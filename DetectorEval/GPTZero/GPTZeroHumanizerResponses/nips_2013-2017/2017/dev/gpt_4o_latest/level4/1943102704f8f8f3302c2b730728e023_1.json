Let me know if it aligns with your expectations?\nThe feedback, from the authors confirms my evaluation that this paper holds significant value to the research field.I am hopeful that they will take into account not my points of concern but also those highlighted by other reviewers when revisiting their work. \nI'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrase without the original text you want me to work on. Can you please provide the content you'd like me to paraphrase?\nI'm sorry. I can't provide a response, without the original text.\nThis article presents YASS (Yet Another Spike Sorter) a crafted system, for analyzing multi electrode array (MEA) recordings.Its approach is strong as it combines cutting edge methods into a unified process.The paper is well crafted with a structure and presents convincing proof that the suggested methodology enhances the sorting of retinal MEAs. \nThe paper already makes a contribution, in its current state; however I feel it could have an even greater impact if the authors focus their attention to the following areas of concern outlined below; \nthe lack of accessible code \nThe method used for detecting networks lacks adequate details. \nNavigating through the obstacles when implementing the pipeline on information can be quite a task. \nI'm sorry. I cannot generate a response, without the input text you provided. Can you please share the text so I can paraphrase it for you?\nThe manuscript lacks a link to access the code. It seems the code isn't accessible to the public either. Given that spike sorting's mostly an engineering issue (albeit a complicated one) describing the approach alone isn't as beneficial without access, to how its implemented. I highly recommend that the authors make their code publicly available to enhance the usefulness and reproducibility of their research work. \nNeural network spike identification stands out as the unique feature in the process since the other parts have already been discussed or utilized before this stage in the document.However the paper does not provide an explanation on how the authors obtained their training data.Section C. Ì² Outlines approaches, for generating training data but it is not evident which particular method (or mix of methods ) the authors actually applied. \n(a). Existing categories. \nMany laboratories moving towards MEAs face challenges in organizing data due to a lack of efficient data processing systems highlighted by the authors themselves in their study findings. Furthermore the effectiveness of incorporating existing sorts into enhancing neural network training for spike detection remains uncertain. Were the authors involved in reviewing each waveform snippet to classify them as clean or not? If not what specific algorithm was employed to identify snippets? What justified the need for neural network training, over utilization of this algorithm? How did the writers handle discrepancies that might cause errors in labeling? \nIf authors utilized existing categories before hand and explained the methodology and reasoning behind their choice effectively enables others to replicate their work reliably. \n(b) Data that is artificially created for training purposes. \nThe writers discuss creating training data by overlaying waveform templates onto ambient noise in the background noise layer, for augmenting data or presenting it as a potential alternative is not confirmed in the text. What proof validates the effectiveness of this technique? Artificial data might not accurately represent recordings; thus this issue needs to be tackled. \nI believe the system works effectively with data but I have doubts about its suitability, for cortical data usage and suggest addressing this limitation in the abstract introduction and conclusions sections explicitly. \nThe shifting of wave patterns, over time. \nDuring recordings in non permanent settings such as non fixed time frames and research styles that are not continuous over time intervals (recording in short bursts or sessions) dealing with changes in waveforms poses a considerable difficulty compared to stable and consistent methods such as chronic high density MEAs which have not been extensively tested yet for their effectiveness and reliability in practice over time durations longer, than a few minutes. A key concern highlighted is the need to actively manage waveform drift for recording periods beyond short durations as mentioned earlier; however; this specific issue lacks adequate attention or coverage within the written material provided for consideration. \n(b); Data used for training recordings, in the cortex. \nAcquiring top notch training data for the network detection method proves to be quite a task when it comes to cortical recordings.It's not easy to come by ground truth or well vetted data (like whats detailed in Appendix I). Moreover recreating data as outlined in Section C could pose challenges for cortical recordings due, to the presence of background noise containing spikes and neurons exhibiting correlated firing patterns frequently.These factors might compromise the reliability of using data as an approach. \nA few quick notes; \nIn the panel of Figure 3; The labeling along the Y axis is a bit confusing to interpret correctly \"\" does \"10^ x\"?. Also the graph seems to magnify small differences in accuracy, between 0Â·99 and 0Â·999 even though both approaches are essentially flawless. \nThe writers refer to the use of whitened information, in Section 2 however there is no explanation provided in the manuscript or supplement regarding the process of spatial whitening.
