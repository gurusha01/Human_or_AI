            "inputText": "In my opinion this paper is well written and insightful although I want to clarify that I'm not well versed in point processes, which should be taken into account when reading this review. I'd say it falls within the half of NIPS submissions as a conservative estimate given my limited knowledge in thoroughly evaluating its impact. I've asked the committee to assign least one reviewer with expertise in assessing the proofs, for this paper and they have confirmed they will do so. I'm really looking forward to getting this paper accepted because I'm excited to dive into its practical uses.I feel like it would be better if the information is spread out over a piece. Maybe, around 20 pages or so. \nHere are my thorough insights based within my area of knowledge.\nDrawing from my experience in tracking user behavior and examining time based information such as heart rate and motion sensor readings the content of this article differed from what I had anticipated given its title initially suggested otherwise to me. I personally feel that a fitting title for the paper could be \"HYBRID; A Framework for Fair Assessment of the Probability Mass Function of Point Processes \" although I grasp the reasoning, behind the existing title after delving into the papers contents. \nThe article makes additions to the suggested framework by rephrasing the forecasting issue using a conditional expectation that includes past data points and enhancing efficiency by minimizing variance in the updated estimator model while establishing a differential difference equation for determining the conditional estimator value as well as offering theoretical assessments on simulated data and practical validations, on real life datasets.The overall paper is thoroughly. Articulately crafted with a substantial impact. \nBefore we delve into the specifics lets review the existing information.\nOne notable point from research is that a particular group of authors appears frequently in the references (mentioned in citations 5 9 and 11 12). While these citations are essential, for acknowledging the work cited by the authors themselves it might be better to directly acknowledge the creators of the datasets utilized in their research projects instead. \nIn the context of the Twitter dataset mentioned earlier... \n Demetris Antonides and Constantine Dovrolis conducted a study on the evolutionary dynamics within social networks using Twitter as a case example, in their research published in Computational Social Networks in 2015 (Volume 2 Issue 14).\nIn Section 6 of the P eer to P eer Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) dataset used in question 6 .5 Citation would be more appropriate, than this citation; \n The dataset by Yehia Elkhatib with Mu Mu and Nicholas Race focuses on the usage of an VoDs PIPV service, in London in 2014. \nIt seems that constraints in space might have affected the choice to use sources such as [12] and [24] but citing the primary sources would be more suitable instead. Moreover it would be beneficial to specify if this specific research field is predominantly led by this group or if there are other research teams actively involved. This input could be more pertinent, for a journal iteration of the manuscript. \nOverview of the Solution (Section 3);\nWhen it comes to the idea of generalizability mentioned in the discussion could the authors possibly share an instance of a point process that hasn't been addressed before in existing literature? For instance; something beyond what's accounted for by a reinforced Poisson process or a Hawkes process? As someone who isn't deeply versed in point processes myself; having such an example would really help shed light on how significant this work's, in a broader context.These points were effectively highlighted in lines 31 32 to emphasize the importance of expanding the functions generalizability. \nThe paper is nicely laid out in terms with its main focus, on introducing a broader framework that maintains the randomness of the function while using fewer samples compared to Monte Carlo methods. \nUpon investigating the assertion about introducing a fresh random variable \\( g(H_{ t. }) \\) It seems that the notion of an intensity function hinged on the processs history is not groundbreaking as per my initial findings. I believe the innovation possibly lies in its application as a variable, for forecasting purposes; however additional clarification would be beneficial to fully grasp its significance. \nThe relevant work I came across is; \nThe study titled \"Temporal Dynamics Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks\" by Yongqing Wang et al. can be accessed as a preprint, on arxiv.org at the link; https;//arxiv.org/pdf/.1701..03918.pdf \nIf the information is useful, to your work a citation could be beneficial for the authors to acknowledge it. If not relevant it can be overlooked.I don't have knowledge on this topic so I'm just making a suggestion after a brief search. \nAppendix C seems founded to me after examining the idea of calculating the expectation of a conditional random variable and understanding when variance might show as negative in this context (see http;//www.baskent.edu.tr/~mudogan/eem611 /ConditionalExpectation.pdf). The authors appear to have made a case for their argument based on this analysis. It's worth noting that variance cannot be zero or negative in this scenario because of the nonconstant nature of the process due to the impact, at \\( t ( 0 ) \\). I look forward to seeing this material included in the final documentation. \nThe transport equation formulation seems innovative and practical standing out as unique in my search for approaches, in related works. \n \"Giovanni Luca Torris discusses the estimation of probabilities, in point processes using Papangelou intensity in an upcoming issue of the Bernoulli Journal.\" \n This information comes from a search and not my personal knowledge; I'm sharing it as a possible point of reference rather, than questioning the originality of the input. \nThe concept behind the Mass Transport Equation is quite intriguing to me! From what I gather far is that as the intensity process triggers events over time and contributes to mass accumulation that gradually decreases in the absence of new events occurring. The authors applied techniques to estimate the integration of the probability mass function and tackled their equation through MATLABs `ode45`. This explanation seems consistent with MATLABs guidance on `ode45` which utilizes a 4th and 5th order Runge Kutta method, for precision. \nAppendix A notes that although I have an understanding of the proof provided and its overall concept was clear to me; however I am not well versed in numerical methods enough to ensure that I have comprehended every intricate detail of it entirely. The application of the lemma of the calculus of variations appears fitting in this context and the proof seems convincing to me, at a first glance. \nTrials; \nFigure 2 was really useful, in helping me grasp the concepts explained by the equations. \nThe details provided about the event were quite engaging, in describing how the framework improved sample efficiency. \nCould the authors provide clarity on whether they employed a split of 70% for training and 30% for testing or if they utilized a split of 70% for training 15% for testing and 15%, for holdout validation? \nI'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrased text without seeing the original content. Please provide the text you'd like me to rewrite in a human like manner.\nThe paper is well crafted overall; however I did spot a typos. \n\"The state of the art technology is constantly evolving.\" \n \nThe phenomenon of interest is being analyzed. \nSuggestion; \nIn my opinion this paper introduces an hopeful framework that I believe should be considered for inclusion, at NIPS based on my comprehension of its content.
