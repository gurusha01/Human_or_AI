The innovative strategy of \"prioritizing sort group follow up \" incorporates advancements such, as a detection technique based on neural networks and streamlined Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP GMM) clustering with coreset based reduction of information. The system is crafted to be durable and flexible while allowing for handling of extensive datasets with limited manual input required.Achieving cutting edge results in precision,reliability and computational effectiveness on both genuine MEA datasets,presented by the authors.The pipeline even manages to process data than real time on just one CPU core surpassing established techniques such, as KiloSort Spyking Circus and MountainSort. \nAdvantages\nThe paper is solid, from a standpoint. It comes with strong arguments backed by theory and real world testing to back them up effectively using biophysically accurate simulations and genuine data sets that enhance the credibility of the findings. \nScalability is a factor in the pipelines performance when it comes to handling large datasets effectively by utilizing methods such, as coreset creation and divide and conquer clustering\"\"this greatly impacts the field of study. \nThe unique approach to sorting incorporates neural network based detection and coreset based clustering in conjunction with a modular design which presents a fresh perspective, in the field of research. \nThe project tackles an issue in neuroscience and could be useful for extensive neural recording projects with the added benefit of making the YASS pipeline openly accessible, to all users. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe paper is well written overall; however some parts that explain clustering and coreset construction methods are a bit dense. Could use more clarity or examples to better understand them. \nThe use of training data for neural network based detection might restrict the pipelines usefulness in laboratories that do not have access, to extensive MEAs training data, which is a recognized limitation but could be investigated more deeply. \nWhen testing the pipeline against methods for comparison purposes it would be beneficial to broaden the evaluation by incorporating various datasets that exhibit template drift or nonstationarity.This approach will lead to a thorough assessment of its reliability, in practical scenarios. \nReasons, in favor of approval.\nThe research paper greatly enhances the area of spike sorting by pushing the boundaries of accuracy and computational efficiency to heights. \nThe flexible structure and use of open source technology greatly benefit the neuroscience field making it easier for researchers to collaborate and achieve results. \nThe methods reliability is guaranteed by the technical approach and extensive experimental testing conducted. \nReasons to Not Agree\nThe document could be clearer in some parts to help readers who're not as familiar, with the technical aspects of clustering and data reduction. \nRelying much on past training data, for neural network based detection could restrict the overall applicability of the method. \nMy suggestion\nThis paper should definitely be accepted as it makes contributions to the scalability, robustness and modularity of spike sorting algorithms. The release of YASS as an open source tool is expected to have an impact in this field. Improving clarity and addressing any concerns regarding generality, in a revised version would enhance the quality of the paper further. "
