            "inputText": "This study introduces an approach known as Deep Hyperalignment (DHA) to align functions in multi subject analysis of functional MRI (fMRI). The core concept of DHA involves utilizing a neural network as a kernel function to align the individuals brain activity patterns to a common space that accommodates non linear and high dimensional information present in the dataset.The researchers argue that DHA demonstrates performance compared to other cutting edge hyperalignment techniques, like Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA) Shared Response Model (SRM) and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE).\nThe paper is nicely. Easy to follow with an informative introduction that explains the background and purpose of the study well.The authors thoroughly explain the DHA approach including the optimization technique and experimental setup.The findings indicate that DHA outperforms methods in terms of accuracy in classification and area, under the ROC curve. \nThe papers notable aspects are; \nPresenting an approach that merges deep learning with hyperalignment methods, in the proposal.\nUsing a network as a kernel function enables the processing of non linear and high dimensional data.\nThe results of the experiment demonstrate that DHA performs better, than cutting edge methods.\nThe paper has some areas that could be improved such, as... \nThe absence of a contrast with other deep learning approaches, for analyzing fMRI data.\nThe small amount of data sets utilized for assessment may not accurately reflect all fMRI analysis tasks. \nFurther validation of the findings is essential. This involves testing with datasets and assessing how well the method performs under various experimental conditions.\nThe paper is nicely written and offers an explanation of the method put forward and its assessment; yet more research is required to validate the outcomes thoroughly and to contrast the method with other deep learning approaches, for fMRI analysis. \nHere are some reasons to consider accepting it; \nThe research paper introduces an approach that merges deep learning with hyperalignment methods.\nThe results of the experiment indicate that DHA performs better, than cutting edge approaches.\nThe technique could enhance the precision of fMRI examination. Offer fresh perspectives, on brain operations.\nPoints, in favor of acceptance; \nThere is an absence of a detailed comparison with other deep learning approaches, in the analysis of fMRI data.\nThere is an amount of data sets utilized for assessment.\nIt is important to validate the findings by using datasets and testing the methods reliability under various experimental conditions.\nRating given by user is 8, out of 10. \nSuggestion for approval with modifications is provided by the reviewers to the authors to improve the paper by addressing its shortcomings such as not comparing it with other deep learning approaches and using a limited number of datasets for assessment purposes It is also recommended that more validation of the findings be conducted by utilizing additional datasets and testing the methods adaptability, under varied experimental circumstances.
