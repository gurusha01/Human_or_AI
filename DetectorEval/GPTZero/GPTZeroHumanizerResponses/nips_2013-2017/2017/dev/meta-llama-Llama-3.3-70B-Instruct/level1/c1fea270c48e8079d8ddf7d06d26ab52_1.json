The researchers enhance running time predictions, for cutting edge algorithms through combinatorial reasoning and carry out a thorough comparative analysis of discrete and continuous techniques. \nThe article is nicely organized with an explanation of the issue at hand and a review of prior research along with their own contributions to the field showcased by the authors themselves. The theoretical examination is solid while the experimental findings are comprehensive and effectively displayed. The authors exhibit a grasp of both the advantages and drawbacks of various methodologies as they present a lucid assessment of the pros and cons between discrete, versus continuous techniques. \nThe primary advantages of the document are; \nThe authors have enhanced their estimates of running times by providing better worst case complexity bounds for optimization methods. A valuable addition, to the field. \nThe authors thoroughly compare continuous methods in their experiments to gain valuable insights into the trade offs, between these approaches. \nThe paper is nicely. The authors have done a good job of explaining the technical aspects in a way that is easy to understand for readers who are knowledgeable, about the subject matter. \nThere are certain areas that could be enhanced.\nThe papers focus on DSFM could make it less appealing to an audience as it delves into specific areas of submodular functions that may be difficult for readers unfamiliar, with the topic to grasp without prior knowledge context provided by the authors. \nThe authors could enhance the evaluation by offering additional specifics about the experimental setup including details, about the hardware and software used to increase the reproducibility of the results. \nFuture directions can be further expanded upon by the authors in terms of applying their methods to optimization issues or delving into the utilization of alternative continuous optimization approaches. \nRegarding the evaluation criteria provided to me for this review task...\nThe paper is well done overall with a minor clarity and presentation issues. The quality would be around an 8, out of 10.\nThe paper is well written overall; however some readers may struggle with the details.\nThe paper offers perspectives and enhancements while also drawing from prior research.\nThe papers contribution to the field is notable with a score of 8, out of 10. However it may have an impact confined to certain areas.\nIn my opinion and, after reviewing it is that this paper should be approved since it adds significant value to the DSFM field and shows a clear grasp of the pros and cons of various methods available. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe research paper offers enhanced predictions, on the time taken for continuous algorithms to run effectively. \nThe researchers carried out an experimental comparison, between discrete and continuous approaches. \nThe paper is nicely. Easy to understand. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe paper may focus on a particular aspect of optimization within a defined area. \nThe assessment of the experiment could provide specifics and be replicable, to a greater extent. \nThe writers could delve deeper into exploring paths, for future research endeavors.
