Has shown success, in a practical experiment using real data. \nThe article is nicely written with an concise introduction, by the authors discussing the issue and their method of approach. \nPoints supporting acceptance; \nThe idea that the target function can be represented by a potential function g may not hold true in all cases. \nBuilding G_x using an approach may not be the most effective or reliable method available. \nInsufficiently examining the demands on G(x) could potentially restrict the effectiveness of the approach. \nIn my opinion the paper adds insights to the Gaussian processes and multivariate regression field and I support its acceptance.. I recommend that the authors work on the weaknesses highlighted earlier especially regarding their assumptions about the target function and their dependence, on a specific approach in order to enhance the paper further."
