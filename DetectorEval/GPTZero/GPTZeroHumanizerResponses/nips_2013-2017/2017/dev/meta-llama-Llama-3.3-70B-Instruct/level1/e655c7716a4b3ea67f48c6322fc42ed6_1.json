Offers a straightforward introduction to the challenges of multitask learning for WFAs by the authors Their review of existing literature is comprehensive and they give a detailed account of the method they propose The algorithms theoretical analysis is robust and the results from experiments show how well MT SL performs, on both artificial and real world datasets\nThe papers notable qualities are; \nA new model called vector valued WFAs has been introduced to facilitate multitask learning of WFAs in a manner. \nProposing a learning method, for vector valued weighted finite automata that proves to be both efficient and successful. \nThe analysis of the algorithms theory sheds light on the advantages of multitask learning for WFAs. \nThe results of the experiments showcase how well MT SL performs on actual data sets. \nThe paper has some drawbacks, such, as; \nThe idea that the tasks are connected is not always true, in real life situations. \nCreating a set of prefixes and suffixes can be quite costly, in terms of computational resources. \nThe absence of any comparison to multitask learning techniques, like those based on deep learning methods is notable. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article introduces an compelling method, for multitask learning with WFAs. \nThe theory behind the analysis is solid. The results, from the experiments show that the algorithm works well in practice. \nThe article is nicely crafted with an succinct introduction by the authors regarding the issue, at hand and their suggested method of tackling it. \nReasons to not agree to it; \nSometimes it may not be accurate to assume that the tasks are always connected in real life situations. \nObtaining a set of prefixes and suffixes can be quite costly, in terms of computational resources. \nThe papers impact might be constrained due to the absence of comparison, with multitask learning methods. \nI suggest approving this paper since it introduces an well founded method for multitask learning in WFAs; the theoretical examination and practical outcomes show that the suggested algorithm works effectively. Nevertheless the authors should be prompted to tackle the papers shortcomings in research efforts; specifically related to task assumptions and the necessity, for a comprehensive foundation of prefixes and suffixes.
