The suggested attention component serves as a straightforward yet impactful addition to cutting edge foundational structures, by enhancing accuracy considerably without significantly increasing network size or computational expenses. The authors show how well their method works on three action recognition tests by outperforming previous results on the MPII dataset, with a 12.% relative enhancement. \nThe paper is nicely. The authors explain their approach clearly and concisely while introducing a unique interpretation of bottom up and top down attention as simplified versions of bilinear pooling techniques.The experiments are comprehensive. The outcomes are remarkable; the suggested attention module surpasses prior cutting edge methods, across various benchmarks. \nThe paper shines in its approach to defining action recognition as a detailed recognition challenge and offers a thorough examination of their attention module when compared to other attention driven techniques and investigating the impact of utilizing human pose keypoints, for intermediate supervision. \nThe document showcases strong points that deserve recognition.\nThe suggested attention module is easy to set up and involves a few extra parameters which makes it a compelling option compared to regular pooling techniques. \nThe writers offer an succinct description of their methodological approach which features an innovative interpretation of both bottom up and top down attention mechanisms. \nThe research conducted was extensive. The outcomes were remarkable; the suggested attention module surpassed existing cutting edge techniques in various benchmarks. \nNonetheless there are a drawbacks to consider ; \nThe article presumes that the reader has knowledge of attention and its use in computer vision applications which might not be universal, among all readers. \nThe writers should include a comparison, with other attention based techniques to help readers grasp the merits and drawbacks of their approach better. \nThe article would be improved by delving into how utilizing human pose keypoints as an interim guide influences performance and exploring the possible constraints of this method. \nThe paper is nicely written with an succinct explanation of their method provided by the authors overall.The experiments conducted were extensive. Yielded impressive results which contribute to the strength of this paper. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article presents an attention component that greatly enhances accuracy without significantly increasing the network size or computational expenses. \nThe writers offer an succinct description of their methodological approach which includes an innovative interpretation of bottom up and top down attention mechanisms. \nThe experiments were conducted meticulously. The outcomes were remarkable as the suggested attention module surpassed the performance of earlier cutting edge techniques across various benchmarks. \nReasons not to agree with it; \nThe paper presumes that the reader has a grasp of the idea of attention and how it is used in computer vision\"\"an assumption that might not hold true for all readers. \nThe writers haven't thoroughly compared their approach, with attention based methods to help grasp the strengths and weaknesses better. \nThe article would be improved by delving into how utilizing human pose keypoints as an intermediate checkpoint affects performance and examining the possible constraints of this method thoroughly. \nThe quality is rated at 8 out of 10.\nSure thing! Here is the revised text; \"Great clarity, rating 9 out of 10.\"\nThe level of uniqueness is rated at 8 out of 10.\nImportance Level Rating ; 9, out of 10 \nI suggest accepting this paper since it presents an attention module that greatly improves accuracy without increasing the network size and computational cost significantly. The authors explain their approach clearly and concisely while conducting experiments that yield impressive results. However it would be beneficial to delve into the impact of utilizing human pose keypoints, for intermediate supervision and compare it with other attention based methods. "
