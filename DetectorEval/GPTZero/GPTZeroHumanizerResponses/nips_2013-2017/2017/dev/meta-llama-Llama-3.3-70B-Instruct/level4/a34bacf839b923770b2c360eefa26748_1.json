            "inputText": "Based on my evaluation of the papers quality level is quite high; however I have to admit that my understanding of point processes is somewhat limited and this should be taken into account when assessing my review of it.I would place this paper in the 50 percent of submissions to NIPS with the caveat that my lack of extensive knowledge, in this field might limit my full appreciation of its subtleties. To ensure a review process for the papers technical aspects I have asked the committee to assign a reviewer, with expertise in point processes.They have agreed to my request.I am eager for this paper to be accepted so that I can delve into its applications. \nIn my field of knowledge and experience I have pinpointed a few elements that make up the suggested framework; 1) Changing how we approach the prediction issue by using conditional expectation with historical data to lower variability, in the new estimator.  2) Using a differential difference equation to calculate the conditional estimator. 3) Evaluating the framework theoretically and empirically using both real world data. In general the paper seems to be well organized well backed up and easy to understand. \nWhen looking at existing research sources for inspiration in my studies far. I've noticed that most of the citations come from a group of writers. Even though these references are important to include for credibilitys sake. I recommend that the authors also acknowledge the pioneers who provided the datasets utilized in the study. For instance like giving credit to Demetris Antoniades and Constantine Dovrolis (2015). Yehia Elkhatib along, with Mu Mu and Nicholas Race (2014).This could lead to a grasp of the overall research environment. \nIn Section 3 of the Solution Overview it would be helpful to see an example of a point process that hasn't been discussed before in existing literature. Something beyond a reinforced Poisson process or a Hawkes process could provide insight into the significance of this research effort. The authors present a framework that maintains stochasticity and reduces the need for extensive sampling compared to Monte Carlo methods, in a clear and effective manner. \nThe idea of a conditional intensity function linked to the history of intensity function intrigued me. Though its not entirely groundbreaking in my eyes. The idea of utilizing this concept as a variable for prediction seems fresh to me; however I lack sufficient familiarity with the subject to verify its originality. In my search for materials, on the topic I came across a paper titled \"Marked Temporal Dynamics Modeling based on Recurrent Neural Network \" authored by Yongqing Wang et al., published in 2017 which could potentially shed light on the authors’ research. \nThe evidence presented in Appendix C seems solid, to me and I really like how the authors used clear language to explain their points.I did need to search up a terms like calculating the expectation of a conditional random variable but the explanation provided was quite beneficial.I am looking forward to seeing any materials that will be added in the upcoming proceedings. \nThe development of the transport equation appears innovative and practical as I couldn't come across any comparable study on it yet. The similar publication I stumbled upon was \"Probability estimation of point processes with Papangelou conditional intensity'', by Giovanni Luca Torrisithat is expected to be released ; this might intrigue the authors. \nThe concept of the mass transport equation is quite fascinating, to me! I grasp that the intensity process leads to events that add to the mass but decreases gradually without events happening over time. It seems fitting that the authors applied methods to estimate the integration of the probability mass function and tackled the equation using ode45 in Matlab. \nFigure 2 was really useful for grasping the equations. I especially liked the part about event information that clarifies why the authors could lower the number of samples for estimation purposes.It would be interesting to learn more, about the setup they applied. Like whether they used a train test holdout set or just a simple train test split. \nIn my opinion and based on the content I've read far in this paper I find the idea presented to be quite promising and well founded. Given this assessment I believe it would be a fit for inclusion, in NIPS. \nI found some spelling mistakes while writing.\n\"The state of the art \" not \"state of the art.\"\nThe phrase \" influences,\" not \"adversely influence \" is the correct form to use in this context.\n\"The phenomenon of interest should be 'the phenomena of interest.'\"\n\"The root mean square error (RMSE)\" should be described as \"The root mean square error (RMSE)\""
