If you'd like I can paraphrase your text by following those steps to make it sound human like. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with that.\nThe authors’ reply has confirmed my evaluation and I still believe this is a significant addition, to the field of study.I am optimistic that the authors will effectively tackle the issues brought up by me and other reviewers in their updated document. \nI'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrased version without the original text. Can you please provide me with the input, from the user so that I can generate a like rewrite?\nThis study introduces YASS (Yet Another Spike Sorter) a crafted system for organizing multi electrode array (MEA) recordings.The authors combined cutting edge techniques in their pipeline that is well detailed and easy to understand.This research paper offers evidence supporting the idea that their work marks a notable progression, in sorting retinal MEAs data processing. \nWhile the paper is already quite significant, in its state; I think it could have an even greater impact if the authors focus on addressing a few key issues that I'll outline below in more detail. \nthe lack of code, for public use \nInsufficiently explaining the method, for detecting networks.\nthe challenges of implementing the process on information. \nLets delve into the specifics; \nThe manuscript lacks code access which's a major drawback since spike sorting is now primarily an engineering hurdle; a thorough explanation of the methodology is only half as helpful, without the real world implementation included in it.I therefore urge the writers to share the code to elevate the papers significance. \nThe spike detection method based on networks stands out as the most groundbreaking feature of the system; however its explanation is not very clear in the text provided by the authors as they fail to give enough details on how exactly they created the training data used in their research work.Section C Part 1 mentions techniques, for producing training data but it remains ambiguous which method (or mix of methods ) was actually implemented in this case. \n(a) Using organized data poses a number of issues to consider; Firstly many labs do not have well sorted data ready when moving to dense MEAs as they usually lack a proper system for organizing such data. Secondly it is not clear how the current sorting can assist in enhancing the training of a neural network, for detection purposes. More details are needed from the authors regarding their approach including how they identified waveform snippets as either clean or not and how they dealt with misalignments and labeling inaccuracies. \nUsing waveform templates overlaid on background noise to create training data presents another option for consideration in the studys methodology section; nonetheless it remains ambiguous whether this technique serves as a means of data augmentation or is merely mentioned as a potential strategy alternative, by the researchers themselves. The authors are encouraged to furnish supporting proof that highlights the efficacy of this method while also acknowledging and resolving any apprehensions surrounding the validity and accuracy of data utilized in their research endeavors. \nThe effectiveness of the pipeline on data is a cause for concern as it might excel with retinal data but could face challenges, with cortical data for several reasons. \nDrifting of waveforms poses a problem in extended non invasive brain recordings and understanding this drift is crucial, for capturing data over longer periods accurately. \nObtaining quality training data, for the network based detection approach poses a greater challenge as creating synthetic data may prove impractical given the intricate background noise and interconnected neural functions. \nI have some feedback, to share.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 3 has a y axis design that might seem unconventional to some viewers due to the notation \"10^ X \" which could be confusing for those unfamiliar with it. Moreover the figure may overemphasize accuracy variations, between 0. 99 And 0. 999 Even though both methods perform exceptionally well and can be considered almost flawless in practical terms. \nThe writers discuss the use of whitened information, in Section 2. 2.. They do not offer a comprehensive explanation of the spatial whitening process in either the paper or its supplement. "
