            "inputText": "The study delves into kernel regression in a dimensional context focusing on the \"additive model\" that presumes regressors with a specific form. \nThe sum of f equals the sum of fp(X_p). \nWhere connections between aspects are not taken into account is neglected in the analysis. Understanding the drawbacks of overlooking these connections leads to the expansion of this idea into a \"group model,\" which organizes dimensions into groups to address correlations within those groups. The study includes an examination of this approach and suggests a series of somewhat improvised methods, for determining the best groupings. The effectiveness of these methods is illustrated using artificial datasets and practical scenarios. \nI believe the main problem with the paper is that it doesn't delve enough into research topics which makes it hard for me (not being an expert in the field) to determine how original the findings really are. For finding optimal groups within data has been examined in other fields such as \"structured sparsity,\" as well as in relation, to learning graphical models or Bayesian networks; however these areas are not mentioned by the authors. The issue could also be viewed as a type of \"feature selection \". This aspect has not been explored either in detail in the analysis of past research literature is primarily based on just one KDD paper from 2015 [reference 9]. This limited reference makes it challenging for me to gauge the novelty and depth of the research work presented. \nThe theoretical ideas presented seem innovative in nature with the introduction of a complexity metric for groupings that prioritize numerous smaller groups based on the covering numbers upper limit derivation. A method that appears logical at first glance. Nonetheless a drawback lies in the measures optimization process as suggested by the authors either through an exhaustive and computationally expensive search or a more efficient greedy strategy akin, to forward feature selection. Although I grasp the complexity of optimizing functions related to ideal groupings descriptions can pose a challenge in itself; I felt a bit let down that the writers did not explore a more streamlined approach to optimization beyond using cross validation alone. Even though they touch upon the idea of \"exploring and contrasting metrics\" (mentioned in line 174) they fail to delve into any further specifics, on this matter which makes it quite hard to judge whether the chosen metric was indeed suitable or not. \nIn their experiments section the writers test their model with made up scenarios and test it on the Boston Housing dataset. Yet they don't include any values or compare it to other approaches. This makes it challenging to assess the accuracy of the findings without a benchmark, for comparison. \n== Rebuttal response == \nThe writers responded to a few of my worries in their counterargument; however I am still not fully satisfied with the assessment and feel that the examination of relevant studies is inadequately thorough. Especially, in linking their concepts to the wider scope of machine learning literature. With these drawbacks acknowledged I admit that the article provides valuable insights and I've increased my rating as a result. I urge the authors to improve their discussion of related work before it is published. "
