Doesn't offer any groundbreaking technical advancements or fresh ideas. Moreover it doesn't delve into the aspects of how effective BN or ReLUs are. Apart from the lack of originality and technical value the manuscript is filled with spelling mistakes, grammar errors and problems, with sentence structure (you can find a detailed list in the abstract and introduction).\nThis document unequivocally denies the proposal. \nI've noticed some typos and grammar syntax errors.\nAbstract; \n\"network that uses a Hamming approach (GH network)\" \n \"The network known as the Hamming network often abbreviated as GHN.\" \n\"GHN not lends itself to rigorous analysis.\" \n \"GHN is suitable for, in depth examination, not analysis.\" \n....
