            "inputText": "I'm sorry. I can't provide a paraphrased response, without the actual input that needs to be rewritten. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to paraphrase? \nThe writers discuss convex optimization challenges identified by conic constraints established by a finite group of elements.They present an oracle centered method influenced by the Frank Wolfe algorithm and Matching Pursuit strategies.The primary technique called Non Negative Matching Pursuit is enhanced with active set adaptations.The study includes the analysis of convergence of all suggested techniques in scenarios presenting sublinear convergence rates for overall goals and linear rates, for highly convex goals.These linear rates rely on a geometric idea known as cone width. The authors confirm the usefulness of their algorithm by conducting experiments, on machine learning assignments and datasets. \nI'm sorry. Without the specific input text to paraphrase I cannot provide a rewritten version. If you could provide the text you would like me to paraphrase I'd be more, than happy to assist! \nThe analysis of the affine algorithms and their assessments in the appendix was, beyond my capability. \nThe paper introduces innovative ideas to linear oracle based optimization techniques but lacks clarity in its technical explanation. \nThe presentation of Theorem 2 is. Does not provide a strong assurance of convergence. \nThe rate at which convergence occurs in a fashion is influenced by The eighth theorem found in the appendix; however the proof lacks clarity and comprehensive explanation. \nThe minimum number of steps, for each algorithm is not firmly established as it is based more so upon the idea that it performs comparably in a similar context. \nThe authors have conducted thorough and convincing experiments; however it would be beneficial for them to offer empirical proof showcasing that the computational expenses are similar, to those of other methods used in the conducted experiments. \n \n\"The second theorem\" \nThe way Theorem 2 is presented and structured including the sublinear rates discussed in the paper follows a format. \nA set time limit, denoted as \\( T \\) has been established. \nAssuming there is a limit \\( \\rho \\) we consider the iterations, from \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_T\\). \nFor every value of \\( t \\) greater than zero it is asserted that the lack of optimality is said to be, around \\( c / t \\) with \\( c \\) value varying based on \\( \\rho \\). \nThe proof is valid for values of \\( t \\le T \\) not all \\( t > 0 \\) since Equation (16)s dependence, on the \\( \\rho \\) bound for \\( x_t \\ ) can be assured only up to time \\( T \\). \nSecondly the top number involves \\( \\rho^{ } \\). If \\( T \\) the denominator increases, \\( \\rho \\) the fraction could also rise too. This indicates that the limit may not always get closer, to zero. \nThe way this is set up poses an issue.The suggestion could be to establish conditions beforehand (such, as coercivity) which would keep the series of progressions limited to a specific range and thus establish a maximum limit regardless of the horizon \\( T \\). \nI find the proof confusing when it says \"Since \\( f \\) is convex and, for \\( t > 1 \\) we get \\( f(x_t)\\le f ( 1 ) \\).\" \nLemma number seven.. Theorem 8 \nLemma 7 \nLemma 7 was quite challenging for me to understand fully as the equation was provided without any context or explanation to clarify its intended meaning clearly. Does the equation define \\( K'\\ ). Is \\( K'\\ ) specifically selected to meet the requirements of this particular equation? Is there another function or purpose that \\( K'\\ ) serves in this context apart, from being defined by the equation itself? \nLemma 7 only pertains to \\( g \\) faces that are polytopes exclusively. Does this hold true in all instances though if \\( K \\)s not a polytope then how does that impact matters here is it fine to assume this across the board. Could it possibly be a typing mistake?. \nTheorem 8 \nThe way Theorem 8 has been presented poses an issue involving the handling of \\( r \\). In Lemma 7s context \\( r \\) its not considered a direction; however in Theorem 8s scenario \\( r \\) it represents the gradient of \\( f \\). Despite Theorem 8 referring to \"using the notation from Lemma 7 \" the proof commences with \"if \\( r \\)\" being a direction instead of discussing unfeasibility as, per Lemma 7s context This inconsistency complicates following the argument put forth in the presentation. \nThe annotations, in Lemma 7 are not consistently used. \nIn Lemma 7 of the proof is a variable denoted as \\( e \\) which represents a value rather, than a constant quantity. \n\"What does \\( K \\)? Its mentioned in Lemma 7 but not, in Theorem 8.\" \n\"Should we clarify if \\( K \\ is considered a polytope?\" \nThe assertion that \"When \\( x \\neq \\text{optimal} \\) based on convexity we can deduce that \\( \\langle r,e \\rangle > 0 \\)\" lacks clarity and leaves questions regarding the assumption of \\( x \\)s non optimality and its connection, to the inequality. \nThe sentence \"After that we project \\( r \\), along the surfaces of cone(\\( A \\)) that includes \\( x \\) until it becomes a direction \" can be confusing. Does this imply projecting onto a crossroads of surfaces or projecting onto each surface repeatedly or some other action altogether? It would be more precise to say \"the projection becomes a direction \" since \\( r \\\\) remains fixed as the gradient of \\( f \\). When \\( r \\) the variable can be altered in the process during the proof it becomes challenging to validate the accuracy of the argument. \nMoreover what stops the value of \\( r \\; \\text{from becoming zero}? If \\( r \\; \\text{turns, into} null the following equation would be deemed invalid. \nThe evidence presented in the proof relies on Lemma 7 to show that if \\( r \\) as a direction to move in the space of solutions for a problem instance under consideration from a given point of the problem instance (the starting point) does not satisfy certain conditions or constraints required for feasibility or optimality of a solution path based on previous assertions made within the text but this seems confusing and contradictory since it conflicts with what was stated earlier in the paragraph leading me to a state of confusion and inability to continue comprehending the subsequent steps, in the proof. \nWhat does the symbol \\( r'\\ represent in line 723 and the equation, before it? \nThe evidence appears to revolve around a repeating procedure; however the ultimate conclusion lacks justification. \nI have thoughts to share. \nIn line 220 it is recommended to replace \"max'', with \"argmax.\" \nI couldn't grasp the negative matrix factorization experiment completely Did the authors only run their algorithm for 10 steps since the resulting approximation is of rank 10?
