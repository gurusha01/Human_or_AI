The experiments effectively showcase the practicality of the approach in tasks; however their range is somewhat restricted which hinders the methods generalizability, beyond the realm of vision + language. Improving the text clarity and broadening the experiments to incorporate model structures or diverse forms of multi modal data would strengthen the submission. \nI'm ready to provide the finished rewrite once you share the input text. Just paste it here. I'll paraphrase it for you right away!\nAdvantages; \nThe reasons driving the CBN approach, from a perspective are fascinating and the technique itself is pleasantly straightforward. \nThe research analyzing the impact of adjusting batch norm parameters through tuning (referred to as Ft BN) compared with utilizing question conditioned batch norm predictions is quite informative. It demonstrates that adapting to image statistics using Ft BN leads to significant enhancements (around 1\\percent in VQA and 2\\percent in Crop GuessWhich) which are further boosted (approximately 2\\percent in VQA and 4\\percent, in Crop GuessWhich ) when taking into account the question context. \nReleasing code, for reproducibility is a praiseworthy commitment. \nThe visualizations using t SNE are quite captivating as they show how language driven adjustments have an effect , on the visual characteristics. \nI'm sorry. I cannot proceed with the paraphrased text without seeing the original input, from you. Could you please provide me with the text that needs to be paraphrased?\nAreas that could use improvement; \nThe explanation regarding Section 2 is not very clear to me at this moment as Batch Normalization and Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN) which are methods mentioned in the text are seen as general practices regardless of the model choice involved in the process. Of focusing extensively on explaining the ResNet design pattern it would be more beneficial to delve into the true reasons and understanding, behind employing the CBN technique. \nI understand the significance of using language modulation to impact vision on a neurological level; however the justification for using normalization parameters for this purpose, in Section 3 seems less compelling. The introduction highlights that the suggested method helps prevent overfitting when compared to tuning yet it fails to properly place CBN in the wider spectrum of alternative early fusion strategies. \nCBNs are techniques that can be beneficial across various model designs in tasks involving vision and language integration; this could support the argument further by exploring its effectiveness in architectures like MCB as an illustration point to consider memory limitations during backpropagation, with CNNs. \nIt's interesting that most improvements in VQA and GuessWhat tasks actually stem from using CBN at Stage 4 despite the focus, on early vision adjustment. It would be beneficial to delve into this finding and explore the implications. The supplementary figures are quite fascinating as they indicate that distinctions based on questions only appear in image space at stages. \nFigures 2 and 3 seem similar, to each other don't you think?\nI'm ready to help you with the paraphrasing! Just provide me with the text you'd like me to rewrite.\nA few quick points; \nIt would be quite intriguing to observe how various questions can change the way a single image is represented in terms of features.\" For instance \" using a visualization technique, on the visual characteristics but changing up the question could offer us some extra perspectives and understanding.\"\nRemember to include a space before the citation brackets when adding references, in your text. \nThe highlighting of models lacks uniformity. \nThere seems to be a mistake, in Equation 2; it should read as \"gamma c\" of \"gamma j.â\n\"To allow the question to be attended to.\"\nI couldn't find the reference for Line 42, in your work; could you please provide it?\nLine 53 is missing a reference, for the batch normalization discussion. \n"
