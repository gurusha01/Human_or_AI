Than relying solely on a traditional LSTM approach, like other methods do the new technique improves the model by adding a data specific hidden variable. The authors place this challenge into the context of autoencoders (VAEs) optimizing the training goal by maximizing the lower bound in a variational framework. To overcome VAEs limited ability to represent captions effectively they introduce a Gaussian factor that is tailored to the specific dataset used. According to real world tests the suggested approach produces sentences that're varied and precise in comparison, to the basic LSTM model. \n== Evaluation Based on Quality == \nThe idea of adding a hidden variable to the caption creation process is something I find intriguing and innovative in this framework setup you've presented here. Although using this approach in a VAE model isn't groundbreaking per se its application in generating captions certainly stands out as a contribution worth noting. When it comes to performance the proposed AG CVAEin method delivers precise outcomes when compared to both the basic LSTM model and other CVAEin methods (see details in Table 2). Furthermore the study delves into analyzing how varied the generated captions are when compared to relying on an LSTM based approach (for more details take a look, at Figure 5). The paper, as a whole is nicely. Includes an adequate amount of experimental information. \nUpon reviewing the paper with the Gaussian prior as the main point of focus in mind; I must admit that I remain somewhat unconvinced, by the current iteration of the paper provided to me for evaluation purposes. I am willing to reconsider my evaluation and potentially increase my score if the authors take into account and adequately respond to the concerns that I have outlined in my assessment during the rebuttal phase. \nThe advantages of AG CVAEs, over CVAEs and GMM CVAEs are backed by evidence. \nThe enhancements in performance shown in Table 2 do not seem substantial in nature.They also did not provide comparisons between AG CVA and CVA/GMM CVA in terms of quality (for example Figure 5 and supplementary materials). It is still uncertain whether AG CVA indeed provides representation capabilities compared to these standard methods.I suggest that the authors address this concern, in their response and incorporate comparisons into the final draft of the paper or supplementary materials. \nAssessing the level of diversity; \nIts puzzling why AG CVAEs don't perform well in diversity compared to CVAEs; moreover the reasons behind the performance differences among various forms of AG CVAEs remain unclear to me.I wonder if assessing the top 10 sentences is enough for analyzing diversity when CVAEs are stochastic generative models.It would be better if the authors present a graph showing diversity measure on the y axis and number of sentences, on the x axis for a view of results. \nSure thing! Just give me the input text you'd like me to paraphrase. \nIn line 183 of the code there are established groups, for GMM CVA and AG CVA. \nIt's not surprising that the authors didn't get outcomes when they considered the cluster means \\( uk \\) as free variables without any constraints like sparsity or orthogonality, on \\( uk \\) or \\( ck \\). This could lead to redundant representations being learned so I suggest that the authors delve deeper into this area in their research endeavors. "
