The article presents algorithms that are able to operate efficiently without the need for information about the quantity of clusters or the patterns of similarity values beforehand. Additionally the authors link their work to the block model (SBM) which is a commonly examined model used in community detection. They also put forth a framework, for demonstrating minimum limits in an interactive environment. \nThe study expands on research in grouping data points together efficiently using additional information to aid decision making processes like learning and identifying communities within datasets effectively using established methods that optimize the accuracy of results by providing solid mathematical foundations for the algorithms used and ensuring their effectiveness through proven guarantees of performance accuracy and efficiency gains over previous approaches without such assurances.The innovative choice of Hellinger divergence to assess the dissimilarities between data sets is a perspective supported by sound reasoning while the iterative process for creating algorithms that do not require manual adjustments represents a notable advancement, in the field. \nAreas of expertise; \nThe paper offers theoretical boundaries based on information theory and closely aligned upper limits to enhance the comprehension of query complexity, in interactive clustering. \nThe suggested techniques are practical. Can be easily applied in real life situations without the need for specific parameters due, to their computational efficiency. \nThe extension of SBM, for distributions and the exploration of how query complexity varies with additional information are significant contributions that enhance our understanding of SBM. \nExperimental Validation Results; The tests conducted on the Coran dataset showcase the real world effectiveness of the suggested algorithms by illustrating their ability to achieve accuracy and recall rates, with minimal query inputs. \nThe paper effectively explains how the level of difficulty in queries changes when side information is present or absent, in tasks. \nAreas of improvement; \nThe authors mention a gap, between the upper bounds that is still unresolved but acknowledged in their work; bridging this gap would enhance the theoretical impact. \nThe paper assumes that the oracle is flawless; in real world crowdsourcing scenarios this may not always be the case as mentioned by the authors without delving deep into addressing noisy responses, from the oracle. \nThe proofs are thorough and detailed. Might be hard to understand for those not well versed in information theory or large deviation principles; simplifying or summarizing important steps could make them easier to grasp. \nThe research findings rely upon one dataset (known as Cora) and conducting further experiments using a variety of datasets would enhance the credibility of the results. \nReasons, in favor of approval; \nThe study offers a theoretical advancement by presenting lower limits and effective methods, for interactive clustering with additional information. \nThe new algorithms suggested are innovative and do not require parameters or consume a lot of computational power; they tackle real world hurdles, in clustering assignments effectively. \nThe link between SBM and the application of Hellinger divergence is groundbreaking. Paves the way, for future research possibilities. \nReasons, to Decline; \nThere is still potential for enhancement in the outcomes due to the significant difference between the lower and upper bounds, on a logarithmic scale. \nThe idea that a flawless oracle exists might restrict how relevant the findings are, in real life situations. \nThe assessment of the experiment could be broader and more thorough. \nSuggestion for approval with adjustments needed.The document offers a theoretical basis and useful algorithms, for interactive clustering which adds significant value to the domain.Tackling the difference and broadening the experimental assessment would increase its effectiveness even more.
