            "inputText": "The research article introduces a method for automatically extracting cells from calcium imaging data sets by utilizing reliable statistical estimation techniques. The writers suggest an optimal M algorithm designed specifically for the distinct noise and background activity patterns present, in calcium imaging information. They incorporate this algorithm into a matrix factorization model that allows for the retrieval of both the spatial and temporal behaviors of neurons. One significant advancement involves creating a fixed point optimization process with proven local linear convergence that is both computationally efficient and suitable for GPU utilization.The suggested technique named EXTRACT has been tested on synthetic as well as real data sets and showcased better outcomes compared to current approaches in preserving signal accuracy and resilience against interference, like overlapping cells and neuropil activity. \nWhat we excel at; \nThe paper is based on statistical principles and uses M estimation to tackle contamination in calcium imaging data sets effectively.The detailed explanation of the one Huber estimator and its optimal minimax performance is thorough and well backed up. \nCalcium imaging plays a role in neuroscience research and the new approach tackles a key obstacle in automating cell extraction efficiently.The algorithm is strong against contamination and adept at managing low SNR data making it highly applicable, to scenarios. \nThe authors conducted experiments using both artificial and actual data sets to compare EXTRACT with leading methods, like CNMF and ICA.. The outcomes clearly show the accuracy and reliability of EXTRACT. \nComputational efficiency is key here. The fixed point solver and GPU setup allow the method to handle large datasets effectively for use, in neuroscience research applications.\r \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe paper contains technical content; however it could use clearer explanations in certain areas like the derivation of the one sided Huber estimator and the fixed point optimization routine for better understanding, by non expert readers who may find the mathematical details challenging to follow. \nThe authors touch upon the performance of the robust estimator in very low SNR situations but do not delve deeply into this issue. More experiments or insights, into instances where it fails would improve the paper. \nCould you also consider comparing EXTRACT with recent methods in the field that involve robustness or deep learning techniques alongside CNMF and ICA? This broader comparison would provide insights and perspectives, for the research paper. \nReasons, in favor of approval; \nThe document provides an addition to the field through the introduction of a strong statistical structure for cell extraction, in calcium imaging\"\"a widely acknowledged hurdle that has been effectively tackled. \nThe results from the experiments are quite impressive. Demonstrate significant benefits compared to current approaches, in terms of precision and reliability. \nThe efficiency of the method suggested makes it very useful, for conducting neuroscience research studies. \nChallenges to consider; \nThe paper could be made clearer by enhancing the readability of the sections, for a wider audience to understand easily. \nThe exploration of restrictions and the contrast, with approaches is quite restricted. \nSuggestion; \nIt would be an idea to accept this paper since it offers a significant and well supported addition to the study of automated cell extraction in calcium imaging field. However it would be beneficial for the authors to enhance the clarity of their presentation and include a comprehensive discussion on limitations and broader comparisons, in the final draft. "
