            "inputText": "This study explores how well Bitcoins peer to peer (P2p ) network protocols protect anonymity by looking at the shift from trickle spreading before 2015 to diffusion spreading after 2015.This paper approaches the issue as a case of figuring out where an epidemic started in graphs using methods from epidemic source detection literature.They evaluate methods of estimating the source including the first timestamp and maximum likelihood (ML ) estimators, for both protocols. The research results indicate that both methods do not provide anonymity assurances since the likelihood of machine learning detection remains significant even in networks with high connectivity levels. The authors confirm their findings by conducting simulations on traditional tree structures and an actual data set from the Bitcoin network. This study introduces frameworks and analytical techniques such as employing generalized PÃ²lya urn models, for analyzing diffusion patterns in investigating the process of deanonymizing cryptocurrency networks. \nAdvantages; \nThe research explores detecting sources of outbreaks using the Bitcoin P2 network. An area that hasn't been thoroughly studied before. The authors present models and estimators designed for Bitcoins protocols; these are unique additions, to the fields of cryptocurrency and epidemic analysis. \nThe analysis is thorough. Supported by solid theoretical findings and in depth explanations provided throughout the process.The utilization of techniques such, as nonlinear differential equations and generalized PÃ²lya urn reveals a high degree of technical expertise. \nThe research focuses on a real life issue. Revealing the identity of users in Bitcoin. And offers valuable perspectives on how changes, to the communitys protocol can make a difference. \nThe credibility of the results is bolstered by conducting analysis and simulations, on real world Bitcoin network data blending both aspects to validate the findings effectively. \nThe paper effectively presents its discoveries by highlighting the limited enhancements in anonymity resulting from the shift, to diffusion spreading. \nAreas, for improvement; \nWhen the authors concentrate on regular tree graphs, for examination in their study scope; this assumption could restrict the applicability of the findings to actual Bitcoin networks that display irregularities in practice. \nPractical Impact Notes; While the document points out flaws, in both procedures; however it doesn't suggest fixes or new approaches to enhance confidentiality. \nThe complexity of the content might make the paper harder for a wider audience to understand. Including those working in cryptocurrency. \nAssessment of Real Life Effects; The study fails to provide figures on the frequency of deanonymization attacks, in real world scenarios or the degree to which the vulnerabilities identified have been utilized. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe study discusses an current issue, in the field of cryptocurrency studies. \nIts impact in identifying the source of epidemics and enhancing anonymity, in Bitcoin is groundbreaking and noteworthy. \nThe theoretical and practical examinations are thorough and expertly carried out. \nReasons not to accept; \nRegular tree graphs might oversimplify the dynamics of networks, in the world. \nThe findings are not as useful as they could be due to the absence of suggestions, for action. \nSuggestion; \nIn terms and from a scientific perspective point of view this research adds value to our knowledge about anonymity within the P2P network of Bitcoin. Although there are restrictions, in terms of scope and real world use cases the originality and thoroughness of the study validate its approval. I suggest accepting it with modifications to tackle the practical aspects and explain better the relevance of the regular tree assumption. "
