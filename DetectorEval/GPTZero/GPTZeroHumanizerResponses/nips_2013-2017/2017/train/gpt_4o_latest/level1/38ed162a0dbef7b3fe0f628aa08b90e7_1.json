            "inputText": "This research paper introduces a theoretical framework for comprehending the stability and unchanging characteristics of deep representations of signals. It focuses on convolutional structures using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). By extending kernel networks (CKNs) to continuous domains and investigating their stability under diffeomorphisms and group transformations. The goal is to connect understanding with practical applications in deep learning like convolutional neural networks (CNN). This study extends work such, as Mallats scattering transform. The technique described in [17] broadens its concepts to encompass structures and provides a unified view based on kernels that merge data depiction and forecast modeling. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper makes a theoretical contribution by establishing a strong foundation, for comprehending the stability of CNN and CKN models\"\"a crucial aspect that previous studies have overlooked so far in the literature review. \nThe kernel based framework is an advancement that links traditional kernel methods with contemporary deep learning architectures in a cohesive manner.It is especially intriguing how it extends to RKHS and establishes a link, to CNNswith smooth homogeneous activations. \nThe thorough mathematical analysis and precise proofs provided in the appendices showcase a grasp of the issue at hand highlighting an insightful application of RKHS norms for managing stability and enhancing generalization, which resonates with contemporary approaches, to comprehending deep learning within functional domains. \nThe practical implications of discussing discretization and kernel approximations connect the findings with real world applications like CKNs. Making the research valuable, for both academics and industry professionals. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe paper is quite detailed in its explanations but might be tough for those not well versed in harmonic analysis or kernel methods to follow easily due to its density level. Certain parts, like the explanation of stability bounds could be made understandable by using simpler language or visual aids to aid comprehension. \nThe paper needs real world data to back up its claims and show how the proposed framework can benefit practical tasks to make a stronger impact. \nThe authors mention that pooling layers can lessen signal energy but don't thoroughly investigate how this affects designs in their work. Moreover they focus smooth activations which might not accommodate common non smooth functions such, as ReLU potentially restricting the relevance of their findings.\nThe paper\" s related work section is thorough; however it could improve by framing its contributions in the larger context of deep learning theory and recent advancements, in comprehending generalization and robustness in CNN models. \nReasons to Consider; \nThe paper offers a theoretical advancement by expanding the scattering transform framework to encompass broad convolutional designs and ensuring stability assurances. \nThe unique viewpoint based on kernels is fresh. Could spark more exploration where kernel methods and deep learning meet. \nThe thoroughness and analytical depth, in the mathematics are impressive. \nReasons to Not Agree; \nThe practical significance of the work is limited by the absence of validation. \nThe complex mathematical explanations might make it hard for a larger group of people to understand easily. \nRemoving activation functions such, as ReLU that're not smooth might limit the generalizability of the findings. \nSuggestion; \nMy suggestion is to accept the paper with some changes needed to be made. Even though the paper is mostly theoretical in nature its contributions are important and valuable for the NIPS community. However I suggest that the authors include results or clearer explanations to make it easier to understand and show how their framework can be useful, in real life situations. "
