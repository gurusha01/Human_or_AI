            "inputText": "The article discusses an issue related to testing for Conditional Independence (CI) without using specific parameters and focusing on continuous random variables. It introduces a method that simplifies CI testing by treating it as a binary classification task. Using classifiers, like gradient enhanced trees and deep neural networks helps differentiate between the combined distribution \\( f(x,y,z)\\ \\ and the independent conditional distribution \\( f_{CI}( x,y,z ) \\).One important advancement involves creating a method using neighbors to produce samples that closely resemble \\( f_{CI} \\) ensuring they are similar in total variation distance based on theoretical assurances in the papers findings.The research also presents boundaries for classification, with independent samples and illustrates the practical effectiveness of the new approach compared to cutting edge kernel based CI tests (KCIT and RCIT) using both artificial and real world datasets. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper presents a way to simplify CI testing into binary classification instead of using the usual kernel based methods—a fresh and innovative approach that allows for the application of contemporary supervised learning techniques in complex scenarios, with high dimensions. \nThe authors offer theoretical assurances by presenting limits on the variation distance of the bootstrapped samples and the generalization risk for classifiers trained on nearly independent samples is discussed in detail along with an analysis of Rademacher complexity, in this scenario which stands out as noteworthy. \nThe new approach (CCIT) when put to the test in trials and real world scenarios like the flow cytometry dataset outperforms both KCIT and RCIT convincingly.Its ability to scale effectively with the dimensionality of \\( Z \\ ) gives it an edge, over the competition. \nThe flexibility of the design enables the incorporation of various classifiers to accommodate domain specific adjustments and enhancements as classification methods progress over time. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe computational complexity of the method is manageable when it comes to dimensionality; however the nearest neighbour bootstrap and repetitive classification processes can still be time consuming for large datasets.It would greatly benefit the paper to delve deeper into discussing the runtime trade offs. \nBias Adjustment; The bias adjustment feature in Algorithm 3 works well. Adds more complexity, to the process. The practical assessment doesn't thoroughly measure how this adjustment affects performance. \nReal world testing is limited for the flow cytometry dataset as its a benchmark; however including more real world datasets, from various domains would improve the overall applicability of the findings. \nThe paper mainly contrasts CCIT with kernel based techniques. Suggests that including evaluations against other contemporary CI testing methods like those reliant, on mutual information or entropy estimation would offer a more thorough assessment. \nReasons, in favor of approval; \nThe article introduces a methodological advancement by redefining CI testing as a classification challenge. \nThe approachs strength and success are supported by both assurances and real world outcomes. \nThe methods adaptability and expandability add value to the field. \nReasons to Not Agree; \nIn situations the practical use of the nearest neighbor bootstrap and classification steps might be hindered by their computational demands. \nIt would enhance the assessment to include datasets and compare it with a wider variety of methods. \nSuggestion; \nIn general，this paper provides insights, into CI testing and statistical learning，although there are some areas that could be enhanced further。The originality，theoretical robustness，and practical success of the study support its approval。I suggest accepting it with minor adjustments to address computational issues and broaden the assessment criteria。"
