            "inputText": "The article presents FSUCRL as a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies on learning with options within Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). By merging the semi MDP (SMDP) framework with the Markov structure of options in a way that eliminates the requirement for prior information about reward accumulations and option durations\" distributions\"\"addressing a significant weakness found in algorithms, like SUCRL. By converting choices into Markov chains using a new method introduced in the algorithm helps calculate positive strategies without the need for detailed parameters specified beforehand. Theoretical limits of regret are. Indicate that FSUCRL performs similarly as SUCRL with a minor additional component. Initial practical findings suggest that FSUCRL maintains the advantages of summarization while also being resilient, in instances of lacking previous information. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper brings attention to a drawback in previous studies by introducing an approach to learning with options that doesn't require parameters. The idea of transforming options into Markov chains is a fresh addition that blends perspectives, from SMDP and MDP. \nThe authors delve deeply into the aspects of regret analysis and offer precise boundaries that consider the increased intricacy arising from the absence of prior knowledge, in their work. \nThe algorithms parameter free design is beneficial for real world situations where there is a lack of available prior knowledge about options, which is especially useful for generating options, in deep reinforcement learning automatically. \nThe tests show that FSUCRL is on par with SUCRL and UCRL while maintaining the benefits of abstraction effectively The outcomes emphasize the resilience of FSUCRL, in situations involving overlapping options. \nAreas that need improvement; \nThe papers theoretical findings are robust; however the practical assessment is restricted to scenarios and grid based settings. Including a range of intricate benchmarks akin, to those found in deep reinforcement learning would bolster the credibility of the research findings. \nThe document is quite complex and filled with jargon that might make it difficult for a wider audience to understand fully.You could enhance clarity by simplifying the part and offering more intuitive explanations for important concepts, like irreducible Markov chains. \nThe practical consequences of regret bounds should be considered carefully as they involve factors, like pseudo diameter and condition numbers that might not always reflect real world scenarios accurately. \nThe paper discusses the benefits of abstraction but could provide a broader comparison, to UCRL by examining situations where options are not well designed or optimal. \nReasons, to Support; \nThe study adds a theoretical perspective by eliminating the requirement for existing knowledge in the process of learning with options\"\"a notable drawback, in previous research. \nThe new algorithm is original and well supported by theoretical analysis that makes it compelling. \nAlthough the evidence is not extensive, in scope it shows that the method can be realistically implemented. \nReasons to Not Agree; \nThe practical testing is limited in focus. Does not thoroughly investigate how well the algorithm performs in tougher or real world scenarios. \nThe paper should be clearer so that more people can easily understand it. \nSuggestion; \nThis research paper provides a theoretical advancement in the realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with options and tackles a significant drawback of previous studies in this area. Though the practical assessment could be more thorough in scope and depth the uniqueness and rigor of the suggested method render it a worthwhile contribution, to existing literature. In my opinion acceptance is warranted with some revisions to enhance clarity and broaden the empirical evaluation. "
