            "inputText": "The paper introduces an adaptive sampling technique for optimization algorithms like Coordinate Descent (CD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGP) to tackle the inefficiencies in current gradient based sampling methods effectively.The authors suggest an estimate of the gradient based sampling using upper and lower limits on the gradient to guarantee noticeable enhancements in performance compared to uniform and fixed importance sampling methods.This method is efficient in terms of computation. Has a complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\, per iteration.It seamlessly integrates into existing CD and SGD frameworks. The theoretical findings are backed by numerical tests conducted with real world data sets to showcase notable improvements, in convergence speed. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper offers theoretical support for the sampling method presented by demonstrating its superiority over fixed importance sampling and its potential to rival optimal gradient based sampling performance, with the authors also establishing competitive ratio bounds for their approach. \nThe new approach brings about extra work (\\[ O(n \\log n) \\]) which makes it suitable for handling large scale tasks effectively according to the authors demonstration, on managing secure gradient limits efficiently for generalized linear models (GLMs).\nThe approach is versatile. Can be used for both coordinate descent (CD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGO) techniques, alike which broadens its usefulness across various optimization challenges. \nEmpirical Testing Confirms the Statements by demonstrating noticeable enhancements in how quickly convergence occurs and computational effectiveness improves as well.. Additionally indicated is the resilience of this approach despite having lenient constraints, on gradients. \nThe paper effectively explains its contributions by detailing the derivation of the sampling distribution and presenting an algorithm for computation along, with empirical evaluation. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe study extensively tests Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). It fails to investigate how well the method works with advanced machine learning models, like deep neural networks or non linear objectives. \nThe suggested sampling method demonstrates enhancements for SGD in contrast to CD as noted by the authors without offering an extensive explanation for the lesser advantages, in the SGD environment. \nRelying on bounds is crucial for this approach; however calculating or sustaining these bounds can be challenging for intricate models at times.The authors suggest techniques, for GLMs but it is necessary to investigate this limitation further. \nThe paper is well laid out overall; however some parts like the explanations might be tough, for those not well versed in the topic to grasp easily. \nReasons, in favor of approval; \nThe paper discusses an issue, in optimizing large scale machine learning and proposes a solution that is both practical and theoretically robust. \nThe suggested approach is both computationally effective. Shows impressive practical results, with real world data sets. \nThe new ideas, in this research enhance our knowledge of importance sampling and offer assurances that were missing in previous studies. \nReasons to oppose approval; \nThe narrow range of assessment and lesser improvements in performance, with SGD lessen the overall validity of the assertions made. \nThe methods effectiveness may be restricted when relying heavily on gradient bounds especially when tackling intricate or non linear problems. \nSuggestion; \nIn terms the paper provides a valuable addition to the domain of optimization in machine learning especially for CD techniques. Despite a drawbacks the advantages surpass the disadvantages. I suggest acceptance, with modifications to enhance the clarity of presentation and delve deeper into discussing the limitations of the approach. "
