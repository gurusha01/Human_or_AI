            "inputText": "This research suggests a methodical strategy for creating feature maps for kernel machines that differs from the random Fourier features technique. The researchers explore systematic quadrature rules such, as exact polynomial quadrature and different grid constructions. Dense grid construction,...\nThe paper is nicely crafted with an succinct review of the context and previous studies provided by the authors.The technical advancements are noteworthy. The outcomes of the experiments are quite striking.The application of feature maps shows promise, in enhancing accuracy scaling compared to random Fourier features as shown by the authors across various datasets. \nThe papers strong points are; \nThe writers conduct an examination of the theoretical limits, on how much data is needed for the methods they suggest. \nThe results, from the experiment are clearly. Prove that the suggested approaches work well. \nThe paper is nicely. The authors offer a straightforward summary of the background information and related research. \nSome drawbacks of the document are; \nThe document presumes that readers have some knowledge of kernel methods and quadrature rules which could pose challenges for those, without expertise in the subject matter. \nSome readers might find it challenging to grasp the contributions fully since some of the technical proofs and derivations are placed in the appendix. \nThe paper would be improved by including an in depth analysis comparing it to other relevant works, like quasi Monte Carlo methods. \nIn my opinion it would be an idea to approve this paper for publication as it offers valuable technical insights and presents compelling experimental findings.The paper is nicely. The authors have given a detailed yet concise discussion of the context and previous research, in the field. \nIn favor of acceptance there are compelling arguments.\nThe paper introduces an efficient method, for creating feature maps for kernel machines. \nThe writers conduct an examination of the theoretical limits, on how much sample data is needed for the suggested approaches. \nThe results, from the experiment are clearly. Show how well the suggested methods work. \nReasons to consider acceptance; \nThe paper expects readers to have some knowledge of kernel methods and quadrature rules which could be challenging for those who're not experts, in the field to understand fully. \nThe appendix contains some proofs and derivations that might make it challenging for readers to grasp the full extent of the technical contributions. \nThe paper could use a thorough examination of similar research like quasi Monte Carlo methods, for better clarity and context.
