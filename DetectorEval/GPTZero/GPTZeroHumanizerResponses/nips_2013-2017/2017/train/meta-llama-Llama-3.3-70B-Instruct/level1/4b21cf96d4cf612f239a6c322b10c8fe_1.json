These include a robust LSTM baseline and a basic CVA, with a set Gaussian preconception. \nThe paper has some drawbacks such, as; \nThe paper suggests that the identification of object categories is taken for granted and can be consistently detected; however this may not always hold true in real world scenarios. \nThe writers didn't delve into an examination of the instances of failure that could offer valuable insights into the constraints of the suggested models. \nThe paper would be more informative with an examination of how its approach stacks up against the latest models in the field, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).\nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article introduces a method, for creating captions for images that tackles a major drawback of conventional CVAEs. \nThe findings indicate that the suggested models perform better than the models used as a comparison. This includes a robust LSTM baseline and a basic CVA, with a fixed Gaussian prior distribution. \nThe document offers an thorough description of the suggested frameworks comprising the mathematical expressions and the experimental configuration. \nReasons to oppose it; \nThe document presumes that identifying and detecting object categories is straightforward and consistently achievable in real world scenarios; however this may not always be the reality, in practice. \nThe writers did not thoroughly examine the instances of failure in their research findings; this oversight could offer perspectives on the restrictions of the models they put forward. \nThe paper would be improved by providing a thorough comparison, with other cutting edge models that utilize GAN technology or other innovative methods. \nIn my opinion the paper adds insights to the image caption generation field and introduces a fresh strategy for tackling the challenge of restricted variability in standard CVAEs; though further exploration of failure instances and a thorough comparison, with other cutting edge models could enhance its impact significantly.
