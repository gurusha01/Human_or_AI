The researchers suggest that feedback in language can offer more valuable insights for learning than just numerical rewards because it can identify errors and propose improvements in a specific manner. The study introduces a phrase based RNN captioning model that can be combined with human feedback along, with a feedback network that rewards the learner based on the input received. \nThe article is nicely written and well structured; It provides an overview of prior studies and a detailed description of the proposed strategy. The testing phase is well thought out. Proves the efficiency of the suggested technique by surpassing standard RL models and attaining top notch outcomes in the MS COCO dataset. \nThe papers advantages are as follows; \nA new method has been suggested to integrate feedback from humans into reinforcement learning (RL) aiming to enhance the capabilities of RL agents, across tasks. \nThe development of a phrase based RNN captioning model that can incorporate input from humans represents a notable advancement, in the realm of image description generation. \nAn, in depth assessment of the suggested approach showcases its efficiency while shedding light on both its advantages and limitations. \nThe paper has some flaws, such, as; \nRelying heavily on data annotated by humans can be a time consuming and costly endeavor to gather. \nThe chance of errors and personal opinions creeping into the feedback data could impact how well the suggested approach works. \nThe papers narrow focus, on image tasks may not translate directly to other reinforcement learning tasks. \nThe paper is nicely. Offers a valuable addition to the realm of reinforcement learning and image captioning. The suggested method shows promise in enhancing the capabilities of reinforcement learning agents and enabling an more instinctive interaction, with people. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe study suggests an creative method, for integrating human input into reinforcement learning techniques. \nThe new approach delivers top notch outcomes on the MS COC0 dataset. \nThe paper is nicely written and well structured; it includes an examination of existing literature and a detailed description of the suggested method. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe proposed method might have a drawback due to its dependence, on a substantial volume of data annotated by humans. \nThe performance of the suggested approach may be impacted by any errors or personal biases present, in the feedback data provided by annotators. \nThe narrow focus of the research paper might restrict how useful it is, for reinforcement learning tasks. \nThe quality is good rating it 8 out of 10.\nYour text is quite clear scoring a 9 out of 10 on the clarity scale.\nThe originality is rated at 9 out of 10.\nThe importance is rated at an 8, out of 10.\nOverall rating is 8 and a half, out of 10. \nRecommendation would be to approve the paper with some adjustments needed to enhance it further.The paper is written well. Makes a valuable contribution, to the realm of reinforcement learning and image captioning.However the authors are encouraged to acknowledge the constraints of their proposed approach and delve deeper into the uses and expansions of their method"
