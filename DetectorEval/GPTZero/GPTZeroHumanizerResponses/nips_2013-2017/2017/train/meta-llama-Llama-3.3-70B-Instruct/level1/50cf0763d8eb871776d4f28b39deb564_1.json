The writers conduct a detailed examination of the distinguishability among various loss functions.The findings are intriguing. Offer fresh perspectives into the operation of generative and discriminative models, in complex environments. \nThe paper shows strong points; To begin with a fresh idea about the separability of loss functions is introduced by the authors which enables them to study the speed at which M estimators converge in a broader context. Additionally they conduct an examination on how different loss functions can be separated such as logistic regression and generative exponential families. Lastly they present a to follow introduction to the issue and their strategy, in the paper making it easy for various readers to understand. \nHowever the article also has some drawbacks.The paper is quite technical. May be difficult for some readers to understand the mathematical progressions.Furthermore the authors could offer insight and reasoning for their method especially for those unfamiliar, with M Estimations technical aspects.Additionally more numerical tests and simulations could be included in the article to showcase how the authors findings can be practically applied. \nThe paper performs strongly in terms of the review criteria regarding quality of content clarity and originality showing competence from the authors clear and concise introduction to the problem and their proposed solution approach.. The findings offer perspectives into the functioning of generative and discriminative models within complex data environments. Nonetheless there is room for improvement in regard to significance since a detailed discussion about the practical implications of the results and their connection to previous research, in this area could enhance its impact. \nArguments supporting acceptance; \nThe research paper introduces a concept of separability, in loss functions that enables a broader examination of M Estimators. \nThe writers conduct an examination of the distinguishability of various loss functions such, as logistic regression and generative exponential families. \nThe findings are unique. Offer fresh perspectives into how generative and discriminative models behave in complex environments. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe document contains technical content that might be difficult for some readers to comprehend the mathematical concepts presented within it. \nThe writers might want to offer insights and reasons, behind their method to help those readers who are not well versed in the technical aspects of M estimation understand better. \nThe article would be improved by including numerical tests and simulations to showcase how the authors\" findings could be applied in real world scenarios.
