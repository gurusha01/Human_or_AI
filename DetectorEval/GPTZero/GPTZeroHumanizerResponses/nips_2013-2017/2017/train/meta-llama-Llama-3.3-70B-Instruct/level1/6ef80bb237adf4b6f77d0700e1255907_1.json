The authors establish two equations.

Furthermore... \nThe paper is nicely. Structured with a clear and detailed description of the methodology and results by the authors.They discuss how their work ties back to research on geodesically convex optimization like in [reference 21] while also highlighting the distinctions and commonalities between their approach and other methods, in a comprehensive manner. \nThe papers strong points are; \nThe writers introduce an effective technique for optimizing geodesically convex functions, on Riemannian manifolds that enhances the speed of convergence compared to current approaches. \nThe research thoroughly. Explains how the algorithm progresses towards convergence by discussing its global convergence rate and the specific conditions that lead to its convergence. \nThe writers outline a step by step approach, for solving matrix Karcher mean issues \"\" a significant use of geodesically convex optimization. \nThe paper has some shortcomings, such, as; \nThe paper suggests that the convex function is typically smooth and strongly convex; however this may not hold true for every application. \nThe article lacks a comparison with approaches, for geodesically convex optimization outlined in references [25 and [11].\nThe results, from the experiment only focus solelyon one particular use case, which's the matrix Karcher mean problems and do not offer a thorough assessment of the suggested algorithm. \nReasons to consider; \nThe research paper introduces an effective algorithm for optimizing geodesically convex functions, on Riemannian manifolds that enhances the speed of convergence compared to current approaches. \nThe article offers an, in depth examination of how well the suggested algorithm merges together. \nThe writers present a step by step approach, for solving matrix Karcher mean issues\"\"a significant use of geodesically convex optimization. \nReasons to oppose the proposal; \nThe document suggests that the convex function is expected to be smooth and strongly convex; however this might not hold true in every scenario. \nThe document lacks a comparison to established approaches, for geodesically convex optimization. \nThe findings, from the experiment are confined to an use case and do not offer a thorough assessment of the suggested algorithm. \nIn my opinion the paper should be accepted because it introduces an effective algorithm for geodesically convex optimization, on Riemannian manifolds and the authors have thoroughly analyzed the convergence properties of this algorithm in a detailed manner. However I suggest that the authors should work on improving some aspects of the paper like comparing it with methods currently available and testing the algorithm on a broader set of applications. "
