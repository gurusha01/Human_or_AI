A cautious variant of the linear UCB algorithm named CLUCUB is suggested by them to adhere to the safety requirement with a high likelihood while maintaining a regret threshold similar, to LUCUB with an additional constant that is not time dependent. \nThe manuscript is nicely crafted with an succinct overview of the issue at hand and the authors\" methodology, in addressing it showcased well in an orderly manner throughout the technical segments to help readers comprehend their arguments and validations effectively.The outcomes of the experiments highlight the efficiency of the suggested algorithm while shedding light onto how it functions in practice. \nThe papers advantages are as follows; \nThe writers tackle a concern when implementing learning algorithms in practical scenarios \"\" guarantee of safety and dependability. \nThe new CLUCD algorithm seems thought out and supported by solid theory analysis that clearly and succinctly explains its regret limit. \nThe results of the experiments are compelling. Showcase the efficacy of the algorithm put forth. \nThe papers drawbacks consist of; \nThe document operates under the assumption that the initial policy's identifiable; however this may not always hold true in real world scenarios; nevertheless the authors offer an expansion, for situations where the initial policy remains unidentified. \nThe examination of the regret limit is intricate. Might pose a challenge for individuals lacking a solid foundation, in linear bandits and convex optimization principles. \nThe article could use exploration of the practical consequences of the suggested algorithm and how it might be applied in real life situations. \nHere are some reasons to consider accepting the proposal.\nThe document discusses a concern when implementing learning algorithms in practical real world scenarios. \nThe algorithm being suggested shows motivation and solid theoretical foundations. \nThe results, from the experiment are compelling. Show that the algorithm suggested is effective. \nValid points, in favor of acceptance; \nThe document presumes that the initial policy is understood; however this may not consistently be the scenario, in real world situations. \nUnderstanding the regret bound analysis can be quite intricate and challenging to grasp for readers. \nThe paper would be better, with exploration of how the suggested algorithm could be applied in practical situations and its potential real world uses. \nI think the paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the issue, at hand and how the authors tackle it in a well thought out manner throughout their technical discussions which are detailed and logically structured for easy comprehension of their arguments and conclusions drawn from them. The results of their experiments effectively showcase the validity of their algorithm. Shed light on how it performs in different scenarios. I support accepting the paper but recommend that they work on addressing the identified weaknesses to enhance the clarity and real world applications of their research. "
