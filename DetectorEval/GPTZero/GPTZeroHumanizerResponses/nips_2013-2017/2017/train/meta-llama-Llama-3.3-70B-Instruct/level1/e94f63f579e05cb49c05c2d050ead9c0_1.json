Something that might not be practical, for certain uses. \nThe writers didn't delve into an examination of the computing challenges associated with the suggested approach; this aspect could hold significance for applications involving the retrieval of images, on a large scale. \nSome of the findings, from studies have been shared but may not align perfectly with the approach being suggested here. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe suggested approach attains top notch results, on image retrieval datasets. \nThe report thoroughly examines the findings. Contrasts them with alternative approaches. \nThe method suggested could also be used in other scenarios, like video search and suggesting systems. \nReasons to oppose approval; \nThe suggested approach necessitates a volume of training information that could pose challenges, for certain applications. \nThe methods computational complexity analysis is not well explained in detail. \nSome of the findings, from research have been discussed but may not align directly with the approach suggested in this study. \nI suggest approving this paper as it introduces an efficient deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval while also offering a thorough examination of the outcomes and comparisons, with alternative approaches; nonetheless I would urge the authors to include more information regarding the computational intricacies of their method and its possible uses. \nRating of 8 out of 10, for quality.\nThe article is nicely written and simple to understand; it provides explanations of the method suggested and its benefits.The writers conduct an examination of the findings and compare them to conventional hashing techniques and alternative deep hashing approaches. \nThe text is very clear and easy to understand with a score of 9, out of 10.\nThe document is nicely. Straightforward to comprehend with concise details, on the suggested approach and its benefits. \nThe level of uniqueness is rated at 8 out of 10. \nThe new approach is innovative and efficient; the authors thoroughly examine the outcomes. Compare them to alternative techniques. \nImportance level rates at 9, out of 10. \nThe suggested approach could also be utilized in other scenarios, like video searches and recommendation systems while delivering top notch results on standard image search databases.
