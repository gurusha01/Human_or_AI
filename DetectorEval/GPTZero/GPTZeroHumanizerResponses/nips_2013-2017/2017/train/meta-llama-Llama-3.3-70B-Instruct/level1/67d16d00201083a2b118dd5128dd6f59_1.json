            "inputText": "This research paper suggests two methods to incorporate resistance to noise into the measurements of distribution distances. One method involves assessing the asymmetry level, in paired sample variances while the other method involves comparing the phase aspects of the samples. The paper offers an explanation of the context and framework which includes defining components that are symmetric positive definite (SPD) and random vectors that can be decomposed. \nThe writers present the idea of phase discrepancy (PhD) a L2 distance between phase functions that remains unchanged by additional SPD noise components.They also create an outline of specific features for kernel K known as phase characteristics that are applicable for studying distributions.The document includes findings such, as statements and validations to back up the suggested approaches. \nThe results from the experiments show how well the suggested approaches like the Symmetric Mean Embedding (SME) test and the PhD test perform on real data sets. The findings indicate that the SME test effectively manages Type I errors with significant variations in noise levels. Additionally the PhD test shows effectiveness compared to the SME test when dealing with minor noise levels. The research paper also illustrates how phase features can be used in studying distributions for tasks such, as distribution regression and multi instance learning. \nThe papers positive aspects are as follows; \nTwo innovative methods have been suggested to incorporate resistance to noise into distance calculations, between distributions.\nSupporting the suggested methods, with results and proofs.\nThe showcasing of how the suggested approaches perform on both artificial and real life data.\nThe usefulness of phase characteristics, in studying distribution patterns.\nThe papers drawbacks are as follows; \nThe idea of foundational distributions might not always be applicable, in real world scenarios.\nThe PhD tests sensitivity, to noise levels could result in higher Type I error rates.\nThere is a requirement for investigation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and constraints of the suggested approaches. \nThe paper provides a contribution to the realms of machine learning and statistics, with its suggested approaches holding promise for broad use across different fields. \nHere are some reasons why we should consider accepting the arguments.\nThe article presents creative methods to incorporate resistance to symmetric noise additions in the distances, between distributions. \nThe research paper offers theoretical findings and evidence to back up the suggested approaches.\nThe outcomes of the experiments show how well the suggested approaches work with both real data.\nReasons supporting acceptance; \nSometimes the idea that underlying distributions cannot be broken down completely may not match what actually happens in real world scenarios.\nThe test, for a PhD might be influenced by levels of noise that could result in higher rates of Type I errors. \nMore investigation is required to gain an understanding of the characteristics and constraints of the suggested approaches.
