The authors establish information theoretic limits and closely align upper limits, on the query complexity involved in clustering with side information. The papers key finding is that incorporating details like a similarity matrix can significantly lower the search complexity for clustering from Θ(n*k*) to O(k²*log n* *H²(f+) + \"\"* f *\"\"* ) where *H²(f+) + \"\"* f *\"\"* represents the Hellinger divergence, between the probability distributions of * f and * f *.\nThe paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the issue and a thorough examination of previous research done by the authors mentioned in it's content.The technical contributions of the paper are notable. An, in depth analysis of the query complexity of clustering with additional information is provided by them as well.The paper further presents findings from a real world dataset that showcase the efficiency of the algorithms suggested. \nThe papers notable aspects are; \nThe research article offers a theoretical examination of the number of queries needed for clustering with additional information—a valuable addition, to the field. \nThe researchers suggest two algorithms that meet the minimum required query complexity with a slight adjustment and do not require any additional parameters. \nThe document showcases findings from a genuine dataset to prove the efficiency of the suggested algorithms. \nThe paper has some shortcomings such, as; \nThe document presumes that the oracle consistently provides responses; however this may not always align with reality. \nThe article does not explore scenarios where the similarity matrix's inaccurate or incomplete. \nThe paper lacks a comparison to existing algorithms, for clustering with additional information. \nIn terms of writing quality and technical impact are notable in the document! The authors present an well defined introduction to the issue, alongside a comprehensive overview of relevant research findings. The experimental outcomes showcase the efficiency of the suggested algorithms. Offer a valuable advancement in the realm of clustering with supplementary data. \nPoints supporting acceptance; \nThe article thoroughly examines the query complexity of clustering with information, from a theoretical perspective. \nThe writers suggest two algorithms that meet the minimum query complexity limit with a logarithmic factor and do not require any parameters whatsoever. \nThe research paper presents findings from a dataset, in the real world that showcase how well the suggested algorithms work. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe paper suggests that the oracle consistently provides answers; however this may not always hold true in real world scenarios. \nThe paper does not address situations where the similarity matrix's inaccurate or incomplete. \nThe paper lacks a comparison, with current clustering algorithms that incorporate additional information alongside the data points. \nI suggest that we accept the paper as it makes an addition to the area of clustering with additional information and presents thorough technical insights that are well examined. The practical outcomes showcase the efficacy of the algorithms put forward and offer an succinct overview of the issue. Despite some drawbacks noted in the papers content. They are outweighed by its strengths. Making it a noteworthy contribution, to this field. "
