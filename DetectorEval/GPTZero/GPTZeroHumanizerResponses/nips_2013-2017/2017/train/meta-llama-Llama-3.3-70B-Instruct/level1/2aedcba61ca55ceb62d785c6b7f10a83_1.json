The authors offer a thorough and clear description of the method they suggest.The theoretical findings regarding the stability of the estimated group structure are firmly established.The experiments, with simulations and real world data showcase how well the proposed method identifies the underlying group structure. \nThe paper has notable strengths, which are worth mentioning.\nA fresh suggestion to recognize the group additive arrangement has been introduced to address the issue of high dimensionality and enhance the effectiveness and interpretability of complex nonparametric regression methods. \nA new technique has been created that combines a penalized kernel approach to detect the underlying group patterns and calculate the functions at the same time. \nA new way to measure complexity in additive systems has been developed using the capacity measure of RKHSes. \nThe development of findings involves confirming the accuracy of the estimated groups additive framework. \nThe paper has its flaws, such, as; \nThe suggested approach might not be practical, for handling datasets since it necessitates a thorough examination of all potential group additive configurations. \nThe selection of tuning parameters like 位 and 碌 might need to be chosen as the authors have not laid out a specific guide, for selecting these values clearly. \nThe approach might not handle outliers or noisy data well. The authors did not address the methods robustness in their discussion. \nThe paper is nicely. The new method suggested is innovative and useful; though there are some drawbacks and room for enhancements, like computational speed and reliability. \nReasons, in favor of acceptance; \nThe research suggests a method to uncover the inherent group additive pattern that helps address the issue of high dimensionality and enhances the effectiveness and clarity of complex nonparametric regression tasks. \nThe approach has a theoretical foundation and the validity of the inferred group additive framework is supported by evidence. \nThe proposed method has been proven effective through simulation studies and real world applications. \nThe supporting points, in favor of acceptance are as follows; \nThe method suggested might not work well for handling datasets in terms of computational efficiency. \nSelecting the tuning parameters like 位 and 碌 can be tricky since the authors haven't given a straightforward guide, on how to choose them carefully. \nThe technique might not handle outliers or noisy data well. There is no mention from the authors about how resilient the method is, in such cases. \nRating given by user is 8, out of 10.\nSuggestion for approval with adjustments needed would be to tackle the shortcomings of the suggested approach like computational efficiency and reliability and offer a comprehensive guide on how to choose the tuning parameters effectively. Moreover the authors should explore the potential uses of the proposed method and compare it to other methods currently, in use. "
