The researchers outline a representation of imaging data and create an optimal robust loss function using M Estimation theory. They also suggest a fixed point optimization process to address the robust estimation challenge with confirmed swift progress. Through experiments, on actual datasets the authors show that their robust estimation technique outperforms current methods. \nThe article is nicely written with an concise introduction, to the issue and their method of tackling it. The technical segments are thorough. Well laid out for easy comprehension of the authors\" thought process. The experiments are comprehensive. Thoughtfully designed with results presented in a clear and concise fashion. \nThe papers strong points are; \nThe writers suggest an strong method for extracting cells automatically that is a big step up, from current techniques. \nThe article presents an clear technical section that simplifies understanding the authors\" thought process. \nThe studies have been carefully. Detailed while the findings are shared in a straightforward and succinct way. \nThe paper has some flaws, such, as; \nThe document expects readers to have an understanding of calcium imaging and accurate statistical estimation which might pose challenges for those without expertise, in these areas. \nThe writers could delve further into the drawbacks of their method. Suggest possible directions, for future studies. \nThe document could use visual aids and diagrams to assist those who are not experts, in grasping the ideas and findings more easily. \nPoints supporting acceptance; \nThe research introduces an reliable method, for automatically extracting cells that surpasses current techniques significantly. \nThe article presents an neatly structured technical segment that simplifies understanding the authors\" thought process. \nThe experiments were carefully. Detailed with clear and concise presentation of the results. \nPoints, in favor of accepting the arguments; \nThe paper expects readers to have some knowledge, about calcium imaging and accurate statistical estimation \"\" this might be challenging for those not well versed in these areas. \nThe writers could delve deeper into the drawbacks of their method. Explore possible directions, for future studies. \nThe document would be improved by including visual aids and illustrations to assist individuals who are not experts, in grasping the ideas and findings more easily. \nIn my opinion the paper is well crafted. Makes a meaningful impact in the realm of calcium imaging. The authors introduce an reliable method for automating cell extraction and their experiments showcase the effectiveness of their approach compared to current techniques. Although there are a drawbacks, in the paper I think that its strengths overshadow them so I suggest it should be accepted. "
