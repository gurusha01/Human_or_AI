VQA version 1 and GuessWhat?!.\nThe article is nicely. The writers present a strong reason, for their method by highlighting the drawbacks of existing VQA models that handle visual and language inputs separately. They explain the aspects of CBN and MODERN thoroughly and conduct a detailed examination of the outcomes which includes an ablation study and illustrations of the acquired representations. \nThe papers strong points are as follows; \nA new fusion method has been suggested to adjust how visual information is processed by incorporating language input\"\"a departure, from existing methods. \nSignificant enhancements were showcased compared to established benchmarks, on two question answering datasets. \nThe detailed examination of the findings with an investigation, into components and illustrations showcasing the acquired knowledge representations. \nThe papers limitations are as follows; \nThe use of a trained ResNet might restrict how widely the method can be applied to different architectures. \nThe absence of a comparison, with other cutting edge VQA models employing varied fusion techniques is noticeable. \nThe authors propose that MODERN could be applied to modalities and tasks beyond VQA; however additional testing is needed to validate this assertion. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe research paper introduces an important idea, to the VQA domain. \nThe method is clearly explained with motivation and thorough technical explanations. \nThe findings show enhancements compared to well established starting points. \nPoints, in favor of acceptance; \nThe use of a trained ResNet might restrict how broadly the method can be applied. \nThe approachs strengths and weaknesses might not be fully grasped due to the absence of a comparison, with other top VQA models. \nThe potential impact of the approach may be restricted due to the assessment on tasks other, than VQA. \nIn my opinion the paper brings an addition to the VQA field and should be accepted. Yet I recommend that the authors focus on improving the areas mentioned earlier by offering a more thorough comparison, with leading VQA models and testing the method on tasks beyond VQA. "
