The first systematic definition of non negative MP algorithms with clear convergence rates. \nA thorough analysis that covers both sublinear and linear convergence rates, for the algorithms under consideration is provided. \nThe incorporation of error corrections, with assured linear progressions is now confirmed by numerical implementations. \nThe proof of the practical results of the suggested algorithms across different uses such, as artificial data sets and non negative matrix factorization and non negative garrote applications. \nThe paper has its shortcomings such, as; \nThe idea that the atom collection is limited may not hold true in every scenario. \nUsing estimates and simplified algorithms that might not work efficiently in real world scenarios. \nI didn't see any other state of the art algorithms like projected gradient descent, with alternating minimization being compared to in the research study. \nIn favor of acceptance; \nThe article introduces a version of NNMP algorithms that includes clear convergence rates\"\"a valuable addition, to the field. \nThe detailed examination of the merging analysis gives an insight into the suggested algorithms. \nThe addition of adjusted versions, with assured progress is a notable enhancement compared to current methods. \nThe practical tests showcase how well the suggested algorithms work, in real world situations. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe idea that the atom collection is confined could restrict how useful the suggested methods are. \nUsing linear minimization oracles may not prove to be effective, in real world scenarios. \nIt might be challenging to assess how well the suggested algorithms perform without comparing them to top notch algorithms in the field. \nThe paper makes a contribution to optimizing convex cones and offers algorithms that could find broad applications in fields, like signal processing and machine learning. Nevertheless the papers drawbacks. Like assuming bounded atom sets and relying on linear minimization oracles. Need thorough evaluation. "
