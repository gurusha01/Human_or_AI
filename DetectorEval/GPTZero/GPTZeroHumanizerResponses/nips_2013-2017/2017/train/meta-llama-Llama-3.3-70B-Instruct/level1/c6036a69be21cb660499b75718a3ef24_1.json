They suggest a deliberation network with two decoders, in place. The first one creates a sequence while the second one fine tunes and perfects that sequence further. \nThe article is nicely. Effectively elucidates the rationale and structure of the deliberation network concept.The writers offer an account of the frameworks components such as the encoder and first pass decoder along with the optimization method utilized for model training.The results from experiments highlight how well the deliberation network performs in tasks, like machine translation and text summarization. \nThe papers notable aspects encompass; \nA new method for creating sequences has been introduced, aiming to overcome the constraints of one step decoding methods, in task execution sequences. \nThe thorough and precise breakdown of the deliberation network structure and the optimization method used. \nThe results, from the experiment show how well the deliberation network performs in handling two tasks involving generating sequences. \nThere are some drawbacks, to the paper.\nThe document presumes that the audience has knowledge of the encoder decoder structure and tasks related to sequence generation challenges; this could pose a challenge for individuals without expertise, in the field. \nThe research could improve by delving into the findings and exploring the limitations and possible downsides of the deliberation network. \nThe paper lacks a comparison with other relevant studies, like post editing and review networks that could enhance our comprehension of the deliberation networks contributions. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article suggests a method, for tackling sequence generation tasks, which deals with a major drawback of conventional one pass decoding methods. \nThe results, from the experiment show how well the deliberation network performs in handling two tasks related to generating sequences. \nThe article is nicely. Effectively outlines the reasons behind and the structure of the discussion network. \nReasons to oppose it; \nThe article presumes that the reader has knowledge of the encoder decoder framework and tasks related to generating sequences; this could pose a challenge for individuals who are not experts, in the field. \nThe paper could be improved by delving into the results thoroughly and addressing the limitations and potential downsides of the deliberation network. \nThe paper lacks a comparison with other relevant research areas, like post editing and review networks to enhance our grasp of the deliberation networks contributions. \nIn my opinion the paper is nicely. Presents a fresh angle on sequence generation tasks.The experimental findings showcase the efficiency of the deliberation network. Add value to the field.However a deeper examination of the results and a direct comparison, with studies would enhance the papers quality.In my view the paper could be accepted with adjustments to tackle these issues.
