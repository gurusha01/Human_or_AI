The authors showcase how the algorithm is applicable, to machine learning tasks and datasets. \n\nI didn't get a chance to look over the affine algorithms and analyses discussed in the appendix of the paper. Although it introduces some intriguing concepts for linear oracle based optimization techniques I found some shortcomings in the technical explanation. In particular The second theorems description is unclear. Doesn't offer a substantial assurance of convergence. The linear convergence rates are dependent, on Theorem 8 which is tucked away in the appendix with a proof that's n't very clear.Moreover the minimum number of steps for each algorithm has not been definitively verified and is based upon less than entirely persuasive reasoning. While the numerical trials are abundant and persuasive I suggest that the authors furnish proof to show that the computational expenses are equivalent, to those of rival methods. \n\nTheorem 2\nThe way Theorem 2 and the sublinear rates are presented in the paper seem a bit problematic, to me because while the theorem mentions a fixed horizon T and a bound rho on iterates x₀ to xᵀ1 ᵀ the proof actually only applies when 1 > 1 > The authors could address the issue by setting conditions to ensure that the sequence of iterates stays within a confined range despite any potential increase in rho squared as T grows larger. Additionally; I found the statement \"This holds since f(x_t) <= f ( 0 ), for t > 0\" to be somewhat confusing as it implies the convexity of f. \nLemma number 7 and Theorem number 8.\nLemma 7 was quite a challenge for me to grasp since it lacks any notes to guide me through it smoothly.The equation is provided without any background information which hinders my understanding of its significance or intention.Additionally Lemma 7 only addresses g faces that are polytopes without clarifying if this is a requirement or if K could potentially be a non polytope.The presentation of Theorem 8 also poses difficulties, with its notation and ambiguous assumptions. The evidence for Theorem 8 mentions Lemma 7; however the notation seems off. The variable e isn't defined consistently throughout the proof. The statement \"Since x isn't optimal due to convexity reasons implies that the inner product of r and e must be greater than 0\" makes an assumption about xs optimality, without reasoning. The process of projecting r onto the faces of cone(A) that contain x lacks clarity. I'm concerned that this could lead to a situation where r ends up being zero making the subsequent equation lose its significance. \nAdditional Remarks \nAt line 220 of the document,\"max\" needs to be changed to \"argmax\". I had difficulty understanding the negative matrix factorization experiment and specifically how many steps the algorithm was executed for. "
