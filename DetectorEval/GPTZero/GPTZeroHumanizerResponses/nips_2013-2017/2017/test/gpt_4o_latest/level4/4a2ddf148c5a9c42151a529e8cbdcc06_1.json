Please provide me with the text you would like me to paraphrase in order to proceed with creating a human like rewrite. \nThis study explores how well the partial hard thresholding (PHI algorithm can recover support and determines the number of iterations needed under circumstances. \n\"Craftsmanship; \nThe paper doesn't clearly explain when the PHT(r) algorithm stops running which makes it hard to understand Proposition 1 fully. Moreover;. The specific problem examples are only briefly mentioned in the paragraph of Section 2.. For example; If the non zero values of \\(\\bar{x}\\) follow a distribution that doesn't have changes at \\( x=0 \\) then \\( x_{min}\\) should increase at a rate of \\( O ( 1/n ) \\). Meeting the \\( x_{min}\\) requirement becomes more challenging, as \\( n\\) increases. \nApologies for not clarifying that the minimum value \\( x_{min} \\) should increase proportionally as \\( O ( 0 / d ) \\). My mistake, for missing that detail in my statement. \nI can see things in a light. \nThe explanation of the simulations is not detailed enough to link the simulation configurations to the theoretical outcomes outlined in the paper. In particular it would be beneficial if the paper clearly defines the function \\(F(x)\\) along, with detailing the condition numbers and other parameters mentioned in the findings. Furthermore it would be helpful to evaluate whether conducting 10 000 iterations is adequate to fulfill the assurances. Moreover since the non zero elements of the signals are created as Gaussian variables,the minimum \\( x_{min} \\) values and the specific \\( s \\) values differ from one trial, to another. \nLemma 4 and Theorem 5, from the text are reiterated as Lemma 19 and Theorem 20 in the supplementary material; however the paper does not explicitly state that they are the same. \nAuthenticity; \nThis piece seems original because it expands on current research, on support recovery using hard thresholding to include the partial hard thresholding framework. A non trivial extension that adds significant value. \nImportance; \nThe algorithm for hard threshold ing extends both the traditional hard threshold ing method and the orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement technique.This means that the theoretical assurances for recovering support outlined in this document are substantial and applicable, to a range of research fields. \nMinor Details; \n \nLine 56 implies \nOn line 76 use a lowercase letter or letters. \nThe movement was limited to an steady flow. \nThe support then led to an investigation. \nLine 287 consists of independent and identically distributed normal variables. \nTo greatly decrease"
