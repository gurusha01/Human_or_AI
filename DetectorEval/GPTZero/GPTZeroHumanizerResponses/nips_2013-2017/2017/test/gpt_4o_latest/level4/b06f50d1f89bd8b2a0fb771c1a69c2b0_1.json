In each round of the experiment the participant observes a context \\( x_{ti}\\) chooses an arm to pull and then receives a reward \\( r_{ti}\\). \nThe main focus is on how to structure the rewards, with the authors pointing out two formulations. \nThe expected value of the reward at time \\( t \\) is equal to the product of \\( x_{t}\\) and \\( \\theta \\) enabling quicker learning but with constraints, on capacity. \nThe expected value of the product of r and ti equals the product of x and theta providing more capability but with a trade off, in slower learning speed. \nThis study delves into an approach between these two contrasting positions, by leveraging kernelization techniques. \nThe main concept is to expand the context area so that the learner can see \\( (z_{ti} x_{ti}) \\) where \\( z_{ti} \\) exists in a supplementary space \\( Z \\). A kernel is established on this expanded space to gauge context similarity and decide how much information is exchanged among components. \nInput text; Contribution \nThe main idea seems to be suggesting a way to expand the context space in this approach. The regret analysis makes use of common methods. \nOriginality.\nThe extension technique appears interesting but has its constraints in terms of effectiveness and scope based on my comprehension of the study conducted by Valkko et al., where their findings could easily be used in the extended scenarios, with comparable assurance levels related to them being innovative. \nEffect\nThe future implications of this research remain unclear at this point in time.The theoretical aspect adds some value but the practical tests lack persuasion.While the efforts put into the experiments are valued the absence of comparisons, with linear Thompson sampling does create a void in the assessment of results. \nPrecision\nAfter glancing through the supporting materials I find that the claims, about regret limits seem reasonable at first glance. \nIn general\nThis paper seems on the edge of being accepted for publication review.. My rating might go up with evidence from the authors showing that their theoretical findings offer deeper insights, than those found in Valk et al.s analysis. \nThe claim that at time \\( t \\) \\( n_{ a,t } = t/N \\) lacks justification entirely.How reliable are the inferences drawn from this claim? \n\"It's a shame we couldn't analyze Algorithm 1 further.Can we assume those sup \"blah blah\" algorithms aren't really practical, to use?\"It would be great to have a representation of how they perform compared to Algorithm 1.These concerns definitely need more focus and consideration.I understand that the problem itself is quite challenging.\"\nNot of age.\nCapitalize \\( A_t \\) well as other random variables for uniformity, throughout the text. \n \nPlease explain what \"za\" stands for by stating that \"za\" belongs to the set of Z. \nLine 110 seems a bit odd, with \\( t_a \\) which is based on both \\( t \\) and \\( a \\). \nLine 114 is too focused on using primes, which can be a bit overwhelming and take away, from the point. \nMake sure to mention a noise assumption (such, as bounded or sub Gaussian noise model) was that part overlooked? \nThe additional context provided here is also represented as \\( ( a, x_a ) \\)."
