            "inputText": "This study delves into the Min Sum Splitting algorithm to address the consensus issue in distributed optimization by examining convergence rates and presenting acceleration methods in detail. The researchers illustrate that unlike the Min Sum algorithm that struggles to converge in graphs with cycles the Min Sum Splitting version ensures convergence and attains subdiffusive accelerated rates. They establish links between the acceleration techniques of Min Sum Splitting and strategies such, as lifted Markov chains and multi step first order methods commonly used in optimization. The key points of the paper involve a fresh demonstration of convergence rates for Min Sum Splitting method alongside an auxiliary technique, for evaluating the algorithms performance and showcasing how adjusting parameters correctly leads to better rates compared to traditional diffusive approaches. \nThe study builds upon investigations into Min Sum algorithms discussed in [27] which examined the convergence of certain graph structures and [34] which introduced the concept of splitting in algorithms.The writers expand on these findings by offering an analysis of convergence rates for various graph structures and by linking Min Sum Splitting to more extensive acceleration methods.The article also places its findings in the realm of distributed optimization and consensus literature by referencing techniques such as Metropolis Hastings alongside recent developments, in accelerated algorithms. \nAdvantages; \nThe research delves into technical details by presenting a thorough theoretical examination and introduces an innovative method of proof involving an additional process to monitor the algorithms progression over time.This method streamlines the analysis process. Establishes connections, between convergence rates and spectral characteristics of the graph. \nSignificant progress has been made as the findings show an enhancement in the time it takes to converge compared to diffusive methods on specific graph structures like cycles and toruses, within distributed optimization scenarios. \nThe paper places its findings within a context, by connecting Min Sum Splitting with lifted Markov chains and multi step approaches to encourage additional research opportunities and valuable insights. \nThe paper effectively presents its contributions by discussing the initial examination of convergence rates for Min Sum Splitting and the proposal of a robust protocol, for achieving consensus in a competitive manner. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe paper would benefit from including test results to support the theoretical conclusions further and demonstrate their real world relevance despite having thorough proofs, in place. \nThe document might be difficult for those not with Min Sum algorithms or spectral graph theory as it is dense and lacks clarity, in certain sections. \nThe speeding up process depends on characteristics of the graph, like the spectral gap; this could make it challenging to use in completely decentralized situations where this kind of information isn't accessible. \nReasons to consider approval; \nThe research paper discusses an issue, in distributed optimization and offers a unique theoretical contribution. \nThe findings are firmly rooted in research and push the boundaries of innovation, in both Min Sum algorithms and consensus techniques. \nThe insights into the relationships between Markov chains and multi step approaches provide valuable directions, for further research opportunities. \nArguments, in opposition to acceptance; \nThe practical significance of the findings is diminished by the absence of confirmation. \nThe methods effectiveness, in world decentralized systems may be constrained by depending too heavily on global graph properties. \nThe complex nature of the paper might make it harder for a wider range of people to understand it fully. \nSuggestion; \nMy suggestion is to approve this paper with the condition that the authors address the need for validation in a future revision. The theoretical contributions are solid. The link, to broader acceleration methods is convincing. However the authors should think about simplifying their explanation to make it easier for a larger audience to understand. "
