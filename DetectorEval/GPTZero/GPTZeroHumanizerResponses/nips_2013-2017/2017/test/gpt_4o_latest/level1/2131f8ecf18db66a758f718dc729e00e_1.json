Their research involves establishing bounds on how much data is needed for queries to be effective and suggesting nearly perfect strategies for asking questions without adjusting based on previous answers; they confirm the validity of their approaches through theoretical examination and practical testing, with real people contributing information. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper brings up the idea of LESC within the realm of clustering and crowdsourcing from an angle which is innovative and exciting to see in research work.The utilization of AND queries of XOR queries is a noteworthy addition that offers a more efficient approach both, in theory and application wise. \nThe authors back up their arguments with explanations and evidence by demonstrating the minimum query complexity and effectiveness assurance of their algorithms using information theory and rate distortion theory principles that highlight their technical expertise. \nThe article tackles an issue in crowdsourcing. The importance of reducing query expenses. The use of data sets such as movie clustering, in the experiments adds credibility to the suggested techniques and demonstrates their practical usefulness. \nThe researchers confirm their discoveries by testing them on both artificial and real life data sets showcasing the practical benefits of the suggested method through a comparison of AND queries and \"same cluster\" queries. \nThe paper effectively explains its contributions by detailing close recovery methods as well as addressing noisy queries and conducting experimental validation. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe paper is quite detailed and technical in nature which might be tough for readers not well versed in information theory or clustering to understand due to its complexity and lack of clarity, in explaining the notation and mathematical derivations despite their accuracy. \nThe practical experiments have some constraints; they are not conducted at a scale (, for example only 200 movies). Conduct larger scale experiments. Compare them with other advanced clustering methods to enhance the empirical findings. \nAssumptions regarding noise in queries may not always align with all crowdsourcing situations as the independence assumption is generally considered standard practice in such cases. A discourse, on how correlated noise and adversarial environments can influence robustness would be beneficial. \nThe theoretical analysis mainly concentrates on labels (where k equals 3) with minimal investigation into scenarios involving multiple classes (with k greater, than 3). Expanding the findings to situations would increase the importance of the paper. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe article provides a theoretical contribution, by linking LESC with clustering and establishing new limits. \nThe new framework, for conducting AND queries is groundbreaking and feasible. Has proven benefits compared to current approaches. \nThe blend of theoretical framework and practical validation adds significant value, to the field. \nArguments opposing acceptance; \nThe way the paper is written might make it hard for a wider audience to understand it easily. \nThe experimental confirmation shows potential. Is somewhat constrained in size and extent. \nThe emphasis, on using two labels could limit how broadly we can apply the findings. \nSuggestion; \nThis paper shows promise for acceptance as it pushes the boundaries in clustering and crowdsourcing through a fresh querying framework and, in depth theoretical analysis.. Though there are areas that could be clearer and have an experimental reach the positives of the study outweigh its drawbacks.. I suggest accepting it with some revisions to enhance readability and extend the experimental assessment.. "
