Moreover it would be beneficial to evaluate whether 10 000 iterations are adequate considering the guarantees. Furthermore since non zero values of signals are generated as Gaussians, x_min values and specified s values differ across trials. In the main document of the study text is put forth as Lemma 19 and Theorem 20 in the supplementary materials without a clear indication that they are the same. \nThe creativity shown in this piece is moderate as it builds upon established ideas related to recovering support through thresholding by introducing the concept of partial hard thresholding—an intricate expansion. \nThe importance of this research is that it provides backing for ensuring recovery in the partial hard threshold algorithm which includes traditional hard threshold and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement, as specific instances thus adding value to the domain. \nSome smaller details to think about are; \nI adjusted the text from \"have should be has.\" to \"has should be utilized of have.\"\n\nSure thing! Here's the paraphrased text; Line 76 should read as \"An uppercase letter.\"\nIn Line 132 the term \"restricted\" could be better explained as \" smooth.”\nThen on line 196 change \"The”, to \"Then”.\nLine 287 could be explained as \"independent and identically distributed \". Normal\" could be specified as \"standard normal.\" \n"
