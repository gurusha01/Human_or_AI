It would be advantageous to incorporate research on iterative enhancement utilizing cascaded networks in the section on related work, from sources [A and B]. \nJ.C., P.A., K.F. And J.M.s research on human body posture estimation through error correction was presented at the 2016 IEEE Conference, on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).\nA study conducted by A.Newelll. K.Yangg. And J.Dengg. titled \"Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation \" was presented during the 2016 European Conference, on Computer Vision (ECCV).\nAt line 110 of the document mentioned earlier,\"we observe that incorporating blocks as fundamental elements leads to enhanced generation performance.\" Could you elaborate specifically which aspects of performance see improvement due, to this alteration? \n \nThe assessment covers a range of aspects; however it would be intriguing to explore how well the Stage 2 network functions when utilizing the Stage 1 inputs and being adversarially trained. Could the blurring seen with Stage 1 + GAN be linked to the connected layer in, between? \nOverall Evaluation; \nConsidering the uniqueness of the issue and methodology presented in this paper I highly suggest approving it. \nCounterargument; \nAlthough I acknowledge the authors’ effort in carrying out a user study in their research paper review rating. I do feel it lacks thoroughness and persuasion to sway my opinion positively towards it; hence my decision to overlook its impact in my assessment of the work overall stays intact. The authors are advised to incorporate a thorough human evaluation in their revised manuscript to strengthen their case further and provide stronger arguments, for consideration. However my overall positive evaluation of the research work still stands firm and unchanged. "
