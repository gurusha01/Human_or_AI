The study demonstrates that this issue is similar to encodable source codingâ€”a concept that has not received much attention in the information theory field. By utilizing this similarity in their research work gives insights into the number of inquiries needed to accurately identify the correct labels, in different situations. \nThe document is nicely crafted and simple to comprehend; it offers descriptions of how the issue is structured from an information theory perspective and outlines the key findings effectively. \nThe paper excels in offering a structure to grasp the complexities of multiclass labeling issues and demonstrates how their method can be utilized in different scenarios like clear and noisy queries and precise or approximate retrieval situations.The document also presents perspectives and findings; for instance the revelation that AND queries may surpass 'same cluster' queries, in specific contexts. \nThe results shared in the paper are quite impressive as they show how well the authors' method works with real world data sets! The contrast between 'same cluster' searches and spectral clustering methods is especially intriguing. Shows the advantages of using AND inquiries, in specific scenarios. \nOne possible drawback of the paper is that it bases its analysis on a representation of noise in the query responses. In reality the noise could be more intricate and subtle. It would be intriguing to observe how the authors' method fares, under such circumstances. Furthermore The paper could use an exploration of the computational challenges involved in the algorithms discussed and a more extensive examination of the balance, between query quantity and the precision of label retrieval. \nIn general though the paper is quite solid. Adds a substantial value, to the realm of semisupervised clustering.The method used by the authors is fresh. Well explained and the outcomes are remarkable and backed by both theory and experimentation. \nArguments supporting acceptance; \nThe article introduces an thoroughly reasoned strategy, for addressing the issue of assigning multiple labels to classes. \nThe writers thoroughly examine the pros and cons of their methodology. \nThe results, from the experiment are quite remarkable. Showcase how well the authors' method works. \nThe article presents intriguing findings and points out the advantages of utilizing AND queries, in specific scenarios. \nPoints, in favor of acceptance; \nThe document presumes a basic concept of noise in the responses, to queries that might not accurately reflect real world scenarios. \nThe article would be better, with a thorough exploration of the computational challenges involved in the algorithms discussed. \nThe article would be improved by delving into the balance, between the quantity of inquiries and the precision of the obtained labels.
