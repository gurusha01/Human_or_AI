Both synthetic and real world ones. To highlight the effectiveness of the suggested algorithm. \nThe papers shortcomings consist of the following; \nThe idea that we can always rely on knowing or accurately estimating the task similarity matrix is not always practical, in real world scenarios. \nIts challenging to assess how well the suggested algorithm performs compared to methods without comparing them to other cutting edge algorithms, for contextual bandits. \nThe analysis of the complexity of the suggested algorithm is somewhat limited and could be crucial for widespread use, in larger applications. \nThe paper is nicely crafted with an effective algorithm proposed within its pages The theoretical examination is extensive and the experiments solidly show how well the algorithm works Yet there are still some boundaries and chances, for enhancement noted like presuming task similarity is known or estimable and not comparing with other cutting edge algorithms available today\nReasons, in favor of approval; \nThe paper introduces an successful approach to multi task learning, in the context of contextual bandit problems. \nThe, in depth theoretical examination is comprehensive. The interpretation of regret bounds effectively highlights the advantages of multi task learning. \nThe tests show how well the new algorithm works with sets of data. \nReasons to oppose it; \nSometimes the idea that tasks are similar or can be estimated may not actually apply in real life situations. \nIts challenging to assess how well the proposed algorithm performs compared to methods due to the absence of comparisons with other advanced algorithms, for contextual bandits. \nAnalyzing the complexity of the suggested algorithm may hold significance for applications, on a large scale. \nI suggest accepting the proposal with revisions to tackle the noted limitations and areas, for enhancement mentioned earlier on.
