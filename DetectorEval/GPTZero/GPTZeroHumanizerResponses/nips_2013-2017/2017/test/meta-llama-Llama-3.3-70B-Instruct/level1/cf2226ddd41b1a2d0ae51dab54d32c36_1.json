            "inputText": "This study delves into the issue of maximizing influence in networks using non submodular threshold functions—a departure, from the usual submodular influence diffusion models. The researchers present the idea of ε submodular threshold functions wherein some nodes exhibit non submodular thresholds that align closely with upper and lower bounds defined by submodular functions. The research paper highlights a challenge by demonstrating that it's impossible to develop a reliable algorithm that achieves a close approximation of 1/n to the power of γ for maximizing influence in graphs with nearly submodular nodes equivalent to n raised to the power of γ and, within ε margin unless the complexity class P equals NP. \nThe authors then present an algorithm for graphs that have only a few non submodular nodes that might not be nearly ε submodular and focus on the scenario of nearly ε submodular nodes instead They introduce two algorithms; Galgorithm U and Galgorithm L that leverage the upper and lower bounds of the submodular functions' threshold values respectively. The algorithms come with assurances and offer an approximation ratio of (approximately 63%)(one minus ε to the power of ) for graphs featuring nodes that are nearly submodular. \nThe study also showcases findings using real life data sets like NetHEPT and Flixster as well as DBLP to highlight the efficiency of the suggested methods in contrast to standard techniques, like PageRank and High degree measures. The outcomes reveal that the suggested strategies excel over the ones particularly when dealing with graphs containing a significant number of ε almost submodular nodes. \nThe positive aspects of this paper are; \nIntroducing an idea called ε almost submodular threshold functions that enables the exploration of influence maximization, in non submodular scenarios. \nA robust finding on the hardness of the issue that establishes a basis, for its complexity. \nGreedy algorithms are offered with assurances for graphs containing a limited number of nodes that are close to being submodular, by epsilon (ε).\nResults from experiments showcasing how well the suggested algorithms perform on datasets, from real world scenarios. \nThe papers limitations are as follows; \nWhen the submodular bound or lower bound of the threshold function doesn't match the Triggering model the suggested algorithms tend to work at a slower pace. \nThe research primarily centers on managing submodular threshold functions ε and the exploration continues into examining models, with various non submodular threshold functions. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe article presents an idea and offers a robust difficulty finding that enhances the theoretical comprehension of influence maximization, in non submodular scenarios. \nThe suggested algorithms come with assurances and show good results, on real life data sets. \nThe article is nicely. Straightforward to understand with lucid descriptions of the ideas and algorithms. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe suggested algorithms might not be suitable for handling graphs and there is room for improvement, in speeding up the basic greedy process using various submodular threshold functions. \nThe research primarily centers on dealing with submodular threshold functions (ε almost) and might not be directly relevant, to models featuring various non submodular threshold functions. \nThis study makes an addition to the realm of influence maximization and social network analysis and stands as a strong contender, for approval.
