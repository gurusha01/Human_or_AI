Proven to be successful, in addressing the consensus issue. \nAn in depth examination of how the algorithm behaves with a demonstration of its progress, towards a solution and an exploration of how it reaches that solution. \nThe link between Min Sum Splitting and other advanced techniques, like lifted Markov chains and multi step gradient methods has been established. \nThe paper is well structured and clear which helps in understanding the authors\" arguments. \nThe papers shortcomings are as follows; \nThe paper expects readers to have an understanding of distributed optimization and graph theory; this might pose a challenge for those without expertise, in these areas. \nThe examination of the algorithms performance focuses on the consensus problem without a clear understanding of its applicability, to other optimization issues. \nThe paper lacks a comparison with other cutting edge approaches, for addressing the consensus issue. \nReasons, in favor of agreeing; \nThe article introduces an algorithm that outperforms conventional diffusive methods in terms of achieving faster convergence rates. \nThe algorithms behavior analysis is comprehensive. Backed by strong theoretical reasoning and practical experiments. \nThe link, between Min Sum Splitting and other faster techniques offers perspectives on how these methods work. \nPoints supporting acceptance include; \nThe assumptions and analysis presented in the paper might be too focused, on an area of study which could restrict how widely the results can be applied to different optimization problems. \nIts challenging to evaluate Min Sum Splittings performance to other advanced methods due, to the limited comparison available. \nThe intricate nature of the paper could pose a challenge for individuals, without expertise to grasp and comprehend the viewpoints put forth by the authors. \nIn general the research paper makes an addition to the area of distributed optimization. The authors provide backing for their points, with both theoretical and numerical proof. However it is important to evaluate the constraints and presumptions of the paper and additional investigation is required to gain a complete grasp of the capabilities and boundaries of Min Sum Splitting.
