Simple to understand since it starts with a clear explanation of the issue and an, in depth review of relevant literature. \nThe key contributions of the paper include; \nIt is essential to identify the individuals function to achieve convergence rates with a direct correlation, to the number of participants involved. \nShowing that without an understanding of the strong convexity factor, in play is unable to achieve acceleration in a wide range of first order and coordinate descent finite sum algorithms. \nDetermining the number of iterations required for oblivious algorithms to solve smooth and convex finite sum problems efficiently. \nThe papers notable qualities are as follows; \nA writing style that is straightforward and, to the point. \nAn, in depth examination of the issue and its potential consequences.\nExtensive research of existing literature has been conducted.\nHere are the findings presented in an organized manner.\nThe papers drawbacks are as follows; \nThe paper expects readers to have a grasp of optimization and machine learning concepts\"\"which might pose a challenge, for those not well versed in these areas. \nSome of the evidence and technical explanations are included in the appendix section of the document that might pose a challenge for readers to grasp the outcomes entirely. \nIn terms the paper is nicely crafted and makes notable additions to the realm of optimization. The findings carry consequences for crafting effective algorithms, for finite sum issues and underscore the significance of acknowledging the distinct nature of functions in such scenarios. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article provides insights that advance the field of optimization. \nThe findings hold implications, for creating effective algorithms for finite sum challenges. \nThe article is nicely. Simple to understand. \nReasons to oppose acceptance; \nThe document presupposes a foundation in optimization and machine learning which might make it challenging for those who are not experts, in the field to fully grasp its content. \nThe appendix contains some of the proofs and technical details that might pose a challenge for readers to grasp the results entirely. \nI would rate it 8 out of 10.\nSuggestion for acceptance, with adjustments to enhance understanding and user friendliness.
