            "inputText": "The article presents a version of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy ( CMA ES) called Cholesky CMA ES designed to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining optimization performance. CMA ES is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning tasks, like reinforcement learning and adjusting hyperparameters. Of the usual covariance matrix update method this novel approach implements a more stable and quicker quadratic time update process by managing triangular Cholesky factors. This adjustment lowers both the time taken and memory usage without affecting the algorithms effectiveness in terms of evaluating functions.It has been shown through testing that the Cholesky CMA ES method produces notable efficiency improvements especially in solving complex optimization challenges, in higher dimensions as compared to the regular CMA ES and its variations. \nAdvantages\nThe paper convincingly explains the aspects of the proposed alteration by offering solid theoretical support, with proofs and lemmas to ensure the reliability and consistency of the Cholesky based enhancements.I Additionally. \nThe practical testing shows an examination of various standard functions and dimensions up, to 256 in scope.The outcomes effectively prove that the Cholesky CMA_ES method brings about time efficiency enhancements while retaining an equal number of function assessments as the traditional CMA_ES approach. \nThe suggested approach holds value in real world applications especially for tackling extensive optimization challenges where managing the covariance matrix efficiently poses a challenge due, to computational costs and storage limitations. Expanding the effectiveness of CMA\"\"ES to handle dimensions without compromising its efficiency is a noteworthy advancement. \nThe paper is well structured and easy to understand with explanations of the algorithms (Algorithms 1 and 2) along, with mentions of open source versions that make it easier to recreate the results. \nShortcomings\nThe paper only compares the Cholesky CMA ES with the CMA ES and a few variations without considering other advanced derivative free optimization methods beyond the CMA ES family leading to a restricted perspective, on its contributions. \nError Assessment; While the theory indicates that the mistake caused by approximating Cholesky lessens with time, in the paper lacks measurements or visuals to directly assess this error throughout the optimization process. \nThe authors recognize that the methods scalability increases quadratically with dimensionality which could be challenging for high dimensional issues.It would be beneficial to consider strategies or extensions to address this limitation effectively. \nReasons to Embrace the Idea\nThe article discusses a known limitation, in CMA\"\"ES and offers a theoretically grounded and proven solution. \nThe suggested approach is hands on. Can be used directly in real life machine learning scenarios\"\"a valuable addition, to the field. \nThe papers clarity and thoroughness make it a strong contender, for acceptance. \nReasons to Decline \nComparing the CMA\\ ES optimization methods, with CMA\\ ES approaches would strengthen the assessment of its overall influence. \nWhile we recognize the scalability constraints due to complexity in this methods application, to very high dimensional issues are acknowledged and considered limiting factors. \nSuggestion\nThe paper adds insights, to derivative free optimization by enhancing the efficiency of CMA\"\"ES while maintaining its effectiveness intact despite some minor drawbacks that don't overshadow the overall significance of the research findings.
