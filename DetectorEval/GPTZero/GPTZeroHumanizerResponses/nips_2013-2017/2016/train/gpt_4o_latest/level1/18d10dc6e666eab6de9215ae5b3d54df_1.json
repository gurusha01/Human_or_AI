It is specifically created to optimize functions that're costly to evaluate in parallel settings without relying on derivatives. The authors develop the q KMG algorithm using a decision making framework that offers a group of points for sampling based on Bayes theorem principles. To tackle the complexities involved in assessing q KMGs performance effectively and accurately in practice tasks; they use infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) which allows for efficient gradient calculations essential, for practical optimization purposes. The new approach was tested on simulated test functions and tuning hyperparameters for machine learning models to show better results than the latest batch Bayesian optimization techniques, in noisy environments. \nThe study expands on research in Bayesian optimization (BO) where Gaussian processes (GPSs ) are commonly employed to represent the objective function and acquisition functions are used to direct assessments of the models efficiency. While many BO techniques concentrate on step by step evaluations one by one recent studies have ventured into evaluations to optimize computational capacity more efficiently. The authors enhance the knowledge gradient (KG ) approach for application tackling issues seen in current parallel BO approaches, like parallel Expected Improvement (EI ) and group Upper Confidence Bound (UCB ). By optimizing the set of data points together instead of using step by step methods that are solely focused on current gains each time q Knowledge Graph (q KC) shows improved results overall\"\"especially in situations where assessments may be imperfect or unreliable in nature.The research also contrasts q KC with established techniques such as Expected Improvement (EI) Gaussian Process based Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound (GP BUCBs) and Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound with Posterior Estimation (GPUCBsPE) highlighting its benefits in scenarios with and, without noise present. \nAdvantages; \nNew and innovative idea presented in the paper is the introduction of a based acquisition function (known as q Kernel Gaussian process or KG in short form). This represents an advancement from the conventional sequential KG method used in batch Bayesian optimization (BO). The decision theoretic derivation process and the utilization of IPA, for computation appear to be well reasoning and technically robust. \nThe practical tests clearly show that q Knowledge Graph performs better than or matches the methods in both artificial and real life scenarios. Especially, in noisy environments where its superiority is evident. \nThe approach is very useful, for tuning hyperparameters in machine learning\"\"a crucial and resource intensive process.The authors have shared their open source code to improve reproducibility and real world application. \nThe paper is structured nicely. Provides clear explanations of the methodology used in the experiments and the obtained results were detailed well too. The thorough evaluation includes scenarios with and, without noise to give a view of the findings. \nAreas needing improvement; \nWhen discussing the complexity of q Knowledge Graphs (q KGs) the authors highlighted that this method requires more computational resources compared to simpler methods such as parallel Evolutionary Intelligence (EI). This limitation may restrict its effectiveness, in handling high dimensional issues or situations where computing power is scarce. \nDiscretizing the domain for optimizing q KGs might lead to approximation errors, in dimensional spaces as noted by the authors; however including further analysis or exploring alternative strategies for continuous domains would enhance the papers credibility and depth. \nReal world performance benchmarks are limited in the experiments conducted far; while tasks, like optimizing logistic regression and CNN models are addressed to some extent in practical terms introducing more extensive and diverse real world challenges would enhance the credibility and applicability of the approach. \nReasons, in Favor of Approval; \nThe research paper presents a theoretical advancement by expanding knowledge graphs into parallel scenarios and offering a practical implementation that is computationally viable. \nThe practical findings are robust. Show distinct benefits compared to current approaches especially in challenging environments. \nThe approach tackles a world and significant issue in the field of machine learning that could have far reaching implications. \nReasons to Not Agree; \nThe expenses associated with implementing q Knowledge Graphs could hinder its ability to scale effectively in situations involving large datasets or limited resources. \nThe paper doesn't fully delve into all the limitations that arise from relying heavily on domain discretization. \nSuggestion; \nI suggest approving this paper as it offers an well implemented addition to batch Bayesian optimization with solid theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence to support it. Though there are limits, in scalability and domain discretization noted in the studys findings they do not greatly diminish the value and influence of the research. This approach is expected to spark investigations and real world uses in the area. "
