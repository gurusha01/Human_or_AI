Unlike techniques such as [21] which used gradient based optimization without proven convergence guarantees this study introduces two novel approaches. A gradient based method with assurances, from an approximate oracle and a gradient free technique tailored for constrained optimization. The writers use the convergent technique described in [17] to estimate stable distributions and gradients with a focus on maintaining theoretical precision in their work aligns well with the latest progress in optimization methods for machine learning algorithms with a specific emphasis, on ranking models based on graphs. \nAdvantages\nThe paper makes theoretical contributions by offering precise convergence rate assurances for optimization techniques that fill a crucial void, in previous studies. \nInnovation in algorithms is showcased by the gradient technique, for its ability to skip derivative computations and enhance computational efficiency on a larger scale. \nThe methods we suggest have been shown to perform than the latest techniques in terms of ranking accuracy and speed when tested on a real dataset, from Yandex. \nThe findings are clearly presented in the study report and are backed by tests that confirm the advantages claimed. \nThe issue of developing Supervised PageRank models is significant, within the fields of machine learning and information retrieval as it pertains to search engines and social networks in terms. \nAreas where one may not excel much.\nThe theoretical parts are detailed. Might be tough for those not familiar, with advanced optimization methods to follow easily. Simplifying or summarizing key findings could make it easier to understand. \nThe experiments mainly concentrate on one dataset which's quite extensive and reflective of real world scenarios; however including more datasets could enhance the applicability of the results across different scenarios. \nThe paper should elaborate more on the real world implications of choosing between gradient based and gradient free methods, beyond computational complexity and accuracy considerations. \nReasons, in favor of approval\nThe document offers a theoretical advancement by presenting assurances of convergence, for non linear optimization within the framework of Supervised PageRank. \nThe suggested approaches push the boundaries of knowledge in terms of both theoretical depth and practical effectiveness. \nThe project is perfectly aligned with the focus of NIPS as it tackles optimization issues relevant, to real world uses in machine learning. \nReasons to Decline \nThe theoretical parts of the paper could be made easier for a wider range of readers to understand. \nThe experimental validation is solid; however it would be helpful to have datasets to show its reliability. \nSuggestion\n\"I suggest accepting this paper for its insights into optimization theory and practical enhancements in ranking tasks that enrich the conference content.. I would advise the authors to enhance the clarity of the theoretical parts and broaden the experimental analysis, in upcoming versions.\""
