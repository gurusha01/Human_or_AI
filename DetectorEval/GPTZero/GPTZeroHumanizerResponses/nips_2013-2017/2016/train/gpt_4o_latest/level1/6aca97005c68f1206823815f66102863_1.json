            "inputText": "This study presents a method for making likelihood free inferences through Bayesian conditional density estimation to overcome challenges associated with Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques (ABC). The researchers suggest using neural networks to learn a parametric representation of the posterior instead of relying on sample based approximations, in traditional ABC methods. By utilizing simulation data to improve the approximation iteratively in their approach reduces the number of simulations needed compared to conventional ABC methods significantly. The study showcases how effective the method is through experiments involving simple tasks as well as more intricate models such as Lotka Volterra and M/G/l queue models in addition to Bayesian linear regression and toy problems. Their findings indicate that the suggested approach surpasses ABC regarding precision and effectiveness in situations, with limited or non Gaussian distributions. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper presents a technical advancement by introducing a parametric method for likelihood free inference that focuses on the precise posterior distribution rather, than an estimate or approximation of it\"\"a notable enhancement compared to conventional ABC techniques. \nThe suggested approach showcases effectiveness by needing significantly fewer simulations compared to ABC methods.The iterative enhancement of the proposal is notably original and efficient. \nThe paper is nicely. Has a logical flow to it.The authors explain the methodology clearly. Back it up, with detailed algorithms and theoretical reasoning. \nThe experiments conducted are thorough. Thoughtfully planned out to encompass various scenarios ranging from basic to intricate models.The outcomes effectively showcase the benefits of the suggested approach compared to ABC baseline methods. \nThe project tackles an issue in simulation based modeling and could have a significant influence on areas such, as biology, ecology and physics which heavily rely on likelihood free inference methods. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe paper shows promise. Lacks thorough exploration of possible drawbacks, like handling very complex parameter spaces or the impact of neural network architecture choices. \nThe authors mention studies in their paper but could provide a more thorough comparison for better clarity and understanding of how their proposed method fares against recent developments, in synthetic likelihood or Bayesian optimization ABC techniques. \nThe authors have shared the code in their paper; however adding specific information, about hyperparameter configurations and computational expenses would improve the reproducibility of their study. \nReasons, in favor of approval; \nThe report introduces an well founded method that pushes forward the current standards in inference without relying on likelihood measurements. \nThe findings are quite convincing as they show enhancements, in precision and productivity compared to current approaches. \nThe project has a range of uses and meets an urgent requirement, in the field. \nReasons to Not Agree; \nThe paper should delve deeper into its limitations. Offer more comparisons with other methods, in the field. \nThe ability to handle problems across multiple dimensions continues to be a topic of ongoing discussion, in the field. \nSuggestion; \n I suggest approving this paper as it makes contributions to likelihood free inference and the proposed approach could impact both theoretical studies and real world applications positively; though the authors should take into account the noted shortcomings, in the final draft to enhance the paper further.
