The authors tackle issues in exemplar based learning like the imbalance between one positive example and many negatives and the challenges with relationships between samples and softmax loss in this specific scenario.The new approach suggests a clique centered optimization framework that clusters samples into tight groups while spreading conflicting connections, across various sets of data. These groups are utilized to teach a CNN through sorting tasks so that the network can grasp indirect connections and apply commonalities to new information effectively. The method is tested using three datasets. Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports and PASCAL VOC 2007. Showcasing strong results, in analyzing postures estimating poses and classifying objects. \nThe article expands upon research in exemplar based learning like Exemplar SVMs and Exemplar CNNs but focuses on improving their computational effectiveness and ability to represent transitive relationships better too! Additionally the authors compare these approaches with similarity learning methods like two stream architectures and ranking losses to showcase the benefits of their unsupervised technique which is quite innovative! The proposed optimization framework for batch selection and refining similarities iteratively, through CNN training are remarkable additions that push the boundaries of unsupervised similarity learning. \nAdvantages\nThe paper presents an approach, to unsupervised similarity learning using a clique based optimization framework that tackles important shortcomings found in current methods. \nThe suggested approach is backed by theoretical foundations and practical evidence.Adequate attention has been given to formulating the optimization issue and explaining the training procedure in a straightforward manner. \nThe method is extensively tested on datasets and shows notable enhancements compared to standard techniques and comparable results with advanced methods, in practice. \nThe paper is well structured. Offers enough information for reproducibility, with a GitHub link provided for the implementation. \nSignificance speaking of it has a wide reach when it comes to computer vision tasks like analyzing postures or estimating poses and classifying objects; it tackles the real world hurdle of picking up knowledge from data that doesn't come with labels. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe authors argue that even though they say the computational expenses are lower than those of pairwise or triplet based approaches in their research work, on selecting batches of data it still poses a problem since it falls under NP hard and using the CCC algorithm might restrict its scalability when dealing with exceptionally large datasets. \nThe paper touches upon instances of failure in pose estimation. It lacks an, in depth examination of the constraints or potential biases associated with the suggested approach. \nIn addition to comparing the method with baseline approaches in the evaluation process as mentioned earlier on in the text discussion; it would be beneficial to include comparisons with newer unsupervised techniques, like contrastive learning or self supervised methods to enhance the assessment further. \nThe technique is mainly tested on tasks and does not delve into its potential use in other areas like text or audio processing; this lack of exploration may constrain its overall effectiveness, across various fields. \nReasons to Support \nThe article talks about an significant issue, in unsupervised learning and presents a fresh and technically solid solution. \nThe method suggested shows real world outcomes across various datasets and tasks and exhibits noticeable enhancements compared to standard approaches. \nThe research aligns well with studies and pushes the boundaries of exemplar based learning to new heights, in innovation. \nReasons to Not Agree\nThe optimization frameworks ability to scale to large datasets is not adequately discussed. \nThe assessment might be improved with references, to unsupervised learning techniques and a more thorough examination of instances where it did not succeed as expected. \nSuggestion\nIn general this paper provides insights into the realm of unsupervised similarity learning and would be a great fit, for presenting at NIPS. Though there are areas that could be enhanced in terms of scalability and more extensive assessment the merits of the study surpass its drawbacks. I suggest accepting it. "
