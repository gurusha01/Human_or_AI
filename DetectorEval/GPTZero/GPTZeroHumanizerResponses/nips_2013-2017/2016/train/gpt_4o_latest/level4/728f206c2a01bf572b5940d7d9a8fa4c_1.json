            "inputText": "The research paper presents a technique for teaching RBMs using a modified form of Wasserstein distance known as \\( W{\\gamma}(hat { p } p{\\theta}) \\)(equations 3 and 4) where \\( \\hat { p }\\ ) stands for distribution and \\( p {\\theta } \\ ) represents model information. The writers calculate gradients of \\( W{\\gamma}(hat { p } p{\\theta}) \\ ). Enhance model performance, through gradient descent optimization. The example of Gaussian shrinkage in section 4 is a cause for concern regarding the reliability of Wasserstein based training discussed earlier in section 4 well. It is crucial to examine this matter before considering the paper suitable, for publication as it is highlighted that statistical consistency is referenced in [source]. Unexpectedly in section 4 there are reports of zero shrinkage even when \\( \\gamma = 0 \\).When using a normal distribution with mean \\( N ( 00 I ) \\) why does this happen ? Inconsistency would be an issue, in establishing a statistical learning standard. Furthermore in section 3 ( Stability and KL regularization ) the writers claim that regularization based on the KL divergence is vital when working with sample points \\( \\hat(p){ÃŽÂ¸ } \\) which compromises the \"cleanliness \" of the Wasserstein objective function. \nThe tests in section 4 were carried out using a subset of the UCI PLANTS dataset called MNIST small (consisting of the 0 class from MNIST) along, with 28 dimensional binary codes known as MNIST code. The findings presented in lines 168 to 172 and Figures 3 and 4 indicate the creation of \" contiguous regions that represent typical real world distributions but exhibit less diversity compared to the actual dataset.\" This observation echoes my concern (highlighted by the Gaussian example in section 4.3) emphasizing the importance of minimizing the smoothed variations. The Wasserstein distance does not provide a density estimator according to the authors in section 3. In that section of the paper the authors try to portray these limitations as attributes when dealing with tasks, like data completion or noise reduction. \nKudos to the writers for delving into a new approach to training RBMs that differs from the usual KL based methods!. There's a worrisome question raised in section 4 regarding the Gaussian shrinkage example and its impact, on Wasserstein based training consistency\"\"a critical matter that requires thorough attention before this paper can be deemed fit for publication. \nAdditional factors to consider; \nThe title seems general; the paper actually delves into the training of restricted Boltzman Machines. \nRBMs are not limited to inputs alone; a good example is Exponential Family Harmonium (https;//papers.nips.cc/paper /2672 exponential family harmonium with an application, to information retrieval.pdf). \nFigure 5 would be easier to understand if it used colors for the different \\( \\gamma \\) values and if the last entry was labeled as \\( \\gamma = 0 \\) instead of referring to OpenCV. Furthermore the text should provide an explanation of how OpenCV is being utilized. \nI have completed the task. Here is the paraphrased text; \nREBUTTING COMMENTS POSTING \nUpon examining the authors\" response and the comments from reviewers I have decided to retract my assertion of a \"fatal error \" as the limited sample size, in the experiments outlined in section 4 seems to clarify some of the problems that were noticed. Nevertheless my apprehensions persist. In the KL based Gaussian experiment where a Gaussian with covariance matrix \\( \\theta^2 I \\) fitting to \\( n = 100 \\) samples drawn from a 10 Gaussian the maximum likelihood estimates of \\( \\theta \\) tend to range between 0. 95 And 105 over, around 10 repetitions. In comparison to that when using the Wasserstein estimator with \\( \\gamma \\)=0) it seems like the value of \\( \\theta \\) as observed from Figure 5 on the left visually estimated to be 0.65 The rate at which \\( \\theta \\). Converges according to the authors information is considered sluggish for this uncomplicated issue. Characterized as \\( O(n^{ 3/11} )\\) and overall progresses at a rate of \\( O(n^{ 2/( D + 2 )})\\), with D dimensional information. There are worries regarding how feasible the suggested approach is in real world scenarios. It would be beneficial to conduct an examination of this straightforward Gaussian scenario to illustrate how the parameter \\( \\theta \\) which minimizes \\( W_0 \\) changes with \\( n \\). The slow convergence pace implies that the procedure will progress laboriously. Could the authors clarify what causes the bias towards shrinkage, in this situation? \nIn their reply to Reviewer 5 the authors mentioned that incorporating an entropy regularizer contributes to creating an effect as depicted in Fig 5 for true W distance measurement. This implies that employing a KL matching criterion (\\( KL(\\hat{p} \"\" p_{\\theta}) \\)) along with an entropy penalty (sans Wasserstein consideration) could yield clustering outcomes as well. Section 4 point 4 elaborates on how this clustering effect can be beneficial for tasks, like data completion and denoising. Considering that KL regularization has already been implemented in section 3 it is probable that this clustering phenomenon is evident, in several of the experiments regardless. \nMy sentiments align with those of reviewers who pointed out the lack of clarity, in the technical explanations and proposed incorporating additional materials to improve understanding. \nUltimately I lean towards not supporting the approval of this paper (though I could accept it to some extent). Even though the work presents concepts it's crucial to clearly explain and separate the origin of the clustering effect (whether from the Wasserstein distance or the entropic prior). My hunch is that certain assertions linked to Wasserstein training might actually stem from the entropic instead. This differentiation should be elucidated by contrasting the suggested approach, with a baseline incorporating KL divergence and an entropic prior. "
