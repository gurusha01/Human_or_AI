The researchers suggest a procedure for conducting this analysis through a breakdown technique that involves determining orthogonal foundations for the Krylov matrix, within RKHS and decomposing the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator projected onto the space defined by these foundations. The algorithm breaks down the dynamics into a number of patterns that serve as a method for extracting features, in nonlinear dynamical systems. \nThe paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the background and purpose of the study by the authors.The technical parts are also well structured. Explained in detail about the new algorithm suggested and its relation to previously used methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The real world examples and practical uses shared in the paper show how effective the new approach is, in estimating Koopman modes and forecasting states of nonlinear dynamical systems. \nThe papers strong points are; \nA new method is being suggested for analyzing the spectrum of dynamic systems by utilizing the Koopman operator, in RKHS frameworks. \nDeveloping a decomposition algorithm for conducting such analysis is crucial, in this context. \nThe presentation of real life examples and practical instances showcasing the success of the suggested method. \nThe papers shortcomings are as follows; \nThe document expects the reader to have knowledge of the Koopman operator and RKHS technicalities which might pose challenges for individuals lacking expertise, in the subject matter. \nThe document would be improved by providing a thorough examination of different approaches, such as DMD and various spectral analysis methods that are already, in use. \nThe real world instances and uses showcased in the document are quite basic. Might not fully showcase the effectiveness of the suggested method. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article introduces an creative method, for analyzing the spectra of nonlinear dynamic systems. \nThe algorithm suggested is compelling and could be useful, in different scenarios. \nThe practical instances and real life scenarios showcased in the document show how well the suggested method works. \nReasons to oppose; \nThe article could be too complex. Might expect the reader to have a lot of prior knowledge. \nThe paper would be improved by conducting a thorough examination of the pros and cons of the suggested method as the current comparison, with other methods is lacking in depth. \nThe practical instances and uses highlighted in the document seem basic and may not showcase the complete effectiveness of the suggested method. \nIn my opinion I would suggest approving the paper with some adjustments to tackle the issues raised earlier The paper holds promise for making an impact, on the study of nonlinear dynamical systems and spectral analysis With a few tweaks it could become even more robust \nRating of 8 out of 10, for quality.\nThe article is nicely written with an introduction that explains the background and purpose of the study clearly and succinctly . The technical parts are well structured as well as, with a comprehensive explanation of the new algorithm and how it relates to other methods already in use . \nThe clarity of the text is rated at 8 out of 10.\nThe article is nicely structured with an straightforward introduction to the context and purpose of the study; nonetheless it presupposes that the audience already has knowledge of the Koopman operator and RKHS technicalities which could pose challenges, for those not well versed in these areas. \nThe uniqueness of the content is rated at 9 out of 10. \nThe research paper introduces an innovative method for examining the spectral characteristics of nonlinear dynamic systems by utilizing the Koopman operator, in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).\nThe importance is rated at 8 out of 10.\nThe research paper could have an impact, on the study of complex dynamic systems and spectral analysis as the suggested method seems well thought out and likely to have broad usage potential.
