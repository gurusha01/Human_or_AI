The authors offer assurances regarding the speed of convergence and the complexity boundaries for both techniques. The gradient free approach uses an optimization framework, without gradients and an approximate oracle; meanwhile the gradient based technique relies on an adaptive projected gradient algorithm with an approximate first order oracle. \nThe article is nicely. Offers a comprehensive summary of the issue at hand as well as the suggested approaches and the theoretical examination presented within its pages.The writers also share their findings by contrasting their strategies with the leading gradient based method available today.They demonstrate that their approaches surpass the method in terms of the loss function. \nThe paper has strong points, such, as; \nTwo novel optimization techniques have been suggested for solving the linear loss minimization issue associated with training Supervised PageRank models. \n Ensuring there are theoretical assurances regarding how quickly they converge and the level of complexity involved in both approaches. \nThe results from the experiments indicate that the new techniques perform better, than the leading method. \nThe papers limitations are as follows; \nThe paper suggests that the loss function is likely to be convex, near the solution but acknowledges that this assumption may not hold true in all cases. \nThe paper doesn't include a comparison to optimization techniques, like stochastic gradient descent or quasi newton methods. \nThe findings from the experiment are only applicable to the dataset used and may not be applicable to other datasets, in general. \nThe paper is nicely. Offers a valuable addition to the optimization and machine learning domain.The suggested approaches show promise in enhancing the effectiveness of search engines and various other applications dependent, on Supervised PageRank models. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe document suggests two optimization techniques that have been proven to ensure a speedy convergence rate and manageable complexity limits. \nThe results of the experiment demonstrate that the new techniques are more effective than the existing method available, on the market. \nThe article is nicely. Offers a thorough explanation of the issue and the suggested approaches. \nReasons to agree with; \nThe document suggests that the loss function is convex in a range, around the best solution but acknowledges that this may not always hold true. \nThe paper lacks a comparison, with alternative optimization techniques. \nThe findings, from the experiment are constrained to a dataset and may not apply broadly to other datasets. \nThe quality of the content is rated at 8 out of 10.\nThe clarity of the information provided is impressive scoring a 9 out of 10.\nThe level of uniqueness is an 8, out of 10.\nThe importance of this is rated at 8 out of 10. \nThe total rating is 8, out of 10. \nSuggestion for approval with adjustments is advised for the authors to tackle the shortcomings of the document by including a comparison, with alternative optimization techniques and deliberating on the constraints of the test outcomes. Furthermore they should contemplate offering specifics regarding how the suggested approaches are put into practice and the computational capacities needed. "
