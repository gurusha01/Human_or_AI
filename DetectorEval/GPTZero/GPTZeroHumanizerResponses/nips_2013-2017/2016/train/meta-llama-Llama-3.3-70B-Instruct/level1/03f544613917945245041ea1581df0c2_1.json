            "inputText": "This study introduces an algorithm named Stochastic Gradient Richardson Romberg Langevin Dynamics (SGRRLD) as part of the Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG MCMC). The goal is to minimize bias in SG MCMC techniques while maintaining an acceptable level of variance by employing the Richardson Romberg extrapolation method that runs two chains simultaneously with varying step sizes. The writers offer a theoretical examination of SGRRLDs that covers its long term accuracy guarantee and statistical properties like the central limit theorem and error bounds, for bias and mean squared errors. \nThe authors have done a job in writing the paper and offering a thorough explanation of the new algorithm along with its theoretical analysis.The tests conducted on both real data show that SGRRLDis successful, in mitigating bias and enhancing convergence rates when compared with current SG MCMC techniques. \nThe papers advantages are as follows; \nA new SG MCMC algorithm has been suggested to tackle the bias problem found in methods.\nAfter examining the algorithms theoretical aspects and considering both its long term and short term characteristics.\nI'm sharing some tests we did on both real data to show how well the algorithm works.\nThe paper has a shortcomings, such, as; \nRunning two chains simultaneously could lead to computational expenses, for the algorithm.\nIn real world scenarios adjusting the step sizes and mini batch sizes might need calibration.\nThe article would be improved with exploration of how the suggested algorithm could be used and its constraints.\nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article introduces an theoretically sound approach to tackling a major problem, in SG MCMC techniques.\nThe tests showed that the algorithm works well in reducing bias and speeding up convergence rates.\nThe article is nicely. Offers a thorough and coherent description of the suggested algorithm along, with its theoretical examination.\nReasons to oppose it; \nThe algorithm might cost more in terms of computation compared to methods because it requires running two chains simultaneously. \nThe paper would be improved by including elaboration, on the possible uses and constraints of the suggested algorithm. \nIn real world situations adjusting step sizes and mini batch sizes may need attention to detail which could pose challenges, in certain cases. \nI suggest approving the paper because it introduces an well founded algorithm that tackles a major problem, in SG MCMC methods and shows its effectiveness through experimental tests. Though I recommend the authors to delve into discussing the possible uses and constraints of the algorithm and find ways to lower computational expenses and enhance its usability. "
