The decompositions that emerge clearly outline brain structures in the functional images and surpass cutting edge models in terms of interpretability and capturing variations, between individuals. \nThe paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the issue at hand as well as the related research and contributions made by the authors The method they propose is detailed thoroughly with well designed experiments that are extensively evaluated The outcomes show how effective the Smooth SOD method is in extracting structured and cleaned up dictionaries that can capture inter subject variability, in small medium and large scale scenarios much better \nThe positive aspects of the document are; \nA new and efficient approach has been suggested for learning dictionaries, with spatial organization to overcome a key drawback of current methods. \nIn depth testing of the technique with trials, on a sizable public database showcases its effectiveness compared to cutting edge models. \nA brief analysis of how choosing hyperparameters affects the issue is crucial for those, in the field. \nThe paper has some drawbacks, such, as; \nWhile the methods computational demands are generally modest, in size; they could pose a challenge when dealing with large datasets. \nChoosing hyperparameters can be a task even with all the research done on the topic; it often needs precise adjustments, in real world applications. \nThe absence of a comparison with techniques that take spatial organization into account is notable, in this context; for instance TV 'l minimization could offer valuable perspectives on the efficacy of the suggested approach. \nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe research paper introduces an efficient approach, to learning dictionaries online with spatial organization that tackles a notable drawback of current methods. \nExtensive experiments, on a public dataset have thoroughly assessed the approach and showcased its superiority compared to existing cutting edge models. \nThe report offers an analysis of how selecting hyperparameters influences the issue at hand\"\"an important consideration for those, in the field. \nSupporting points, in favor of acceptance; \nThe computational demands of the method could potentially pose a challenge when dealing with datasets. \nIn real world situations tuning hyperparameters might be necessary. \nThe papers impact might be restricted due to the absence of comparison, with methods that consider spatial structure. \nIn my opinion I suggest approving this paper because it presents an efficient approach to online dictionary learning with spatial structure, which tackles a major drawback of current methods. The comprehensive. Succinct examination of hyper parameter selection position the paper as a valuable addition, to the field."
