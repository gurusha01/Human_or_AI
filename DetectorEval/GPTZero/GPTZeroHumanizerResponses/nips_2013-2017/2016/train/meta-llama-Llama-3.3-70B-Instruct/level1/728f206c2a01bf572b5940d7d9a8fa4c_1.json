Display its real world promise in tasks, like data restoration and noise reduction.The manuscript is nicely crafted with explained concepts. \nThe papers advantages are as follows; \nA fresh idea has emerged for machines with a different objective function that considers the distance, between observations instead of the usual Kullback Leibler divergence. \nDeriving the slope of the Wasserstein distance in relation to the model parameters is an element, in making this approach feasible. \nWe showcased how the method works in real world scenarios using datasets, like MNIST and UCI PLANTS to demonstrate its potential. \nThe papers shortcomings are as follows; \nThe use of the Sinkhorn algorithm, for calculating the Wasserstein distance may not be as effective when dealing with datasets. \nCareful adjustment of hyperparameters is essential; this includes tuning the smoothing parameter γ as well, as the regularization coefficients λ and θ. \nUnderstanding the connection between the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback Leibler divergence can be challenging when deciding which objective to choose in scenarios due to the ambiguity, in their relationship. \nPoints supporting acceptance; \nThe research suggests an captivating method for educating Boltzman machines considering the distance between data points, in its training process. \nThe method has proven effective on datasets such, as MNIST and UCI PLANTS. \nThe paper is nicely crafted with presentation of ideas. \nReasons, in favor of acceptance; \nThe method depends on the Sinkhorn algorithm. It might not work well for big datasets. \nUsing hyperparameters requires adjustments, which can pose challenges when applying this approach, in real world scenarios. \nHaving a grasp of how the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback Leibler divergence are related could pose challenges when deciding between the two objectives, in real life scenarios. \nIn my opinion the research paper makes an addition to the domain of machine learning and should be approved for publication. The method outlined in the paper shows promise in enhancing the effectiveness of Boltzmann machines across tasks; furthermore the practical application of this method, on real datasets is quite compelling. Nevertheless the paper could be enhanced by tackling the identified shortcomings like depending on the Sinkhorn algorithm and ensuring adjustment of hyperparameters.  \nThe level of quality is rated at 8 out of 10.\nThe paper is nicely written with presentation of ideas. The innovative and engaging approach suggested in the paper is backed up by convincing demonstrations using real world datasets. Nevertheless the paper could benefit from addressing the mentioned shortcomings. \nThe clarity of the text is excellent scoring a 9 out of 10.\nThe document is nicely structured with presentation of ideas, throughout its contents.The notation remains uniform. The equations are neatly formatted for better comprehension.The document flows smoothly for readers to grasp the concepts promptly. \nThe uniqueness score is 9, out of 10.\nThe paper introduces a method for training Boltamann machines that considers the distance between data points.There is a shift from the conventional Kullback Leibler divergence in this approach and its application, on actual datasets is quite persuasive. \nThe importance level is rated at 8 out of 10.\nThe study shows promise in enhancing the efficiency of machines across various tasks, with its innovative and intriguing approach demonstrated effectively on real world datasets; however addressing the noted weaknesses could further enhance its quality.
