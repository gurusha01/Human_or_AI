            "inputText": "The manuscript introduces a method for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) using a modified Wasserstein distance called $ W{\\gamma}( \\hat { p } p{\\ theta } ) $ (equations 3 and 4). In this context $\\hat { p } $ corresponds to real world distribution while $ p{\\ theta } $ denotes model distribution The authors have calculated derivatives of $ W{\\gamma}( \\hat { p } p_{ \\theta }) $ and utilized gradient descent, in their training approach. The decrease noted in the Gaussian illustration discussed in section 4; 4 raises questions about the reliability of the Wasserstein training approach and requires thorough examination before considering the manuscript ready, for publication. \nThe writers mention a source [4] that is said to demonstrate the reliability of the technique used in the studys framework; however its puzzling to see non zero shrinkage in section 4 for the basic scenario of modeling a standard normal distribution with another normal distribution having a covariance matrix of $\\sigma^5 I$. This contradiction raises concerns as a lack of consistency could be an issue, in shaping a statistical learning standard. \nIn the section of the paper or article discussed by the authors involves talking about how making the smoothed Wasserstein objective function stable and adding KL regularization to it is necessary, for learning from samples according to them; however they highlight that this regularization affects the original essence or purity of the smoothed Wasserstein objective function. In the tests carried out in section 4 with the MNIST dataset and a portion of the UCI PLANTS dataset using 28 dimensional binary codes resulted in outcomes (as detailed in lines 168 to 172 and illustrated in figures 3 and 4). The results show \" continuous areas that represent typical real distribution but with less variation, than the actual data.\" These discoveries emphasize the uncertainty that reducing the Wasserstein distance could not necessarily result in a reliable density estimator. \nSection 4 of the document discusses how the authors try to see these shortcomings as advantages when it comes to filling in missing data or reducing noise levels in the information provided. Although the authors are praised for looking into an approach than the usual KL based training method for RBMs the reduction seen in the Gaussian instance mentioned in section 5 brings up significant doubts about how reliable the Wasserstein training technique is. This issue needs to be looked into before considering this manuscript, for publishing. \nSome other important things to consider are the title of the manuscript; it might be overstating things by focusing on the training of restricted Boltzmann machines. The introduction inaccurately claims that RBMs are limited to visible units when there are examples, like Exponential Family Harmonium that prove otherwise. It would be helpful to use colors in Figure 5 to show different values of $\\gamma$ and the final entry should say $\\gamma=0 instead of OpenCV. Perhaps clarifying that computations were done using OpenCV could enhance the text. \nAfter reviewing the counterargument raised on and reconsideration of the claim of a significant error in the research findings has led to a reassessment recognizing that the limited number of participants, in the studies highlighted in section 4 may have influenced the conflicting results observed. In contrast to the KL version of the test where a Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix of $\\theta^2 I $ is matched to 100 samples drawn from a 10 Gaussian distribution the maximum likelihood estimator gives results for $\\theta $ ranging from 0.95 to 1.05 while the Wasserstein estimator (with $\\gamma=0 $ ) produces an estimated value of, about $\\theta=0.65 $.The slowing rate of convergence at $ O(n^{ \\frac{10}{11}})$ for this issue is worrisome and hints at the methods lack of practicality prompting further research on how the optimal $\\theta$ minimizing $ W_{\\text{zero}}$ changes with $ n$. This investigation could shed light on the bias, towards shrinkage in a meaningful way. \nThe feedback given to reviewer 5 about lines 177 178 implies that the inclusion of the entropy regularizer leads to an impact similar to what is shown in figure 5 for the actual Wasserstein distance measurement graphed there. This prompts consideration as to whether applying a KL matching criterion with an entropy penalty (excluding Wassserstein elements) could result in clustering effects; this possibility is explored in section 4.4 which delves into the benefits of grouping data for tasks, like completion and noise reduction. It is suggested to include resources to enhance the clarity of technical descriptions since the existing presentation seems lacking in effectiveness. Although the paper introduces intriguing findings about the clumping effect phenomenon it is crucial to provide a coherent explanation and analysis on whether this effect stems from the Wasserstein distance or the entropic prior. Moreover the assertions concerning Wasserstein training must be meticulously examined in comparison, with a construction involving KL + entropic prior. "
