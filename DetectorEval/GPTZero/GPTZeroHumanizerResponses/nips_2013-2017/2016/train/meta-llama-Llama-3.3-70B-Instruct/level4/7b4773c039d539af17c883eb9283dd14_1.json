            "inputText": "This paper introduces a new planning algorithm called TrailBlazer that utilizes Monte Carlo methods and relies on having a model of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). TrailBlazer aims to calculate the value function of the initial state (V(s0)) By reducing the number of times the generative model needs to be accessed It is capable of handling both finite and infinite state spaces in scenarios, with discounted rewards.  \nThe paper discusses theoretical assurances for TrailBlazer such as Probabilistically Approximately Correct (PAC) consistency and limits on the number of calls to the generative model, for both finite and infinite state spaces. TrailBlazers assurances showcase its ability to surpass extreme cases in specific situations (such as finite state spaces with random dynamics) align with current findings in other cases (such as fixed dynamics or situations, without control) or provide fresh perspectives particularly for infinite state spaces. \nTrailBlazers way of working includes switching between two types of nodes known as Avg and Max nodes. The Avg node determines the value of its children using transition probabilities and acts like a Monte Carlo estimator. The parameter m plays a role in regulating the variance of this estimator. On the hand the Max nodes goal is to find the child node, with the highest value by eliminating nodes that are unlikely to achieve that maximum value probabilistically. \nThe paper is impressive for presenting an algorithm that has great potential for use in different areas of study. TrailBlazer not has a solid theoretical foundation in terms of consistency but also provides more robust assurances than current knowledge. Especially in scenarios involving generative models and stochastic systems with limited state spaces. While the manuscript is written overall it could benefit from clearer explanations to show why TrailBlazer surpasses other methods. Even though the induction based proofs, on the tree structure are complex they enhance the sophistication of the paper. \nThere are a few things that need explanation or thought;  \nThe assurance outlined in Theorem 3 raises the inquiry of whether there exist constraints that hinder a more robust guarantee. \nThe current algorithm doesn't take advantage of patterns, in the value function like smoothness does in the StoSO algorithm approach to see if it can improve performance is a valuable exploration to undertake. \nIn cases where there are differences in actions to take place and these differences depend on the current state of affairs significantly like Farahmands study suggests in relation, to how effective and applicable TrailBlazer is. \nSection 3 of the document could use some details to clearly compare how other algorithms calculate bias and variance differently, from the approach taken by TrailBlazer. \nSeveral mistakes in spelling and formatting were identified in lines such as L81,L84,L220,L229 and L472 along with the inconsistent portrayal of \\Delta, in Appendix D. \nThe research paper brings insights to the field by introducing an innovative algorithm supported by strong theoretical foundations and proposing opportunities, for enhancing both theory and real world implementation further refining the manuscript for better clarity and ease of understanding will enhance its impact.
