            "inputText": "This research paper introduces two algorithms called SGD BB and SVRG BB that use the Barzilai Borwein (BB) technique for dynamically determining step sizes in stochastic gradient descent (SG D) and stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) approaches without the need for manual tuning or reliance on diminishing schedules. By integrating the BB method these algorithms can adapt step sizes on the fly. Achieve results that are as good as or better, than manually adjusted methods. The writers offer assurances such as linear convergence for SVRG BB on strongly convex goals and showcase practical tests showing the effectiveness of their techniques, in logistic regression and SVM assignments. \nAdvantages;**\nThe paper introduces an approach by applying the BB method to stochastic optimization instead of using conventional step size strategies.The automated calculation of step sizes is seen as an practical addition, to the field. \nThe authors have provided evidence of the gradual progress of SVRG BB and have also filled the gap by verifying the convergence of SVRG I that was previously missing in action; all in all enhancing our grasp on variance reduced methods, from a theoretical perspective. \nImportance; The suggested approaches remove the requirement for manual adjustment of step sizes, which is a tedious and mistake prone task in real world scenarios. The trials show that SGD BB and SVRG BB deliver results that are equal or superior to the performing methods, with optimally adjusted step sizes. \nThe authors thoroughly assess their techniques using used datasets and measure them against established benchmarks, in the field. The outcomes demonstrate reliability as the BB based techniques dynamically converge towards optimal step sizes. \nThe paper is nicely. Provides thorough explanations of the algorithms along with theoretical analysis and experimental findings included in a thoughtful manner to improve stability by incorporating smoothing techniques, for SGD BB. \nAreas needing improvement; \nThe experiments in the paper are persuasive. Have a narrow focus since they only cover a limited number of datasets and tasks like logistic regression and SVM models being tested out. To enhance the validity of the claims made in the paper trying out a variety of machine learning problems such, as deep learning or non linear optimization would be beneficial.\nSensitivity Assessment;The authors suggest that the techniques are not significantly impacted by step sizes; however conducting a thorough sensitivity evaluation, across various scenarios would enhance overall certainty. \nThe calculation of the BB step size adds workload when compared to using fixed step size techniques; although the creators argue that the expense is minimal a detailed review of the runtime overhead could be valuable. \nThe paper could provide context to its contributions by mentioning recent developments in adaptive step size techniques, like Adam or AdaGrad and comparing them to the BB approach. \nSuggestion; \nAdvantages, for Approval; \n A new and useful addition to determining step sizes, in stochastic optimization methods. \nSolid theoretical. Thorough examination. \nThe proposed techniques show empirical evidence of their efficacy, in real world applications. \nDownsides to Consider; \nThe experiments scope was. There was a lack of analysis, during runtime. \nThe exploration of connections, to adaptive methods is lacking. \nThis paper adds value to the area of optimization and would be a good fit for presentation, at NIPS conference. I suggest accepting it and recommend including experiments and comparing runtimes in future research. "
