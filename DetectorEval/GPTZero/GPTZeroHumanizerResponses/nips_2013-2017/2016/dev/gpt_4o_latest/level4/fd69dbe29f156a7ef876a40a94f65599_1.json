            "inputText": "The study presents a method that utilizes several layers of reasoning to enhance question representations by analyzing the image iteratively. Each reasoning layer consists of two elements; the Question to image interaction is carried out through a multilayer perceptron that processes the question representation from the previous layer and the image representation. The second element involves weighted pooling to combine the revised representations from the Question, to image interaction using attention weights determined through backpropagation. The model uses object suggestions to pinpoint image areas by utilizing a convolutional neural network, for encoding purposes.The encoded image attributes then engage with the question representations. Employ a gentle attention mechanism to calculate an attention spread across the image regions. \nThe strengths lie in the simple expansion or blending of current concepts such as the \"Neural Reasoner,\" spatial coordinates invention by R.Hu et al. And the soft attention mechanism, by K.Xu et al. The paper is nicely. Easy to understand with a clear explanation of the models structure and its various components; the image understanding layer question encoding layer reasoning layer and answering layer. The unique approach of refining the question representation using the image stands out as a highlight in this work since it hasn't been seen in previous VQA systems making a strong contribution, to the paper. \nThe paper points out a weakness in Section 3. 1 Regarding the lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of adding an 8 dimensional spatial representation for object locations in improving the models performance in understanding spatial relationships, between object proposals. \nIn Section 4 of the paper (starting at line 209) it discusses how the proposed model differs from SAN by concentrating on object proposal regions likely to be objects for improved performance on questions related to objects. Furthermore (line 216) a similar pattern is seen in the VQA dataset with enhancements in questions categorized as \"Other.\" However the findings, in Table 3 do not seem to back up this assertion. The model being suggested does better than SAN for Yes or No queries. Falters with the \"Other\" category questions which is quite concerning because there isn't any solid quantitative proof to support the models effectiveness, in addressing these miscellaneous questions. \nThe suggested model seems to be based on the \"Neural Reasoner,\" as outlined by B.Peng in arxiv in 2015. With enhancements incorporating images and an attention mechanism which somewhat diminishes its originality. \n rebuttal Remarks; The progress highlighted in the rebuttal is a step in the right direction; however it does not showcase any new capabilities of the model. It is probable that other models could also see improvements, by refining the representation (if we interpret \"achieving better outcomes through initial learning adjustments\") as suggested in the statement. The two points discussed in lines 43 to 46 of the document appear to have some constraints; \nIteratively refining the representation of inquiries is akin to a referenced study. Tailored to visual content instead of text based data like in ImageNet classification tasks. The research paper lacks studies that isolate the advantages of this method through comparisons with other established frameworks like Self Attentive Network (SAN) or models employing singular or dual attention mechanisms on image attributes. Consequently it remains uncertain how significant this contribution truly is. The evaluation of existing works falls short as variations in results may be influenced by conditions rather than the intrinsic effectiveness of the model particularly when considering the modest improvements, in performance. \nObject proposals are not a concept and have already been investigated in reference [23]. \nThe paper should be rejected due, to its lack of originality and only minimal enhancements compared to existing research well as the absence of necessary ablation experiments.
