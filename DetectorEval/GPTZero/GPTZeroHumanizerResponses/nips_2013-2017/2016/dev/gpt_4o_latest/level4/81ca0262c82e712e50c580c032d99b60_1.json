Regrettably,'causalit'y is a term that carries ambiguity since it can denote two ideas that need to be distinctly defined (and this differentiation should be clearly addressed in the written work). The primary notion of causality involves predicting a series of events based on interconnected events while upholding the temporal sequence—a characteristic that qualifies it as causative. For instance if you have a collection of time series data a common inquiry could be which series has the predictive power over another in the subsequent time step viewed as a way to assess causality. This methodology reflects the papers emphasis on pinpoint the k predictors and engaging in \"causal\" feature selection. The correlation, between this Granger notion of causality and directed information is fascinating and has been investigated in earlier studies like [20] referenced within this paper. The latest research expands on this concept of causality by referring to it as generalized Granger causality or predictive causality. \nThe second idea of causality. Often seen as the precise definition according to many sources. Deals with counterfactual reasoning and structural equations instead of mere prediction when it comes to understanding the effects of changing X on Y by analyzing the underlying mechanisms or functions that produce the information.. It's important to emphasize in the paper that while accurate time series predictions are valuable for forecasting outcomes based on trends in one variable, over time; they may not offer a picture of how changing one variable could impact another. In short the research paper showcases findings that focus more on forecasting outcomes rather than establishing cause and effect in a hypothetical context. It would be beneficial for the authors to highlight their advancements in submodularity and its estimations in relation to Granger causality. Additionally when discussing the field of causality studies the authors could make reference, to the works of Pearl, Imbens, Rubin and Richardson. \nThe second theorem is quite intriguing. Its proof seems accurate too! Lemma 1 plays a role in illustrating the relaxation of submodularity discussed in this paper (even though its labeled as Lemma 2 in the appendix) and its proof is easily understandable as well. The third theorem and its associated corollaries stand out as the important findings in the paper by introducing a fresh perspective, on submodularity relaxation that doesn't depend on causality or any specific information metric. This distinction definitely deserves to be emphasized more explicitly within the manuscript. \nThe next concern involves the connection between the findings of this paper and the submodularity ratio detailed by Das and Kempe in their research [reference 1]. The paper incorrectly states that the submodularity ratio from reference 1 is solely defined for the R² score; however reference 1 actually presents the submodularity ratio for any set function (as, per Definition 2) later refining it specifically for the R² score as an illustration. In addition to that the result on performance as mentioned in reference [ 03 ] ( also known as Theorem three point two ) expands on the one minus one over e outcome for any set function with a limited submodularity ratio. Although not prominently highlighted in the abstract or introduction of reference [ 03 ] this comprehensive finding is clearly articulated prior, to Theorem three point two. \nOne important point to consider is if certain outcomes mentioned in this document can be seen as extensions of the findings described in Theorem 1 of the cited reference [1]. Specifically Equation (6) which introduces the Submodularity Index (SMI) assesses the discrepancy between adding items individually versus adding them collectively in this paper. In comparison the submodularity ratio discussed in [1] represents the proportion, between these measures. Submodularity suggests that the discrepancy is always positive (as illustrated in Lemma 1 of this document) equating to a ratio of 1 (as mentioned in [reference] ). \nThe submodularity ratio (as defined in reference [^]) should satisfy the condition; the sum of f(x A)s divided by f(S A)s is greater than or equal, to 1. \nFrom the information provided in this paper the inequality sum fx(A) f(S)( A ) is demonstrated. \nThe relaxation mentioned in [3] requires a submodularity ratio than or equal to a constant γ; however this paper explores scenarios where the difference in SMI is negative yet close to zero. By normalizing SMI based on f(S_greedy) in this papers findings there could potentially be a correlation between the two frameworks for general set functions. Nevertheless establish such a connection would not be straightforward and would demand analysis, from the authors. I suggest that the authors delve into discussing how their results may relate to the submodularity ratio framework presented in [ ].The study becomes more complex because it only focuses on functions while this research expands its findings to include both monotone and non monotone functions as well. If this study truly broadens the scope beyond monotonicity compared to the previous one [reference 1] it could have an impact. \nI have some comments to share.\nThe order of the authors should be reversed in reference [2]. \nPropositions 2. 3 Lack clear proofs or seem to be missing. \nThe document has spelling mistakes and grammar errors along with some symbols missing (like ??, in the appendix). For instance; \n Consider two random sequences X raised to the power of n. \n On page 3 they discussed problems related to maximizing information. \n address, in detail \n In this context \"any polynomial algorithm\" can be expressed as a \"polynomial time algorithm.\" \n Monotone submodular functions \n \"We primarily analyze.\" \n \"We can provide reasoning, for its submodularity \" (rephrased for clarity). \n \"On page 4 it mentions 'that, in the literature'.\" \n Several efforts were made to address the issue. \nSuggestion; \nI suggest approving this paper once these concerns have been resolved as the combinatorial optimization findings are quite intriguing— the innovative approach, to submodularity relaxation.
