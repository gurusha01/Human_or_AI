A crucial inquiry arises about whether certain findings in this document follow from Theorem 4 in the reference considering the resemblance, between the Submodularity metric introduced here and the submodularity ratio described in that source. The two ideas basically describe the comparison between adding items versus adding them all together. Submodularity suggests a difference that's more than zero (or a ratio that is equal, to 1). The relaxation discussed in [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) requires a submodularity ratio that's equal or greater than a specific constant gamma value which bears resemblance with the near zero negative SMI difference in this paper; furthermore indicating a tendency towards standardizing SMI divided by f(S_greedy). This observation hints at a direct correlation between the outcomes detailed in [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) for general set functions and the findings presented here. Delving into this analysis can be intricate, as [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) solely delves into functions while our study encompasses both monotone and non monotone functions possibly extending the findings of [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) beyond just monotonicity. \nSome minor suggestions include fixing the author order in reference [3] providing explanations for Propositions 2 and 3 proofs and correcting various typos and grammar mistakes in the document such as changing \"Consider two random process X^n (processes)\" to \"Consider two random processes X^n \" substituting \"directed information maximization > maximization problems \" replacing \"address in details > in detail \" switching \"any polynomial algorithm > polynomial time algorithm \" and ensuring a consistent usage of \"monotone'' instead of \"monotonic'', for submodular functions. While there are some issues to address the findings, in optimization are quite interesting; therefore I suggest accepting the paper with the required revisions. "
