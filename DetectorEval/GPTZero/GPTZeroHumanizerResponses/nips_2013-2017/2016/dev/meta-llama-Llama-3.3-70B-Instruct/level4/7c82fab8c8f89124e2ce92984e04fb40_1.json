The uniqueness of this study lies in its capability to establish ranges of certainty of just computing p values for sets of variables, like earlier approaches did.The key breakthrough is based on a concept that explains how Gaussians are limited in their projections.  \nThe paper showcases two experiments conducted. One using artificial data and the other with actual data. To showcase the effectiveness of the method proposed in a clear and structured manner and offers a thorough overview of the issue at hand while effectively pointing out the new hurdles and contributions stemming from it; Nevertheless there are some sections that could benefit from additional information, for improved clarity and comprehension.  \nFrom a perspective the paper seems solid; Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 make valuable contributions to the field of research presented here However some parts of the proofs may need further explanation for thoroughness and precision. The experimental segment is a beginning but lacks impact in some areas. Specifically the objective and conclusion of the experiment, in Section 4. 2 Require clarity. Additionally evaluating the suggested technique in contrast to methods like simply dividing the data could offer significant perspectives on its effectiveness and productivity particularly when dealing with the primary difficulty of employing identical data, for both group selection and inference. \nMultiple insightful remarks are worth mentioning. \nIt would be helpful to have a conversation, about whether the groups are considered separate and distinct (creating a division).\nConsidering the option to expand on the method beyond using the quadratic loss or Gaussian model could open up intriguing paths, for future investigation. \nCondition (2), on the hand requires further elaboration to support its relevance. \nThe first theorem would be improved by including information about the specific quantities being conditioned and the random variables associated with the probabilities, under consideration. \nWe need to clarify the solution, for the equation \\(\\hat f Y ( L \\alpha )= \\alpha\\) specified on line 252. \nTalking about how complex the approach's in various situations, like IHT and group lasso would be really helpful and interesting to explore. \nThe purpose and findings of the experiment are unclear and need more explanation. \nThe possible use of the suggested approach in methods to [A] and its contrast with a basic bootstrapping procedure, like [B] but tailored for group sparsity estimators pose fascinating inquiries. \nIn the information provided should address the continuity of \\( t \\rightarrow fy(t)\\) ensuring that \\( L\\) exists and offering more insights, into the properties of \\( f_y \\)' s proofs would be helpful. \nReferences; \n\"Refer to the research paper by Ndiaye et al., titled 'GAP Safe screening rules for multi task and multi class models' published in Advances, in Neural Information Processing Systems in 2015.\"\nF.Bach introduced the Bolasso model for Lasso estimation at the 2008 International Conference, on Machine Learning (ICML)."
