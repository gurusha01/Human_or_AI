The authors should offer insights into the mathematical equations especially in Section 3 point 2 where they define the combined residual function. Moreover it would be advantageous for the paper to include evaluations against other leading techniques, particularly within the realm of attention models. Furthermore the authors note that the performance of Number and Other categories still falls short when compared to performance indicating room for enhancement, in these specific domains. \nPoints supporting acceptance; \nThe research paper demonstrates performance on the Visual Question Answering dataset, for both open ended and multiple choice tasks. \nThe writers present a technique, for illustrating the impact of shared residual mappings attention through back propagation. \nThe paper thoroughly examines models and delves into various possibilities. \nReasons to agree; \nThe essay could be improved with thorough explanations of the math equations used. \nThe writers could include comparisons with leading edge techniques, in the field of attentional models. \nThe results for Number and Other categories are still not up to par with human performance levels; this implies that there is still potential for growth and enhancement, in these areas. \nI think this paper makes a valuable contribution, to the realm of learning and visual question answering as a whole. The authors present a crafted paper that offers a detailed summary of the existing research and their suggested approach demonstrates outstanding performance on a demanding dataset. If they make some tweaks to tackle the shortcomings highlighted earlier I would suggest accepting this paper for publishing."
