This discovery empowers the authors to create tools for making inferences using group sparse selection techniques, like group lasso iterative hard thresholding and forward stepwise regression.\nThe paper is nicely structured with an thorough explanation of the technical findings presented by the authors research work. The numerical tests illustrate how well the suggested methods work in practice while the outcomes concerning California health data reveal how useful this approach can be, in real world scenarios. \nThe papers positive aspects are; \nA new approach has been created to make inferences, in group sparse linear regression.\nClear and concise technical results explanation is provided.\n Showing how well the suggested approaches work by conducting tests. \nExploring how this method is used with data, in the real world.\nThe paper has some flaws, such, as; \nThe idea of having a predetermined design matrix might not always align with real life scenarios.\nThere is a need for a comparison with current techniques in dealing with selective inference, within group sparse regression.\nThe possible computational intricacy of the suggested approaches could be a concern when dealing with datasets.\nReasons supporting approval; \nThe research paper makes an addition to the realm of selective inference, within group sparse linear regression.\nThe innovative findings are original. Thoughtfully justified.\nThe results, from the numerical trials showcase the efficiency of the suggested approaches. \nThe paper is nicely. Easy to understand. \nReasons to not agree; \nThe idea of using a fixed design matrix could potentially restrict the usefulness of this method.\nWithout a comparison, to other methods it could be challenging to evaluate how well the proposed approach performs in comparison.\nThe potential difficulty, in computing with the suggested techniques might be worrisome when dealing with data sets.\nIn my opinion the paper makes a valuable contribution to the area of inference, in group sparse linear regression and its strengths outweigh any weaknesses it may have had.I suggest accepting the paper with some revisions to tackle the mentioned weaknesses.
