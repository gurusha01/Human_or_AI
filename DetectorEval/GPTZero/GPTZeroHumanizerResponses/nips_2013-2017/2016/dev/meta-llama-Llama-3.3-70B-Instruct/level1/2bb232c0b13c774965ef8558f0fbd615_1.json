            "inputText": "This study suggests a method for recognizing offline handwriting by adapting Multi Dimensional Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTM RNNs). The researchers swap out the collapse layer, with a recurrent attention mechanism that lets the network concentrate on individual text lines and carry out implicit line segmentation iteratively. \nThe authors have done a job with the paper by giving a detailed summary of previous research in handwriting recognition systems and how they have evolved over time from character based to word segmentation up, to the latest MDLSTM RNN models being used today in the field of study.The model they suggest is explained in depth. The experiments conducted are carefully planned to test how well the approach works in practice. \nThe papers notable attributes consist of; \nThe new model performs well compared to the systems on two popular databases. IAM and Rimes. Without the need, for specific line segmentation techniques. \nThe attention mechanism enables the network to concentrate on sections of the input image to enhance implicit line segmentation and overall performance. \nThe new method is much quicker than techniques by a significant margin which makes it more useful, for real life scenarios. \nThe paper has some drawbacks, such, as; \nThe system can only process images at the paragraph level. Needs to analyze the document layout to identify paragraphs before using the model. \nThe method might not work effectively for documents containing various text sections and random reading sequences. \nThe researchers recognize that the language model employed in the tests might not be ideal and suggest that enhancing it with sophisticated language models could lead to better results. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe research paper introduces an efficient method for recognizing handwritten text offline and shows comparable performance to the latest systems available, in the field. \nThe design of the model is impressive. The experiments have been carried out meticulously and comprehensively. \nThe document offers an succinct summary of the existing research and the suggested method that is simple to comprehend and track along, with. \nReasons to oppose it; \nThe model is constrained to interpreting images at the paragraph level, which may hinder its ability to effectively analyze intricate documents. \nApplying this approach in situations, like analyzing document layouts and optimizing language models might need substantial adjustments. \nThe paper would be better with a thorough examination and conversation, about the findings. Looking into errors and comparing them to other cutting edge systems. \nThe paper makes a contribution, to the realm of offline handwriting recognition and the suggested method shows promise in enhancing the effectiveness and productivity of handwriting recognition systems With some adjustments to rectify the shortcomings and drawbacks mentioned In the paper could bolster its strength and influence further.
