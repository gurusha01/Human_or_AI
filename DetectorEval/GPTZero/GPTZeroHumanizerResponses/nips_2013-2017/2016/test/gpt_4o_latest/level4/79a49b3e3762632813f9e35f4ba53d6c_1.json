            "inputText": "The article presents a technique for calculating the class bias by utilizing both labeled samples and imperfect samples building upon a previous method that calculates the bias with clean positive samples only showcasing impressive performance, in experiments when compared to other methods available. \nAfter taking into account the response provided in the update regarding the key finding highlighted therein; it is worth noting that the correlation between the observed \\( P(y\"x)\\ and its true counterpart has been previously discussed in [1]. Although this current study introduces a perspective by incorporating noise in positive outcomes compared to prior research, without such noise; I did not find this particular outcome to be exceptionally astonishing. In my evaluation report mentioned that it's important to record these discoveries in the midst of positive commotion; however I believe the impact doesn't quite reach the level of originality required. \nIn the conversation about research on uneven noise in datasets my main argument is that by using Lemma 1 and Proposition 3 (part 2) as stated in the study by Scott et al., 2013 we can develop a technique to link the outcomes of a \"mixing proportion estimator\" (MPE). This method can be applied to determine the mixing ratios in scenarios, with both negative label noise present asymmetrically. It seems to me that this suggests that the approach suggested by Sanderson & Scott might be adjusted to suit situations where positive labels are affected by noise. The authors mention that Sanderson & Scott primarily studied positive unlabeled learning without noise in the positives but suggested that their estimator could also be relevant for cases, with noisy positives. I think the same could be said for the estimator put forth by Ramasawamy and others. \nI can help you with that. Just provide me with the input text. I'll get started on the paraphrasing.\nStudying from unlabelled data has been thoroughly explored and the article presents a convincing argument for handling situations where positive examples may be unreliable in terms of accuracy. Techniques found in literature concerning class prior estimation, in PU context do not translate directly to this situation. Highlighting the importance of the suggested method. Henceforth the paper is well grounded with a purpose. \nThe paper thoroughly examines the challenges of identifiability in this problem from a standpoint which is quite impressive.It uses this analysis to come up with a format, for estimation that results in a practical algorithm.The main concept is based on the framework (referencing Jain et al., 2016) where the estimation problem involves finding the mixing weight of a particular mixture model.Estimation is carried out using the results from a scorer that's probabilistically consistent to ensure scalability without running into dimensionality issues. In terms the technical material seems valid. \nMy primary worries revolve around the originality of the project.\nThe examination in Section 3 closely mirrors the study, by Jain et al., 2016. Includes adaptations to address inaccurate positives effectively . The main takeaways from the study conducted by Jain and colleagues in 2016 can be summarized as follows; firstly dealing with a range of distributions can result in unidentifiability issues; secondly limiting the analysis to non mixture distributions helps resolve this problem. The application of two iterations for estimation and the adoption of mixture modeling seem to be directly inspired by the original research. Moreover the utilization of transformations in Section 4 bears a strong resemblance to the work of Jain and team back, in 2016. The paper suggests that one approach focused on calibrated probabilities while Theorem 9 in (study, by Jain et al., 2016) seems to permit transformations instead of being restricted to specific ones noted earlier on. Extending these concepts to the Positive Unlabeled (PU for short) scenario is beneficial but does bring up questions regarding originality and innovation levels. \nThe connection to label errors should be explored further in this context compared to the broader setting of uneven label noise overall for a clearer understanding of why the analysis is limited to this specific case instead of examining the general scenario where one distribution aligns with the fundamental marginal assumption (why not utilize Scott et al., 2013s broader mutually contaminated framework). Are there reasons why similar principles as those, in Theorem 1 would not apply in the general scenario? Furthermore some findings in the document seem to be similar to those in a study by Scott and others from 2013. With a different perspective presented. Additionally there are established techniques for dealing with symmetric noise situations that might be relevant for the current scenario under discussion. For instance the methods introduced by Sanderson and Scott in AISTATS 2014 Liu and Tao in PAMI 2016 well as Ramaswamy and colleagues, in ICML 2016 seem to be applicable here. The techniques ought to be contrasted with the suggested strategy specifically because certain ones (, like Sanderson & Scotts method) do not necessitate calibrated probabilities but depend on rankers that're probabilistically consistent instead. \nOverall the document offers an expansion on the work, by Jain and others from 2016 in the context of noisy PU scenarios but lacks significant originality. \nAdditional notes; \nIn Section 3 it is mentioned that there are results missing that are crucial, for our approach. It would be beneficial to clearly specify these missing results. \nThe use of \\( a^\\lambda_\\mu \\) might be a bit unclear. Perhaps \\( a(\\lambda,\\mu)\\ can be used instead. \nIt might be clearer to introduce \\( \\Pi^{res}\\ after discussing Lemma 1. \nCould we switch the order of statements 4 and 5 in Lemma 1? It appears that the proof aligns better with this arrangement. \nWhen proving Lemma 1s validity it's better to avoid displaying every equation in the text, for easier reading. \n\"The first theorem, on identifiability needs to be corrected to read as 'identifiability.'\"\nSection 4 might need elaboration on the suggested algorithm by specifying that it utilizes a blend of modeling techniques on classifier results, for positive and unlabeled instances. \nCould you elaborate further on the model depicted in Figure 1. Is it considered a foundational generative model for the data or more of a structure, for data manipulation purposes instead? For instance... If one were able to extract samples from the imprecise positive distributions mentioned earlier on... What specific function does Figure 1 serve in this context? \nDoes the equation labeled as (12) have any connections to the findings, on label probability function discussed in Proposition 1 from Ward et al.s work titled \"Presence data and the EM algorithm\" published in Biometrics in 2009?"
