            "inputText": "This research introduces an approach to analyzing the balance between exploration and exploitation, in scenarios involving the stochastic K arm bandit model when less expensive approximations of the desired experiment exist. The authors propose the idea of fidelity bandits where each option offers various levels of fidelity that provide biased estimates of the most accurate outcome. They also present an algorithm called MF UCG that adjusts the classical Upper Confidence Bound strategy to suit this multi fidelity framework. \nThe paper is nicely written with a explained introduction to the issue at hand and their contributions along with related researches considered in a clear and concise manner.The technical sections are structured well. The proofs are detailed.The authors present a regret bound for MF. UCB illustrating its superiority over UCB strategies that overlook multi fidelity information.They also offer a bound suggesting that MF. UCB is close, to being optimal. \nThe papers notable attributes are; \nA fresh and engaging problem scenario has emerged with practical uses across industries, like online advertising, finance and robotics. \nA new algorithm called MFUC B has been created to modify the UCB approach, for scenarios involving multiple levels of fidelity. \nThe explanation of a regret limit and a minimum limit showcases the efficiency of MF\"\"UCBand its closeness, to being optimal. \nThe papers shortcomings are evident.\nThe idea that limitations from accuracies are controlled by familiar values could sometimes be inaccurate, in real life situations. \nThe absence of real world testing to showcase MF. UCBs effectiveness is a significant drawback. \nThe lower limit is not accurately set for all options; this allows for enhancements, in the future. \nIn my opinion and considering the content of the paper submitted for review, on bandit algorithms and its practical applications it would be beneficial to accept it with insights it offers to the field.. It would also be prudent for the authors to consider working on rectifying the weaknesses highlighted earlier in their future endeavors. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article presents an captivating scenario that holds numerous promising real world uses. \nThe writers create a method called MF. UCB that adjusts the traditional UCB approach, for the multi fidelity scenario. \nThe paper showcases a regret bound and a lower boundary that illustrate the efficiency of MF\"\"UCBand its proximity, to optimality. \nReasons to oppose; \nSometimes, in reality it may not be true that the biases caused by accuracies are always limited by established quantities. \nThe papers practical impact may be restricted due to the absence of testing, on real world issues. \nThe possibility of there being room for enhancement arises from the lower bound not being stringent, for all arms.
