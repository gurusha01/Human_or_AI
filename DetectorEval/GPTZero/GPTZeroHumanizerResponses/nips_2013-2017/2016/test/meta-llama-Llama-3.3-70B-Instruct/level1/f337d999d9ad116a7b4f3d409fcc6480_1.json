Tested on the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data related to the visual system surpassing existing top performing methods, in the field. \nThe paper is nicely written with a discussion on the issue at hand and how the authors approached it along with their findings stated clearly too. They introduced a smoothing penalty as a way to improve the solution which seems like an innovation and show how it enhances cross validation results. Additionally the low rank version of the algorithm is an addition as it allows for compressing the connectivity map which could potentially be useful, in inferring whole brain connectivity. \nThe papers notable attributes are; \nA concise and compelling statement of the issue, at hand. \nA fresh and efficient approach that tackles the difficulties posed by the issue.\nImpressive outcomes seen in tests using both authentic information.\nA crafted and simple to understand presentation.\nThe paper has some drawbacks, such, as; \nThe idea that mesoscale connectivity always exhibits smoothness may not be entirely accurate. The authors should consider offering validation for this assumption. \nThe authors should offer explanation on how they selected the regularization parameter 位 since its not fully clarified.\nThe simplified version of the algorithm lacks convexity. It would be beneficial for the authors to delve further into the constraints of this method.\nHere are some reasons supporting acceptance; \nThe study introduces an efficient approach, to deducing detailed connectivity maps from viral tracing experiments.\nThe findings, from both authentic data showcase the success of this method.\nThe basic form of the algorithm could potentially facilitate the deduction of connectivity, across the brain.\nReasons supporting acceptance; \nThe idea that mesoscale connectivity always shows smoothness may not be accurate, at all times.\nThe explanation, for the selection of the regularization parameter 位 is incomplete.\nThe basic form of the algorithm isn't convex. It would be helpful if the authors delved deeper into the possible drawbacks of this method.\nIn my opinion the paper makes an addition to the field and should be accepted without a doubt.The authors introduction of an successful approach for deriving connectivity maps from viral tracing experiments is commendable.The outcomes obtained from both actual data prove the efficacy of this method.Although there are a drawbacks, in the papers content the strengths far outweigh them.This paper undoubtedly brings value to the field.
