The experiments conducted are detailed and well planned.The findings indicate that the suggested Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier performs better than cutting edge approaches,such, as those utilizing object detectors and labeled bounding boxes. \nThe papers notable aspects are as follows; \nA new and realistic method, for forecasting visual attention has been suggested in the proposal.\nThe display of top notch results, across three visual search assignments.\nThe planned and thoughtfully executed studies.\nThe writing style is straightforward and, to the point. \nThe paper has some shortcomings, such, as; \nThe likelihood of a bias towards the center, in the POET dataset could impact the outcomes. \nThe absence of references, to approaches that consider center bias and other search related factors.\nThe analysis of the shortcomings, in the SDR classifier is not comprehensive.\nReasons supporting approval; \nThe research paper presents an important addition, to the realm of computer vision and visual focus.\nThe outcomes show performance, in three distinct visual search assignments.\nThe paper is nicely. Simple to understand.\nReasons to not agree with it; \nThe outcome of the POET dataset might be influenced by the possibility of center bias. \nThe omission of comparisons, with techniques that take into account central bias and other search affecting factors.\nThe examination of the reasons, for the SDR classifiers failures is lacking in depth.\nIn my opinion the paper makes an addition in the field and should be accepted without a doubt!. I do think it would be great if the authors could tackle the center bias problem and offer deeper insights, into the failure modes of the SDR classifier for their upcoming work. \nThe quality is rated at 9 out of 10.\nThe paper is solid, from a standpoint and the arguments are backed up by both theoretical analysis and practical experimentation. \nThe clarity is rated at 9 out of 10.\nThe report is nicely written with an succinct summary of the context and previous research presented by the authors. \nThe originality rating is 8, out of 10.\nThe research paper introduces a method for forecasting human visual focus; however it is based on prior research, in the area. \nThe importance of this is rated at 9 out of 10.\nThe study showcases top notch results across three visual search assignments and could significantly influence the realms of computer vision and visual focus.
