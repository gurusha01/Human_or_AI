Recurrent depth and feedforward depth along, with the recurrent skip coefficient are introduced by the authors in a comprehensive manner using a graph theoretic approach to analyze RNN architectural intricacies. \nThe key advantages of the paper are; \nThe authors offer a graph theoretic framework, for examining RNN structures that greatly enriches the field. \nIn the realm of complexity metrics lie the suggested measures like recurrent depth and feedforward depth along, with the recurrent skip coefficient that shed light on the intricate architecture of RNN models and offer direction for crafting new recurrent structures. \nThe authors carry out experiments to test the effectiveness of the suggested methods and show how they enhance model performance across different tasks. \nNevertheless paper also exhibits shortcomings.\nThe graph based framework can be quite complex for some readers to grasp easily if they do not possess a foundation in graph theory due, to its rigorous nature. \nThe authors briefly touch on optimization concerns when it comes to increasing the depth of recurrent or feedforward structures but could benefit from a thorough examination of these issues. \nThe authors could enhance the paper by providing an extensive comparison to other relevant studies in addition, to the existing work they refer to in their analysis. \nReasons supporting approval; \nThe article introduces an thorough approach, to examining RNN structures. \nThe suggested complexity metrics offer perspectives on the structural intricacies of RNN models. \nThe real world tests show how well the suggested actions enhance the models effectiveness and performance. \nReasons to not agree with the proposal; \nThe structure of the paper might be difficult for certain readers to understand. \nThere are restrictions, in the examination of problems related to optimization. \nThe references, to research could be more thorough. \nIn my opinion the papers strong points definitely overshadow its weaknesses. It greatly adds value to the RNN field. With a few tweaks to tackle those weaknesses the paper could really stand out as a top notch contribution, to the conference. "
