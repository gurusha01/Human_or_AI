            "inputText": "The researchers in this study suggest a method, for creating optimization algorithms by framing the design process as a learning challenge instead of a traditional approach.The study shows that trained neural optimizers surpass cutting edge optimization techniques employed in deep learning and display an impressive ability to adapt to new tasks and data sets.This paper is well crafted with carefully planned experiments. \nThe papers key concept revolves around substituting crafted update guidelines with a trained update guideline through the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN). This RNN receives the functions gradient as input and generates an update step, as output. Furthermore the authors demonstrate that this method allows for the learning of optimizers tailored to function classes. These trained optimizers exhibit generalization across different tasks and datasets. \nThe research paper showcases positive aspects worth noting; To begin with the concept of training optimization algorithms is innovative and engaging as presented by the authors in a well articulated and logical manner; secondly the experiments conducted are detailed and thoughtfully planned out leading to impressive outcomes where the authors prove that their optimized learning techniques surpass existing methods in various tasks such, as neural network training and artistic image styling using neural art techniques. The paper also includes an analysis of existing research and effectively illustrates the distinctions between their method and prior studies, in the field. \nNevertheless research paper also has shortcomings.One drawback could be that the learned optimizers might not be as easy to interpret as those designed manually.This could potentially complicate understanding of their effectiveness.Another drawback may lie in the fact that this approach may not be as effective, as hand designed optimizers since it involves training a network to grasp the update rule. \nIn my opinion the article makes a scientific contribution to the field and fulfills the requirements for quality, clarity originality and importance. The article is well crafted. The experiments are detailed and well planned. The concept of mastering optimization algorithms is fresh and intriguing, with the authors offering a reasoned explanation of their method. \nSupporting points, for agreeing with the proposal; \nThe article suggests an captivating method, for creating optimization algorithms. \nThe experiments conducted were extensive. Carefully planned out with notable outcomes. \nThe paper offers an examination of the existing research and clearly outlines the unique aspects of their approach compared to prior studies, in the field. \nThis method could bring about advancements in the realm of optimization. \nPoints supporting acceptance; \nThe optimizers that are learned might not be as easy to understand compared to optimizers that are designed by hand. \nThe method might not work well as manually crafted optimizers because it involves teaching a neural network to understand the updating process. \nThe paper could be improved by conducting analysis of the learned optimizers to gain insights, into their effective functioning. \nIn my opinion I'd suggest approving the paper as it brings a contribution to the optimization field with detailed and well planned experiments. However I'd also recommend the authors to delve into analyzing the optimized learned outcomes to comprehend why they are effective and to tackle any weaknesses, in the approach. "
