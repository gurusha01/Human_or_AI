            "inputText": "This paper presents an approach for adding temporal details (past/present/future/atemporal) to word senses in a study of WordNet annotation methods by the authors who view it as a semi supervised classification problem based on graphs that consider both specific features like temporal cues in definitions and the network structure of WordNet connecting synsets semantically along with unlabeled data being involved as well.The researchers fully annotate WordNet by training on a dataset that has been labeled previously and, by considering the rest of the WordNet data as unlabeled. They break down the task into two steps; firstly distinguishing between atemporal classifications and secondly categorizing them more specifically as pasts present or future within the temporal group. To assess their method internally they use crowdsourcing for annotation on a portion of WordNet synsets. Their system is pitted against a cutting edge tagging tool (Stanfords SUTime) supported by a backup heuristic plan and previous research, for comparison. The suggested approach shows an 11 percent boost in precision. Showcases better results compared to earlier systems with just 400 labeled instances of data, for training purposes. Moreover the creators assess their tool using the TempEval‐３ assignment and manage to enhance the F₁ score by 10 percent across four categories. \nThe document is nicely. Mostly easy to understand with a logical and well supported method used throughout it. The outcome of this work that offers time based annotations at the level of word meanings can greatly improve different natural language processing tasks.. I have a few points to note specifically about the way the experiments were conducted. \nWe require information regarding the task outlined in the extrinsic evaluation part of the document. For instance sharing an illustration would help explain the systems prediction process (the features mention \"entity pairs \". Their significance remains unclear) and delving into specifics about the features (such as defining entity attributes or clarifying if POS, for a pair is considered one or two dimensions or if lemmas are automatically generated).The labels explanation is a bit phrases such as \"event to document creation time\" and \"event to same sentence event\" require more clarity and detail. Are they specific types of pairs under consideration or are they relationships (as hinted at in page 8)? The footnote regarding the 14 relations seems ambiguous. Why were relations left out and what criteria determine a mapping, as \"too complex\"? Also would you mind clarifying if the scores mentioned are macro or averages? Could the authors shed some light on the overlap, between Lexica and Entity features revealed in the ablation study results since their scores appear quite similar? \nI also have some queries about utilizing SVMs in the research paper mentioned earlier in the text detector instructions regarding algorithm optimization—specifically which parameters are involved in this process and how they are fine tuned for performance, within the MinCut framework that incorporates an SVM model as well; additionally if the optimization was performed using Libsvm library through the Weka wrapper as asserted then a proper citation mentioning Libsvm must be provided. \nSorry,. I can't provide a response, without the input text to paraphrase. Could you please provide the text you want me to rewrite?\nIt would be useful to include the quantity of instances per category in the dataset as detailed information is provided for broad labels (127 temporal, versus 271 atemporal) but the specific breakdown is absent. \nIt would be helpful to know how many words are uncertain in terms of time such, as \"present.\"\nTable 3s description suggests that there are improvements, in performance although it doesn't provide any tests or p values to support this claim. \nA few quick comments; \nIn the study by Filannino and Nendic, in 2014. What particular activity was carried out?\nIn research studies mentioned that a citation is needed for \"involves a post adjustment process \" and it may be helpful to provide a more detailed explanation of calibration as noted in footnote 5 on page 6. \nIn the context of research it is important to clarify in what ways their model deviates, from ours. \nTable 3 seems a bit cramped – maybe try taking out the parentheses and mentioning \"(precision (PR) recall (RE) F measure (F))\" in the caption ? Just stick to two metrics, like precision and F measure. Perhaps shorten the caption a bit too. \nTable 4 would be better presented as a chart for communication of the information, within it. \nOn page seven please make sure to change \"1064 \" to \"1264.\"\nThe TempEval. A reference is required. \n\nCould you please fix \"atemporal)\" to \"atemporal.\" in paragraph 3, on page 1? Thank you!"
