First is a conversion approach that aligns BSS with formalisms, like dependency and constituency trees to utilize existing parsers; second is a new transition based parser called the Broad Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP) designed to handle all three structural properties directly. Studies are carried out using UCCA marked datasets which show that both methods are viable and indicate areas where enhancements can be made. \nKey Contributions  \nThe creation of the BSP parser marks an advancement as its the initial parser designed to inherently accommodate all three structural components of BSS.This project expands upon and enhances current transition based parsing methods by introducing unique characteristics and transitions specifically crafted for UCCA. \n   \nThe paper thoroughly examines conversion based methods. Discusses their advantages and disadvantages in detail. This assessment provides insights into the balance, between utilizing current parsers and creating custom solutions. \nThe authors promise to make their converters and parsers publicly available to support the replication of results and encourage studies, in semantic parsing. \nAdvantages\nThe innovation of BSP brings a perspective, to semantic parsing by accommodating various parents and non terminal nodes while also handling disjoint units effectively—a development that overcomes the shortcomings of current parsers and propels the field forward. \n   \nThe research thoroughly assesses how well BSP performs within its specified domain and outside of it well to showcase its resilience while also establishing a benchmark for upcoming research endeavors. \nThe clear and easily understood explanation of the transition sets characteristics and the training process guarantees transparency and reproducibility in the research work presented here.The addition of limits, for methods based on conversion enhances the interpretation of the outcomes even more. \nThe works impact on applications is significant as it concentrates on UCCA. A semantic representation that can be applied across different languages. Which could have implications for tasks like machine translation and summarization, in multilingual NLP contexts. \nAreas, for improvement\nBSPs performance is strong when it comes to edges but shows room for improvement with remote edges achieving a modest 13· ƒ score). This suggests the necessity for enhancements, in effectively managing remote edges. \n   \nLack of classifiers in BSP is a problem as the LSTM based dependency parser performs much better than BSP does It shows that incorporating neural architectures into BSP could lead to significant enhancements The current dependency, on a linear classifier restricts its possibilities\nThe method of converting dependencies faces challenges in retaining important details for non terminal nodes and distant connections which hampers its effectiveness and highlights the necessity, for advanced conversion techniques. \nThe paper presents evaluation metrics, for BSS parsing; however these metrics are not commonly adopted or verified within the community which could impact the ability to compare with other semantic parsing methods. \nAsking Authors Questions\nHow does the BSPs performance stack up against cutting edge parsers for semantic representations, like AMRs or SDPs outside of UCCA? \nCould incorporating structures like LSTMs or transformers into BSP enhance its functionality, on distant edges? \nAre there any intentions to expand the BSP to include semantic annotation systems apart, from UCCA in the future and if thats the case what difficulties are expected to arise? \nAdditional Thoughts\nThe article is nicely. Tackles a significant issue in semantic parsing field.While BSP exhibits potential improvements are required to enhance its effectiveness and scalability.The authors’ dedication, to making their tools available is admirable. Is expected to benefit the industry positively. "
