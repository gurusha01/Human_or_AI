The study also offers information on how redundancy is distributed in NMT structures and emphasizes the significance of upper layers along, with attention and softmax weights. \nKey Contributions\nEffective Reduction through Pruning; The study shows that magnitude based pruning methods such as the class approach can compress NMT models by as much as 80% without any decrease in performance following retraining.This finding plays a role in enhancing the efficiency and feasibility of NMT models on devices, with limited resources. \nThe authors thoroughly examine how redundancy is distributed among weight classes in NMT models in their analysis titled \"Redundancy Analysis, in NMT Architectures.\" They point out the significance of layers and weights related to attention and softmax functions compared to the redundancy found in lower layers and embedding weights. \nThe paper extensively examines three methods and demonstrates the effectiveness of the class blind approach over previously preferred techniques such, as class uniform and class distribution pruning in a robust way. \nAdvantages\nThe suggested method for pruning has benefits as it allows for substantial model compression without compromising performance levels significantly—especially valuable when implementing NMT models, on mobile or edge devices. \nThe document offers a set of experiments to validate the findings thoroughly by comparing various pruning methods and retraining approaches while conducting in depth assessments of the significance of weights, in diverse layers and elements. \nThe method of class pruning is easy to execute and can be used with various types of neural network structures besides Neural Machine Translation (NMT) broadening its overall usefulness. \nInsightful Findings; Examining how redundancy is distributed and the significance of weight categories offers valuable insights, into NMT structures that could shape upcoming model design and optimization endeavors. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe paper mainly discusses magnitude based pruning. Lacks exploration of other advanced techniques such as Optimal Brain Damage or Optimal Brain Surgery, for a thorough evaluation of different approaches. \nThe paper lacks discussion on leveraging the nature of trimmed models to enhance runtime or training efficiency; this hinders the practical applicability of the proposed approach. \nResults Generalizability Concerns; The tests were carried out using one NMT model and dataset (specifically WMT '14 English German). It's uncertain if these conclusions can be applied to structures of models or other language combinations and tasks. \nAsking Authors Questions\nHave you thought about trying out pruning and retraining cycles like they recommended in earlier studies to see if it helps with making more compressed or improving performance further? \nCan we use the complexity of pruned models to speed up training or inference processes and how would this impact the overall computational efficiency? \nHow can the findings be applied to types of NMT structures, like Transformer based models or other tasks outside of NMT? \nFurther Thoughts \nThis paper significantly advances the field of model compression for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The straightforward yet powerful pruning method suggested here. The thorough examination of redundancy offer valuable insights, for researchers and industry professionals alike. Nevertheless improving upon the constraints related to techniques and runtime performance could enhance the studys impact even more. "
