The author develops coding schemes to align word components, in languages and establishes an MD objectiv... The findings are showcased using distance measurements, a tree representing evolutionary relationships and instances of identified connections. \nThe reasoning behind the strategy and theoretical foundation seems solid to me.The utilization of MD is seems appropriate for solving the issue and the explanation for using EM is well explained.However some of the calculations weren't completely understandable to me.The writers point out the resemblance between the MD objective and Bayesian inference which makes me think about how its used in (phylogenetic inference like with MrBayes tool.A practical assessment, within this framework might offer perspectives. \nReview of Previous Research \nThe paper does not include a discussion about comparing with existing techniques for identifying borrowed words and similar words in linguistics using computational methods as seen in studies by Alexandre Bouchard Côté,Tandy Warnow,Luay Nakhleh and Andrew Kitchen which are significant sources to consider.Even though some tools may not be directly suitable for the dataset in question the authors could reference works like Listand Moran (2013).Furthermore biological phylogenetics tools such, as PAUP or MrBayes could also be explored. \n\nThe process of alignment appears to be limited by memory and runtime constraints when comparing up to five languages simultaneously. Considering the utilization of languages and phylogenetic trees, in this context it would be intriguing to understand the approach the authors intend to take in overcoming this obstacle. \nThe neighbor joining method for constructing trees has certain limitations like requiring manual root specification. Are there more advanced approaches worth investigating? \nAre the authors running the EM algorithm until it converges or are they using a stopping point instead? \nI'm sorry. I cannot proceed with generating a paraphrased text without having the original content provided by you. Please share the text that needs to be rewritten so that I can assist you accordingly.\nThe research merges two sets of data. One consisting of cognates and the other not specifically based on cognates (Swadesh lists). Do the authors take into account how this could impact the outcomes? \nThe information is shown in written form which may hide connections especially in languages with diverse writing systems.Thus the rules acquired could show changes, in writing systems than real language links.This constraint may be lessened by using transcriptions instead. \nI'm not sure I understand some parts.\n\"What does the phrase 'optimal word, for using symbols in all rules (line 286) refer to?\"\nThe explanation of the merging process in the maximization step wasn't completely clear, to me. \nA minor concern. \nPlease provide the text you would like me to rewrite in a like manner.\nCitations\nJohann Mattis List and Steven Moran presented an Open Source Toolkit for Quantitative Historical Linguistics at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Sofia Bulgaria in 2011.You can find more information, about it at this link;[http;//www.aclweb.org/anathology/P13_4005](http;//www.aclweb.org/anathology/P13_4005).\nAndrew Kitchen and his colleagues from 2009 conducted a phylogenetic study on Semitic languages that suggests an origin of Semitic in the Near East, during the Early Bronze Age.
