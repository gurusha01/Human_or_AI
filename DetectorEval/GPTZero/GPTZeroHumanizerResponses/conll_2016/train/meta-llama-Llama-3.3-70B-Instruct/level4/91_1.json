It shows that pruning based on magnitude produces the favorable outcomes and that performance can be regained through retraining after substantial pruning while maintaining the original standards. \nThe main benefit of this article is its straightforwardness and the caliber of its findings which are presented in an comprehensible manner, by the authors who have also effectively addressed existing research. \nOne significant drawback of this research is that it lacks innovation since it essentially utilizes a known method on a different type of neural network and use case which leads to somewhat expected results. \nThe real world impact of these discoveries remains uncertain since utilizing them would demand the use of sparse matrix representations—an implementation that can be difficult to optimize for GPUs considering that prioritizing rapidity over storage is key in NMT applications; thus necessitating a clearer rationale for the importance of pruning, within this framework. \nIn order to tackle this limitation effectively; the writers might consider using the trimming outcomes to guide changes, in the design structure of the system. For example; as shown in Figure 3; they could look into the possibility of cutting down the layers to just two and potentially shrinking the size of source and target embeddings. \nOne other way to consider is making a link between pruning and retraining using dropout. This idea can be inspired by studies, like \"Applying Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks; A Theoretical Perspective,\" written by Gal (arxiv 2016).\nYour comment should provide details, for better understanding.\nHow, about using \"output embeddings\" of \"softmax weights\" for better understanding and clarity?\nIn Section 3 of the document it mentions that using the term \"dimension\" can be confusing and there is no need to express parameter sizes as multiples of this value, in integers. \nPlease provide a text for me to paraphrase in the tone of a human writer for you. \nIn Section 003 both methods, for class uniformity and class distribution produce outcomes so it might be advisable to eliminate one to prevent duplication issues. \nLets consider exploring a pruning method in which class blind is used for the majority of classes and class uniform is employed for embeddings, in Figure 3. \n\nIn Section 4 point out the technique, for trimming and refer to Figure 6 for aid. \n\"Could you please specify if the loss pertained to the training data or the test data, in Figure 7?\"\nLets include statistics of just the diagram, in Figure 8 as the softmax weights are missing making it hard to understand. \nInclude Le et al.' s \" A Method, for Starting Recurrent Networks of Rectified Linear Units \" (ar Xiv 2015 ) for more background information."
