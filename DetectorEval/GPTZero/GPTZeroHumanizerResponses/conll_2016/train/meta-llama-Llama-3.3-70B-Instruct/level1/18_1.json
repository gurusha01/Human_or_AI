            "inputText": "This research suggests a method for analyzing extensive semantic structures that involve multiple parents and non terminal nodes as well as disjoint units of information integration in a comprehensive manner. The authors present two strategies, for parsing these types of semantic structures effectively; (1). They propose converting the structures into formal representations and leveraging advanced parsing tools on these converted forms. (2). They also describe the development of a parser designed specifically to handle the range of properties associated with such structures. \nThe primary achievements of this study include; \nA new transition based parser called Broad Coverage Semantic Parser (BCSP) has been introduced in the proposal to accommodate relations between parents and nodes as well, as non contiguous units. \nThe incorporation of a conversion focused parsing method to evaluate the effectiveness of technologies, in tackling the issue. \nThe initial trial on UCCA parsing showcases how transition based techniques are efficient, for BSS parsing purposes. \nThis paper excels, in the following areas; \nThe writers offer an thorough description of the suggested method that covers the transition set\u0010 characteristics and training process in depth. \nThe test outcomes show that the suggested method is successful since BSP achieves F scores as modern parsers, on main connections and surpasses them on distant connections. \nThe document thoroughly examines the outcomes by conducting in depth research, on feature removal and error assessment to shed light on the pros and cons of the suggested method. \nThe papers drawbacks include; \nWhen using the conversion based method for parsing text data into a format, like this one may result in loss of information during the conversion process and could impact the accuracy of the parser used for analyzing the transformed data. \nThe suggested method necessitates a volume of labeled data that may be laborious and costly to acquire. \nThe paper would be improved by providing a comparison with existing research, on semantic parsing and exploring the strengths and weaknesses of various methods employed in the field. \nEnquiries, for writers; \nHow are the writers intending to tackle the problem of losing information when converting data? \nIs it possible for the suggested method be used with forms of semantic representation, like AMRs or SDPs? \nHow do the writers intend to enhance the precision of the parser, for distant edges?
