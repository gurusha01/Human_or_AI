            "inputText": "This study introduces a method for adapting to different domains, in statistical machine translation (SMT) employing semi supervised convolutional neural networks (CNN). The key advancements of this research include; \nWhen using in domain data for effective data selection in the proposed method shows promising results by outperformaung baseline systems that are trained on large amounts of general domain data. Even with just 100 sentences of, in domain data. \nThe semi supervised CNN approach shows results compared to the current top methods in language models for data selection techniques and has achieved an improvement of up to 3/ point 3 BLEUs, over the standard system. \nThe approach demonstrates stability and resilience even when dealing with limited in domain data sets by showcasing a standard deviation of 0.12 in BLE U score, across three repeated trials. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nUtilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for data selection in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) represents an inventive strategy tapping into the capabilities of deep learning models, for text classification assignments. \nUsing word embeddings effectively is key in the suggested approach as it leverages word embeddings from unlabeled data to enhance the precision of domain categorization even in scenarios with restricted, in domain data availability. \nThe study includes testing across four unique language orientations and three trial areas to showcase the efficiency and reliability of the suggested method. \nThe papers drawbacks are as follows; \nThe paper lacks an in depth examination of the CNN structure and its hyperparameters that could be crucial, in grasping the models performance. \nThe paper solely compares the approach to data selection methods based on language models and does not assess how it performs in comparison to other deep learning models, like recurrent neural networks (RNNS) or long short term memory (LTSM).\nThe paper fails to offer an analysis of the suggested method that would aid in comprehending the fundamental mechanisms and constraints of the approach. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow did you choose the settings, for the CNN model. How do these settings affect the performance of the model? \nCould you share information, about how the word embedding learning process impacts the effectiveness of the method being proposed? \nHave you thought about using the suggested approach for NLP tasks, like language modeling or text classification and what advantages and difficulties could arise from doing that?
