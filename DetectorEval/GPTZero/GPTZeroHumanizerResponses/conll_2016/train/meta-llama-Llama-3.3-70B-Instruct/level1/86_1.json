Do not include a comparison, with commercial tools that are commonly used in practice. \nQuestions, for writers; \nCould you give me information regarding the creation of AppCheck and TweetCheck apps such as the features utilized and the algorithms employed in addition, to the training data used? \nHow do you intend to overcome the challenges posed by the constraints of your method. Such as the absence of clarity, in crafting your tools and the restricted evaluation of outcomes? \nCould you compare your tools to those, in the market and talk about the pros and cons of using your tools in real life scenarios?
