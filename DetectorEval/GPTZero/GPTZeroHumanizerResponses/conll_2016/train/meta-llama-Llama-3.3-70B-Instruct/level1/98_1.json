Compare its performance with advanced delexicalized transfer parsers, in their study. \nA new method has been introduced with a supervised parser in the field which offers a fresh perspective on analyzing languages, with limited resources. \nThe extensive assessment conducted across 32 languages offers an examination of the methods effectiveness while also pointing out its advantages and drawbacks. \nThe flaws, in this paper include; \nThe evaluation given by the authors is comprehensive. Lacks a deeper analysis of the results regarding linguistic factors that impact the parsers performance. \nThe authors should have compared their method with unsupervised parsing approaches to offer a more thorough analysis of the field without any direct comparisons, with other unsupervised parsing methods being made. \nThe authors could have delved deeper into the impact of their findings by discussing how their approach could be applied to languages, with resources. \nQuestions, for the writers; \nCould you give me information, about how different linguistic factors influence how well parsers work and how these factors differ from one language to another? \nHow do you intend to expand your method to include languages, with limited resources and what obstacles and constraints might arise from this approach? \nCould you offer a thorough analysis of how your method differs from other unsupervised parsing methods and delve into the advantages and limitations of each approach?\""
