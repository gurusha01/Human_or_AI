Moreover. Going back to what was mentioned. It might be a good idea to explore moving away from focusing solely on word variety towards considering diversity, on a sentence level as the student model progresses and begins to rely less on rare word cues. \nAdditional remarks; \n\nPlease clarify \"target word y \" not \"target sentence y \" in line 277.\nCan you please explain if when K equals 4 and K equals 8 mean comparing the likelihoods of the likely word and the top eight most likely words in the present situation? Also clarify if the current situation is chosen based on benefits or, through a more thorough search process. \nSection 4 point 2 talks about comparing an uniform distribution which doesn't offer much insight because its highly likely that y given z will be much more similar to y given x than to a uniform distribution probability wise. A useful way to look at this would be to see how valuable y given z remains as y given x gets better and better over time or, with increasingly more data used during training iterations. Furthermore¸ it would be intriguing to explore how the mode approximation fares in contrast to best lists, in determining sentence level scores. \n\"I find it interesting that word beam search is less effective than word search even though word beam search is expected to be more similar, to word sampling in theory.\" Can you explain why this is the case? \nThe claimed benefit of sent beam seems dubious since it might just be fluctuations given the significant variability, in the associated data points.
