Rewritten\nAdvantages; \nThe paper discusses an issue related to building ontologies or the use of thesarui in depth.   \nThe suggested approaches seem sensible and well matched for the job, at hand.   \nThe methodology and the experimental setup have been elaborated adequately.   \nThe findings indicate that the method used by the authors outperforms the existing practices (although I do harbor some concerns which will be elaborated upon later).  \nAreas that could be improved upon;   \nThe main flaws of the paper are found in its assessment and the quality of the presentation. Writing overall.   \nThe choice of methods is not clear as some of the methods listed are outdated and their significance is doubtful (, for instance Mpttern).  \nMemb appears to have been the leading method, in the past; however there is no citation or reference provided for this claim.   \nThe findings indicate that the new technique shows performance compared to the previous leading method; however the proof provided does not seem entirely persuasive. In the case of the initial dataset, the enhancement in performance, over the previous state of the art is minimal.   \nThe paper needs a review before it can be considered for publication in its current state.. I found 11 mistakes, in the column of page 2 alone as an example of the issues that need to be addressed.   \nIn the experiments conducted with the Cilin hierarchy system utilized a simple structure comprising only 5 levels in depth. Previous research has employed this system; however I anticipate that incorporating hyponym hypernym relationships might present more difficulties, with deeper hierarchies. This observation could potentially clarify the high performance outcomes noted in previous studies as well.   \nLets talk about it in general.   \nThe suggested method may not be groundbreaking or unprecedented; however it tackles an issue that has yet to be investigated through learning methods. This aspect makes the paper intriguing. Nevertheless there are two concerns that require attention.   \nThe initial problem lies in the way its presented. The document is riddled with mistakes and typos that should be fixed before it can be published to avoid any confusion, for readers or reviewers of the work I've done to identify and troubleshoot these errors was hoping to help out the authors by providing a list of them. There are just too many to go through one by one.   \nThe next concern pertains to the assessment process. While the stated achievement surpasses the cutting edge standard the outcomes lack complete persuasion for the aforementioned rationales. To elaborate further there is uncertainty surrounding Membs identity. Is Memb referencing the strategy introduced by Shwartz and colleagues in 2016 ? If not how did this recent technique fare, in comparison ? The assessment part should be rearranged to clearly present the systems used as a reference point and showcase the benefits of the suggested approach while also pointing out the shortcomings of other methods, in comparison. Furthermore it's important to include tests to determine significance especially considering the slight improvement noticed in one of the datasets. "
