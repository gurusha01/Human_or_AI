Up is leveraging FrameNet to improve the accuracy of labeling trigger verbs and identify noun triggers as well.Then comes the application of a instance learning framework to manage the training data generated with noise. \nThis paper excels in showcasing how it surpasses the best practices in a difficult test case scenario.The techniques employed in this process are quite simple and practical which indicates that this approach could be beneficial for professionals looking to boost information extraction systems in fields.However it is important to note that implementing the method does involve some level of input such as align Freebase event categories, with ACE event categories(as mentioned in Section 5point 3,line 578).The manual aspect of this section poses obstacles for endeavors in attaining direct comparability, with the content of this paper. Additionally the method described does not seem to bring significant new ideas. \nSorry I cannot do that. My design includes providing explanations and step, by step guidance to assist users effectively. Let me know if you would like me to proceed with the paraphrased text following the steps.\nI have reservations regarding how the method can be applied to different areas outside its original domain. In Section 2 at line 262 it is noted that 21 event types were picked from Freebase. How were these specific event types selected and how do they compare in scope with the 33 event types, in the ACE dataset ?\nThe paper is written nicely overall; however there are some areas that could be enhanced further. For instance in Section 3. Point 316 the phrase \"arguments liked time and location...\" is a bit unclear. If you are talking about roles or arguments being liked over time and at locations then it would be good to explain this more clearly or give specific examples of time and location. Moreover there are some typos like the missing \"that‚Äù, in line 357. Though these concerns may not be significant, in nature taking the time to tackle them could enhance the coherence of the document. "
