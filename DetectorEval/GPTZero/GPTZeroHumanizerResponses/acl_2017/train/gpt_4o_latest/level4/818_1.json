            "inputText": "Thank you for your response as the author! I appreciate that you've touched upon some of my concerns in your reply; although it mostly involves promises, like \"we will...\" – I understand that space limitations may play a role here. However this brings up a point for me. I would like to see an updated version of the paper to confirm that the noted issues are indeed addressed thoroughly.. The changes needed are quite significant. The additional experimental findings suggested by the authors would not be subjected to peer review if the current version of the paper is accepted as it is. It's hard for me to decide if I should let the authors handle the revisions on their own. If we need another review round for it.I'm giving it a 3 now because I'm not completely sure about it (even though I value the research, in the paper I find its structure quite messy).\nI will rewrite the text and ensure it appears natural and human like; \"It's important to note that the AI text detector uses various techniques such as heuristics and perplexity to determine if a text is generated by a machine learning model or written by a human. By analyzing statistics, on part of speech distribution and common characteristics of AI generated text it can differentiate between the two sources.\"\nAdvantages; \nThe article discusses an important subject. Extracting information from text while dealing with the issue of reporting bias where people tend to overlook stating obvious facts like a person being bigger, than a ball). The suggested method involves making deductions based on the information gathered from the text which is quite ambitious and commendable. \nI'm sorry. I cannot proceed with the paraphrased text without the input text you'd like me to work on. Please provide the input text for me to paraphrase.\nAreas, for improvement; \nThere are a points in the suggested method that need to be clarified (refer to the comments provided below). My main worry is that the article fails to articulate how the method enables the integration of information, on objects and actions to address reporting bias effectively.The paper jumps into complexities too rapidly without properly laying out the overall approach or proving its efficacy. \nThe analysis and its discussion are lacking in some areas as noted by the user in reference to Table 2 which shows results, for one of the tasks that were not elaborated upon in the discussion section. Moreover there is an absence of a crucial experiment where Variant B of the authors’ model demonstrates superior performance compared to Variant A in the initial task; however only Variant A is evaluated for the subsequent task and regrettably does not surpass the baseline performance. \nI cannot proceed with the task as you requested. Let me know if you would like me to help with something.\nLets talk about topics.\nThe document needs revisions before it can be published. \nI am sorry. I cannot proceed without the actual input text that needs to be paraphrased. Could you please provide me with the text you want me to rewrite? Thank you.\n\n\"Lets stick with five dimensions, not six.\"\nCaption, for Figure 1. How can one establish the implied connections accurately? \nIn Figure 1 and lines 113 to 114 the method seems focused on capturing entailments as described in formal semantics (referencing Dowty, 1991). It would be beneficial to connect this with existing literature, on the topic. \n  David Dowtys work, on \" proto roles and argument selection\" was published in the journal Language in 1991 (pages 547–619).\nCould you explain the idea of your method here. How does combining both types of information help address reporting bias and why is it effective? \nSure I will be happy to help. Just give me a moment to process and generate the paraphrased text for you.\nWhen thinking about your research project on distributional semantics it might be helpful to look into related work, like; \n  The work by Bruni et al. presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2012 delves into the realm of distributional semantics, with a vibrant approach. \n  The study by Silberer et al. published in the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) conference, in 2013 explores models of semantic representation incorporating visual attributes. \nYour unique contribution is in your task and approach since extracting common knowledge from language has been a well established task, for a long time. \nPlease provide the text that you would like me to paraphrase in a human manner so that I can assist you accordingly. \nSection 2 Subsection 2a should detail the rationale behind selecting those dimensions and outline the method used for the selection process. \nPlease define \"pre condition\". Post condition\" and discuss why they are important. \nCould you please give an example of the distribution for an item such, as model generated content or content sourced from a crowd?\nIn Figure 2s \"x is slower than y \" the explanation seems a bit confusing as it touches on the difference in meaning between stage level and individual level predicates in semantics. For instance. When someone throws a ball (stage level) the ball moves faster than the person throwing it; however this isn't a truth (individual level). This also connects to the distinction, between pre condition and post condition concerns. Could you please clarify the details you're looking to gather from this information?\n\"Line 248 highlights the absence of a determiner, in the 'Above definition.'\"\n\n  Could you please list the 50 classes that were chosen and explain the criteria used for their selection in terms of being classified as action verbs according to Levins classification system? \n  Please provide the input that needs to be rewritten before I can provide a paraphrased version of it in a human like manner. \n  How can you tell if a frame is producing much or too little output? \n  In Table 1 please explain if partitions are basedon frames or verbs or any other method. Do verbs or frames repeat across partitions ? Besides while proportions for two scenarios ( 1 agreement, out of three and all three agreeing ) are provided one case has count information—could you clarify this further ?\n  There is a lack of information regarding the inclusion of \"with... PMl”, in line 336. \n  Line 371. Were the partitions made at random? \n  \"Assess the connection.\"\n  How do you determine which aspects of knowledge to note down for every frame selection? \nSection 4; \n  Lets make sure the computational linguistics audience has an understanding of factor graphs by explaining what \"factor graph \" \"substrates,\" and \"factors\" are and how they function in comparison to standard graphs, in your models overview at the beginning of this section. \n  Line 420 highlights a lack of clarity regarding the reference, to \"both classes of knowledge.\"\n  Please provide the input that needs to be paraphrased.\n  At line 445 the introduction of preference factors seems sudden even though they seem crucial to the topic at hand so it might be better to introduce them earlier in the discussion, for better clarity regarding their role – could you please provide further explanation?\n  Could you please explain \"also\"?\n  Line 471 discusses the origin of similarities at the level. \n  I find it quite challenging to understand Figure 3; perhaps it needs some enhancements to make it clearer and easier to read in black and white as per the guidelines, for submitting to ACL. \n  Please elaborate on the concept of \"message\" and its function, within the factor graph structure. \n  Please provide the input text that needs to be rewritten in a human manner so I can assist you with the paraphrasing process. \n  Could you please elaborate on the EMB MAXENT classifier starting from line 647? It would be helpful to know more, about its training data source and input encoding to understand why it serves as a baseline model. \n  Please provide the text you would like me to paraphrase.\n  Please ensure that the table references, in lines 659 and 681 are updated to Table 2.\n  The example given is not very clear to me. How exactly is the entity considered bigger than the revolution and is being \"larger\" the same, as being \"stronger”?\n  Lets talk about the outcomes of the object knowledge inference assignment and present the findings related to model (A). Using terms for models, in both Tables 1 and 2 would enhance clarity. \n  When talking about knowledge, in verbs why aren't objects included in the discussion? \n   Line 781 indicates that there is an antecedent, for \"both tasks.\"\nCheck the formatting details (like capitalization in Grice and Sorower et al.). Make sure all bibliographic information is complete (such, as VerbNet reference). "
