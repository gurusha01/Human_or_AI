Moreover it contrasts RMSprop and pSGLDG for character level tasks while looking at SGD with or without dropout against SGLDG with or without it for word level tasks. This lack of consistency, in evaluation presents an issue. It would be better to show outcomes for both aspects (architectures and learning methods) covering both character level and word level language modeling tasks to evaluate if the suggested Bayesian learning approaches work well across tasks and data sets.   \nThe paper argues that the improvement in performance is primarily due, to incorporating noise and model averaging techniques; yet this assertion lacks empirical evidence to back it up convincingly.A/B testing that specifically examines the impact of noise and model averaging is essential to validate this claim.   \nGals dropout is only assessed for the sentence classification task and not for language modeling or captioning tasks even though it can be applied beyond sentence classification tasks; thus its effectiveness should be tested across all three tasks to offer a thorough evaluation of the new algorithms relative, to current dropout techniques.   \nThe paper does not specify if the samples (θ₁,... Θₖ) are arranged in an order like by posterior probability or not. Moreover the authors might consider presenting outcomes for choosing K samples from S as an alternative approach to gain more understanding of the effectiveness of the sampling method.   \nRecurrent neural network (RNN) language models are considered to require significant computational resources for training and assessment processes compared to other approaches like Bayesian learning algorithms and stochastic gradient descent (SGC) with dropout technique, which are being suggested in this context for performance evaluation purposes to help readers assess the trade offs, between enhanced performance and computational demands more effectively. \nClarifications; \nWhat is the meaning of \\(\\theta_s\\) here. Does it indicate the MAP estimate of the parameters derived only from sample \\( s \\)?  \nCould you explain what \\(\\theta\\) represents in relation to dropout and dropconnect techniques?  \nTypos detected.\nSorry,. I can't provide a response without understanding the context of the input you provided. Can you please share details or rephrase your request?  \n"
