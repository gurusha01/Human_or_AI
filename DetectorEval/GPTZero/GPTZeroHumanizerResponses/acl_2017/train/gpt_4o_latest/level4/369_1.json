            "inputText": "This study presents an approach to translating text from languages with limited word structure (like Chinese) to languages with complex word structures (such as Spanish) through a two phase procedure; Initially creating a simplified form of the desired language and then determining specific morphological traits, for each word before adding appropriate inflections based on those traits. \nAlthough the writers focus on a language pair in their study I believe that the issue discussed in this research is both important and not thoroughly explored in current machine translation (MT). The approach suggested differs from modern techniques such as BPE and character level models; instead it takes cues from earlier methods like \"Factored Translation Models\" by Koehn and Hoang (2007) and \"Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages, with Synthetic Phrases\" by Chahuneau et al., (2013). Regrettably the paper does not reference these works. \nHowever I do have some concerns about the fact that the authors only mentioned METOR scores without including any reference to BLEO or providing any assessments in their report If the BLEO scores do not show any improvement it would be helpful if the authors could explain why their approach is still effective, by using METOR results and presenting sample sentences as evidence. \nFurthermore the article highlights the importance of considering gender and number as linguistic characteristics but overlooks the aspect of person which is equally crucial in languages with complex morphology. This absence could be attributed to the occurrence of first person and second person pronouns and verbs in news datasets however it deserves some attention. Additionally there is a lack of explanation in the article regarding why adjusting scores has a negative effect, on gender accuracy. If the accuracy rates are high shouldn't the reranker be able to learn to preserve the hypothesis? \nIn conclusion even though the paper shows potential it needs improvements in spelling, grammar, word selection and style before it can be considered for publication. I have outlined errors and recommendations, for enhancement below. \nI believe this work should be showcased at a conference with the inclusion of more language pairs and evaluation metrics, after thorough proofreading. \nHere is a list of errors identified; \nI corrected the spelling of \"Zh**a**nd to \"Zh**a**ng\".\n\nIn the section on Related Work consider replacing the occurrence of `\\cite', with `\\newcite' when suitable. \nIt's best to steer of filler phrases such, as \"its important to note that...\" or \"its worth noting that...\"\nLine 182 and 184 ask for clarification on whether \"The popular phrase based MT system\" refers to Moses to PBMT systems, in general.\nSoftware has been designed to turn AI generated writing into human writing by mimicking the behavior of imperfect humans.\nLine 196 requires the plural form, for both commercial levels; however it is worth considering whether 'levels accurately conveys the intended meaning. \n\nPlease provide a sentence or text that you would like me to rewrite in a like manner.\nTable 1 needs adjustments to address the spaces in \"cuestión\" at the start and \"titulado\" at the end of the rows along with emphasizing discrepancies between rows for better understanding of the content; it should also provide insights into whether the simplifier is manually crafted or reliant, on a pre existing tool. \nHere is the revised text; Line 290 should use \"for example\" of \"that is.\"\n\n\"Our design takes inspiration from Colloberts suggestion.\"\nSorry,. I can't provide a human like rewrite without more context or content to work with!\nPlease confirm if all the words, in the equation share the word vector ` W `.\n\"Could it also be 'white houses? Please clarify how the system decides between singular and plural forms and mention the influence of the context.\"\nThe chart looks like a grid structure known as a \"sausage lattice.\"\nPlease provide me with the text you would like me to paraphrase in order to sound human like. \nI need context to provide a paraphrased human like text in English based on the users input alone as it is quite brief and specific, to a spelling correction task regarding the word \"syllable.\" If you can provide details or content I will be able to generate a human like response accordingly. \nPlease provide examples or further explanation of how \"words with the stress accent in the to last syllable\" (palabras llanas) and \"words with the stress accent in the third, to last syllable\" (palabras esdrúgulas) are managed or treated differently in this context. \n\"as well as sentences that exceed 50 words, in length.\" \nPlease provide the content you would like me to paraphrase in order to continue.\nHere is the revised text. Line 574 needs clarification, on whether \"or \" not \". \" Should be used.\nOf \"trained on \" it should be \"trained for.\"\n\n\"The sizes are.\"\nLets talk about whether increasing the size of embeddings would be beneficial since training for 1 hour and 12 hours seems reasonable. \n\"Seven and five are considered the values.\"\n\"Why did it increase to 70 specifically. What was the initial value it was raised from?\"\nTable 3 should be updated to specify that these values are hyperparameters, than just parameters. \n\"Coverage surpasses 99 percent.\"\n\"going down.\"\n\"quadratic.\"\nPlease provide the text that needs to be paraphrased so I can assist you further. \nPlease provide me with the text you would like me to paraphrase for you.\n\"underneath.\"\n\"The typical expression utilized in...\"\nPlease update the release year to 2009 of 2016 as mentioned in the citation.
