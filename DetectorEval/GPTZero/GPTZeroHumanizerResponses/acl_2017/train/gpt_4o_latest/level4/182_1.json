Your dedication, to sharing the code is truly commendabl  \nTaking everything into consideration I have decided to increase my score to 4. \nAdvantages; \nThe article is nicely crafted. \nThe research involves a range of experiments. \nThe outcomes are reliable. \nAreas, for improvement include; \nThe project doesn't introduce any innovations and mainly utilizes already existing technologies. \nThe code has not been made accessible yet. \nThe outcomes are as anticipated and do not bring about any revelations. \nCasual Conversation; \nWhy didn't you use audio features, like MFCC when working on this project? \nMinor Specifics; \nIn cases, like L155 it should be \"an LSTM,\" not \" a LSTM.\"\nIn places, like L160 and L216 Why do you see hyphens after the text? \nThe description of convolution is not very clear. \nTable 1 should be relocated to a section, like page 2 since it has already been referenced. \nIs the use of 3 CNN a common method in video processing or are there other options available, for consideration? \nThe caret (^) probably needs to go above the \"Y.\"\n\"Did you intend to say 'to prevent overfitting' instead of 'to check overfitting'?\"\nConsider using quotation marks or italics to highlight names like L403 and 408, for readability. \n\"The correction should be 'an SVM' instead of' a SVM.\"\n\"L448 states that the correct term to use is either 'Outputs or 'is,' instead of 'Output... Are'.\"\nThere is a space, after \"layer.\"\n\"The term 'concatenate' should continue on the line without starting a new one.\"\nWhy do we not know the number of individuals involved in the situation? \nPlease provide the text that needs to be paraphrased so I can assist you further.\nSorry,. I can't provide a direct rewrite without first understanding the context of your text. Can you please provide me with the input you'd like me to paraphrase?\nSure thing! Here is the paraphrased text; \"L777 should have a \"hand, on the other.\"\nThere are some issues with the references that need to be fixed;. Remove whitespace in L823. Add \"Munich\" in L831. Clarify what \"ACL (1)\" refers to in L860. Eliminate the extra closing parenthesis in L888. Include \"Volume\" in L894. Remove extra new lines in L951. Properly indent \"linguistics”, in L956"
