Does it represent the sense rankings found in WordNet?   \nIn studies on this topic of related research work on representing word meanings as a mix of different senses has been looked into before. For instance the study titled \"Placing a meaning network within a language space\" (presented at NAACL in 2015), by Johansson and Nieto Piña broke down word meanings into senses connected to a structure using a method. The same concept has also been used in the training of sense vectors in a manner. This approach is evident, in the work titled \"Linear Algebraic Structure of Word Senses\" authored Arora et al. It includes applications related  words.\nI just have a small remarks;   \nNo definitions, for types and tokens are necessary since these terms are commonly used in the field.   \nWhy do we need the \\(\\lambdawi\\) in equation 4 when the probability is not normalized yet? \nLets talk about it in general."
