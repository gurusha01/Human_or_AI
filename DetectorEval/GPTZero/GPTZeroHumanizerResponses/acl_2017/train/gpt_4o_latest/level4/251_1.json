            "inputText": "This study delves into the foundations of the skip gam model and highlights its performance in analogy tasks as well as the overall success of additive composition models.It also establishes a link, between skip gam and Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR). \nThe papers detailed exploration of skip gras characteristics was intriguing. Got me thinking about its implications in general terms.The way it delves into the assumptions of the model and how they interact with the composition operations it enables is praiseworthy.I think the paper provides perspectives, for the community in this aspect. \nMy main issue with the paper lies in how they approach language usage. It seems a bit basic for me. The way the authors explain 'compositionality' where words are put together to create meanings is quite different from what I'm used to. I believe that two words can come together to form a concept that is unique and doesn't directly link to any other idea, in the mix. Then this new concept still holds its own meaning which is important for language to remain effective and useful. In language studies jargon compositionality pertains to the act of merging language elements to build complex structures without introducing extra limitations aside from a broad (and arguable) idea of semantic clarity.. Also the assertion made on line 254 regarding how composition functions with setss inaccurate;; the sequence of words is essential (for example 'sugar caneâ€™ does not mean the same as 'cane sugar'). This constraint, in combining elements is extensively recorded..\nAnother important concern is the lack of consideration for elements that impact why people tend to prefer phrases over individual words (and vice versa) in certain situations which can lead to changes in how words are used in extensive collections of texts or writings as a whole. For example choosing to say 'male royaltyâ€™ of 'kingâ€™ or 'princeâ€™ can often reveal the speakerâ€™s purpose (such, as highlighting gender differences). Therefore the equation on line 258 (and the adjustment in KL divergence) is invalidâ€”not because of data noise. Due to inherent language mechanisms. Although this issue could potentially be discussed in the SDR section I am unsure, about it (refer to the comments.\nOn a note even though I have some reservations about how the authors structured their discussion on composition the paper effectively showcases how skip gram functions, which I view as a significant addition, to the field. \nThe topic of Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction seems a bit separate, from the points discussed before this section came up for me personally; understanding it was a bit tricky and I'd welcome some clarification from the authors in their response here If I've got this right so far; the argument posits that skip grams create representations where nearby words are structured based on an exponential parameterization of a categorical distribution However it's not entirely clear whether this corresponds with the distribution of the corpus itself (as opposed to a model based on counts).The research paper proposes that the reason behind the effectiveness of skip gram model is its utilization of SDR without making assumptions, about the structure of the data. Could it then be suggested that the generated representations are tailored for tasks that focus on patterns without being influenced by the real distribution of the dataset itself? In terms. Is there a hidden noise reduction happening in this process? \nMinor remarks; \nThe summary is quite long. Could use some trimming, for better clarity. \nIt appears inaccurate to view circularity in this context deceptive or misleading perspective to take here because Firths point about the relationship between co existence and similarity assessments corresponds with the cognitive processes that statistical techniques try to replicate. The effects of co existence and vector space representations essentially capture linguistic phenomena at their core without us having direct evidence of those phenomena. The comparison of similarities between pairs of items is not aimed at resolving circularity but, at enhancing the accuracy of modeling human assessments. \nLine 296 could benefit from using 'paraphraseâ€™ of â€˜synonym' considering the context revolves around a group of words and a distinct lexical element. \nThe conversation is really interesting. Its noticeable that a large portion of the Zipfan distributions tail shows quite even distribution. \nOne thing to consider is that analogy relationships don't always work perfectly in real world situations and sometimes the first neighbor returned (usually one of the terms being compared directly) \nI don't agree with the idea that 'manâ€™ can be considered equivalent to or interchangeable with anything related to â€˜woman.â€™ When conducting analogy calculations that involve subtraction, in this context there is an element of negation present which sets it apart from a simple composition process. \nA small suggestion overall. The paper refers to 'P(w | c)' for the likelihood of a word given a context; however in this case 'Wâ€™ stands for the context and 'Câ€™ represents the target word instead.. This unique notation can make the paper more challenging to comprehend maybe consider revising it for better clarity. \nHere is the rewritten text; \"Books and stories have always been a part of human culture.\"\nThe claim that Arora (2016)s work is the one exploring vector combination is exaggerated; for instance Paperno & Baronis research highlights the effectiveness of addition, in creating composed PMl weighted vectors. \nIn a study by D.Paperno and M.Baroni published in 2016 they explored the impact of composition on PMIA values within semantic vectors revealing that the collective effect may be lesser than the sum of individual parts in Computational Linguistics Volume 42 Issue 345, to 350. \nI'm sorry. I cannot complete the task without the specific text that needs to be paraphrased. Please provide me with the input text so that I can proceed with rewriting it in a like manner.\nThank you to the writers for their reply. I am eager to witness the acceptance of this paper. "
