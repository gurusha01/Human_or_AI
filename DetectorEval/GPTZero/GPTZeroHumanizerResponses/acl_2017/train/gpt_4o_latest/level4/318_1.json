            "inputText": "This research shows that improving word representation learning (WRl) by integrating sememes into an attention mechanism can be beneficial.The authors believe that sememes play a role in regulating WRL and tasks like word sense induction (WSI). They introduce the SE WRL model to identify word senses and refine representations concurrently.Even though the experiments indicate enhancements in WRL performance the actual benefits for WSI are not well defined due, to the evaluation being based on an analysis of only a few instances. The paper is nicely. Organized as a whole. \nIn the section of the opening part of the paper the writers list three key aspects of their study. Nevertheless items (one)( and (two)) come across as innovative methods rather than genuine contributions. The main focus, as perceived by the reviewer is on the outcomes that show how sememe modeling can produce effective word representations when compared to other existing methods (although its effect on WSI is not yet certain). Point number (three) however does not meet the criteria, for being a contribution or an innovation. \nThe three strategies suggested for SE WRL modeling make sense and can be easily ranked based on their anticipated effectiveness levels.The authors describe these strategies effectively. The experimental outcomes support these beliefs.However the reviewer sees MST as a strategy rather than a baseline because it seems influenced by Chen et al.(2014),where numerous WSI systems assume one meaning per word, within a context.MST frequently outperformed SSA and SAC. MST appears to be quite similar to SAT unless specified otherwise – the main distinction lies in representing the target word with its likely meaning instead of an average of all possible meanings weighted by attention as, in SATs case. In MSTs approach as well involves using an attention based mechanism to select the sense with the attention weight; however it remains uncertain whether the target word is solely represented by the embedding of the selected sense or some modification of it is also considered. \nThe authors failed to provide reasoning for why they chose certain datasets for training and assessment in their study.The mention of the Sogou T text corpus didn't offer insight since the reviewer isn't familiar with Chinese and it wasn't clear which dataset from the referenced page was actually used.There was also a lack of explanation on why two word similarity datasets were used and what sets them apart (such as one having uncommon words) even though the models showed varying performance, on these datasets. Using these datasets also made it challenging to compare our results directly with findings, from other studies which raised additional inquiries. \nIt's not certain if the suggested SAT model actually outperforms models in Chinese word similarity like the study by Schnabel et al in 2015 that achieved a score of 0.640 on the WordSim 353 dataset, with CBOW word embeddings; however there is no similar comparison included here. \nThere are some details that we need clarification about regarding model parameters like the sizes of vocabularies for words (for example; does Sogou T have 2.. Billion unique words?). Word senses (for instance; how many types of words are derived from HowNet?). The way the paper is written makes it unclear whether embeddings for senses and sememes across words were shared or not.The reviewer assumes they were shared. It raises a question as, to why 200 dimensional embeddings were used for only 1'889 sememes. Talking about the intricacies of model parameters could also prove helpful. \nThe analysis of the findings seems somewhat superficial possibly due to limited space available in the text; it doesn't delve deeply into the results apart from highlighting that SAT showed the strongest performance overall. Moreover the authors mention that sememes aid in acquiring representations, for common words but this assertion lacks supporting evidence from assessing a dataset with rare words. \nThe reviewer has looked through the feedback provided by the authors.
