It's crucial to address the alignment matter in the paper and maybe validate whether this alignment issue persists with an initialization seed. The authors suggest that the new model is notably distinct yet slightly more effective with a 10% decrease in errors. I ponder if merging it with the old model in an ensemble could produce superior outcomes if the errors are complementary, across the models; this could potentially enhance performance significantly. In general this paper is well crafted. I commend the authors for their thorough response. Consequently I am revisiting my review score. Adjusting it to a 4.\nStrengths; \n  The evidence that links attention mechanisms to multitask learning (MTC ) is strong. \n  The techniques are a fit for the job and the models hold their own when compared to the latest advancements, in the field. \nShortcomings; \n  The paper is missing information, in certain sections. \n  The suggested models lack originality. \nLets talk about topics; \nThis research paper presents a method for standardizing historical texts that stand out for its effectiveness in practice; however the key innovation lies in the idea that attention mechanisms for this purpose could be acquired through multi task learning with pronunciation modeling as an additional task—a fascinating connection, between attention mechanisms and MTL is put forward. \nHowever re are two areas where the paper could be enhanced.Firstly the paper doesn't clearly explain why an attention mechanism like the one used for normalization would be required for the pronunciation task.The authors point out that spelling variations often stem from pronunciation differences. This clarifies the link, between the two tasks(normalization and pronunciation).It is still not clear why applying MTL to tasks would lead to an underlying attention mechanism—and why this inherent mechanism would show improved performance without having an explicit attention mechanism included as well; this question remains unanswered, for now but providing a plausible hypothesis here could enhance the papers credibility. \nThe second problem is about clarity in the writing. While its usually clear enough to understand some key details are missing. The crucial detail thats left out is a thorough explanation of the attention mechanism itself. Since it plays such a role in the paper this method should be described in depth instead of just referring to previous studies. For example I felt that the explanation, in Section 3. 4 Wasn't very clear. \nI found Figure 4 hard to grasp well. Even though both models have the output dimensions I am puzzled by why their hidden layer dimensions are being directly compared. Usually the arrangement of states varies greatly among models and may even be rearranged, which makes such comparisons quite complex. \nThe comparison of the Kappa statistic between attention and MTL models should also be assessed in relation, to their statistics compared to the baseline model. \nIn Section 5 of the document. Is the row marked as \"< 0;21\" indicating the limit, among all datasets included in the analysis? \nIn Section 5 of the analysis report indicates that both the attention and MTL methods bring about modifications to the model (as shown in Figure 5). Nonetheless; the actual enhancements, in accuracy observed during experiments are modest (approximately 2%) which appears somewhat conflicting. "
