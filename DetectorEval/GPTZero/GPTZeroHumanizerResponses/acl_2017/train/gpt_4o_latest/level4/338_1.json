How does this compare to the dataset depicted in Table 2? What's the specific count of reviewers in Table 2. What percentage of them are considered labeled reviewers? It would also be beneficial to determine the number of reviews, per individual. If only a small number of reviewers provide reviews (meaning there's not much to go on) the outcomes could use a deeper conversation. \nLets talk about topics.\nThis research paper discusses the issue of detecting reviews in situations where there is little data available, for making decisions from scratch. The authors suggest using a network model that combines text and behavior data to analyze new reviews effectively. In terms the paper is well written and the findings are quite convincing. \nGrammatical errors; \n\"The new reviewer only gave us feedback.\"  \nJindal and Liu (2008 ) took the step. As it is an older work it may be appropriate to describe it in the past tense.   \nPlease replace contractions, like \"cannot \" \"could not \". What is.\"  \nThe new reviewer just posted a review that we need to address promptly. They haven't shared any reviews with us."
