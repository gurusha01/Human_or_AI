The authors assess the effectiveness of their method across vector spaces and languages by demonstrating consistent improvements on intrinsic benchmarks such, as SimLex 999 and SimVerb 3500. They also evaluate the technique in the scenario of monitoring dialogue progress and show tangible enhancements compared to embeddings that do not consider word structure.   \nIn terms I believe this is a well crafted paper. It offers a impactful method for integrating linguistic expertise into distributional semantic models and the practical findings are convincing. Though I have some queries and ideas detailed below none of them diminish the papers excellence or its appropriateness, for publication.   \nWriters Notes;   \nI'm a bit worried about using the morph evaluation set in your work because it seems like it might skew the results in favor of your approach by relying too heavily on assumptions that align with your models design rather than being unbiased and objective, like traditional datasets do. This could potentially cause some confusion. Make the evaluation less reliable overall since your performance is already solid based solely off standard datasets. I'd suggest leaving out this dataset entirely to maintain credibility and avoid any complications.   \nI think it's great that you included the morph fix baseline as it gives context to your work! However I suggest enhancing the evaluation by incorporating a baseline that relies on character embeddings well. Character based methods are in vogue for handling morphological differences nowadays; therefore a comparative study would offer a more thorough assessment of your work. Even though you referred to character embeddings in your research conducting a direct comparison, with them could enrich your analysis further.   \nThe suggested approach successfully reduces the distance between variations; however extending this to maintain significant geometric connections, in the vector space would be advantageous too.. For example; Does the equation \"looking. Look + walk = walking\"? A study showcasing that morphological alignment leads to a relevant space goes beyond just enhancing embeddings and adds significant value.. This could offer proof of the wider applicability of your method. "
