            "inputText": "\"Advantages;\"\n   The paper effectively lays out its contributions, from the beginning.   \n   The authors offer both the system and the dataset to ensure reproducibility.   \n   The visuals effectively depict the suggested methodology.   \n   The method is thoroughly explained.   \n   The writers test their method, on datasets and measure how well it performs compared to previous studies that have been published before this one.   \nAreas, for improvement; \n   In sections where the methods are discussed in detail and lack references to prior studies or repeat information already mentioned in the method sections could be improved by the authors for the final version of their work.   \n   The dataset does not have a README file at the moment; however the authors have assured that they will include one soon.   \nLets chat about topics.\n   In Section 2 part 2 of the paper they talk about DBpedia properties that were utilized as characteristics in their study; however it's not clear if all properties were included in the analysis process ٫or just a portion of them Were used? If only a subset was considered٫ then the authors should clearly specify which ones were actually used In their response to this query٫ the authors offered explanation and I strongly suggest that they include a detailed list of all features, in the final version to make sure that everything is transparent and can be replicated effectively.   \n   In Section 2 point three. The writers use the Bi LSTM CRF model from Lample et al.' Which is an idea to mention that the input includes word embeddings similar, to Lample et al.' work.   \n   Figure 3 presents a situation where it is not clearly specified if the KN references are originally, in the source language or if they have been translated into English by the authors for clarity purposes as mentioned in their response where they commit to rectifying this issue.   \n   Section 2 of the document indicates that when topics are related to each other in a domain context; certain characteristics could be influenced by that domain specificity It would be beneficial to examine how these features unique to a specific domain affect overall performance in this study The authors mentioned they plan to present the results of how these features impact performance in their final version as, per their response.   \n   In the section discussing research findings mentioned a comparison to the studies conducted Sil and Florian with a focus on differentiating supervised and unsupervised methods.The technique suggested is supervised during the training phase but does not rely on involvement, for generating training data.
