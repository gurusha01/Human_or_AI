            "inputText": "This study presents a collection of essay edits and showcases two possible uses; \n\nThe authors have set up the task as a classification exercise using an SVM classifier with features included mentioning that the dataset will be accessible for research use, at no cost. \nThe article is nicely organized and easy to understand. It's clear how they used an annotation system with two annotators to improve the corpuss quality.Think this material might catch the eye of scholars looking into writing processes and related topics.The added bonus of having two application scenarios, for the corpus was also quite nice. \nI do have two concerns though. The first one can be sorted out quite easily if the paper gets accepted but the second one would need a lot more work. \nThe paper doesn't include statistical information about the corpus required when discussing such a resource. Crucial details like the quantity of documents ( 180 since there are 60 essays with 3 drafts each) the token count (around 400 words, per essay?) and the number of sentences are omitted. If I'm right about this the collection contains 60 essays that add up to about 24 thousand words in total when you factor in all three versions. Thats roughly 72 thousand words altogether. Although theres a lot of overlap, between the drafts A summary table of these figures should be part of the document. \nIf the numbers mentioned are indeed precise as stated above the dataset seems to be somewhat limited in size. I understand the difficulties associated with developing annotated datasets. A factor I consider to be a positive aspect of this study. However I have doubts about how useful this resource would be for the NLP community as a whole. It is possible that presenting this work at an event such as the BEA workshop or a conference dedicated to language resources like LREC might be more appropriate than showcasing it at a general NLP conference, like ACL. In the paragraph of the text source provided by the authors refers to intentions of augmenting the corpus with extra annotations in order to extend it further.Would they also contemplate incorporating essays to tackle the constraint regarding size? \nAdditional. Some smaller details to consider; \nIn light of the fact that the collection comprises essays from a mix of individuals who're native and non native speakers alike​​​; another possible use could involve identifying the native language (NL) of the authors.​ \nOn page 7 substitute \"where the basic unigram feature was employed as the reference point\" with \"where the word unigram feature was used as the baseline\" for clarity. \nOn page 7 it's unnecessary and repetitive saying \"the SVM classifier was used as the classifier \" so it should be rephrased.
