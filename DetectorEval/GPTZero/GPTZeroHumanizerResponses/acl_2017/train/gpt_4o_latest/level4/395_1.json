The authors utilize a skip gram structure which lacks inherent depth—a discrepancy, in their approach. \nReinforcement learning is highlighted as a focus in the paper; however the reasoning behind it and how its executed lack clarity. In Section 3.. It tries to explain the task as a reinforcement learning puzzle. Points out two significant limitations that result in utilizing a Q learning technique instead. Nonetheless this approach doesn't match the policy as stated earlier resulting in an inconsistency, in the storyline. \nThe originality of the technique is uncertain at best as it mirrors the EM learning strategies closely. With the E step focusing on selecting an ideal sense and the M step enhancing a goal to refine sense representations accordingly.The authors fail to distinguish their method from EM or explain why reinforcement learning holds an advantage, over EM in this particular scenario. \nThe phrase \"pure sense representations' is frequently. Highlighted as a significant addition; yet its definition and advantages remain ambiguous and unsupported. \nThe writers claim that their model can efficiently select senses in time according to the text, under review; however​ the evidence supporting this assertion is lacking​. Bringing attention to this point in the appropriate sections would enhance the overall clarity of their argument​.\nThe statement about attaining cutting edge outcomes is predominantly grounded on the MaxSim C standard. Different studies have showcased effectiveness by employing the AvgSim C standard. Although achieving top notch results isn't the parameter for assessing a research papers quality the declaration presented in the abstract and introduction might be somewhat deceptive due, to the constrained assessment scope.
