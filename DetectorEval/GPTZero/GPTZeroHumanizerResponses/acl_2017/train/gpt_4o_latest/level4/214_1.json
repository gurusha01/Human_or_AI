            "inputText": "This paper presents a framework for organizing discussions on a larger scale.The researchers tested their approach by analyzing a set of 97 news pieces from the Chinese Treebank 8 database.They then crafted a system to pinpoint secondary connections and five discussion links (such, as association and explanation).\nThe writing in the paper is not very good. Its hard to understand at times.. I suggest that the authors get someone who speaks English as their language to check the manuscript carefully for mistakes in grammar and spelling.. As, for the content of the paperI have a concerns; \nWhen it comes to expressing ideas it's important to be clear and maintain consistency throughout your writing. \n   The papers reasoning seems unclear. Lacks proper justification. For example; what exactly do the authors intend by \"logical semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\" (lines 115–116)? It’s important to provide definitions, for these terms. \n   When looking at how the big picture of discussion's organized there seem to be some differences in how macro and micro structures are defined In Figure 4 we can see how macro and micro discourse structures are connected with the micro structure staying within paragraphs However in Figure 6 the micro discourse structure extends beyond paragraph limits and captures relationships between different paragraphs This representation in Figure 6 is quite similar to the macro structure shown in Figure 5 which seems to be applicable across different genres So why not use the structure, from Figure 6 instead? What benefits does the overall structure outlined in Figure 5 bring about? To me it appears to differ based on the genre and does not offer any details when contrasted with Figure 6. \n   Also can you tell me why sentences 6 and 15 are not shown in Figure 5? Is it because they are subtitles? If thats the case then why is sentence 12 included even though its also a subtitle? \nSection 4; Building the Corpus\n   The explanation of how the corpus was created lacks detail to fully grasp the concepts mentioned like \"discourse topic \" lead,\" \"abstract,\" and \"paragraph topics.\" It would be helpful to have examples provided in order to clarify these terms (lines 627–629). Additionally although the authors state that they intend to examine the connections between micro and macro structures, in their research work I couldn't find an analysis addressing this aspect in the paper. \n   Table 4 talks about the agreement research; however there are some points that need clarification from the authors.“It’s quite challenging to have results as the assessments of relation and structure are quite subjective.Our data is gathered at the leaf nodes level.”Firstly what exactly are these \"leaf nodes”? On a scale they seem to be paragraphs but at a closer examination they are actually EDUs.Would it not be more appropriate to present the agreement study results, for both macro and micro levels? The authors appear to have utilized a portion of the data for the agreement analysis in their study. This specific subset may not fully represent the quality of the dataset since achieving high consensus on annotations at lower levels doesn't necessarily ensure the same level of concordance on annotations, at higher levels. \n   Could you please provide clarification on the points mentioned in Section 4?\n     Table 4 lists terms like \"discourse structure\" and \"discourse relation\" which seem a bit unclear to me. Could you elaborate more, about what they refer to? \n     Table 5 raises a question about the term \"amount of macro discourse relations \" which might be better explained for clarity purposes regarding the relationships between paragraphs in comparison to those, between sentences shown in Figure 6. \n\n   The paper aims to enhance the discourse structure at levels but lacks convincing preliminary results in the current experimental setup. \n     \n     The characteristics utilized in the model lack descriptions and sufficient justification. \n     It's not clear why only some of the discourse relations listed in Table 6 were chosen for the discourse relation recognition test. \nIn my opinion the paper needs a lot of changes before it can be accepted.
