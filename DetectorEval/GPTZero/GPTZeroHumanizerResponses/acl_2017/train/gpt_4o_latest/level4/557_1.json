Structured in a clear manner. \nThe platform combines innovative methods like global optimization into a holistic approach, to neural relation extraction; the utilization of parser representation directly is especially fascinating. \nThe suggested method delivers top notch outcomes on the ACE05 and CONLL04 datasets, outperforming methods. \nThe document contains a variety of evaluations. \nAreas of improvement; \nThe approach seems to be building upon existing methods mostly. \nThe improvements in performance (an increase of point two percentage points, in the test phase results) though noticeable are not considered significant as no statistical tests were presented in the report. \nLets talk about topics and ideas.\nMain Remarks; \nHow did the recent parser and GloVe word embeddings influence the effectiveness of relation extraction, in the model? \nHow did the system deal with predictions, during the prediction phase? \nI have some feedback, to share.\nThe way local optimization is described in the introduction can be a bit misleading as it doesn't solely focus on the \"perspective but also takes into account the structural similarities, between incremental choices made along the way. \nIn Figures 6 and 7 it would be better to connect the data points with lines instead of curves. \nHow are objects depicted in the \" segmentation method\"?\nSome citations are not fully detailed with all the information provided; for example Kingma et al.s work from 2014 is found in ICLR without page numbers listed for Li et al.s publication, from the same year.
