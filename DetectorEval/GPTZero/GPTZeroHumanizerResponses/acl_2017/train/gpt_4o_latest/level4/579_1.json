It includes code and data sources, for reference.\nThe outcomes show potential. \nAreas, for improvement include; \nThe method depends on specific handcrafted rules, for minimizing.\nThere is a lack of attention given to literature on OIE.\nThe assessment of the experiment is well done. Lacks thoroughness. \nLets talk about something, in general.\nThis article discusses a problem faced by many systems that extract information from text (Open Information Extraction systems); the production of repetitive and unhelpful extractions that contain errors. The new approach called Minimize Open Information Extraction (MinIOIE) works to reduce these extractions by removing detailed parts and organizing them into different categories of structured annotations similar to the system named Online Linked Literature Extractor (OLLIE). The authors test MinIOIE on a performing Open Information Extraction system called ClausIE and assess its performance using two datasets available, to the public. Their findings show that MinIOIE generates concise extractions than traditional methods used in Open Information Extraction while still maintaining accuracy.\nIn general‚ the paper addresses an relatively unexplored aspect of OIE in a thorough and systematic way‚ It's well crafted‚ adequately detailed‚ and backed up with additional resources‚ including a clear Java setup‚ Nevertheless‚ my main worry is, about the completely fixed‚ predictable‚ and rule based character of MinOIE. Even though I understand that creating rules manually can work well for exactness in situations it can become a challenge to expand these methods across different languages (which is becoming increasingly common in Open Information Extraction according to Faruqui and Kumar in 2015 as well as Falke et al., 2016). Essentially the idea lacks originality and thoroughness since it suggests a sequence of crafted rules based off established Open Information Extraction systems, like ClausIE and ReVerb. I wish they had tried to understand and apply these minimization rules of just programming them directly into the system. \nFurthermore the article fails to acknowledge an area of study regarding \"semantically informed\" Open Information Extraction (OIE) that enhances conventional extractions by incorporating connections to knowledge bases and sense inventories like Wikipedia,Wikidata,Yago and BabelNet.This exclusion holds importance not in relation, to previous research but also concerning the methodology employed. For instance adding an Entity Link module, to the OIE process could automatically recognize \"Bill of Rights\"(line 554) as a registered entity without considering its parts. Likewise a sense inventory can effectively manage the data related to collocations and multi word phrases mentioned in Section 6. 2. It is worth mentioning that the authors themselves use WordNet and Wiktionary to create their list of collocations, which could have been incorporated in a structured manner. \nFinally sharing some thoughts on the assessment.\nEven though MinOlE is said to be a method of approach in their study trials only with ClausIE as its core OIE system (seemingly the prime choice). It would have been beneficial to examine if the enhancements of MinOlE remain steady across OIE systems for a more thorough evaluation of its adaptability, as an after processing utility. \nIn Section 7 of the paper we should have also considered the OIE benchmark introduced by Stanovsky and Eagan in 2016 which offers results for other comparison systems, like TextRunner and KrakeK that were not discussed in this paper. \nReferences; \nManaal Farooqi and Shankar Kumar presented a paper titled \"Multilingual Open Relation Extraction using Cross Lingual Projection\" at the NAACL HLT conference in 2015. \nTobias Falke collaborated with Gabriel Stanovsky and Iryna Gurevych to adapt an Open Information Extraction System from English to German, at the EMNL P conference in 2016. \nNdapandula Nakashole and colleagues presented a research paper titled \"PATTY\" at the EMNPC conference in 2012 that delves into a taxonomy of patterns, with semantic types. \nAndrea Morro and Roberto Navigli presented their work on \"WiSeNet,\" a project that involves constructing a network using information, from Wikipedia and incorporating ontologized relationships during the CIKM conference in 2012. \nAndrea Mor and Roberto Navigli presented a paper titled \"Incorporating Syntactic and Semantic Analysis into the Open Information Extraction Paradigm\" at the ICAJI conference in 2013. \nClaudio Delli Bovi along with Luca Telesca and Roberto Navigli published a study titled \"Large Scale Information Extraction from Textual Definitions through Deep Syntactic and Semantic Analysis\" in volume 3 of TACL, in 2015. \n\"Gabriel Stanovsky and Ido Dagan authored a benchmark, for Open Information Extraction, which was presented at the EMNL conference in 2016.\""
