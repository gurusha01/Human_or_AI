These results nicely support the description of the tagging system and the assessment of triplets.   \n\"Areas, for improvement;\" \nOne significant aspect of this paper is the labeling system outlined in Section 3. 3. Nonetheless there exist known tagging methods for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), like IO, BIO and BILOU.   \nWere any tests carried out by the authors to try tagging methods with this approach?   \nOn line 14 of page 5 in the dataset section mentioned by the authors includes details about 24 relations, without outlining the count or categories of named entities involved in them.   \nIn Section 4. 14 They introduce the evaluation standards, for triplets. Did these standards originate from studies ? It seems like the entity identification process is not fully done when only the entitys head is taken into account.   \nFor instance in Table 4s S4 entry, from the LSTM LSTM Bias model evaluation. Was the correctness of the output deemed accurate according as indicated by the text itself if the relational role is deemed inaccurate; however it remains uncertain if this influences the assessment process.   \nLets talk about some topics.\nThis article presents a labeling system and investigates comprehensive models for simultaneously extracting entities and relationships.   \nThe article is nicely organized and easy to follow; this makes it easier to grasp the method being proposed.
