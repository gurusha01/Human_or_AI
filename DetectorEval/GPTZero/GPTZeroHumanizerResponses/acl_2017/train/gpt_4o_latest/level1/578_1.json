This innovative model represents the comprehensive semantic graph parser for MRS by utilizing deep learning techniques to progressively forecast linguistically intricate graphs. This parser undergoes assessment using MRS based graph representations such as DMRS and EDS alongside Abstract Meaning Representation (AMF) demonstrating top tier proficiency, in MRS parsing and producing outcomes in AMF parsing tasks. The system is also much quicker than grammar based parsers thanks, to GPU batch processing. \nKey Contributions\nThe paper presents an effective parser for MRS that outperforms other attention based models and achieves an impressive Smatch score of 86.69%. This achievement is important as it fills the need for parsing of linguistically complex semantic representations, with broad coverage. \n   \nUsing a stack based model combined with attention and pointer networks to predict alignment is an innovative technique that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of parsing non planar dependencies significantly compared to basic encoder decoder models. \nThe model is used for AM Return, on Asset (ROA) analysis. Performs well when compared to leading parsers that use outside sources This shows how broadly the suggested method can be used with other types of semantic graphs. \nAdvantages\nThe parser shows top notch performance in MRS parsing by existing benchmarks and yielding notable enhancements in EDM and Smatch scores across various MRS graph formats, like DMRS and EDS. \n   \nEfficiency and Scalability Considerations; The parser operates faster than traditional grammar based parsers such as ACE due to its utilization of GPU batch processing and incremental prediction techniques.This feature renders it well suited for applications, on a scale. \nThe models superior performance is boosted by combining stack based features and hard attention mechanisms to tackle graph structures effectively. \nThe research paper conducts a range of experiments to compare various graph linearizations and model architectures along, with attention mechanisms in a detailed manner. \nAreas, for improvement\nComparing the parser to ACE without delving into an examination of its linguistic expressiveness in relation to grammar based methods hinders the clarity of results, for tasks driven by linguistic motives. \n   \nThe model excels in AMF parsing. Falls short compared to leading parsers that make use of external resources such, as syntax trees.The study could have delved into integrating these resources to enhance performance more. \nData Dependency Issue The model heavily depends upon supervised alignments for MRS parsing this could restrict its usage, in low resource languages or fields lacking annotations\nAsking Authors Questions\nHow does the parser manage sentences that have incomplete meanings when there are no definitive alignments available? \nIs it possible to expand the suggested model to accommodate semantic parsing as well, as what changes would be needed for that integration? \nHave you thought about using language resources like syntactic trees or semantic role labels to enhance the performance of AME parsing? \nAdditional Thoughts \nThe article presents an argument in favor of employing neural transition based parsing to achieve linguistically rich semantic representations. It suggests that upcoming research could investigate semisupervised or unsupervised methods to lessen the dependence, on annotated data. Furthermore a thorough qualitative examination of parsing errors could offer perspectives on the models constraints. "
