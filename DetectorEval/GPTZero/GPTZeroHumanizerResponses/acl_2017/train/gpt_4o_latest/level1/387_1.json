The researchers suggest using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract features, from both text data and eye tracking data in order to overcome the limitations of conventional feature based methods. The effectiveness of this proposed technique is validated using two accessible datasets that include eye tracking information and shows better performance compared to existing systems that rely solely on text or manually crafted gaze features. \nKey Contributions;   \nThe main focus of this study is the creation of a CNN based system that can extract features from gaze data without requiring feature extraction efforts—a noteworthy progress that tackles the complexities involved in capturing linguistic nuances through manual modeling methods.   \nThe study shows how blending gaze related attributes with textual characteristics in a cohesive CNN design yields better outcomes in discernment and irony assessment tasks, than models solely based on text.   \nThe authors extensively tested their method on two datasets. Demonstrated notable enhancements compared to existing techniques in a statistically significant manner.They delved into the examination of acquired characteristics to shed light on how gaze data plays a role, in capturing both pragmatic subtlties. \nAdvantages;   \nThe study presents a method, for cognitive NLP by incorporating gaze data into a deep learning model—an area that has not been extensively studied before This research is timely and contributes to the progression of multimodal NLP investigations.   \nThe new technique shows enhancements in F scores for identifying sentiments and sarcasm, in tasks—especially on Dataset 1—where the multimodal CNN surpasses both conventional and text only CNN methods.   \nIn their study findings are thoroughly examined by the authors through analysis covering factors like embedding dimensions and gaze channels (fixation vs saccade) as well as learned feature representations which contribute to better understanding and trustworthiness, in their conclusions.   \nScalability and Automation are factors in this framework as they help streamline the process of extracting features from gaze data while minimizing human bias and reducing the need for manual feature engineering effort. Ultimately enhancing its suitability, for real world applications. \nAreas of improvement;   \nThe method being suggested is tested using two small and specific datasets in the evaluation process which may raise doubts, about how well it can be applied to larger and more varied datasets or different NLP tasks.   \nThe authors recognized that there are problems with overfitting on Dataset 1 and noted that additional fine tuning is necessary, for the models regularization methods and hyperparameters.   \nRely on Gaze Data Limitation; Even though incorporating gaze data is an approach its dependence on specific equipment like eye trackers restricts its usefulness, in situations where such data is not accessible.   \nLimited Progress in Identifying Sarcasm Using Gaze Data Only brings enhancements in sarcasm detection and prompts doubts about the effectiveness of the multimodal method, for this purpose. \nQueries, for Writers;   \nHow well does the suggested approach work, with datasets or datasets that do not include gaze information included within them and is it possible to modify the framework to accommodate synthetic or deduced gaze data instead?   \nHave you thought about trying out types of deep learning models like transformers that have proven to be very effective, in tasks related to natural language processing (NLP)?  \nWhat difficulties might arise when adapting this structure to analyze sentiments across documents or for tasks such as identifying emotions, in natural language processing (NLP)?  \nIn summary this research illustrates...  \nThis article introduces a method of combining cognitive and text related elements for identifying sentiments and sarcasm in a thoughtful manner with positive outcomes and valuable insights provided by the analysis involved. Nonetheless its heavy dependence on gaze information and the narrow range of assessments conducted could potentially limit its usefulness, in contexts. Exploring scalability, generalizability and different architectural approaches further would enhance the significance of this study. "
