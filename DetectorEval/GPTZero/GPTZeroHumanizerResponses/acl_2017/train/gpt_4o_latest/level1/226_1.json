Expand upon the principles of the SICK corpus design used for evaluating English CDS models in order to suit the specific features of Polish language.The dataset produced includes 10 000 pairs of sentences marked for correlation and implication along with metrics showing its consistency, among annotators. Changes made in the SICK method consist of rules for transforming sentences based on language specifics and verifying sentences automatically modified by humans, with both backward implications. \nKey Contributions; \nThe main achievement is the establishment of a top notch dataset for assessing CDS models in Polish that's accessible publicly â a significant addition for a language with scarce NLP resources and providing a standard akin in importance as the SICK corpus, for English evaluation purposes. \n   \nNew Linguistic Adjustments for the SICK Approach in Polish are discussed by the writers who have come up with language conversion guidelines that cater specifically for Polish nuances like flexible word placement and complex morphology structures fused together in meaningful ways. This development represents a noteworthy addition, within the extensive realm of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP).\nThe paper emphasizes the significance of annotating relations in two directions which improves the datasets usefulness, for assessing CDS models. \nStrong points; \nA noteworthy contribution of resources is the datasets value for the NLP community and its significance for researchers focusing on languages with resources is evident The datasets comparability with the SICK corpus underscores its importance for studies, across languages. \n   \nThe writers offer an clear account of how they created their dataset by explaining linguistic changes made to it as well as the guidelines for annotations and metrics, for inter rater agreement. All of which boosts the credibility and reproducibility of their research work. \nHigh Annotation Quality Statement; The agreement among annotators (Îº = 0,732 for entailment and Î± = 0,780 for relatedness ) suggests that the dataset can be trusted and is appropriate, for its intended use. \nThe study shows how the suggested method can be adjusted for use in languages with limited resources which makes it a useful resource for upcoming research, on multilingual clinical decision support systems (CDS).\nAreas needing improvement; \nThe methodology doesn't offer newness beyond the adaptation of the SICK corpus design for Polish data; though the dataset is valuable, in itself. \n   \nRelying on verification and post correction for altered sentences could hinder scalability, with bigger datasets or different languages lacking similar linguistic knowledge. \nEvaluation of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Models in the Paper lacks a real world assessment of CDS models using the dataset, which could have shown how useful the dataset is, in practice and brought attention to its difficulties. \nQuestions, for Writers; \nHow do you think the dataset could be utilized to assess CDS models of Polish context such, as cross language transfer learning or tasks related to multilingual NLP? \nCan you explain in detail how your approach can be adapted for use with other languages that have fewer resources available, to them and have linguistic structures that differ greatly from Polish? \nAdditional thoughts; \nThis paper adds value to the field by filling the gap in evaluation resources for CDS models in Polish language research field despite having limited novelty; the dataset marks a noteworthy advancement, in multilingual NLP studies.
