            "inputText": "Reviewing the Submission \n  \nThis study delves into how Regular Graph Languages (RGLS) when used in natural language processing (NLP) can portray probabilistic graph models in a formal manner. The authors suggest that RGLS are a subset of both Hyperedge Replacement Languages (HRLS) and Monadic Second Order Languages (MSOLS) thereby possessing characteristics related to meaning and compatibility, with intersection rules respectively. The document highlights two contributions;   \nA demonstration showing that Regular Languages are closed when intersecting them using their properties in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSOL).  \nA new method has been created for analyzing RGL structures from the top down with a runtime that scales linearly with the size of the input graph and operates within limitations.   \nThe writers make a case for RGLs ability to find a ground between being expressive and computationally efficient which makes them well suited for representing semantic graphs, in NLP applications They also mention the drawbacks of RGL and propose potential expansions to wider subsets of strongly context free languages (SCFL).\n  \nA fresh perspective on RGL in NLP is presented in the paper as it introduces a formalism that has not been widely explored within the NLP community before now. The authors make an argument for the importance of RGL by emphasizing their probabilistic nature and ability to handle intersection closure properties. Features crucial for tasks such, as semantic parsing and machine translation.   \nThe theoretical significance of proving that Regular Graph Languages (RGL) are closed under intersection cannot be overstated in the realm of graph based Natural Language Processing (NLP). This finding positions RGL as an option alongside Hierarchical Regular Languages (HRL) and Monadic Second Order Logic (MSOL) for NLP applications using graphs and effectively addresses a crucial drawback of HRL. Its lack of closure, under intersection.   \nThe new down parsing algorithm is efficient and shows a clear computational edge over standard HRD parsing methods, in terms of complexity analysis and focus on boundary representations and normal ordering.   \nThe exploration of RGL in connection with SCFL and other related formal structures such as Tree Grammars and Restricted DAG Grammars holds importance as it places the research within a wider theoretical framework paving the way, for future investigations.   \nAreas of improvement  \nThe paper makes theoretical points but falls short in providing real world evidence of RGLs practical usefulness in NLP tasks through empirical testing such as applying the parsing algorithm to datasets like AMRs or comparing its performance, with existing HRGs based approaches would enhance its credibility.   \nExpressivity Issues; The paper recognizes that Restricted Graph Languages (RGL) might pose limitations on semantic graph structures as demonstrated by the awkward depiction of the sample graph, in Figure 4. Such constraints beg the question of how RGL can handle intricate Natural Language Processing (NLP) assignments.   \nThe detailed theoretical material would be easier to follow with a presentation style despite its meticulous nature. For instance the explanation of the parsing algorithm and its rules for inference could be tough for those not versed in HRD parsing. Using examples or visual aids might make it more understandable, for readers.   \nAssumptions in Parsing Note include the identification of nodes, in an input graph may not always apply in real world situations fully acknowledged by the authors; however; a more thorough exploration of its consequences would provide valuable insights.   \nQuestions, for Writers  \nHave you tested out the parsing algorithm on real NLP datasets to see how well it works in practice yet or have you thought about how it could be used in real world tasks without any experiments so far?   \nHow do Recursive Graph Logic (RGL) stack up against formal models such, as Tree like Grammars or Restricted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Grammars in terms of their expressive power and computational efficiency?   \nCould you offer some instances of natural language processing tasks where rule based generation languages would have clear benefits, over heuristic rule languages or machine learned statistical models?   \nGeneral Evaluation   \nThis article presents a theoretical advancement by introducing RGL concepts to NLP and demonstrating their closure under intersection operations.The suggested parsing method is an enhancement despite its practical effectiveness yet to be proven.While the study is constrained by its emphasis on theory and the limitations of RGL usage it paves the way for intriguing research avenues.I suggest approval contingent on the authors addressing any clarity and applicability issues, in the revised edition.
