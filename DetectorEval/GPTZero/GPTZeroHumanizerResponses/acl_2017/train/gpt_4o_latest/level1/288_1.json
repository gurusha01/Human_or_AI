Crafting a narrative new coherent conclusion and a disjointed ending.A straightforward linear classification model employing these elements is devised to effectively identify and categorize these tasks with remarkable accuracy even without factoring, in the narrative context. Moreover the classifier excels in the story cloze challenge, by outperforming learning models. The reported advancements include;   \nThe presence of stylistic variations, in writing tasks indicates how cognitive processes impact writing style.   \nUnderstanding how NLP tasks are designed is crucial as it highlights the significance of task instructions to prevent unintentional stylistic biases from creeping in.   \nA groundbreaking achievement, in the story completion task has been accomplished by merging elements with a neural language model.   \nThings we're good, at  \nThe research sheds light on writing styles and the way tasks are presented affects the outcome of the writing style; whether its creating a cohesive or disjointed conclusion has an impact, on how our thoughts are expressed through words.   \nImpressive empirical findings are observed with the classifier showcasing accuracy levels ranging from 64, 1% 75 7% in classifying writing tasks and reaching a new leading position at 75, 7%, in the story closure test demonstrating the success of integrating stylistic attributes with a neural language model.   \nThe straightforward method and clarity of interpretation are highlighted by employing a classifier with clearly defined characteristics such as ngrams and sentence length analysis, in this case study.This approach offers perspectives on stylistic variances.Additionally the examination of features boosts the explanatory capability of the paper.   \nPractical Implications for Designing NLP Tasks; The paper discusses the biases that can arise from task instructions and provides practical suggestions, for creating more reliable NLP datasets.   \nAreas, for improvement  \nThe results hold up well in the story cloze task format; however it's uncertain how applicable they are to types of writing tasks or fields, outside of this context. The research paper could be strengthened by conducting experiments using datasets to confirm its wider relevance and applicability.   \nThe classifier focusing much on style without taking into account the context of the story brings up questions about whether it accurately captures task specific cognitive processes or just leverages surface level patterns without depth in understanding the connection, between style and coherence which could bolster its arguments.   \nThe paper briefly touches upon how writing tasks relate to states and cognitive load but fails to thoroughly investigate these connections, in depth.The inclusion of cognitive science viewpoints could enrich the theoretical aspect of the discussion.   \nQueries, for Writers  \nHow applicable are the results to datasets or writing assignments apart, from the story cloze task?   \nIs it possible that the classifiers heavy emphasis, on elements without considering context could cause it to become too tailored to dataset specific biases? How could this impact its effectiveness when faced with tasks?   \nHave you thought about including subtle cognitive or psychological assessments to enhance the link, between writing assignments and emotional states?   \nOverall Evaluation   \nThis study adds value to our comprehension of the relationship between writing assignments and style by presenting robust empirical findings and useful insights for designing NLP tasks effectively; although enhancements in generalizability and theoretical intricacy could be beneficial, for further refinement of the papers quality.
