(1)A process of post editings where user corrections are progressively included and (2)a domain adaptation method incorporating specific terminologies from the domain as restrictions. Both instances demonstrate enhancements, in BLEU scores which highlight the success of this approach. \nThe authors highlight the ranging usefulness of GBS in different text creation tasks like summarizing content and generating dialogues and image descriptions.When the experiments primarily study MT (machine translation) the potential, for influence is quite intriguing. \nAreas of expertise;   \nGBS is a variation of beam search that is adaptable and widely applicable compared to previous methods since it doesn't depend on specific input output alignments or structural presumptions. \nThe experiments clearly show the impact of GBS on enhancing translation quality in interactive post editting (+20 BLEUG points after four rounds) as well as in domain adaptation (+13​ ​points, for EN​. PT).\nThe paper is nicely. Easy to understand with clear descriptions of the algorithm provided along with detailed pseudo code and comprehensive experimental setups.This ensures that other researchers can easily access and replicate the work, in the research community. \nEfficiency Aspects Discussed by the authors involve looking into the intricacies of GBS and suggesting methods, for parallelization to keep the algorithm feasible for real world applications. \nAreas that could be improved upon;   \nThe experiments conducted have a focus despite the authors assertion of wide applicability; they only cover machine translation (MT). Including assessments of GBS in tasks, like summarization or dialog generation could enhance the overall claim of universality. \nScalability Issues Addressed; As the number of constraints grows in GBS operations increases its runtime complexity potentially hampering its scalability in situations with constraints considered in the analysis presented in the paper lacks an in depth examination of performance deterioration, as constraints increase. \nThe paper lacks a comparison of GBS, with recent constrained decoding methods tailored for neural models which would offer a more comprehensive assessment of the strengths and limitations of GBS. \nQuestions, for Writers;   \nHave you thought about using GBS for tasks than machine translation, like summarizing or creating dialogues?   \nHow well does GBS fare in situations with constraints, such as more than 10 constraints present in the scenario ? Are there approaches to address any decline, in performance that may arise?   \nCan you compare it to ways of decoding that also have limitations, like using flexible restrictions or additional attention methods in the process? \nIn conclusion   \nThis document introduces an advancement in the realm of limited decoding by introducing a new algorithm that is adaptable and efficient at the same time\\. Although there is room to broaden the range of experiments conducted; the findings are persuasive and indicate a significant potential for wider influence\\. I suggest accepting it with a condition to tackle scalability issues and include more comparisons, with other approaches\\."
