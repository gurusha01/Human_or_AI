Test various methods of blending textual information with factual market data (such, as early fusion and stacking approaches). Their findings reveal that merging these types of data enhances the accuracy of predictions significantly—especially in predicting outcomes over longer time frames. \nThe paper thoroughly examines the risk factors to different sectors and explores the feasibility of developing customized models for each sector. Although the overall model performs better, than sector models because of limited data availability the research emphasizes the distinct features of various sectors and how they impact forecasting volatility. \nAdvantages\nA new approach has been developed that involves utilizing word embeddings to enhance term weighting methods marking a progression, from previous strategies. This techniques outcomes effectively showcase its superiority in enhancing prediction accuracy. \n   \nThe research paper carries out assessments through various experiments such as cross validation and temporal validation along with sector specific analyses to support its findings effectively by utilizing multiple baseline methods, like GARCH and previous text based approaches. \nThe emphasis on predicting long term market fluctuations and incorporating both textual and market information tackles issues in financial prediction with implications that are relevant, for both academic research and industry applications. \n\nAreas, for improvement\nThe paper mentions that sector specific models don't perform well because of a lack of data but doesn't discuss ways to address this problem like using transfer learning or data augmentation. \nThe fusion methods computational complexity poses a challenge with the MKM method being notably resource intensive.There is a lack of exploration in the paper regarding its adaptability and practicality, for extensive applications. \nThe paper talks about the significance of terms like \"fire\" and \"beneficial\" in different sectors but doesn't thoroughly analyze how these terms impact model predictions.A more in depth look, into feature importance could improve understanding of the results. \nThe data is, from U.S stock market reports so the results may not apply to other markets or regions and this limitation is not specifically mentioned. \nDear Authors, Queries, for You \nHave you thought about utilizing transfer learning or other methods to tackle the lack of data, in models tailored for industries? If not yet considered these strategies for overcoming data scarcity in models – how do you intend to handle this challenge in your future research endeavors? \n   \nCould you elaborate further on the expenses associated with the MKl technique in contrast to other methods of fusion and its adaptability, for handling larger datasets efficiently? \nHow well does your approach adapt to shifts in the jargon over time? For instance; How would it cope with the introduction of terminology or ideas, in financial statements? \nHave you considered looking into adding types of text features, like sentence structure or context details instead of just using basic word representations? \nAdditional thoughts.\nThis study provides insights into forecasting financial market volatility by integrating both textual information and market data effectively as mentioned in the papers content summary statement; It discusses the potential benefits of this combined approach but suggests improvements in dealing with challenges like sector specific model limitations and the need, for enhanced scalability and interpretability to enhance its impact further.
