The researchers analyze NLB standards and suggest a partially automated technique for creating varied linguistic datasets from databases like DBpedia.The created dataset (DBPNLG) is contrasted with an already existing dataset (RNNLG) showing its greater diversity, in input structures,difficulty level of language and range of syntactic forms. The writers also assess how well a sequence, to sequence model performs on both sets of data and demonstrate that DBPNLG poses a difficult learning challenge. \n\nA key aspect of our work is the development of a automatic system, for producing text datasets from knowledge bases.This innovative approach enables the construction of datasets that encompass a range of semantic and linguistic variations.This method overcomes the shortcomings of benchmarks that are based either on synthetic data or domain specific collections. \n   \nThe researchers introduce a dataset created from DBpedia that offers diversity in attributes and syntactic structures than the commonly used RNNLG dataset.This dataset proves useful, for training KB verbalizers and microplanners adept at managing NLG tasks. \nThe research paper extensively compares DBPNLG and RNNLG across measures such as input variety and model performance on text complexity in the field of NL generation study which emphasizes the difficulties associated with DBPNLG and underscores its significance, in progressing NL generation research. \nBenefits\nThe new approach is original. Tackles an important issue in natural language generation (NL The system makes it possible to generate datasets from real world knowledge bases advancing the training of verbalisers and microplanners, for knowledge bases significantly.L).\n   \nThe authors thoroughly compare DBPNLG and RNNLG by examining metrics and machine learning performance in detail to bolster the papers assertions regarding the datasets varied and intricate nature. \nThe authors have provided a resource to the community by releasing the DBPNLG dataset and suggesting its utilization in a collaborative project to advance research, in natural language generation (NLg) especially focusing on neural generation models. \nFocusing closelyon microplanning is a key aspect of this datasets design as it aims to aid in mastering intricate microplanning subtasks, like lexicalization,reorganization and dividing sentences – areas that are typically neglected in current benchmarks. \nAreas of improvement\nThe paper only focuses on one type of evaluation when assessing the dataset with a sequence, to sequence model without considering advanced NLGs or methods which affects the applicability of the results related to the datasets complexity. \nThe DBPNLG dataset is considered varied in content compared to RNNLG; however its smaller size might restrict its usefulness, for training extensive neural models immediately as mentioned by the authors who have intentions to enhance the dataset further which is yet to be carried out. \nEnsuring the quality of crowdsourced content is essential; however the paper lacks data on how well annotators agree or how effective the validation process is which may lead to doubts, about the datasets dependability. \nDear Authors, Inquiries, for You.\nHow will you handle the size of DBPNLG compared to RNNLG in upcoming versions of the dataset? \nHave you thought about assessing the dataset with NL generation models, like transformers or pre trained language models to get a more comprehensive understanding of its complexity? \nCould you share information, about how well the crowdworkers agreed with each other and how the crowdsourced text was validated for accuracy and quality control purposes? \nAny further thoughts?\nThis paper makes a contribution to the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) by addressing the shortcomings in current benchmarks and introducing a new framework for developing linguistically varied datasets. Despite some areas that could be enhanced further the proposed DBPNLG dataset shows promise, in advancing microplanning and neural generation studies. I suggest accepting it with revisions. "
