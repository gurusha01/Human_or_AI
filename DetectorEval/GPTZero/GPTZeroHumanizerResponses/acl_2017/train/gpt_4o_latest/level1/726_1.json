The platform is built to enhance itself over time based on user input and minimal interference by utilizing contributions from the public for forecasts. The authors showcase the efficiency of their technique through tests on datasets (such as GEO880 and ATIS) as well as a practical application on an educational database. Moreover they also introduce a dataset (known as SCHOLAR ) specifically, for academic database inquiries. \nKey Contributions\nThe paper suggests a sequence to sequence model that creates SQL queries without the need for intermediate meaning representations in a direct manner This method makes full use of SQLs expressive capabilities while overcoming the constraints of earlier systems dependent, on manually crafted rules or interim representations. \nIntroducing Feedback Based Learning Approach; The writers present a feedback loop that involves users giving input to identify queries which are then annotated by crowd workers to enhance the model performance efficiently and speedily across different domains, with reduced annotation requirements. \nData Augmentation Methods; The study uses schema templates and rephrasing to kickstart the model with artificial data for the system to manage intricate queries even during initial deployment phases. \nThe authors showcase the practicality of their method by implementing a system for an academic database—an important demonstration of how semantic parsers can be effectively built in real world scenarios, with minimal manual input. \nA valuable resource has been made available, with the launch of the SCHOLAR dataset containing natural language utterances and SQL queries for academic database search purposes; this will greatly benefit the parsing community. \nAdvantages\nIn real world scenarios the feedback based learning system is ideal because it reduces the need for intervention and adjusts to different fields, through user driven enhancements. \nThe suggested model shows results on standard datasets (like GEO880 and ATIS) even though it faces challenges, in generating SQL directly and its effectiveness is confirmed through real world use. \nInnovative Data Augmentation involves utilizing schema templates and paraphrasing as an approach to tackle the cold start issue and empower the system to manage intricate queries right from the start. \nThe report offers an assessment by combining benchmark tests with real world implementation to give a complete evaluation of the method employed in the study.The interactive learning simulations conducted also showcase the flexibility of the system. \nThe SCHOLAR dataset release and its accompanying database make a contribution that will support upcoming studies, in semantic parsing and NLIDBs. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe paper talks about the quality of user feedback. Doesn't dive into a thorough analysis of the models errors in detail (, like certain SQL structures or types of queries that challenge the model). This could offer an understanding of the methods constraints. \nReliance on crowd workers to annotate queries may not be sustainable for specialized domains, like medical or legal databases as mentioned in the paper without discussing potential solutions to this challenge. \nEvaluation of Advanced Queries; Although the model shows performance with GEO880 and ATIS datasets which are not very large and have simple queries; conducting a more comprehensive evaluation, with bigger and more intricate datasets would enhance the credibility of its generalization claims. \nInterface User Friendliness Issue; The feedback collection interface is briefly mentioned without an assessment of how user friendly it is or its influence on feedback quality quantitatively. A study involving users could offer insights, in this area. \nInquiries, for Writers\nHow does the system manage situations when user queries are missing information resulting in the possibility of multiple valid SQL results? \nCould the suggested method be adapted to accommodate query languages such as SPARQL or ElasticSearch, with minimal adjustments needed? \nWhat were the particular difficulties faced during the implementation phase and how were they resolved? \nAdditional Remarks. \nThis paper provides insights into the realm of semantic parsing and NLIDBs with a notable emphasis, on practical application and continuous enhancement efforts. Rectifying the identified shortcomings could significantly boost the effectiveness of this study. "
