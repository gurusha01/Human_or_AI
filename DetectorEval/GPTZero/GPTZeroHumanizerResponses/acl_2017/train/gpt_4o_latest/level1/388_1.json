The writers enhance the DEPLAMBDA system. Initially tailored for English. To enable its use in linguistic contexts by utilizing the multilingual features of UD annotations. UDEPLAMBDA undergoes assessment, through parsing for question answering using Freebase; the trials are carried out in English and also include German and Spanish languages. The writers also offer translations in languages for two standard datasets. WebQuestions and GraphQuestions. To make cross language assessment easier. The outcomes show that UDEPLAMBDA surpasses starting points in various languages and attains top notch results, on the GraphQuestions dataset in English. \nThe key points highlighted in the paper are;   \nThe creation of UDEPLAMBDA marks a milestone in the field of linguistics by introducing a new language independent semantic interface, for Universal Dependencies (UD). Unlike its predecessor DEPLAMBDA that was restricted to English only   \nThe authors have included Spanish translations of two standard datasets for multilingual evaluation purposes in assessing the performance of semantic parsing systems, across different languages.   \nAchieving results in practical applications is a key strength of UDEPLAMBDA as evidenced by its impressive performance in WebQuestions and its groundbreaking achievement in GraphQuestions for English language tasks; moreover demonstrating consistent effectiveness across different languages, like German and Spanish further highlights its robustness.   \nAdvantages  \nThe paper makes a contribution to multilingual natural language processing research, by expanding semantic parsing across different languages through the use of universal UD annotations.   \n\"The assessment is comprehensive. Includes experiments carried out in three different languages and across two datasets.The outcomes are well explained and showcase the performance of UDEPLAMBDA compared to standard methods.\"  \nResource Contribution; Offerings of Spanish translations for WebQuestions and GraphQuestions serve as a valuable asset to the community by fostering more exploration, in multilingual semantic parsing endeavors.   \nTask Agnostic Design Approach; The frameworks use of UD annotations of language specific features allows for its wide application, across various natural language understanding tasks.   \nAreas, for improvement  \nThe framework prioritizes language independence, over semantic analysis by not distinguishing between active and passive constructions or standardizing terms like \"broke.\" This might limit its usefulness in tasks that demand semantic comprehension.   \nRelying on the quality of UD parsers significantly impacts UDEPLAMBDAs performance. Evidenced by the outcomes, in German that showcase how parsing inaccuracies affect semantic representation.   \nThe paper mainly discusses question answering. It would have been helpful to test UDEPLAMBDA on other tasks, like entailment or summarization to show its wider usefulness.   \nQueries, for Writers   \nHow does UDEPLAMBDA deal with languages that have syntactic structures like those found in languages, with complex morphology or limited linguistic resources?   \nCould you explain further about how errors, in UD parsing could affect tasks that come after it and what steps can be taken to reduce these impacts?   \nAre there any considerations to include semantic features or outside sources to overcome the limitations of the framework regarding lexical semantics?   \nIn summary   \nThis study marks an advancement in cross language semantic analysis through the introduction of a universal semantic framework for Universal Dependencies (UD). Although there are challenges in managing meanings and relying heavily the quality of UD data sets the findings are significant and are expected to make a lasting impression, in this area of study. I suggest approving it with some revisions to tackle the identified shortcomings. "
