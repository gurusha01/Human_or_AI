Additionally they achieved top notch performance, in realization (32· 13 BLEW).   \nA comprehensive preprocessing system that involves anonymizing data and grouping named entities, with scope identification has been shown to greatly decrease sparsity issues and enhance the effectiveness of the model.   \nExtensive research shows that seq to seq models are generally unaffected by the order in which graphsre linearized. Indicating their ability to handle any irregularities that may arise during the conversion from graphs, to sequences. \nAdvantages  \nThe suggested approach shows a remarkable enhancement of more than 5 BLE U points, in AM R realization when contrasted with previous efforts showcasing the efficiency of the paired training process and preprocessing sequence.   \nA cutting edge Paired Training Technique is being used in this study. The self training method that merges unlabeled data with fine tuning on annotated data stands out as a significant advancement, in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning research methodology.   \nThe authors thoroughly investigate the effects of preprocessing steps such as anonymization and scope markers through in depth ablation studies to show their importance, in parsing and realization tasks.   \nThe discovery that seq to seq models are indifferent, to the order of linearization holds importance as it streamlines the preprocessing process and underscores the adaptability of the suggested method.   \nQualitative Assessment; Adding error analysis and real life examples gives us an understanding of the models strengths and weaknesses, in dealing with long distance relationships and coping with issues related to coverage and fluency. \nAreas of improvement  \nParsing capabilities are somewhat limited in this method with results (61, 19 SMATCH) but not quite reaching the level of more resource intensive approaches such, as CAMRand SBMT.Hence it seems that the proposed method may not completely leverage the full semantic depth of AMRand graphs  \nRely significantly upon datasets like Gigaword for self training which could restrict its effectiveness in settings with limited resources and no access, to such datasets.   \nSignificant gaps in coverage and fluency are evident, in the analysis of the completed sentences of the model. Especially when dealing with intricate or extensively nested AMRs which could pose limitations on its practical applicability.   \nThe document points out a bias in human created AMRs by revealing details about the order of realization that could lead to inflated performance results.The paper suggests that employing randomized or stochastic orders, for evaluation could enhance the credibility of the findings.   \nAuthors often receive questions.  \nIs it possible to modify the paired training method for languages or subjects with resources especially when external datasets, like Gigaword are not accessible?   \nHow does the system deal with named entities or unfamiliar graph structures when making predictions?   \nCan the writers share information, about the computational expenses involved in the paired training process when adapting it for larger datasets?   \nIn summary   \nThis research paper brings advancements to AMR parsing and realization with its innovative training method and showcasing the effectiveness of seq2seq models in handling graph linearization challenges. Even though the technique shows performance in realization tasks its dependence on external datasets and the restricted parsing outcomes stand out as notable limitations. Despite these drawbacks the paper stands out as a contender for acceptance due, to its groundbreaking methodology and comprehensive analysis. "
