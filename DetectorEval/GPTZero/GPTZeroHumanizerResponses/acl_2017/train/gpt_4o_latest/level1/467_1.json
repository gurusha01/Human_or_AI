Offers a detailed account of the suggested approach and its theoretical foundation.The experiments cover a range within the selected language pairs; however wider assessment across various languages and a comparison with recent unsupervised methods would enhance the studys credibility.In general the paper presents an addition to the domain of bilingual word embeddings specially in situations, with limited resources.
