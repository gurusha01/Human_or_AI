The approach integrates the position of words in the document into a modified PageRank algorithm that prioritizes words appearing earlier and more frequently. The effectiveness of PositionRank is validated across three datasets of works through comparisons with established models like TextRank and SingleRank as well as competitive techniques such, as TF IDF and TopicalPageRank. The suggested approach shows enhancements in performance of around 29% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and consistently performs better than baseline measures in terms of precision values and recall rates as well, as the F score. \nKey Contributions\nThe new Position Based PageRank Algorithm introduces an innovation of incorporating the position of words within the PageRank system to prioritize words that appear at the beginning of a document with higher probabilities, than those appearing later on in the text.This represents an improvement compared to current unsupervised approaches that overlook positional indicators. \nThe authors thoroughly assess PositionRank using three datasets to showcase its reliability and versatility in various scenarios.The model consistently surpasses leading approaches and even outperforms computationally intensive methods such, as ExpandRank and TopicalPageRank. \nEfficiency and Simplicity; PositionRank stands out for being computationally efficient compared to supervised methods or models that rely on datasets like topic models in TopicalPageRank; it only needs the target document, for extracting keyphrases. \nAdvantages\nThe PositionRank demonstrates advancements in various metrics such as MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) precision rate accuracy and recall rates compared to other baseline models with a substantial relative boost of, up to 29%.\nUtilizing position details in a setup is a fresh and well supported approach here as shown convincingly in the experiments where gathering position data, from all instances of a word yields better results compared to models that rely solely on the initial position. \nThe technique is versatile. Can be used across different document types beyond academic articles as mentioned in the final remarks. \nPositionRank prioritizes simplicity and efficiency by eliminating the requirement for information or intricate preprocessing such as training topic models, which enhances its suitability for practical use in real world scenarios when compared to approaches, like TopicalPageRank. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe assessment is only focused within a range and is limited to academic papers titles and summaries without exploring its effectiveness in other areas, like websites or emails as proposed by the writers. \nPosition Weighting Heuristic Perspective; The method of position weighting (inverse sum of positions) while intuitive lacks a theoretical basis, for justification.It would be intriguing to contrast this heuristic with weighting approaches. \nRely on using part of speech filtering like nouns and adjectives might restrict the model from grasping phrases containing verbs or other word categories that are significant, in specific areas. \nQuestions, for Writers\nHave you tried using PositionRank on sources than scholarly documents like news articles or web pages and how does it compare to the existing standards, in those areas of study? \nHow much does the models performance change based on the position weighting scheme chosen by the user? Have you explored options for weighting strategies, such, as using exponential decay? \nCould we expand PositionRank to include language features, like syntactic dependencies while still keeping it unsupervised? \nAdditional Notes \nThis study significantly enhances the area of keyphrase extraction with its innovative and successful incorporation of position details, into a graph based ranking system as demonstrated through the experimental outcomes provided in the papers findings section.It would be beneficial to address the noted constraints to enhance the papers impact and widen its relevance more.
