The researchers show that the model performs better in terms of BLEU scores compared to byte pair encoding (BPE) based models after one epoch and is on par with the latest character based models for tasks like translating between English French (En Fr) English Czech (En Cs) and Czech English(Cs En). Moreover the model demonstrates its ability to grasp morphology effectively and deal with spelled or nonce words giving it an edge, over word level models. \nThe key aspects highlighted in the paper include; \nA new design for character level Neural Machine Translation (NMT); The incorporation of a decoder and a word encoder that is aware of morphology marks a notable progression in character level modeling, for NMT purposes sidestepping the challenge of dealing with extensive vocabularies and facilitating effective training processes. \nThe model excels in understanding morphemes. How they combine together which enhances its capacity, for broader generalization and quicker training speed. \n\nAreas of expertise\nThe thought out hierarchical decoder and morphology aware word encoder in innovative architecture tackle important issues, in character level NMT by effectively managing lengthy sequences and acquiring significant representations. \nThis model is quite efficient even though it uses six RNN units; it manages to achieve BLEUscores with less training time compared to similar character level models. \nThe research showcases evidence that the model grasps morphology well through PCA visualizations and the capability to manage intricate or unfamiliar morphological forms. \nThe capacity to convert spelled and newly coined words is an exceptional and beneficial attribute to have; especially when dealing with chaotic or content produced by users. \nThe thorough evaluation includes experiments across language pairs and offers detailed comparisons, with both word level and character level benchmarks. \nAreas of opportunity\nThe model is quite competitive but doesn't always surpass the notch character based models in terms of BLEUs scores consistently; authors need to explain the balance, between efficiency and ultimate performance better. \nScalability Issues; The suggested design is effective for analyzing characters. Could encounter scalability issues with lengthier sequences or extensive datasets as, per the reports omission of investigating deeper RNN models or prolonged training periods. \nThe paper focuses mainly on presenting results; however including qualitative examples of translations such, as the handling of rare or morphologically complex words would enhance the credibility of the claims regarding morphology learning. \nThe authors briefly touch upon the possibility of applying the technology to tasks, like speech recognition and text summarization but fail to present any evidence or elaboration to back up this assertion. \nQueries, for Writers\nHow does the models effectiveness improve with training periods or more complex RNN structures potentially leading to better performance compared to state of the art character based models in terms of BLEUs scores?\"\nCan you share real life examples or specific instances to demonstrate how the model deals with uncommon words that are misspelled or have complex forms? \nHave you looked into how changing hyperparameter settings like the size of embeddings and the number of layers affects how well and efficiently the model works? \nFeel free to share any thoughts or feedback.\nIn terms the article offers a strong and creative method for character level NMT that is well justified and innovative, in nature I believe that by acknowledging its shortcomings and offering more qualitative perspectives it could greatly enhance the overall quality of the paper.
