            "inputText": "Checking over the submission\nOverview of the Report\nThe study presents a challenge in the field of multi document summarization (MDS) called concept map based MDS that focuses on creating summaries as concept maps instead of conventional text summaries. To facilitate this task the researchers introduce a dataset consisting of 30 topics with around 40 web documents for each topic along, with associated gold standard concept maps. A new method involving a crowd sourcing approach without much context was used to develop the dataset that identifies the significance of statements in extensive document groupings efficiently.This method includes an evaluation process and a basic system for the task at hand which is now accessible to the public along, with the dataset and tools provided by the authors. \nKey Contributions\nThe main innovation presented in the paper is the introduction of concept map based MDS as a fresh summarization task that resonates with how people tend to structure information in formats rather, than traditional prose summaries. \nThe writers introduce a dataset for MDS based on concept maps to overcome the absence of proper evaluation collections, for this purpose. \nThe paper introduces an approach to annotating the importance of text in crowdsourcing tasks that manages to balance scalability with cost and annotation quality effectively. A method that could prove beneficial, for various summarization tasks too. \nA starting system and assessment criteria are included to provide a basis for studies, in this area. \nAdvantages\nInnovative and Relevant Approach; The concept map driven MDS assignment represents an useful expansion of conventional summarization tasks that cater to practical requirements for well defined and easily navigable summaries in real world scenarios.This project effectively bridges a void, in the discipline. \nThe dataset is carefully crafted with quality checks and thorough examination of its attributes. Incorporating web documents of different types enhances its value by mirroring the complexities encountered in real world summarization tasks. \n\nA thorough assessment is essential as it incorporates evaluation criteria such as exact match comparisons and metrics like METRO and ROUGE‑3 alongside a standard system to establish a robust basis, for comparing upcoming projects. \nThe decision to publicly share the dataset along, with the baseline and evaluation scripts using a license is praiseworthy and is expected to promote wider use and ongoing exploration in this field. \nAreas of improvement\nThe systems performance is not satisfactory as it struggles to cover essential concepts accurately and lacks efficiency in extracting relationships, between them. \nThe use of crowdsourcing method may have its limitations in terms of generalization as the effectiveness of the low context importance annotation scheme is specific to this task only and its suitability for areas or tasks, with more loosely organized outcomes is uncertain. \nEvaluation Criteria; The evaluation criteria put forward primarily look at how propositions align with each other at a fundamental level; however they might not completely grasp the effectiveness of the entire graph layout (such as coherence and connectivity) which holds significance, for concept maps. \nThe ultimate stage in creating a concept map hinges on the expertise of annotators. This could potentially hinder the expansion of creation, for larger or varied datasets. \nQueries, for Writers\nHow does the suggested low context significance labeling approach stack up against conventional document level annotation techniques in terms of cost and effectiveness? \nAre there any intentions to delve into sophisticated foundations, like neural models to overcome the shortcomings of the existing system concerning relation extraction specifically? \nCould we expand the assessment criteria to include analyzing the structure of the concept maps, such, as assessing graph coherence and usability?\n\"How effectively can the dataset be applied to areas, outside the realm of subjects?\"\nAnything else you'd like to add? \nThis submission adds insights to the field of summarization by introducing a fresh task and offering top notch resources to back it up.The initial system and assessment criteria could be enhanced further; however the paper establishes a groundwork for upcoming studies, in concept map driven summarization.
