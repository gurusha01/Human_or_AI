Firstly translating into a form of the target language and then selecting morphological elements, for each produced word followed by inflecting based on those features. \nWhile the authors focus solely on one language pair in their research project the challenge they tackle is an overlooked aspect within present day machine translation frameworks. Their methodology sets them apart from techniques that hinge heavily on byte pair encoding and models operating at the character level. Of following these recent trends they take cues from past studies like \"Factored Translation Models\" and \"Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages with Synthetic Phrases \" though regrettably omitting proper citations, for these references. \nHowever  presenting METRE results without including BLEW scores or providing qualitative advancements can be worrying. If there isn't an improvement, in BLEW scores the writers should explain why their method is effective using METRE results and sample sentences as evidence.\nMoreover the authors delve into addressing issues related to gender and number in their work; however they fail to consider the aspect of person, in detail which could benefit from some discourse. Furthermore the effect of rescoring on gender accuracy remains ambiguous. It is not apparent why the reranker does not opt to stick with the top result when accuracy is already high. \nThe paper also needs a review for errors in spelling and grammar along with improvements in word choice and style before it can be considered ready for publication, in its current state. \nIn conclusion‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äå‚Äã‚Äå‚Äã‚Äå‚Äã‚Äã‚Äå‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äå‚Äã‚Äå‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äå‚Äå‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äãof the paper looks good far but needs some refining to tackle the issues mentioned earlier like assessing multiple language combinations providing more evaluation criteria and meticulous proofreading done on it hoping to see this work revised in an upcoming conference, with all necessary enhancements and additions made. \nI encountered an error. The system generated a dump of information.\n\"Lol it looks like they misspelled 'Zhange' as 'Zhond'. Silly mistake!\"  \n\nThe section, on related research consistently references \\cite of using \\newcite.\nThe text includes many unnecessary phrases, like \"its important to note that \" and \"its worth noting.\"\nLines 182 and 184 are uncertain about whether \"The used phrase based MT system\" pertains to Moses specifically or phrase based MT systems, in general.\nLine 191 erroneously uses the term \"software.\"\nLine 196 should have the terms \"academic and commercial levels\" pluralized as the use of the term \"level\" seems ambiguous.\nLine 210 suggests that it would be more accurate to use \"A simplified target\" instead of \"A morphology based simplified target.‚Äù\nLine 217 appears to be unclear, about the decisions regarding simplifying aspects.\nTable 1 has spaces and does not clearly show the distinctions, between lines.\nThe process of simplification is not clearly. It is uncertain whether the individual simplifying it does so manually or utilizes a preexisting tool.\nI think \"for example\" should be used of \", in other words.\"\nPreferred phrasing would be \"train on or train for.\"\n\"Our design takes inspiration from Colloberts suggestion \" or \"Our architectural approach is influenced by the proposal put forward by Collobert \" provides clarity.\nLine 324 does not require a comma.\nAccording to the equation it suggests that all words have a common word vector represented by W.\nThe systems decision on whether to use plural forms is ambiguous and needs to be reconsidered with respect, to the input data.\nLine 445 shows a lattice structure resembling a \"sausage lattice.\"\nFor example using \"for instance\". A comparable phrase is required\nError, in spelling detected for the word \"syllable.\"\nLines 500 and 503 require examples or explanations for the terms \"palabras llanas\" (words with emphasis in the penultimate syllable) and \"palabras estr√∫gulas\" (words with emphasis, in the antepenultimate syllable).\nLine 570 is unclear when it comes to sentences exceeding 50 words.\nLine 571 prefers the use of \"by means of zh segmentation tool.\"\nLine 574 may have an error ‚Äì \". Could be a better choice, than \"and\".\n\nLine 597 should say \"copora,\" not \"corpus.\"\n\nThe effect of increased embedding sizes, on performance remains uncertain.\nLine 615 seems unclear when mentioning that \"seven and five are the values.\"\nThe cause for the rise, to 70 remains uncertain.\nTable 3 displays hyperparameters as opposed to model parameters.\nThe statement \"coverage is, than 99%\" is not clear.\nLine 653 is not very clear, about the term \"descending.\"\nLine 666 seems a bit confusing, with the term \"\"\nA space should be included before the \"\\cite\" references.\nWhen comparing options using \"by or \"by a large margin\" is better, than using \"by large.‚Äù\nLine 716 seems ambiguous.\nLine 729 appears to be ambiguous, in its description regarding the phrase based method.\nThe citation in the zh segment lists the year, as 2016; however the tool was actually released in 2009.
