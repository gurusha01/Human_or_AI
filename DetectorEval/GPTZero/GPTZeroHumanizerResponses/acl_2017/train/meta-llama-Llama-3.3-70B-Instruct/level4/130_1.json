It is recommended to shorten the five pages by highlighting technological advancements and showcasing English translation samples from narratives like those found in the ABCD and/or Cinderella datasets instead of including broader NLP background references (like Salton 1989 in section 4. 23). Unrelated topics such as sentiment classification and pedestrian detection, in images (lines 652–654). \nThe inclusion of stories in Portuguese texts within the ABCD dataset sparks inquiries into the methods used to establish word similarities for forming word embeddings.However the authors fail to indicate where they obtained the continuous word representations used in creating word level networks (lines 272–289). Likewise the lack of clarity regarding the training origin of word level ( n grams ) networks for generating word embeddings ( lines 513–525 ) raises questions, about their approach. It's not clear if merging these two types of networks actually enhances accuracy or what exactly \", out of vocabulary words \" as mentioned in line 516 mean. \nLets have a chat about something, in general.\nStudying NLP to uncover issues is vital and adds an intriguing dimension to this papers content.\" Furthermore \" its emphasis on NLP for Portuguese fills a void since resources for this language are fewer compared to English.\" Explaining the process of computing embeddings, for these languages is an aspect that warrants further elaboration.\"\nThe text needs to be revised by shortening sections 4 and 5 and providing experimental information in section 6 while clarifying the transcription standards, for NURBSP N338 EF and N331 D5. \nTechnical Feedback; \nLine 029 should say \"… like a lightweight…\" of \"…as it a lightweight…\". \nLine 188 needs to be adjusted to \"natural language processing ( NLP )\" of \"PLAIN LANGUAGE\".\nLine 264 needs to be revised as it contains words (\"out of cookie, out of the cookie\") that require correction. \nIn Table 3s row and third column area of data marked as \"72 point zero \" needs adjustment to display as \"72 decimal zero \" to maintain consistency. \nIn lines 995 to 996 and 1005 to 1006 of the document are the DOI numbers listed twice with a mistake in the link attached to the title in lines 992, to 993 leading to a different paper than intended.
