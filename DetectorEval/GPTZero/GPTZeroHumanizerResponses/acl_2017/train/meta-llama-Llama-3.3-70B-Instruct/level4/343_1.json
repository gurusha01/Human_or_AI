Clear to understand with a set of experiments that confirm the strength of the new approach suggested in the study. However there is a concern that comes up. The approach suggested is semi supervised in nature and involves using resources to pre train characters. Additionally it makes use of training datasets for pre training purposes. On the hand the comparisons, with the standard methods are based more on supervised learning techniques. In general semi supervised learning tends to outperform learning because it can make use of a wide range of additional information sources. Hencefortht’s compare it with semi supervised methods to accurately assess if this method stands out as superior. \nSorry I cannot assist with that request.\nAlthough the gold dataset isn't directly utilized in training the segmentation model itself; employing another \"gold standard\" dataset, for character embeddings training may create a comparison scenario by providing the proposed method with an advantage.
