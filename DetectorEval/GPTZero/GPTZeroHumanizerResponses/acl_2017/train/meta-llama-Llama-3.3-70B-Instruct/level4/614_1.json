            "inputText": "This paper introduces a way to improve the lexical substitution process by integrating word sense collections into current methods and using them to refine potential substitutions. The authors present a measure to evaluate how sense inventories can be substituted for each other by incorporating human assessments in the lexical substitution task. They also test the substitutability effectiveness by comparing inventories sourced from WordNet and PPDB. Additionally they suggest a view clustering strategy to automatically create a sense inventory, from PPDB rephrasings, which is then combined with a basic WSD technique to filter out potential substitution options. \nThe main strong points of this project are; \nThe creative concept of merging vector space models with sense inventories, for the lexsub task is intriguing because these methods offer types of information that complement each other well. Especially considering that vector space models tend to miss out on nuances in meaning and multiple senses of words. \nThe assessment by the oracle offers insights into how much the suggested approach could improve things; it shows a notable contrast between the GAP scores before and after filtering by the oracle system while still leaving a gap, between the oracles scores and the real ones. \nHowever there are a drawbacks that have been observed.\nThe view clustering methods efficiency remains uncertain since the paraphrase similarity perspective consistently outshines the other perspectives and their combinations. This raises doubts about the relevance of the viewpoints. Conducting a thorough examination of the distinctions and similarities among these different perspectives is crucial, to formulating definitive conclusions. \nThe document is a bit confusing as some parts seem disconnected and don't have links between them. For example The connection between sections 2 point 11 and 4 point three isn't clear. The part, on multi view clustering needs some revisions since the subsections appear mixed up and lack proper references. \nThe lackluster results regarding nouns are worrying considering the assertion that the clustering method can be applied universally to all parts of speech – a claim not substantiated by the outcomes. \nThe manuscript is quite clear regarding the methods and experiments discussed by the authors who exhibit progress in the lexsub task through their dual strategy approach; although there are still some lingering questions to ponder; \nThe reason for including /narrower terms (lines 221, to 222).\n\"The importance of balance, in X^p is highlighted in lines 367 and 368.\"\nThe method of assigning weights seems random (lines 387 to 389).\nAdjusting the number of clusters according to the SubstClus^{p] perspective can influence the outcomes and final assessments significantly. \nThis method could possibly be applied to similar tasks beyond lexicon substitution, for wider applicability.
