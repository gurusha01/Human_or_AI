            "inputText": "Advantages; \n   The manuscript clearly outlines its contributions right from the beginning and offers a clear insight, into the authors’ goals. \n   Having both a system and a dataset improves the usefulness and reproducibility of the paper. \n   Using visuals, like figures really helps to see and grasp the approach being suggested better. \n   The authors provide an explanation of their methodology to help readers understand their techniques thoroughly. \n   The writers rigorously assess their method by testing it on datasets and comparing it to previously published studies. \nAreas, for improvement; \n   Some parts of the text focus much on methodological specifics, without citing relevant studies and these explanations are repeated unnecessarily in the method sections corresponding to them.The authors have recognized this problem. Are dedicated to resolving it in the final draft. \n   The dataset doesn't have a README file at the moment. The authors have promised to fix this issue soon. \nLets chat about topics; \n   In Section 3 of the paper mentioned DBpedia properties as features without specifying if all properties were used in the analysis a clearer explanation, with a list of the features employed would improve clarity and reproducibility as noted by the authors. \n   The Bi LSTM CRF model described by Lample et al in Section 2 is enhanced by using word embeddings as input in a manner, with the approach outlined by Lample et al. \n   In Figure 3 of the documents illustration section is in need of some clarification concerning how the knowledge nodes (KNs) language representation. Whether it is in the original source language or, in English since the mentions have already been translated into English by the authors who plan to address this issue. \n   Section 2.A suggests that the connection, between topics could bring in domain characteristics that might influence the outcome positively or negatively—an examination of how these factors affect performance could offer meaningful perspectives and the authors have confirmed their intention to incorporate these findings in the completed edition. \n   The section discussing research makes a significant contrast with the studies conducted Sil and Florian to highlight the difference between supervised and unsupervised methods. Although the new technique relies on learning it cleverly sidesteps human involvement in creating training data introducing a unique twist to the debate, between supervised and unsupervised approaches.
