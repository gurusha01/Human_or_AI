            "inputText": "Benefits; The suggested system offers a tool, for teachers and learners alike by offering a detailed evaluation of Grammatical Error Correction ( GEC ) systems. \nWeaknesses include a lack of depth, in the systems description and an evaluation methodology that lacks credibility. \nCasual Chat; \nThis article presents a method to enhance the results of GEC systems by incorporating error types this approach is beneficial, for educators and students as it offers clear error details and allows for a thorough comparison of GEC systems based on accuracy and specific error type metrics. \nThe systems description is missing specifics concerning the fundamental aspect of rules created manually by users. The authors need to give examples of these rules and explain their quantity and complexity while also discussing how they interact with each other. Rather than that focus area the paper spends much time evaluating systems from CoNLL. 2014 With repetitive content, across text and tables. \nThe assessment of the suggested system falls short in ways for a couple of reasons; First and foremost the assessors ought to have developed a gold standard for the 200 trial sentences instead of simply rating the systems results. This approach could have facilitated a precise comparison. Secondly the methodology outlined in the paper for averaging assessor ratings deviates, from common practices and might obscure significant inconsistencies. For example if each \"poor\" rating was assigned to edits the genuine percentage of \"poor\" edits could potentially be markedly higher than the average reported. Thirdly the paper does not provide details on the test data including how error categories there are and their distribution.Moreover the reference to \" edit boundaries\" needs further explanation along, with examples to grasp how it affects the systems functionality. \nThe writers argue that their system is not as reliant on domains as systems that need data for training purposes do require It is debatable whether this claim holds true since rules crafted manually can be tied to particular domains and the systems reliance, on language stands out as a significant limitation compared to machine learning methods The test data utilized FCE test and CoNLiL2014 are confined to one area student essays\nThe addition of another group of error classes appears redundant since we already have established tagsets like the one outlined in Nicholls (2003) or the CoNNL 2014 tagset could have been employed instead to enable the evaluation using the CoNNL gold standard. \nIn summary the main reason behind the paper is not clear enough The purpose of introducing a system or a set of error categories is not well explained and crucial details are missing The discussion and motivation, for evaluating CoNNL 2014 systems are insufficient as the results presented are superficial\nI noticed some errors in spelling and layout.\n\"Correction, for line 129 and others; use 'cf.' instead of 'cf'.\"\nCorrection, for l366 and others; Change \" M² \" to \" M squared \" (using ￼). \nPlease provide clarity on \"50 to 70 Farenheit 01 \" such as specifying the intended meaning, like \"50 to 70 percent.\"\nMake sure to review the references for any errors in case usage, like \"es1 of \"ES1 (line 908) and \"Fleiss,Kappa (lines 878 and 879).
