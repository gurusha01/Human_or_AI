Notably missing are references, to studies. \n  Tiziano Flati and Daniele Vannella collaborated with Tommasi Pasini and Roberto Navigli on the MultiWiBi project in 2016 to create a taxonomy based on Wikipedia content. \n  The authors of the 2007 publication titled \"DBpedia. A Core Element of an Open Data Web\" are Soren Auer et al. \n  Gerard de Mel and Gerhard Weikum collaborated on a project in 2010 called MENTA, where they developed taxonomies using data, from Wikipedia sources. \n  In 2010 Zornits Kozareva and Eduard Hovy developed a technique that combines supervised and unsupervised learning to create taxonomies using data sources. \n  The authors of the study titled \"WikiNet\" include Vivi Nastase and Michael Strube among others in 2010. \n  Simone Paolo Ponzetto and Michael Strube published a study in 2007 on creating a taxonomy using information sourced \tfrom Wikipedia. \n  Simone Paolo Ponzetto and Michael Strube authored a study, in 2011 on building a taxonomy using a shared knowledge base. \n  Fabian M Suchanek along, with Gergji Kasneci and Gerhard Weikum published a study in 2008 called \"YAGO \" which delved into creating a comprehensive ontology sourced from Wikipedia and WordNet. \n  Paola Velardi along with Stefano Faralli and Roberto Navigli co authored a paper titled \"Ontolearn Reloaded,\" introducing a graph based method, for taxonomy inference in 2013. \nThe experimental section is quite disappointing because it only contrasts with \"patterns identified by Hearst \" without taking into account the mentioned studies. \nThe papers effectiveness, in showcasing the real world application of its principles is weakened by the absence of thorough comparisons. \nLets chat about a variety of topics.\nThe paper is nicely. Straightforward to understand with helpful additional resources included in itt! Howeverr it could benefit from including references to the extraction of's a relations and taxonomy literature as this would add depth to the contentt.. The experiments appear to have a focus due to the lack of these references.. Moreoverr the comparisons showcased are not thorough enough as they do not consider more pertinent systems, beyond just \"Hearst patterns.\"While the authors have responded and engaged in discussions with reviewers for their papers assessment process and considered their feedback diligently; the papers lack of experimental depth and failure to connect with existing literature, on is a relation extraction and taxonomy development are still pressing issues that need addressing. Even though the references cited mainly deal with taxonomy creation aspects; a detailed analysis exploring the boundaries of taxonomy could have been carried out for a more comprehensive evaluation. After considering the comprehensive feedback from the author and engaging in discussions with other reviewers​ the rating may be revised to 3​​​; however​​​ it is important to acknowledge that the research papers experimental limitations​ and its failure to situate itself adequately within the existing literature remain significant areas, for improvement.
