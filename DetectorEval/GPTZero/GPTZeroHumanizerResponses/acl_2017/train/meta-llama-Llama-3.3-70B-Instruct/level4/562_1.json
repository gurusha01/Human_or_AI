The authors have really added to the field by developing a large dataset for relation extraction presented as question answering; this could be a helpful asset, for the community. \nAreas of improvement; \nOne significant drawback of the paper is its failure to compare and recognize studies and works, in the field—a factor that brings up questions regarding the originality of the findings put forth. \nLets talk about it; \nThe authors view relation extraction as a task of understanding text passages and gathering information effectively to build reading comprehension models for extracting relations between entities in text data sets.They created a dataset comprising 30 million relations transformed into natural language queries through the assistance of mechanical turk annotators, from a schema.They employed a reading comprehension model introduced by Seo et al.in 2016. Enhanced it to include the option of returning \"no relation \" contrasting the initial model that consistently provides an answer. The main goal and result of the research appear to achieving zero shot relation extraction – identifying relationships that are encountered only in testing situations. \nWhile the paper is nicely crafted and presents a concept it lacks thorough experimental assessment and fails to adequately compare itself with previous research. This makes it difficult to establish convincingly that the papers contributions are truly original and influential. \nThe authors failed to consider an amount of previous research work in their study area. For example Neelakantan and colleagues in 2015 (available at this link; https;//arxiv.org /abs150406662 ) utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for extracting relations without training using knowledge base paths. Similarly Verga and team in 2017 (accessible at https;//arxiv.org /abs160605804 ) conducted relation extraction, on entities that had not been encountered before. The authors referenced the work of Bordes et al. who gathered a dataset and used memory networks typically employed for reading comprehension tasks to perform relation extraction. However they just mention that their data was marked at the \"relation\" level of the triple (relation and entity pair). It's not clear why Bordes et al couldn't have followed the approach as well, as presented in a NAACL 2016 paper (https;//www.aclweb.org /anthology/N/N16/N16 2016.pdf) which conducted relation extraction using a novel model using memory networks and there are probably more related research works available. It's important to reference and highlight the uniqueness of the research compared to existing studies from the start, in the introduction to distinguish it from previous work. \nFurthermore the writers don't test their model on a dataset or compare it to previously published models on their own dataset. This undermines the credibility of their findings. Given the abundance of research already done in this area and the lack of originality in their work the authors should conduct experiments that prove their method surpasses others in this field or demonstrate that their dataset stands out from others (such, as its size enabling generalization)."
