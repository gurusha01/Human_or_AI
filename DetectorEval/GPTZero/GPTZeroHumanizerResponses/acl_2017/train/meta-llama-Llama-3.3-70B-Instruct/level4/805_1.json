To begin with the document includes spelling errors that ought to be rectified, such as; \nThe text detector looks at heuristics and perplexity to decide if your text was created by a machine learning model or written by a human. It examines the distribution of parts of speech and typical markers of AI generated text.\nChange the mention of \"figure 2\" to \"figure 1\" in line 176 to 177.\nThe phrase \"within the ranks\" shows a duplication and should be adjusted to \"among the top.”\nIn the article it would be helpful to mention \"figure 4' earlier to provide context. \nLine 434 should be amended to read \"the dataset contains,\" as it is grammatically correct. \nPlease correct \"table 3\" to \"table 1”, for consistency. \nFurthermore​s​ it is important to substitute all mentions of \"Tensorflow​s​, with \"TextFlow​s​ for representation. \nMoreoverm there are inaccuracies that need to be addressed.  \nThe paper should provide an explanation of the precision in computing features like lemma and part of speech (POS) or WordNet synset accuracy and its potential impact, on assessing overall similarity accuracy. \nEven though the neural networks are coded in Python language the experiments code availability, for replication is not specified.  \nThe text talks about sharing training and evaluation sets. Does not explain how exactly they are shared. Like whether its done upon request or under a license. Which is important, for replicating the experiment accurately. \nDuring the conversation or discussion, about this topic area it's important to keep in mind these aspects to improve how clear, repeatable and high quality the content is.
