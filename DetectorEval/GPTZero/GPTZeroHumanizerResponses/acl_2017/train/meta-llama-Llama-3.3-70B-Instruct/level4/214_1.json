            "inputText": "The paper introduces a framework for analyzing large scale discussions and tested it in a small study with 97 news articles, from the Chinese treebank 8 dataset. The researchers also created a system to detect main sub relationships and five distinct conversation patterns (collaboration, expansion, sequence, context, cause and effect ) within this dataset. \nThe writing, in the paper isn't great. Makes it hard to understand at times. I suggest that the authors work with an English speaker to carefully check the manuscript for errors. When it comes to the content there are an issues that need addressing ;\nThe rationale, behind the paper seems ambiguous. Lacks clear justification. \n   Lines 115, to 116 should clearly define what is meant by \" semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\" to ensure understanding. \n   The difference between macro and micro discourse structures can be tricky to grasp at glance. In Figure 4 we see a blend of both types of structures; in Figure 6 the micro discourse structure expands beyond paragraph limits to capture relationships, across paragraphs. This micro level structure mirrors the macro structure suggested in Figure 5. Is not limited by genre constraints. Its puzzling why the macro discourse structure illustrated in Figure 5 is deemed necessary since it seems tied to genres and doesn't offer more detailed insights compared to Figure 6. It's quite strange that sentences 6 and 15 are missing in Figure 5 when sentence 12 is there, as a subtitle. \nSection 4 of the corpus construction lacks elaboration. \n   The definitions of \"discourse topic \" \"lead,\" \"abstract,\" and \"paragraph topics,\" as mentioned in lines 627 to 629 are not clear, without an example provided. \n   The writers discuss investigating the connections between scale and large scale structures; however; the relevant section is absent, from the text. \n   Table 4 explores a research study focusing on agreement issues raised by the authors regarding the challenges in maintaining consistency due to subjective judgments involved in the process. However the reference to \"leaf nodes,\" whether at a level (e.g. paragraphs) or a finer level (e.g., Elementary Discourse Units) remains unclear. It would be useful to conduct agreement studies for both levels. Additionally the measurement data appears to have been collected from a subset of the dataset raising concerns, about its ability to accurately represent the quality of the corpus. \nThere are parts, in section 4 that are not very clear.\n   Table 4 indicates that the terms \"discourse structure\" and \"discourse relation\" are unclear and need explanation. \n   Table 5 lacks clarity regarding the \"number of macro discourse relations \" especially considering that these relationships can occur between sentences and paragraphs as illustrated in Figure 6. \nThe results, from the experiments lack credibility. \n   The results are compromised by the lack of benchmarks. \n   The description and reasons, for the features used are unclear. \n   The decision to only choose discourse relations from Table 6 for the experiment, on recognizing discourse relations is not very clear. \nUltimately the paper needs enhancements and is presently unsuitable, for approval.
