            "inputText": "Advantages; \nThis study introduces a method for analyzing arguments using neural networks by utilizing a Pointer Network (PN). By incorporating task learning techniques into the model design process it outperforms existing approaches, on two different datasets. \nAreas that need improvement; \nThe suggested approach essentially uses PN in the context of argumentation mining with the integration of PN and multi learning as the main unique aspect.However this new idea might not be substantial enough to justify a publication, in ACL.Moreover the lack of qualitative evaluation and error analysis raises a notable issue. \nLets talk about something, in general.\nFurthermore apart from the weaknesses mentioned earlier the rationale behind utilizing PN lacks justification in the given context. Even though the writers outline three attributes of PN (mentioned in lines 138 to 143) these aspects fail to offer a rationale, for choosing PN over bi directional LSTMs and attention mechanisms. It is recommended that the authors delve deeper into the challenges tackled by PN and illustrate how these problems are effectively dealt with in the experiments. \nThe visuals shown in Figures \u0002two and \u0002three seem confusing at glance – especially the connections like the self link to D₁ and the links from D₂ to E₁ and from D₃/D₄ to E₂ that resemble decoder outputs rather than genuine links. Additionally the decoder LSTM depicted here doesn't seem to receive input, from e_j as mentioned in Equation (\u0003three). In Figure \u0002three the abbreviation \"FC\" is used without being explained. \nEquation (9), on the hand determines the likelihood of each component category by considering the probability of E_i occurring. \nThe experimental setup raises concerns since the \"PN\" model was assessed on the microtext database without being a joint model while it remains unclear if the BLSTM model underwent training, with a joint task goal. \nThe writers need to talk about how their research differs from studies, on discourse parsing that make use of attention mechanisms. \nThere are some problems.\n In line 128 \"should be related\" needs to be adjusted to \"should be connected”.\n\nThe phrase \"it able\" should be revised to read as \"it is able.”\nAfter reviewing the feedback from the authors and examining it carefully I decided to raise my recommendation score. I highly recommend that the authors present examples showcasing the advantages of PN along, with a thorough analysis of feature ablation. "
