            "inputText": "This paper suggests a technique based on graphs to create sense disambiguated groups of synonyms from a group of sets of synonyms. The authors test their method by forming these groups from Wiktionary and Russian dictionaries and then analyzing the similarity relationships (measured by precision, recall and F1 score) with WordNet and BabelNet for English well as RuThes and Yet Another RussNet, for Russian languages. \nThe article is nicely. Organized with straightforward experiments and assessments that are easy to understand and follow along with ease. The approach is solid. The interpretation of findings is logicalm considering my initial worries like the inconsistency in vocabulary, between synonym references and benchmarks were resolved in the subsequent sections. \nI worry that the writers might not have grasped the research completely; this weakens the papers rationale slightly. For instance; in the writing piece they wrongly mix OmegaWiki with Wiktionary and Wikipedia as sources containing \"undisambiguated synonyms \" because of its setup. Actually though; OmegaWiki operates on a database centered around word meanings; this ensures that its translations and synonyms are clear and not open, to interpretation. \nThere is a disagreement that comes up when talking about BabelNet and UBY in the papers discussion The paper argues that both depend on English WordNet as a central point for connecting current resources and finds fault with this approach as \"error prone.\" Even though BabelNet makes use of WordNet as a point U BY does not do the same.U BY is a specification meant for representing lexical and semantic resources and their connections independently of any specific resource, like WordNet.The criticisms directed at UBY are therefore unfounded. \n\nThe final section of ยง1. The initial two sections of ยง2 need to be reworked to address the broader issue of creating synsets through aligning/translating senses from LSRs, in general rather than focusing solely on BabelNet and UBY specifically. It would be beneficial to mention that alignment/translating techniques may result in generating synsets or enhancing ones without necessarily being the main objective. \nBesides that and as well as moreover... The analysis of TWSI in JoBinText raises concerns about an abundance of hypernyms and co hyponyms rather than synonyms being included in the text. It remains uncertain if this particular issue is specific to TWSI and JoBinText or if Watset faces challenges. Having data to compare the two would be helpful, in addressing this concern. \nThere are a small details that need to be addressed. \nThe mention of Kiselev et al.s study, from 2015 appears to be redundant. Could potentially be omitted. \nThe play on words with \"wat \" used in the sentence, about finding the word meaning is confusing and might need to be clarified or expressed more directly. \nFigure 2 and Tables 3 to 5 have fonts that make them hard to read; using bigger fonts or abbreviations could enhance their readability. \nIt's important to mention the date of the Wiktionary database dump being used to make it easier for others to replicate or compare information. \nThe frequent change from Times, to Computer Modern fonts is quite distracting. Could be fixed by removing the times package and switching to newtxtext and newtxmath or mathptmx instead. \nReferences; \nGurevych et al.s work on Linked Lexical Knowledge Bases, in the book \"Foundations and Applications\" delves into the world of linking algorithms within the realm of human language technologies.
