The approach used involved stages; initially developing linguistic patterns to gather numerous tweets reflecting opinions on different subjects manually. These tweets were then transformed into sets of three elements. User identity and their stance on a topic. Which were organized into a sparse matrix. After applying matrix factorization techniques and obtaining a reduced rank approximation with 100 as the rank choice cosine similarity calculations were utilized to gauge the likeness, between topics and uncover underlying preferences not overtly outlined in the original sparse matrix. Furthermore \" cosine similarity\" was used to determine topic preferences in the studys initial empirical assessment suggests that the model can accurately anticipate missing topic preferences while also showing a moderate association with values sourced from a manually curated collection of preferences submitted by the public.\" Additionally \" as mentioned in the section on related research \" the absence of established systems, for evaluating predictions of topic preferences adds promise to this work.\"\nI will need context or content, from you to proceed with the paraphrasing.\nRows 23 and 744 mention the term \"quality \" but it lacks a precise definition so its recommended to eliminate all instances of \"high quality\" from the paper unless a specific definition is given. \nIn line 181 and in the description, under Figure 1 it might be clearer if we eliminate the word \"\"\nRow 217 needs a revision to say \"We collected,\" or \"This section describes how we collected \" for grammar. \nRow 246 needs to change \"ironies\" to \"irony\".\nRow 269 poses the question of whether all relevant patterns related to the topic, such, as \"Supporting TPP \" have been gathered and subsequently reviewed manually an explanation of this procedure would improve understanding. \nRows 275 and 280 need correction, from \"unuseful\" to \"useless.”\nRow 306 suggests that enhancing readability could involve substituting the word \"including\" with \"'re including.”\nRow 309 mentions that the terms \"of\" and \"it\" seem to have been identified as topics even though they are not actual topics of discussion. \nThe initial statement can be omitted to make the paragraph more concise and direct by beginning with \"Twitter user.\"\nThe method employed to practically determine the ideal k is praiseworthy since this particular value has frequently been accepted in studies, without solid empirical backing. \nRow 446 suggests that using \"call\" of \"let\" could improve clarity and accuracy, in this context.
