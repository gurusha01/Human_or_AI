Your decision to share your code with the public is truly admirable. Will be incredibly valuable for fellow researchers, in the field. \nAfter reviewing everything carefully and considering all factors at play I've decided to adjust my overall rating to a 4, out of 5. \nThe papers advantages are as follows; \n\"The document is nicely. Simple to understand.\"\nThe experiments carried out are thorough. Encompass a broad array of situations. \nThe findings are. Show that the method is working well. \nCertain shortcomings were observed; \nThe project lacks innovations and mostly utilizes technologies that are already established in the field. \nYou said you would share the code, for this project but its not out yet; having it would have made the paper better. \nThe outcomes are satisfactory. Fall in line, with our expectations without any major surprises. \nDuring the conversation on this topic it might be helpful to delve into the reasons why traditional audio features such, as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC's)e were not used. \nWhen it comes to specifics; \nIn instances such as L155L15515 \"an LSTM,\" the correction, to \"an LSTM \" is needed for proper grammar. \nI think adding hyphens after text, in L160 and L216 could be avoided for clarity. \nThe way convolution is explained in Section 205 could be enhanced to make it easier to grasp. \nTable 1 is mentioned at the beginning of page 2. Should be positioned there for easier reference. \nIts being questioned on line 263 whether using 3 convolutional neural networks (3DCNN) is the conventional method, in video processing and if there are any other options worth exploring and considering. \nIn lines 375 and 378 of the document I noticed that the caret (^) which should be, above the letter \"Y \" appears to be positioned and may need to be adjusted. \n\"In Section 380 it might be clearer to use the term 'to prevent overfitting' instead of 'to check overfitting'.\"\nIn order to improve readability, for L403 and L408 sections of text consider using quotation marks or italics to indicate names. \nLike how L155 was corrected from \" a SVM \", to \" an SVM \" L420 should also be adjusted in the same manner.\nIn line 448 of the document there seems to be an inconsistency, with the number usage. It should either be \"Outputs,\" or the verb needs to be changed to \"is.\"\nThere is a space, after \"layer,\" which should be deleted in line 489. \nIn lines 516 and 519 the word \"concatenate\" shouldn’t start a line. \nIt's strange that we don't know the number of people mentioned in line 567. \n\"After reviewing line 626 it appears that the comma following 'Since' is not needed and should be deleted.\"\n\"The abbreviation for 'does not', in line 651 should be written out as 'does not'.\"\nIn line 777 of the documents content suggested placing \"on the hand.\" This adjustment could enhance the coherence of the sentence flow. \nThe references section needs some tidying up. L823 has spaces; L831 should mention the complete location name instead of just \"Munich\"; the reference to \"ACL (1)\" in L860 is unclear; there's an unnecessary closing parenthesis in L888; \"Volume,\" without extra formatting should be used in L894; there are extra new lines in L951; and the indentation of \" Linguistics \", in L956 is not correct.
