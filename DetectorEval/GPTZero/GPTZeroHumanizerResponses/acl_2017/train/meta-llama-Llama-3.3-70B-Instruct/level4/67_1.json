Makes sense. \nThe techniques and experimental arrangements are detailed extensively. \nThe findings indicate that the method proposed by the authors outperforms the existing top tier standards; however some issues are brought up. \n\nThe main drawbacks of this paper are found in its assessment and general delivery. \nThe initial methods mentioned are quite complex to understand; some seem outdated and don't provide reasons for their inclusion (, for instance; Mpttern). \nIt seems that the comparison is unclear as Memb is mentioned as the state of the art without any reference, to what specific approach is being compared to. \nEven though the authors claim their method is better than the one in their papers results section, on the first dataset where the improvement is not significant enough to be compellingly demonstrated. \nThe manuscript needs a review for errors as there were many identified (for instance; 11 errors, in the first column of page 2). Publication cannot move forward until these issues are resolved. \nThe Cilin E hierarchy has a number of levels. Just 5, in total. Which might explain the impressive outcomes achieved in this and earlier research studies. \nLets talk about topics.\nThe method used may not be very unique in itself. Its use in tackling a problem that hasn't been explored with deep learning gives the paper an intriguing angle to it.However two key concerns need attention.Firstly the presentation is flawed, with mistakes and typos that require fixing.Secondly the assessment brings up worries as the technical advances are not convincingly showcased. It's important to clarify what \"Memb\" refers to. For example whether its the method described by Shwartz et al., 2016. And understand its performance better. The authors should consider reorganizing the evaluation section to clearly outline the baseline systems used and show how their approach brings benefits while also pointing out areas where other methods may fall short. Furthermore it might be beneficial to include significance tests since there was an improvement noted on one dataset. "
