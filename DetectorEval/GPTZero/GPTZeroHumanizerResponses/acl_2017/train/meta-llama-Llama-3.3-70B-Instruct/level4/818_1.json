            "inputText": "The authors reply is acknowledged with gratitude as it touches upon my concerns to an extent; nonetheless it mainly comprises assurances, for forthcoming modifications. A requirement imposed by limited space availability.This situation exemplifies the core problem;I wish to assess the updated paper to ensure that the noted shortcomings are adequately rectified.The necessary alterations are significant. The upcoming experimental findings pledged will not undergo evaluation if the paper is approved in its current form.  It's a bit tricky for me to fully trust the authors to handle all the needed revisions without another round of review involved.I've bumped up my rating to a 3 as it shows my feelings. I do admire the creativity, in the research but find the way its presented quite chaotic. \nAdvantages; \nThe paper explores a creative topic with a valuable goal; extracting shared knowledge from text by addressing the challenge of reporting bias through combined inference on gleanable information, from text. \nAreas of improvement; \nThere are parts of the method that need more explanation but what concerns me the most is the lack of clarity on how they combine object knowledge with verb knowledge to address reporting bias effectively in this study paper they jump into technical details without giving a clear overview of the approach or its benefits, from the start. \nThe experiments and the discussion seem unfinished because the results for one of the tasks in Table 2 (the half) have not been discussed yet and an important experiment is missing too. Variant B of the authors’ model performs better than Variant A in the first task but only Variant A is tested in the second task and does not show any improvement, over the baseline. \nLets talk about a things; \nThe paper needs a lot of polishing before its ready, for publication. \nI'm sorry. I cannot proceed with the task as you have not provided any text for me to paraphrase. Please provide the text you would like me to work on. Thank you.\nOn page 26 of the paper it states there are five dimensions noted of six. \nFigure 1 caption raises a question, about the ambiguity of the term \"implies relations.\" The authors are prompted to explain how they discern the physical relations that are implied in this context.\nFigures 1 and 113–114 illustrate the method of deriving implied meanings for verbs that align, with semantics principles as outlined by Dowty (1991). Referencing this work directly would enhance the clarity and depth of the discussion. \nOn page 135 it is important to explain the idea of the method. The reasons, behind why combining both sets of information through joint inference can address reporting bias effectively. \nOn page 141 it should say \"value,\" not \"values.\"\nOn page 143 of the document it could be beneficial to explore research on distributional semantics and possibly include it in the relevant literature section of the paper for added value.There are studies, by Bruni et al.(2012) and Silberer et al.(2013).\nOn page 146 of the document is where its important to specify that the focus is on the task and method for extracting common sense knowledge from language since this has been a well established objective, for quite some time. \nOn page 152 the meaning of \"grounded'' is not clear, at this stage. \nSection 2 point 2 requires an explanation for why specific dimensions were chosen and the reasoning, behind them should be provided. \nOn page 177 of the document it is recommended to elaborate on the meanings of \"pre condition\" and \"post condition\" well as their significance, in the context provided. \nPages 197 to 198 could benefit from including an example that shows the distribution, for a particular item, which would help with comprehension. \nIn Figure 2 of the text on semantics the difference, between stage level and individual level predicates appears important but lacks clear explanation. \nOn page 248 of the book there seems to be a missing determiner, in the definition. \nSection 3 needs explanation regarding the choice of \"action verbs \" and the criteria for their selection should be clarified regardless of Levins explicit tagging of them, as such. \nOn pages 306 and beyond there should be an explanation of how \"action frames\" are defined and selected or created. \nOn page 326 it doesn't mention how to tell if a frame is producing little or too much. \nTable 1 should provide an explanation of how to divide the content (based on frames or verbs) as well, as how verbs or frames can be used in different sections. \nOn page 336 of the book mentions PMIs. Lacks specifics, like thresholds. \nOn page 371 it is important to mention the approach used for dividing whether done randomly or according to certain criteria. \nOn page 376 the expression \"evaluating the connection\" is not very clear, in its meaning. \nOn page 378 it does not specify the criteria used to select which knowledge dimensions should be annotated for each frame. \nSection 4 should provide an overview of the models elements like factor graphs and substrates and explain why this approach is suitable, for a CL audience. \nOn page 420 it seems like the reference, for \"both types of knowledge\" is not provided \nOn page 421 the phrase \"object of kind\" is not very clear. \nPage 445 feels like the selectional preference factors were introduced out of the blue so it might have been better to introduce them earlier, in the paper for clarity and understanding. \nOn page 461 the presence of the word \"also\" appears misplaced or awkward, within the context provided. \nOn page 471 it doesn't mention where the similarities, in usage come from. \nFigure 3 may be challenging to comprehend. Could use a clearer written explanation or a more intuitive presentation for better understanding, in black and white format. \nOn page 598 it is important to provide a definition of the term \"message \" and explain its significance, within the factor graph framework. \nOn page 621 it would be helpful to provide an explanation, for using a \" 1\" instead of a firm 1. \nOn pages 647 and beyond of the document there should be information provided about the EMB MAXNET classifier such as its training process and the type of input data used for it as well as an explanation, for why it serves as a baseline model. \nOn page 654 the expression \" information, about seeds\" is not very clear. \nOn pages 659 and 681 of the document there seems to be a problem, with the table reference; it should actually point to Table 2. \nOn pages 664 and beyond, in the text you mentioned earlier. The illustration given might not be ideal because comparing an entity to a revolution is not a task. \nPage 681 mentions the importance of discussing the findings related to understanding object knowledge and including results for model ( B). It would be helpful to use terminology for the model, in Tables 1 and 2. \nPage 778 seems a bit lacking when it mentions \"latent in verbs \" without any reference, to objects. \nOn page 781 it seems that the reference, for \"both tasks\" is not specified. \nThe citations need to be reviewed for consistency in formatting such as capitalization and bibliographic information to the examples, in Grice and Sorower et al.s references.
