Easy to follow with detailed experiments to support its claims.The qualitative assessment presented in Table 1 shows the outcomes and proves the approachs efficacy.These remarks aim to offer ideas for enhancing clarity and refining the content further. \nSome important factors to take into account; \nBoth the current method and the one by Tian et al. from 2014 use mixture models to break down single word representations, into prototypes; hence a quick comparison discussing their variances would be helpful. \nThe section on research could benefit from including references, to relevant studies cited in the following manner; \nEfficient estimation without parameters of embeddings per word in vector space by Neelakantan and colleagues at the EMNL conference, in 2014. \n\"Are Multi Sensory Embeddings Enhancing Comprehension of Natural Language?\" as discussed by Li and Jurafsky at EMWLP 2015. \nLiu and colleagues presented their research, on Topic Word Embeddings at the AAI conference in 2015. \nAdding the outcomes of these methods to Tables 3 and 4 might offer valuable perspectives. \nAuthors, what aspects lead to the variance in performance, between wTGM and wTG in the SWCS examination? \nThe feedback, from the writers has been considered.
