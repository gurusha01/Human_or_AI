Just 25 word pairs or even a list of numbers generated automatically could be enough to get started on the process.The approach leverages the resemblance in structure, between developed embedding spaces and operates by progressively acquiring a mapping and introducing a fresh vocabulary until reaching stability. \nThe primary achievements of this study include; \nA basic self teaching system that can develop notch dual language word representations, with minimal bilingual data input. \nThe approach can effectively operate with initial word lists and even automatically compiled sets of numbers while still producing comparable outcomes to cutting edge systems utilizing more extensive bilingual references. \nThe suggested framework can acquire dual language word associations without tangible bilingual data sources which shows potential, for supporting less resourced languages. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe suggested approach delivers outcomes to cutting edge systems by leveraging more extensive bilingual sources to showcase its efficiency in acquiring top notch bilingual word embeddings. \nThe technique is straightforward and effective; it can be easily put into practice. Scaled up for handling extensive datasets. \nThe research paper thoroughly examines the optimization goal and the functioning of the self learning system to offer an understanding of its operation and possible constraints. \nThe paper has some flaws, including; \nThe approach depends on how similar the structuresre, in embedding spaces that were trained separately; this might not always hold true especially for languages that are far apart. \nThe paper lacks an analysis when compared to other advanced methods available today that utilize parallel datasets or advanced optimization strategies. \n\"The approach might not work well with background noise or mistakes in the dictionary; this could impact how well it performs in real world scenarios.\"\nAsking authors some questions; \nHow well does the approach work with languages that're further apart linguistically and may have less similarity in their embedding spaces? \nIs there a way to enhance the approach by incorporating optimization methods or regularization techniques to avoid overfitting issues? \nHow does this approach stack up against cutting edge methods that utilize parallel datasets or more advanced strategies, like adversarial training or attention mechanisms?
