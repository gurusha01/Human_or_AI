The key highlights of this research include;  \nA fresh approach to acquiring meaning representations for every reference by integrating the analysis of words, within contextual text and entities sourced from a knowledge repository. \n1) Utilizing a language model driven method to clarify each reference to a meaning efficiently. \nUtilizing the suggested disambiguation technique along, with prototype mention embeddings to attain top notch outcomes on the entity linking benchmark dataset. \nThe positive aspects of this entry are;  \nThe new model for Multi Categorized Mention Embedding adequately tackles the uncertainty surrounding mentions of entities—a hurdle, in merging text and knowledge into a cohesive semantic realm. \nUsing a language model based method, for clarification proves to be effective and showcases outcomes in trials. \nThe use of the suggested approach, in the context of entity linking as a case study clearly showcases its efficiency and attains cutting edge outcomes. \nThe research paper uses both quantitative methods to showcase the excellence of word embeddings and multi faceted entity mentions in a convincing manner. \nThe flaws, in this submission are;  \nThe uniqueness of the suggested technique might be restricted since comparable methods have already been investigated in studies. \nThe assessment of the suggested approach relies mainly on one benchmark dataset only; this might not be enough to prove its applicability. \nThe paper would be improved by providing an extensive examination of the drawbacks and possible uses of the suggested approach. \nQueries, for Writers;  \nHow does the Multi‐Prototype Mention Embedding model deal, with situations when the knowledge base is not fully updated or lacks information? \nCould the writers offer information, about the language model centered method employed for clarifying meanings and how it is fine tuned for linking entities in tasks? \nHow do the writers intend to expand the suggested approach to cover tasks beyond entity linking and what difficulties do they foresee?
