Using schema templates and paraphrasing. To enhance the models effectiveness and lessen the requirement, for labeled data. \nThe paper excels, in the following areas; \nA new method is suggested by the authors for constructing Natural Language Interface Database systems merging sequence to sequence models, with feedback driven learning and data augmentation techniques. \nThe authors show that their method is just as effective as systems, on two standard datasets. GEO880 and ATIS. \nThe authors showcase how their method proves to be effective in a scenario by developing a semantic parser for an academic field, from the ground up. \nThe shortcomings of this paper include; \nThe authors only tested their method on a couple of datasets and a small online study—a limited scope that might not capture all potential scenarios. \nThe authors depend on crowd workers to label utterances; however this could lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies, in the annotation process. \nThe authors have not thoroughly analyzed the mistakes made by their model. Identified the types of statements that pose the greatest parsing challenges. \nQuestions, for the writers; \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the challenge of dealing with noise and fluctuations in the process of annotating, by crowd workers? \nCould the writers elaborate further about the kinds of statements that're particularly difficult to understand and their strategies for enhancing the models accuracy, with these statements? \nHow do the writers intend to expand their method to accommodate query languages, like SPARQL or ElasticSearch?
