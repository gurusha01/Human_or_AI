Using the representation projection method makes it simple to include languages without needing individual embeddings, for every language pair. \nThe papers drawbacks include; \nThe authors only test their methods on a selection of languages (Japanese, Korean, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch) and datasets (, in house and CoNNL). \nDepending on the precision of alignment is crucial for the annotation projection method to work effectively since there might be instances where the alignment, between the translated languages is not always precise or readily accessible. \nThe inclusion of decoding methods might introduce intricacy to the entire system that could affect its scalability and efficiency. \nAsking authors some questions; \nHow do the writers intend to expand their methods to languages, with resources and little to no parallel information available? \nCould the writers offer details about how well the heuristic data selection method and the representation projection technique work, across various language combinations and datasets? \nHow do the authors intend to tackle the challenges related to scalability and efficiency in the decoding schemes they are working on?
