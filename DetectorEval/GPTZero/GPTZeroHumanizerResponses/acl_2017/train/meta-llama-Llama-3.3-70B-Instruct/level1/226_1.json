Can be modified for use, in other languages that have limited resources available. \nThe assessment data set will be released to the public to promote the advancement of distributional semantics models in Polish and other languages, with limited resources. \nThe document offers an explanation of how sentences are annotated and includes the guidelines and sample sentences used in the annotation process. \nUtilizing Fleiss’ kappa and Krippendorff’s alpha for assessing rater agreement offers a dependable way to evaluate the datasets quality. \nThe submission has areas that could be improved such, as... \nThe method created relies on the SICK corpus and may not be directly relevant, for languages or fields. \nThe dataset only contains 10 thousand sentence pairs which might not be enough, for training and testing models that handle the distribution of meanings in an adequate manner. \nThe paper lacks an assessment of the models, for compositional distributional semantics that can be developed and assessed using the dataset created. \nThe linguistic rules developed for Polish may not be applicable, to languages. \nThe paper would be improved by delving into the consequences of the findings and exploring how the dataset could be used in practical situations. \nQueries, for writers;  \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the issue of the datasets size and guarantee that it is adequate, for training and assessing models that deal with compositional distributional semantics? \nCan the process be adjusted for use, in languages or areas of expertise and what changes would need to be made? \nHow do the writers intend to assess the models, for distributional semantics that can be developed and tested with the dataset they have created? \nWhat do the findings suggest for creating models that analyze how words are put together in Polish and other languages with resources? \nHow do the authors intend to share the dataset with the public and make sure it is easily accessible to researchers, in the field?
