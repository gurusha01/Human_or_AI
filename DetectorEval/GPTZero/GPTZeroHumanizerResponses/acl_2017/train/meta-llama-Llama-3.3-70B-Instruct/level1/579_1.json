An open information extraction system that reduces and marks extractions effectively highlighting its key advancements. \nMinimization of extractions, from Open Information Extraction systems involves streamlining the results to focus on information discarding excessive details while highlighting key insights. \nMinIE offers annotations for polarity assessments well as modality and attribution details, alongside quantities to maintain the essence of the extracted information. \nThere are levels of minimization modes available, in MinIE that allow users to balance between accuracy and minimalism effectively. \nThe positive aspects of this paper include; \nMinIEs effective minimization strategies result in shorter extracts while still achieving a competitive level of precision and recall. \nMinIEs enhanced annotations offer insights into the extraction process by providing details, on polarity and modality that can benefit subsequent applications. \nFlexibility is a feature of MinIE as it offers users the option to adjust the level of aggressiveness to fit their particular needs or requirements. \nThe shortcomings of this document are; \nError propagation is an issue, for MinIE as it depends on parsing dependencies and recognizing named entities which can lead to errors in the extraction process. \nMinIEs method of dealing with collocations has some limitations as it relies on a dictionary based approach which may not address all scenarios effectively and could result in disjointed collocations occurring. \nThere is still room for enhancement, in the minimization methods used by MinIE; for example its negation detection may not encompass all scenarios and could benefit from improvements. \nQuestions, for the writers; \nHow do you intend to tackle the problem of error spreading. What methods can enhance the resilience of MinIE? \nCould you give me information about how the dictionary, for managing collocations is put together and how it could be expanded to include a wider range of situations? \nWhat are some of the uses for, MinIEs highlighted extractions and how can they be applied in tasks like answering questions or summarizing text?
