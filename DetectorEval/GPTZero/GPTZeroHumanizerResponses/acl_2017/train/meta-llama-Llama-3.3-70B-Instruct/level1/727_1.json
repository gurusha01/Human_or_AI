This might not work well for fields, with little existing knowledge. \nThe authors rely on the F score as their main evaluation metric. Note that it may not fully capture the subtleties of frame prediction. \nAuthors are often asked questions such, as; \nHow do the writers intend to deal with the challenge of making their approach applicable to fields and platforms, beyond their own domain? \nCould the writers elaborate further on the single word keywords they employed to kickstart their model and how they were chosen? \nHow will the writers assess how well their strategy works in fields and, on various platforms?
