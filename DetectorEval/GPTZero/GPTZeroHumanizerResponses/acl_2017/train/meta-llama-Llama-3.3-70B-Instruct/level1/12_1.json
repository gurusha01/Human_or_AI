            "inputText": "In this article introduces an approach called SynTime that focuses on identifying time references in natural language text based on their type classification method than analyzing the characteristics of the time expressions in four different datasets and drawing conclusions from them such as their brevity and limited vocabulary usage being common traits along with containing at least one time related term and displaying consistent syntactic patterns; Utilizing these findings SynTime establishes categorized types, for terms and develops straightforward rules based on heuristics to detect time references. \nThe key achievements of this study include; \nThe examination of time related phrases in four sets of data offers support, for the idea that people tend to use language with effort. \nThe concept of SynTime involves creating a system that uses types, for tokens and implements straightforward heuristic rules to identify time expressions accurately. \nSynTimes performance was tested on three datasets. Demonstrated superiority over existing baseline models such as rule based and machine learning based time taggers, in the evaluation results. \nThe highlights of this document are; \nAnalyzing time related expressions thoroughly forms a basis, for the suggested method. \nThe straightforwardness and efficiency of SynTime are notable as it delivers results across three datasets. \nComparing SynTime to the benchmark models clearly shows its superior performance. \nOne should consider the shortcomings present, in this document.\nThe idea that words are consistently tokenized and tagged with parts of speech may not always hold true in practice. \nThe evaluation was limited to three datasets and may not accurately represent all text types. \nThere is an absence of exploration regarding the potential uses of SynTime, in future studies. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow will you handle the problem of tokenization and part of speech tagging that could impact SynTimes effectiveness? \nCan you share information about how SynTime plans to grow into different languages and aspects of language, in the future as mentioned? \nHow do you believe SynTime could be utilized in scenarios, like information retrieval and tasks involving natural language processing?
