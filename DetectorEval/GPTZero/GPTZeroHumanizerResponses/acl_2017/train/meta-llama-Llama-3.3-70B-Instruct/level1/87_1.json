PositionRank considers the word position and frequency in the document to rank them similar to PageRank but with bias. By creating a word graph with words as nodes and cooccurrences as edges from the documents content and assigning weights based on their positions helps in ranking the words, within the PageRank algorithm. The research paper assesses PositionRank using three sets of papers and demonstrates its superior performance over TextRank and other established methods, like SingleRank and ExpandRank. \nKey Contributions; \nThe article introduces an unsupervised graph based algorithm that integrates position details into a biased PageRank, for extracting keyphrases. \nEnhanced Results; The research paper demonstrates that PositionRank performs better than established benchmarks, like TextRank, SingleRank and ExpandRank across three sets of papers. \nThe research paper shows that the enhancements in MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) precision rate accuracy and F measure, for PositionRank exhibit significance. \nAdvantages; \nThe research introduces an algorithm that integrates positional data into a biased PageRank method—a valuable addition, to the realm of extracting key phrases. \nThe study indicates that PositionRank surpasses benchmarks, in performance levels highlighting the algorithms efficacy. \nThe study thoroughly assesses the effectiveness of PositionRank using three sets of papers to gain a full insight into how well the algorithm performs. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe paper has a focus on comparing PositionRank with just a few solid baseline models; however it would be more advantageous to include comparisons, with other cutting edge algorithms as well. \nThe paper lacks an examination of the findings that could offer insights, into the algorithms pros and cons. \nThe paper lacks an error analysis section that could have helped in pinpointing the algorithms mistakes and areas needing enhancement. \nQuestions, for Writers; \nHow does PositionRank manage documents that cover topics or subtopics? \nCan PositionRank be utilized for kinds of documents, like websites or emails? \nHow do the selection of window size and damping factor influence the effectiveness of PositionRank?
