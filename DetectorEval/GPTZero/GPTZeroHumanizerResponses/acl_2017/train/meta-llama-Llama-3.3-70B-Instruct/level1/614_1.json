The extended B Cubed F Score. To evaluate the effectiveness sense lists is a significant development. \nUsing word meanings as a filter, on lexsub rankings generated automatically could enhance their alignment with substitutions annotated by humans.The demonstration shows this improvement in agreement. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe new approach surpasses sense inventories, in its ability to be substituted and its range. \nUtilizing a view clustering technique enables the integration of various forms of data, on paraphrases which enhances the methods resilience and adaptability. \nThe method was tested on a dataset (CoInCo) and when compared with cutting edge models its effectiveness was clearly demonstrated. \nThe shortcomings of this document are; \nThe success of the approach hinges, on the effectiveness of the input rephrasings and the precision of determining word meanings. \nUsing a method, for clarifying word meanings could create bias and constrain the effectiveness of the strategy. \nIn the experiments conducted to test its effectiveness it was found that the approach might not yield results when dealing with nouns and could benefit from optimization tailored to specific parts of speech. \nAuthors are often posed with inquiries; \nHow do the writers intend to overcome the methods shortcomings regarding nouns and enhance its effectiveness, for this part of speech? \nCould the authors offer information regarding how the multi view clustering algorithm was implemented and the rationale, behind selecting the parameters? \nHow do the writers intend to expand the approach to cover languages and fields and what obstacles and constraints might arise in this expansion?
