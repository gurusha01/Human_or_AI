            "inputText": "This study introduces a method, for creating a conversational agent named KB Assistant that assists users in accessing Knowledge Bases (KBs). The key highlights of this research include; \nThe researchers present a method for searching a knowledge base using a probabilistic approach instead of traditional symbolic queries by generating a \"soft\" distribution, over the knowledge base data set to enable comprehensive training of conversational AI systems. \nThe authors suggest a neural agent called KB infoBot that is trained solely based on user input and combines soft retrieval with a reinforcement learning mechanism, throughout the process. \nThe authors test their method by using both an user and actual users and then compare it to other methods to show how well it works. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nA fresh strategy is being introduced with the Soft KB lookup technique that offers a way to search through knowledge bases (KB). This method enables the training of neural conversational agents from start, to finish. \nThe authors assess their method by testing it with a user simulator and actual users to gain an insight into the systems effectiveness. \nThe authors contrast their method with techniques to showcase its effectiveness and emphasize its benefits. \nThe paper has some shortcomings; \nThe suggested method is quite complex as it demands an array of computational resources and could pose challenges when put into action. \nThe writers point out that the E Commerce agent is prone to overfitting issues that could restrict its adaptability, to users and situations. \nThe method might not easily adapt to knowledge bases or more intricate conversational situations which could restrict its usefulness. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do you intend to tackle the problem of overfitting in the E​nd, to End agent? \nCould you share information, about the computing resources needed to put the suggested method into practice? \nHow do you think the suggested method could be used for knowledge bases or more intricate conversation situations?
