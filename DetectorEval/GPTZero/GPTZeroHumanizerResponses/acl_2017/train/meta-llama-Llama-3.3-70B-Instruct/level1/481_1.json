Posing a tough challenge for language and vision (LaVi) models to spot errors accurately. The authors assess two cutting edge LaVi models, across three tasks. Caption classification; detection of foil words; and correction of foil words. The findings indicate that the models struggle to excel in these assignments because they fail to combine language and visual elements. \nThe primary achievements of this research encompass; \nThe FOIL COC dataset has been introduced as a platform, for assessing LaVi models effectively. \nThe suggestion of three assignments to assess LaVi models in order to identify their shortcomings. \nCurrent research shows that existing LaVi models struggle to combine language and vision and heavily depend upon language priors. \nThe paper excels, in these areas; \nThe dataset and tasks suggested show a motivation and have the potential to drive progress in the field of LaVi research. \nThe studies are detailed and thoughtfully planned out to offer an assessment of how the models function. \nThe examination of the findings provides insights by pointing out the constraints of existing LaVi models. \nThe paper has some shortcomings such, as; \nImproving the process of generating datasets could help address biases that may arise from the current method being used. \nThe assessment criteria being utilized might not cover all aspects adequately; incorporating supplementary metrics could offer a thorough assessment of the models’ effectiveness. \nThe paper would be improved by delving into the implications of the findings and exploring potential avenues, for future research. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do you intend to tackle any biases that might arise during the process of creating the dataset? \nCould you give me information about the assessment criteria utilized and the rationale, behind their selection? \nHow do you believe the findings, in this document could help enhance the development of LaVi models?
