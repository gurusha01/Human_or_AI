The researchers introduce a process for extracting common sense knowledge from language and put forward a framework that is capable of deducing relationships between concrete object pairs along, with fundamental relationships implied by physical actions. \nThe key accomplishments of this study are; \nA new challenge has emerged in extracting common sense knowledge from language; delving into the consequences of actions and the physical connections, between objects. \nProposing a model that can deduce connections between tangible object pairs along, with relationships suggested by physical actions. \nA new dataset called VERBsPHYSICS has been created to gather information from a group of people, about actions and objects. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe writers discuss an obstacle, in natural language processing. Acquiring common knowledge from text. \nThe suggested model can deduce the real world consequences of actions and the comparative physical connections, between objectsâ€”a component of human thinking. \nThe authors thoroughly assess their model by conducting experiments, on predicting frames and object pairs. \nThe article is nicely written with an explanation of how the authors approached the topic and presented their findings. \nThe dataset and the code will be shared with the public to support research in this field. \nThe shortcomings of this article include; \nThe system depends on gathering a volume of data from the public which could prove to be both costly and time consuming, in nature. \nThe authors did not delve into an examination of the mistakes made by their model that could offer valuable insights, for enhancing it further. \nThe model can only grasp the consequences of actions and the relative physical connections, between objects; it's uncertain how it could broaden its scope to acquire different forms of common knowledge. \nThe authors did not include a comparison with cutting edge models, for acquiring common knowledge from text. \nThe article could use an exploration of how the suggested model could be used and what the results imply in practical terms. \n Inquiries, for writers; \nHow are the writers intending to expand their model to acquire forms of everyday knowledge beyond social expectations and theoretical ideas? \nCan the writers offer information, on how they gathered input from a diverse group of people and on what basis they chose the object pairs and frames? \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the problem of reporting bias in learning common sense knowledge from text sources? \nCan the writers offer details on the mistakes made by their system and their strategies, for enhancing its effectiveness? \nWhat are the authors intentions, for sharing their dataset and code with the public and what research endeavors do they have in mind for this field?
