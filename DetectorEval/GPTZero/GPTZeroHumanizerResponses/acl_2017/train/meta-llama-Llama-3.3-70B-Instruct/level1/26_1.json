The key accomplishments of this study include;  \nA cross focus mechanism that adapts the representation of queries based on aspects of answers is shown to be more expressive and adaptable compared to earlier approaches. \nIncorporating worldwide knowledge base data during training can address the out of vocabulary (OOOV ) issue. Enhance the models overall performance. \nThe results from experiments conducted on the WebQuestions dataset illustrate that the suggested method is highly effective and outperforms end to end approaches, in terms of performance. \nThe positive aspects of this article are; \nThe new cross focus method is an advancement compared to earlier approaches as it enables better and adaptable question representation. \nUtilizing worldwide knowledge base data is a strategy that tackles the out of vocabulary issue and boosts the models effectiveness. \nThe results of the experiments are. Clearly presented to show how well the suggested method works. \nThe shortcomings of this document are; \nThe effectiveness of the model could be influenced by the quality of the training data; the authors might have considered investigating training methods. \nThe authors might have delved deeper into analyzing the attention weights. How they influence the models effectiveness. \nImproving the models capacity to tackle inquiries and identify inaccuracies could enhance its performance since these issues frequently arise in knowledge base question answering tasks. \nAsking authors questions; \nWhat are the authors strategies for dealing with inquiries and inaccuracies, in labels in their upcoming research endeavors? \nCould the authors offer a thorough examination of how the attention weights influence the performance of the model? \nHow do the writers intend to expand their suggested method to knowledge base question answering datasets and tasks?
