The authors suggest that current combined techniques addressing event detection and argument extraction at the time do not fully leverage argument details, for event identification.  \nThe primary achievements of this study include;  \nA suggestion for a supervised attention based model, in education that utilizes argument data to boost educational performance. \nExploring two methods, for creating gold annotations using annotated arguments. \nAchieving top notch results, on the ACE 2005 dataset is an accomplishment. \nThe positive aspects of this document are; \nThe writers thoroughly examine the drawbacks of combined methods and introduce a fresh strategy to overcome these shortcomings. \nThe results of the experiment show that the suggested method is effective and outperforms cutting edge techniques, by a considerable margin. \nUtilizing data from FrameNet events, for training significantly boosts the effectiveness of the suggested method. \nThe papers drawbacks are; \nThe suggested method depends significantly on the accuracy of the arguments provided and it may not always be entirely precise. \nThe writers did not offer a contrast, with other attention focused techniques; as a result it is challenging to gauge the originality of the suggested approach. \nThe findings, from the experiment are constrained to the ACE 2005 dataset. It remains uncertain if the method suggested can be applied to various other datasets. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow are the writers intending to tackle the challenge of dealing with annotated arguments that could potentially decrease the effectiveness of the suggested method? \nCould the writers offer information about how they fine tuned the hyperparameters in their process. Specifically looking for insights, on setting the trade off parameter λ in the combined loss function? \nHow do the writers intend to expand the suggested method to handle different event extraction duties like extracting event arguments and resolving event coreference issues?
