These methods include bridging techniques and hybrid approaches along, with Pacman and PCFG approximation. \nSignificant progress has been made in expanding the coverage of the ER system through PCFG based systems as evidenced by the results which demonstrate coverage improvements of, up to 100% on specific datasets. \nThe paper excels, in the following areas; \nThe authors carefully assess a range of robust parsing methods and offer a detailed examination of their pros and cons. \nA new method of evaluation is suggested which deals with the issue of lacking reference data and enables a better assessment of reliable parsing methods. \nSignificant progress has been made in the analysis showing how the suggested methods enhance coverage. A factor, in parsing performance effectiveness. \nThe paper has some shortcomings, including...\nThe authors recognize the importance of evaluation to thoroughly gauge the efficacy of the suggested methods; however; such evaluation was not carried out in this study. \nThe computational effectiveness of suggested methods, like PCFG based systems might come with substantial computational expenses that could impede their practical use. \nThe authors point out that the parse ranking model is not adjusted for situations in which it is applied and this could affect the accuracy of the suggested methods. \nAuthors are often posed with inquiries.\nWhat are the authors strategies for overcoming the challenge of external assessment, in their future research plans? \nCould the writers offer information on how efficient the suggested methods are computationally and suggest ways to enhance their effectiveness further? \nHow do the writers plan to modify the parse ranking model to enhance the effectiveness of the suggested methods, in research endeavors?
