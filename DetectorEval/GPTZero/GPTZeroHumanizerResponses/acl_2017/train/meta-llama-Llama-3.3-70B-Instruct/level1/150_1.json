The system can effectively train a neural machine translation model at the character level, with superior results compared to word level models and similar results to top notch character level models. \nThe research paper shows that the system can grasp morphology effectively to accurately interpret words and nonce words. \nAdvantages\nSolving the OOV Problem; The paper suggests a way to tackle the out of vocabulary (OOB ) problem faced by word level models by adopting a character level strategy. \nWhen training the model efficiently for a character level neural machine translation model is successful it leads to better performance compared to word level models. \nThe research shows that the system can grasp morphology effectively to accurately translate words, with spelling errors and coined words. \nThe model shows performance to the best systems available today which proves its effectiveness. \nThe paper mentions that the approach could be used for tasks beyond speech recognition and text summarization due, to its flexibility. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe model includes six neural networks which might increase its complexity and make training more challenging compared to other models. \nThe paper notes that the model needs a lot of computing power to run smoothly and this could pose a challenge, for researchers. \nThe study assesses the model in three language pairings; however this might not be adequate to showcase its efficacy across multiple languages effectively. \nThe paper discusses how the model measures up against character level models but could benefit from comparing it to word level models to showcase its strengths. \nThe article lacks a theoretical examination of the models implications and potential uses. \nQueries, for Writers \nHow does the model manage languages with morphology, like Arabic or Chinese? \nCan the system serve purposes, in natural language processing like creating language models or categorizing text? \nHow does this model stack up against character level models when it comes to the resources required for computation and training duration? \nIs it possible to utilize the model for languages, with resources and limited training data available? \nHow does the system manage words that were not part of the training data and are thus unfamiliar, to it?
