Easy to understand the proposed approach as it is clear and well explained. \nThe shortcomings of this document are; \nThe models complexity poses a challenge as it demands computational resources for both training and testing phases; this could potentially restrict its effectiveness, on larger datasets. \nThe paper could benefit from a thorough analysis and discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach in addition, to what is already provided in the analysis of the results. \nThe paper would be more informative with an evaluation of its performance in relation to other advanced models, for extracting relationships in order to offer a comprehensive assessment of the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow is the suggested model able to deal with words and entities that're not in the training data set? \nCould the authors please give us information, about the computational resources needed to develop and evaluate the suggested model? \nHow well does the suggested model work on datasets that vary in characteristics, like datasets containing entities or relationships?
