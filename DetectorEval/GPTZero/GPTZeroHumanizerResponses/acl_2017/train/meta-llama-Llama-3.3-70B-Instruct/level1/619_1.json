Doesn't delve into other facets of revision analysis, like sub sentence scopes or evaluative criteria. \nFurther validation is required as the outcomes of the two studies outlined in the document show promise; however there is a necessity for confirmation to establish the efficacy of the dataset and the proposed framework, for analysis revisions. \nTo all the writers there; \nHow do you intend to broaden the range of texts to encompass a number of contributors and various writing examples? \nCould you please elaborate further on how the annotation process works and how well annotators agree with each other on the annotations? \nIn what ways do you see the corpus being applied in real world scenarios like writing support or automated editing evaluations?
