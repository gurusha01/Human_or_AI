The dataset. Which may not accurately represent all historical text normalization tasks due to its limited scope of data sources and variations in language use, over time. \nThe authors did not compare their method to other neural network architectures and neglected to assess alternative neural network models that could be appropriate, for historical text normalization purposes. \nThere is a necessity for examination of the impacts of adjusting hyperparameters as the writers only adjust hyperparameters in one document; this might not be adequate to guarantee that the outcomes are applicable, to different datasets. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to apply their method to historical text standardization databases? \nCould the writers elaborate further about how they tuned the hyperparameters and guaranteed that the outcomes could be applied to different datasets as well? \nHow do the writers believe their method could be utilized in language related tasks like translating text or categorizing text content?
