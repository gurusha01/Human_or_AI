Enhance overall effectiveness further. \nReaching top tier performance levels on known datasets such as CNN and the Childrens Book Test is considered a significant accomplishment, in the field. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe AoD Reader surpasses cutting edge systems by a significant margin showcasing the efficiency of the suggested attention, over focus technique. \nThe strategy of re ranking the options is quite effective, in enhancing outcomes. Especially when used alongside the AoN Reader tool. \nThe document thoroughly examines the findings. Includes a detailed assessment of how well the AoU Reader performed across various document lengths and answer frequencies. \nThe suggested model is straightforward and versatile enough to be used for tasks and datasets. \nThe papers drawbacks include; \nThe paper heavily depends on the belief that using the attention over everything mechanism effectively captures the connections, between the document and the query. \nIn some situations the N best re ranking approach might not work well. Selecting the right features and weights could need some fine tuning. \nThe paper lacks a comparison, with other advanced systems which makes grasping the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model challenging. \nThe paper would be improved by delving into the attention, over a‌ttention mechanism and exploring how it impacts the models effectiveness. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow does the attention, over focus mechanism manage situations where the document and query exhibit varying lengths or structures? \nCan the N best re ranking approach be used for tasks or datasets as well and if yes what changes would be necessary to implement it effectively? \nHow is the suggested model dealing with situations where the response's longer, than one word or cannot be found in the text? \nIs it possible to apply the attention over attention mechanism to types of neural network models, like recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks?
