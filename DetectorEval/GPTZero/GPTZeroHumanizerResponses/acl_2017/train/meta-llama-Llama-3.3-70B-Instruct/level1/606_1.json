It combines a network with a symbolic non differentiable computer to achieve its goals effectively.The NSMs is comprised of the programmer for generating programs the computer for executing these programs and the manager providing guidance and oversight throughout the process.The programmer employs a sequence, to sequence model with a memory feature that enables it to handle and reference intermediate variables efficiently. The computer acts as a Lisp interpreter running programs, against knowledge and offering coding support to the programmer. \nThe key accomplishments of this study include; \nThe NSN framework blends the capabilities of networks with symbolic computing techniques, in its introduction. \nThe creation of a model that can sequence information while incorporating a memory element to capture and reference variables. \nUsing a Lisp interpreter, on the computer creates a user neural interface and enables programs to run efficiently. \nThe positive aspects of this document include; \nThe NSN framework represents an creative method, for neural program induction that could address the constraints of conventional neural networks effectively. \nUsing a Lisp interpreter, on the computer allows for a high level programming language that can express meanings effectively. \nThe test outcomes demonstrate that the NSN excels in performance on a semantic parsing dataset, with limited guidance achieving cutting edge results. \nThe papers shortcomings include; \nThe process of training is intricate and necessitates adjustment of hyperparameters. \nThe NSMs may not be widely used in areas without access, to a Lisp interpreter, which could restrict their application range. \nThe paper lacks an examination of the mistakes made by the NSN system that could offer valuable insights into its drawbacks and possible enhancements. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow does the NSN deal with words and entities not found in its database? \nCan the NSN method be used in areas than semantic parsing, like generating natural language or answering questions? \nHow does the NSN stack up against neural programming models, like the Neural Programmer or the Dynamic Neural Module Network when it comes to how well they perform and how easily they can scale up?
