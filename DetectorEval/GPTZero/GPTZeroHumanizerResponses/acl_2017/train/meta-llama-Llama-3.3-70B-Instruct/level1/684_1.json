The GA Reader integrates a step structure with an innovative attention mechanism that enables the model to create tailored representations of words in the text based on the query, for precise answer identification. \nThe primary achievements of this study include; \nThe introduced Gated Attention (GA) module allows the model to focus on specific parts of the token embeddings within the text document which helps in detailed information selection while going through multiple reasoning steps. \nThe GA Reader utilizes a hop architecture by making several passes through the document to mirror how humans comprehend text in multiple steps.This approach has demonstrated outcomes in various recent models focused on text comprehension. \nThe GA Reader delivers top notch results by outperforming models on various significant benchmark datasets with, over a 4 percent enhancement compared to rival standards. \nThe submission excels, in the following areas; \nA new and innovative attention mechanism has been introduced with the GA module which plays a role in enabling the model to focus on specific aspects of the token embeddings, within the document. \nCutting edge Achievements; The GA Reader shows results, on various extensive benchmark datasets to illustrate the success of the suggested method. \nThe research paper thoroughly assesses the GA Reader by conducting an evaluation that includes an analysis of its core components and visual representations of attention mechanisms to shed light on the models capabilities and limitations. \nThe submission has some areas that could be improved such, as...\nThe paper does not provide a theoretical backing for the suggested GA mechanism; instead relying on empirical evidence, as its basis. \nThe GA Reader heavily relies on existing word embeddings that might not be accessible, for every language and field of study. \nThe models computational complexity may be affected by the hop architecture and GA mechanism used in it; this could pose a challenge, for large scale applications. \nQuestions, for Writers; \nIs there a rationale, behind the suggested genetic algorithm mechanism or is it solely grounded in practical outcomes? \nHow well does the GA Reader function, in languages or fields that do not have pre existing word embeddings accessible? \nWhat resources does the GA Reader need and how does its computational complexity stack up against other cutting edge models?
