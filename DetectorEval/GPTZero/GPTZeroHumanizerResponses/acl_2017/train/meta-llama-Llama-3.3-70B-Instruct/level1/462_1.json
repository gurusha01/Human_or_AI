The researchers assess how advanced Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models that utilize word embedding data can predict volatility. Additionally they look into techniques, for integrating textual data with factual market information. \nThe primary achievements of this study include; \nThe authors suggest using a word embedding technique, for sentiment analysis that surpasses leading methods by a large margin. \nThey analyze the features of reports from companies across financial industries and demonstrate that specialized training, for each sector does not enhance performance mainly because of the restricted amount of training data available. \nThe authors show how effective it is to blend written and factual market data by utilizing fusion techniques such, as stacking and Multi Kernel Learning (MK).\nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe authors offer an examination of previous studies and effectively explain the reasoning, behind their approach. \nThey run experiments to assess how well their method works and present, in depth outcomes. \nThe document is nicely. Simple to understand. \nThe papers shortcomings include; \nThe authors fail to offer an explanation for the reasoning, behind their method that relies on word embeddings. \nThe paper would be improved by delving into the analysis of the results and exploring the implications of the findings in more depth. \nSome of the charts and graphs may need enhancement to enhance their clarity and readability. \nAuthors here are some inquiries, for you; \nCould you explain the reasoning, behind your method of using word embeddings and how it enhances current techniques? \nHow do you intend to tackle the challenge of having training data, within various industries and what solutions are you considering for this issue? \nCould you delve deeper into the analysis of the results. Talk about what these findings could mean for how your method could be used in finance and industry applications? "
