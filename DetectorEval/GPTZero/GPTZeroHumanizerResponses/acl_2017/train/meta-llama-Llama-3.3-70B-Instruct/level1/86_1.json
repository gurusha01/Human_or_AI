            "inputText": "In this paper a new method is suggested for converting text into code using a grammar model to understand the syntax of the programming language being targeted.The key advancements, in this study include; \nThe researchers suggest a code generation model that utilizes a grammar model to create an abstract syntax tree (AST). This method enables the model to grasp the details of the desired code and produce properly structured code. \nThe writers describe a grammar model that breaks down the creation process of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a series of steps involving the implementation of production rules and the generation of terminal tokens. \nThe authors present a method called the parent feeding mechanism that lets the model transfer information, from parent actions to child actions to help capture the nature of the AST. \nThe paper has notable strengths; \nThe authors have achieved impressive outcomes in two tasks related to generating Python code by surpassing the performance of current sequence, to sequence and semantic parsing methods. \nThe authors highlight the significance of incorporating syntax details into code generation to produce written code and enhance performance in challenging code generation assignments. \nThe writers demonstrate that their method can handle varying sizes of reference ASTS effectively by performing even on extensive ASTS. \nThe paper has some shortcomings, including; \nThe authors only test their method, on two Python code creation tasks and one semantic parsing task which may not be indicative of all code generation tasks. \nThe authors’ method is quite complex as it involves a lot of work to design the grammar model and establish the parent feeding system; recreating it could pose a challenge. \nThe lack of clarity, in how the model produces code can hinder understanding and enhancement of the model according to the authors perspective. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow are the writers intending to expand their method to include programming languages and what difficulties do they foresee encountering? \nCould the writers offer explanation on the functionality of the parental feeding system and its impact, on the models effectiveness? \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the intricacy of the model and ensure it is easier for other researchers and professionals to understand and utilize?
