These embeddings might not always catch all the subtleties of language nuances. \nThe authors recognize the importance of validation, for their method emphasizing the necessity to test it with broader and more varied datasets. \nAuthors are often asked the questions; \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the challenge of a dataset size and guarantee that their method can be applied to different populations effectively? \nCould the writers offer explanation on how the intricate network characteristics can be understood and their connection, to the fundamental cognitive functions clarified? \nHow do the writers intend to expand their method to encompass languages and cultures while acknowledging the variations, in language usage and thought processes?
