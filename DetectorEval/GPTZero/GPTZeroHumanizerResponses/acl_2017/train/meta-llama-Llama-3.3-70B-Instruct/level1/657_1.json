The findings indicate that the LSTM model has grasped the distinction in gender traits, within text – noting that female students tend to employ justifications centered on others while male students tend to lean towards self focused justifications. \nKey Contributions \nA fresh way to interpret LSTMs is introduced by the authors suggesting a technique, for comprehending LSTM predictions by viewing the model as both an input and output mechanism and creating stimuli that deliberately fluctuate along a specific dimension of focus. \nIn a psychological educational program application example provided by the authors to study essays from a values affirmation intervention dataset shows how male and female students justify their value choices. \nInsights into the traits associated with gender in written text emerged from the findings which suggest disparities in the reasoning patterns employed by male and female students align with established theories, on gendered self perception. \nAreas of expertise\nA take on interpreting LSTMs is presented by the authors—a perspective that sheds new light on comprehending LSTM predictions with potential applications, across various fields. \nA thought out application of a psychological educational intervention by the authors sheds light on the reasoning behind male and female students, in a values affirmation program. \nThe findings strongly support the idea that male and female students use justifications due, to their gender identity beliefs. \nAreas of improvement\nThe method used by the authors may not easily apply to areas or tasks and might need substantial adjustments to work effectively in those contexts. \nRelying on top notch data is crucial, for the authors’ method since it might not always be accessible or simple to acquire. \nThe findings of the authors could be open to explanations and might need further examination or testing, for a complete comprehension. \nQueries, for Writers\nHow do the writers intend to apply this method to areas or objectives and what adjustments might be needed to ensure its success? \nHow will the writers tackle the drawbacks of this method like its limited applicability or reliance, on top notch data sources? \nWhat further research or testing is required to grasp the outcomes and their significance, for gender identity theories?
