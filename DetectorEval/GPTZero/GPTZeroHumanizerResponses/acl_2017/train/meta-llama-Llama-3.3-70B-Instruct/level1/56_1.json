            "inputText": "This study suggests incorporating ngrams into four techniques for word representation—SGNS and GloVe embedding methods along with PPMl and its SVD decomposition factors—bringing insights and advancements, in this field. \nIntroducing ngrams into word representation techniques enhances word representations by expanding the information source from word co occurrences to ngram co occurrences statistics. \nA new method, for creating an ngram cooccurrence matrix is suggested by the authors to decrease disk input/output and ease the hardware load associated with ngrams. \nThe authors perform experiments and assessments by testing word analogies and similarities, in various tasks and qualitatively assessing the ngram representations they've trained. \nThe paper excels, in the following areas; \nEnhanced word representations have shown advancements in tasks such as word analogy and similarity, with the incorporation of ngrams. Showcasing the efficacy of the suggested method. \nInnovative method for creating a frequency matrix allows ngram based models to operate on affordable hardware solutions that are now within reach, for both researchers and industry professionals. \nHigh caliber ngram embeddings capture nuances and grammatical structures effectively to support a range of natural language processing tasks. \nThe paper has some areas that could be improved such, as; \nThe authors briefly looked into hyperparameters and stuck with the standard settings of the baseline models without considering if they were the best fit, for the ngram based models. \nThe authors did not assess their method, against ngram based approaches to determine the uniqueness and efficiency of their proposed method. \nThe authors only assess the ngram embeddings qualitatively. Do not offer a comprehensive evaluation of how well they perform in different natural language processing tasks. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to investigate the connections, between n word groupings and different hyperparameters in order to enhance the effectiveness of models based on n word groupings? \nCan the authors offer a comparison, with ngram based techniques to assess the originality and efficiency of the suggested method? \nHow do the writers intend to assess how well the n word embeddings perform in different natural language processing tasks?
