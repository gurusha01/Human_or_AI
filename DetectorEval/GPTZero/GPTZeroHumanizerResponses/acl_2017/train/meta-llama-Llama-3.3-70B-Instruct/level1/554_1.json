The key advancements of this research include; \nA new approach put forward by the authors involves using SG MCMC to train RNN weight uncertainty and prevent overfitting issues in a scalable manner. \nThe suggested method offers an approach to enhance RNN performance through the incorporation of gradient noise during training and employing model averaging during testing, for effective regularization purposes. \nThe authors showcase how well their method performs on tasks in natural language processing such as language modeling and image captioning as well, as sentence classification. \nThe positive aspects highlighted in this document are; \nThe authors offer an succinct elucidation of the theoretical underpinnings of SG MCMC and how it is utilized in RNN applications. \nThe authors performed experiments on various standard datasets to showcase the efficiency of their method. \nThe authors in this study evaluate their method by comparing its effectiveness with cutting edge techniques, like stochastic optimization and dropout methods. \nThe papers shortcomings include; \nThe suggested method involves running passes multiple times for model averaging, during testing stages which could potentially lead to higher computational load. \nThe authors showcase how well their method works in modeling weight uncertainty but do not delve into an examination of the uncertainty estimates. \nThe authors did not provide a comparison of their approach to Bayesian methods, like variational inference or Monte Carlo dropout. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to deal with the burden of their method during testing? \nCould the authors offer an elaborate examination of the uncertainty assessments derived from their method? \nHow does the suggested method stack up against Bayesian techniques, like variational inference or Monte Carlo dropout?
