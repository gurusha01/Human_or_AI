The paper states three contributions. A new labeling system; exploration of various end to end models using this system; and the creation of an end to end model, with a tailored objective function to align with the new labels. \nThe primary achievements of this study are listed in descending order of impact; \nThe suggested labeling system effectively changes the combined extraction task into a challenge that allows the utilization of end, to end models. \nA new model has been created that focuses on connecting entities more effectively using a targeted objective function throughout the entire process. \nThe results from the experiment show that the suggested approach is effective and has achieved performance on the dataset available, to the public. \nThe positive aspects of this entry are; \nThe uniqueness of the labeling system offers an approach, to the task of extracting information jointly. \nThe extensive testing conducted compares the suggested approach, with baseline methods and offers a comprehensive analysis of the outcomes. \nThe proposed techniques efficiency, in attaining top notch outcomes on the dataset is noteworthy. \nThe flaws, in this submission are; \nThe proposed method is limited to overlapping relations and may not be ideal, for all real world scenarios. \nRely on supervision could lead to errors, in the training data. \nThere needs to be a thorough examination of the bias objective function to grasp its complete influence, on the outcomes better. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow do you intend to tackle the challenge posed by the lack of overlapping relationships, in your projects? \nCould you please elaborate further on how the bias objective function influences the outcomes? \nHow do you believe the suggested approach could be utilized in NLP tasks like answering questions or categorizing texts?
