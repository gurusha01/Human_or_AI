Creating a more complex and engaging dataset, for natural language generation tasks. \nWhen comparing to established standards the evaluation of the suggested framework, against RNNLG gives an overview showcasing both its advantages and limitations. \nExperiments conducted using sequence to sequence models reveal the difficulties in creating intricate texts from extensive data underscoring the necessity for further advancements, in models. \nThe papers shortcomings include; \nThe DBPNLG datasets smaller size compared to the RNNLG dataset could restrict its effectiveness, in training and testing NLQ models. \nThe DBPNLG dataset presents a level of complexity and diversity compared to the RNNLG dataset which could pose additional challenges, in handling it. \nWe have seen from the tests with sequence to sequence models that there is a requirement, for sophisticated models to produce linguistically intricate texts from diverse data sources. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow do you intend to expand the DBPNLG dataset to enhance its size and scope further? \nCould you share information, about how the crowdsourcing was carried out and the methods used to maintain the quality of the gathered texts? \nHow do you reckon the suggested framework could be utilized to generate datasets, for natural language generation tasks like crafting dialogues or summarizing texts?
