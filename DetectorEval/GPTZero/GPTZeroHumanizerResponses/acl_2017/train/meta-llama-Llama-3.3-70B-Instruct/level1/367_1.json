Seems to be enhancing its correlation, with human assessments. \nExamining the error breakdown offers valuable insights into the constraints of automated metrics and emphasizes the necessity for additional exploration, in this field. \nThe shortcomings of this document are; \nThe evaluations narrow focus on end, to end data driven NLQ systems may not apply broadly to NLQ system types. \nRelying on opinions from the crowd can be tricky since they may not always be accurate or fair due, to biases and inaccuracies. \nThe absence of a reason, for why automatic metrics struggle to differentiate between medium and high quality system outputs is puzzling. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to overcome the constraints of the assessment range and ensure that the findings can be applied to kinds of natural language generation systems? \nHow can we enhance the quality and trustworthiness of judgments gathered from crowdsourcing efforts? \nCould the writers offer explanations, on why automatic metrics struggle to differentiate between system outputs of moderate and high quality?
