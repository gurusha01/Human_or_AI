The training time doesn't necessarily grow proportionally with the length of the input sentence. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe model effectively utilizes knowledge to direct the attention mechanism and enhance the performance of the natural language understanding (NLU).\nThe new model performs well on the ATIS benchmark dataset compared to other standard models. \nThe model demonstrates improved adaptability and resilience, to data availability—particularly noticeable when the training dataset is small. \nFlexibility in representing knowledge is a feature of the model as it can work with various forms of knowledge representations, like dependency trees and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMRs).\nThe analysis of attention reveals that the model appropriately focuses on subcomponents with guidance, from external information despite limited training data availability. \nThe paper has its flaws ; \nThe models complexity could pose challenges during training and optimization due, to its architecture. \nThe model heavily depends on information that may not always be accessible or precise. \nThe model is assessed based on the ATIS benchmark dataset; however it may not accurately reflect performance, on other NLU tasks or datasets. \nThe paper does not provide a comparison, with attention based models that could potentially have similar performance levels as the proposed model. \nHyperparameter tuning is necessary, for the model. Can be quite time consuming and demanding in terms of computational resources. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow does the system deal with situations when the existing information is not fully accurate or is lacking in details? \nCan this model be used for NLU tasks, like identifying intentions or analyzing sentiments? \nHow does this model stack up against attention based models, like the ones found in machine translation or question answering tasks? \nWhat is the expense of training the model computationally. How does it change as the size of datasets increases? \nIs it possible to utilize the model in a scenario of task learning by training it on various Natural Language Understanding tasks all at once?
