Surpasses a number of basic models, in performance. \nThe model effectively captures information from syntactic paths and words by utilizing attention based neural networks. \nThe system can better recognize speculative values with the assistance of relevant indicators. \nThe papers shortcomings include; \nThe effectiveness of the model is greatly dependent on the quality of the identified characteristics, like SIPs (Service Improvement Plans) sources of information and signals. \nThe model doesn't perform well on embedded sources because of the complex sentence structures. \nThe model needs an amount of labeled data for training purposes; this could pose a challenge for languages or fields, with limited resources. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to enhance the models efficiency when it comes to embedded sources? \nCould the writers offer information about the attention mechanism utilized in the model and its role, in capturing significant details from syntactic paths and words? \nHow do the writers intend to modify the model for languages or fields, with annotated data availability?
