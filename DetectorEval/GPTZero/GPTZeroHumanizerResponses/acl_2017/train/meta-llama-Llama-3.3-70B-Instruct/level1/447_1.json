Drawing inspiration from RST. Which enables the model to grasp the significance of text segments without standardizing attention weights. \nThe authors were able to achieve the results in four, out of five datasets using their approach which shows its effectiveness. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nThe authors clearly explain why they chose to incorporate discourse structure in text categorization and point out the shortcomings of methods. \nThe authors carried out experiments, on five datasets to compare their method with the latest techniques available. \nThe authors thoroughly examine the results by conducting an analysis that includes assessing the attention weights qualitatively and discussing how parsing performance impacts categorization accuracy. \nThe papers shortcomings include; \n\"Having many parameters, in the complete model can cause overfitting issues when dealing with smaller datasets.\"\nThe method may not apply effectively to genres with distinct discourse structures like legislative bills due, to its limited generalizability. \nRelying on the discourse parser plays a role, in determining the accuracy of categorization results and could potentially restrict the practicality of this method. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the problem of overparameterization, in the model? \nCould the authors offer explanations on why the method is ineffective, for legislative bills? \nHow do the writers intend to enhance the conversation analyzer to boost the precision of the classification system?
