Key highlights of this study include; \nThe authors introduce a task that involves predicting absent entities, in online articles—a complex challenge owing to the varying language styles and numerous rare entities involved in the process. \nThe authors have upgraded the Wikilinks dataset to offer an advanced version for assessing models, in the rare entity prediction task on a larger scale. \nThe authors put forth the Encoder and Hierarchical Double Encoder models as a solution, to predicting rare entities by utilizing external knowledge from lexical resources and achieving notable enhancements in performance compared to standard models. \nThe paper excels, in the following areas; \nThe writers suggest a task that deals with a major hurdle, in processing natural language – predicting uncommon entities mentioned in online articles. \nThe authors have developed a dataset that serves as a standard, for assessing models in predicting rare entities. \nThe authors suggest two models that show advancements compared to standard models by utilizing external knowledge to tackle the challenge of predicting rare entities effectively. \nThe paper has some flaws ; \nThe authors evaluation of their models is restricted to accuracy this may not provide a complete assessment of the models performance capabilities. \nThe authors failed to compare their models to the cutting edge models, in similar tasks; this lack of comparison makes evaluating the performance of their models challenging. \nThe authors lack of analysis of the results hinders comprehension of their models strengths and weaknesses. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow are the authors intending to expand their research to include forms of external knowledge like relational data between entities, in the future? \nHow are the authors intending to assess their models using evaluation measures, like precision, recall and F score? \nHow do the authors intend to evaluate their models against the models in tasks, like identifying entities and resolving ambiguities?
