The key highlights of this research include; \nIntroducing a factor to represent a range of diverse conversations; The writers suggest a model based on CVAEs that adds a hidden factor to capture the range of responses in discussions at the conversational level, for more varied and context specific replies. \nThe authors have enhanced the CVAEmodel by incorporating linguistic prior knowledge like dialog acts, in their Knowledge Guided CVAEmodel (kgVAEmodel). This modification aims to enhance the models effectiveness and ease of interpretation. \nThe authors suggest a training approach called bag of word loss to tackle the challenge of vanishing latent variables in training VAE based models, with RNN decoders. \nThe paper excels, in the following aspects; \nProposed models like CVA and kgCAVE have shown results in producing a wide range of relevant responses, at the conversational level compared to a robust baseline model. \nThe kg Conditioned Variational Autoencoder (kgVAEmodel) intelligently integrates linguistic background information, like dialogue patterns to enhance the models effectiveness and ease of understanding. \nA new and innovative method for training involves using the bag of word loss technique to address the challenge of disappearing latent variables in VAE based models, with RNN decoders. \nThe shortcomings of this paper include; \nThe models suggested. CVAEs and kgCVEs. Are intricate and demand adjustment of hyperparameters that may pose a challenge. \nThe study mostly relies on automated metrics, like BLEUs and cosine distance to assess the models performance. These metrics might not capture all the subtleties considered in human evaluations. \nThe paper would be improved by conducting experiments such as comparing with other advanced models and assessing performance, on various datasets. \nQueries, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to expand the kgGVA model to encompass language aspects, like feelings and proper nouns? \nCould the writers offer information regarding the identification system and its application, in uncovering valuable overarching purposes? \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the intricacy of the model and enhance its usability, for professionals?
