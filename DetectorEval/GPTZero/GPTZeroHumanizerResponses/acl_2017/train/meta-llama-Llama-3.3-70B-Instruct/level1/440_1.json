Key highlights of this study include; \nThe authors suggest an approach that integrates CCG categories and dependencies to enable effective A star search and deliver top notch outcomes, in English and Japanese CCG parsing. \nThe authors have introduced a model that focuses on predicting heads in bi LSTMs to address attachment ambiguities more effectively compared to older approaches based on fixed rules. \nThe researchers demonstrate that their combined approach is compatible, with A* search algorithm – known for its efficiency and optimality – yielding outcomes compared to earlier techniques. \nThe paper excels, in the following areas; \nThe authors have achieved the F score results, in English CCG parsing compared to previous leading models. \nThe writers’ parsing tool works efficiently by handling than five times the number of sentences compared to a leading parser, in A star search. \nThere has been an enhancement in the performance of Japanese parsing with the method proposed by the authors surpassing a basic shift reduce parser, in CCG parsing tasks. \nThe paper has some shortcomings, which include; \nThe model created by the authors is quite intricate as it consists of elements such as bi LSTMs (bidirectional Long Short Term Memory networks) MLPs (Multilayer Perceptrons) and a biafline transformation technique.It could pose challenges when it comes to training and optimizing due, to its complexity. \nRelying on existing word embeddings can be limiting since they may not always be accessible, for all languages and domains as needed by the authors. \nThe assessment of Japanese parsing in the study is. Further experiments are required to thoroughly evaluate how well their approach performs in this language. \nQuestions, for writers; \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the intricacy of their model and what methods can be employed to streamline or enhance it? \nCould the writers offer information regarding how they conducted the training phase of their work  such, as the specific hyperparameter configurations and the optimization algorithm that was utilized? \nHow do the writers aim to expand their approach, to languages or fields and what difficulties do they foresee in the process?
