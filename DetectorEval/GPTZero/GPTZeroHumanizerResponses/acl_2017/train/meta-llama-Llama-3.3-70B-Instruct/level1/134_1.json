The authors explore neural network approaches for AM such, as dependency parsing and sequence tagging alongside multi task learning and a hybrid model integrating sequential and hierarchical information. They assess the efficiency of these models using a set of essays and contrast their results with those of a feature based ILP model. \nKey Contributions\n\"We introduce a pioneering approach called Neural End toEnd AM in our paper that removes the requirement for feature engineering and expensive ILT constraint design, in computational AM.\"\nThe authors demonstrate that Bi Long Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) taggers excel in identifying components effectively and that a traditional neural sequence tagging model can maintain strong performance, across various contexts. \nThe paper highlights the significance of integrating component and relation detection in a joint modeling approach and emphasizes that simply connecting these tasks together without thoughtful consideration may not yield optimal results. \nAttributes\nThe research paper has achieved new results in end to end acoustic modeling on the PE dataset, from Stab and Gurevych (2016).\nThe writers perform an assessment of various neural network structures and measure their effectiveness, against a feature based ILF model. \nThe paper offers insights into the challenges of identifying relationships within lengthy documents and emphasizes the significance of using cautious modeling methods, in such scenarios. \nAreas, for improvement\nInsufficient Investigation into Hyperparameters; The study lacks an examination of hyperparameters, in the neural network models that could affect their effectiveness. \nThe authors did not assess their models against neural network designs like encoder decoder models that could be relevant, for AM purposes. \nThe findings of the paper rely upon one dataset; it remains uncertain whether these models can be applied effectively to different datasets or fields. \nQuestions, for Writers\nHow do the authors intend to tackle the problem of adjusting hyperparameters for the network models? \nCould the authors elaborate further on the reasons behind the performance of the LSTM‐ER model in identifying relations, within lengthy documents? \nHow do the writers intend to expand their research to sets of data or fields and what difficulties do they expect to face in the process?
