Subsequently using this dataset to devise a formula, for predicting text readability based on these features. The writers test their formulas effectiveness through cross validation and state that it achieves an accuracy of, than 80% accurately predicting the readability of Vietnamese text. \nKey Findings\nThe authors have developed an trustworthy collection of Vietnamese texts for use in natural language processing research—a valuable addition, to the field. \nThe authors have created a formula to forecast text readability by considering factors like the average sentence length and word length as well, as the proportion of challenging words used. \nThe authors assess their formulas effectiveness through cross validation and state an accuracy exceeding 80% in predicting the comprehensibility of Vietnamese text. \nAreas of expertise\nThe writers compile an dependable collection of Vietnamese text that greatly benefits the realm of natural language processing. \nThe authors have created an efficient method, for forecasting the readability of text by utilizing a blend of easily extractable features. \nThe researchers achieved an accuracy rate of more than 80% a noteworthy accomplishment, in assessing the readability of Vietnamese text. \nAreas of improvement\nThe writers only focus on a range of features like the average length of sentences and words as well, as the percentage of challenging words; this approach may not fully grasp all the intricacies of text comprehensibility. \nThe authors fail to make a comparison, between their formula and established formulas for assessing text readability; this omission hinders the assessment of their formulas effectiveness. \nThe authors only test their formula, on a collection of Vietnamese text that may not reflect all kinds of textual data. \nQueries, for Writers\nHow do the writers intend to broaden their research to encompass languages and fields of study? \nCould the writers offer information about the characteristics they utilized and their rationale, for selecting them? \nHow do the writers intend to assess how well their formula works on collections of data and sets?
