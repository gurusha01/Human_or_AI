Shows greater resilience, to limited data availability. \nVector space models such as WordVec and GloVe play a role in capturing the relationships between words, for sentiment analysis tasks. \nThe paper thoroughly compares the method with the current one and talks about the potential drawbacks and future paths, for this research. \nThe results of the experiment show how well the suggested method works in classifying sentiments and offer insights, into how dense vector modeling can help address the issue of sparse data. \nThe paper has some areas that can be improved such, as;  \nThe results of the suggested method fall short of the performance seen in traditional supervised techniques that usually reach an accuracy rate exceeding 80%.\nThe technique for creating reference vectors through vector averaging may not be the approach as the improvement in results does not significantly rise with an increase, in the number of word tokens. \nThe paper would be improved by providing a thorough exploration of the constraints of the suggested method and potential directions, for future research to consider. \nThe evaluation of the method should extend beyond just one dataset, like the PMl R approach did; it's crucial to test it across various datasets and tasks for a more comprehensive assessment. \nQuestions, for writers;  \nHow do the authors intend to tackle the challenge of creating reference vectors to depict the emotional tone of a vector space accurately? \nCan the writers offer information, on how the suggested method could be used in real life scenarios for analyzing sentiments? \nHow do the writers aim to enhance the effectiveness of their suggested method to match the criteria of supervised methods? \nCould the writers talk about the drawbacks of the suggested method when it comes to scalability and computational efficiency?
