            "inputText": "This study introduces two approaches, for creating rhythmic poetry in different styles automatically outlining the key advancements of this research work as follows; \nA neural language model was trained on a representation of poetry to understand both its structure and meaning implicitly. \nA structured character based model follows a step, by step method that merges a language model with a judgmental model to convey structure effectively for shaping the style of crafted poems. \nEvaluation Approach; Conduct a real world assessment to showcase how well the suggested models perform in creating top notch rhythmic poetry. \nThe positive aspects of this paper include; \nA fresh perspective is taken with the utilization of encoding and restricted character level models for crafting poetry offering a novel and creative approach, to the art form. \nThe poetry produced is top notch; 54 percent of individuals perceive the machine created poems, as human authored works of art. \nFlexibility is enhanced with the character level model limitation as it provides influence over the style of generated poems such, as themes and poetic elements. \nThe evaluation method is well thought out. Offers a comprehensive review of the suggested models. \nComparing the generated poetry to poetry serves as a helpful standard, for assessing its quality. \nThe shortcomings of this document include; \nThe phonetic level model has a capacity to adapt to new verse forms due, to its limited generalizability. \nTransliteration mistakes are common, in the phonetic level model. Can impact the overall quality of the poetry produced. \nThe quality of the poetry produced is determined by the quality of the data used for training purposes. \nThe neural language models utilized in this paper may pose a challenge, in terms of interpretability as they can be hard to decipher and comprehend when it comes to understanding the rationale behind the creation of poetry instances. \nThe examination of the outcomes is restricted in scope; a thorough analysis could offer additional perspectives on the merits and shortcomings of the suggested models. \nQueries, for writers; \nWhat methods do the suggested models use to deal with words that're not, in their vocabulary and how can we enhance their ability to manage such words effectively? \nCan the restricted character level model be applied to create poems in languages, than English and what changes need to be made for this to work effectively? \nHow do the new models stack up against cutting edge poetry generation models and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each method?
