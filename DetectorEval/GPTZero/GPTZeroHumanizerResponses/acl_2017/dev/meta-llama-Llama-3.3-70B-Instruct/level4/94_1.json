            "inputText": "\nAdvantages; \nThis research paper introduces a variety of ideas in the area of transition based dependency parsing by exploring non monotonic transition systems and dynamic oracles to handle non projective dependency parsing without limitations effectively.The theoretical and algorithmic examination offered is clear and insightful while the papers overall coherence is praiseworthy. \nAreas, for improvement; \nThe main reason for using Covingtons algorithm is its capacity to reconstruct projective arcs effectively; a thorough empirical error examination centered on non projective structures could have bolstered the papers credibility further.' Besides the contributions of the paper' a comparison with the latest performance standards, in CoNNL datasets and the basic version of the parser would have added value to a thorough assessment. \nLets talk about something, in general. \nThe research expands on Covingtons dependency parsing algorithm that is based on transitions and is intended for handling projective structures without limitations by introducing the concept of non monotonicity.In this approach later transitions are permitted to alter structures that were established by transitions.Furthermore the paper illustrates how approximate dynamic oracles are developed specifically for this approach.The findings from the experiments suggest that these oracles offer an estimation and that the non monotonic system leads to enhanced parsing accuracy compared to its monotonic counterpart, across most languages examined. \nI believe that the theoretical advancements presented in this paper justify its publication to a degree; nevertheless,\"there is room for improvement in the empirical aspects.\" It could be beneficial to conduct an error analysis to determine if the non monotonic system improves accuracy, in dealing with projective structures. There are two reasons for this approach; first is the focus on handling non projective structures using Covingtons algorithm and second is the difficulty in predicting long distance dependencies in such structures for conventional parsers based on greedy transitions which indicates potential enhancements, with the new system. \nOne interesting topic of discussion is how the actual findings stack up against the advancements in the field todayâ€”especially with the help of word embeddings and neural network methods that have come about recently.One example is how non monotonicity is said to lower the error spread thats commonly seen in greedy transition based parsers.On the side some suggest using recurrent neural networks as preprocessors to grasp a broader sentence context in word representations making strides in overcoming this obstacle.It would be intriguing to delve into whether these methods work harmoniously or if they're more at odds, with each other. Though delving deeply into these matters goes beyond the scope of this paper; it would be quite relevant to engage in some discussion, on them. \nCould you please provide details on the following questions?\nThe choice to utilize 9 out of the 13 datasets from the CoNNL X collaborative project requires clarification as explicitly stating the rationale can help avoid readers from making assumptions, about why certain datasets were excluded. \nDo the writers have any theories as to why accuracy drops for Basque with the monotonic system, in place? Similar but pronounced patterns can also be seen in Turkish, Catalan,Hungarian and maybe even German. \nHow do the outcomes stack up against the advancements shown on these datasets? This context plays a role, in grasping the importance of the enhancements stated and empowering readers to evaluate their influence. \nAuthors reply; \nThe authors reply meets my expectations. I find no need to modify my original review. "
