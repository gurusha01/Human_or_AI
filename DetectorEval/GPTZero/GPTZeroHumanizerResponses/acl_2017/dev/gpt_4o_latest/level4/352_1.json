            "inputText": "This study introduces setups and training goals for neural sequence models within a multi task learning (MTB). The authors highlight the importance of task scenarios where tasks can benefit from shared information and learning multiple tasks together could enhance overall performance. \nThe methods section is quite clear and well organized in a manner; I like the overall direction it takes although it could use a bit of fine tuning in its structure. When I read through it carefully two main challenges stood out to me â€“ first is the shared features crossing into the feature space unintentionally and second is the private features seeping into the shared space. The authors suggest an approach for tackling each of these challenges which is quite innovative, in my opinion and if this organization was presented right at the beginning it would make the methods section more cohesive. The paper presents a technique to keep task related characteristics from the common representation by using adversarial loss and another method to prevent common features from affecting task specific representations through orthogonal constraints. However I found the adversarial approach a bit perplexing as it involves a layer after the LSTM output that relies on parameters U and b. The output of this layer is considered as a probability distribution. Then compared with the real distribution data set to see the differences in them both when observing them closely enough from a task related perspective concerns me greatly about the possibility that the system could potentially learn \\( U \\) and \\( b \\) in such a manner that conceals task specific details present, within the LSTM outputs without ensuring that these specific task related details are actually eliminated in reality. \nBefore diving into the assessment part of the study I laid out my hopes for the experiments and overall the paper lived up to them well. The concept put forward is fascinating. Though there are many other experiments one could think of the paper offers the essential experiments needed to confirm the approaches. Incorporating the recognized outcomes, for these tasks would boost the evaluation even more. \nI have a concern about the papers lack of clear motivation for the suggested method.This study explains that a shared model could encounter challenges because of conflicts in the feature space.The shift to a shared model appears to be a logical solution to this issueâ€”one would expect that shared latent spaces capture valuable common information while task specific spaces acquire features that are specific, to each task. Although this line of thinking seems logical at glance; the writers seem to believe that the shared private model is inherently plagued by the very problems they seek to resolve. The argument should have had a flow in the following steps; 1. Models that are completely shared will naturally face conflicts in their feature spaces. 2. Models with private components seem to help alleviate this issue. 3. However shared private models do not entirely resolve this problem in scenarios due to factors a b and c. 4. The authors suggest a technique to better restrict the feature spaces, for outcomes. Table 4 sheds some light on the limitations of shared models and the enhancements brought about by the proposed methods. For instance some words carry meanings that often lead them to be grouped together in discussions. To improve the clarity and persuasive power of the paper it would be beneficial to provide an explanation, a practical example and a coherent argument structure, in the introduction. \nI think this project is connected to uncredited research in multi task learning (MTL) which delves into deep hierarchical MTL by supervising lower level tasks like part of speech (POS tagging) at lower layers and higher level tasks like chunking and CCG tagging at higher layers, with the finding that MTL is effective only when tasks are quite alike. This paper brought to mind a study because the suggested model has the potential to grasp the concept of \"sufficiently similar.\" In words if two tasks aren't deemed similar enough the joint model might not learn much and resort to training separate systems instead. This differs from a shared baseline approach, which could potentially overfit and deliver subpar results under those circumstances. \nI'm sorry.
