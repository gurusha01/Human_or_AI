However, \nNumber the moves listed in Table 1 to enhance readability since it would simplify tracking the corresponding text (lines 095–103). At present readers need to count the turns themselves to align with the references in the description which can cause uncertainty about whether terms such as \" \"third\" and \"last\" pertain, to side specific or overall enumeration. \nThe mention of \"segment level”, in line 269 should be clarified to avoid confusion in understanding its meaning clearly linked to the reference made on line 129 regarding a \"sequence sequence similarity matrix \" as both terms seem interchangeable without an explanation of their intended definitions. It appears that the writers might be discussing the concept of \"word sequences within a sentence \". Word sequences from one word to another ”, with the prefix \"sub \" indicating \"not the entire expression \" although this is not definitively confirmed. \nThe usage of the variable \"x\" is inconsistent as it represents both the count of words in a sentence (mentioned on line 306) and also the count of sentences in a conversation (as described on line 389). To prevent confusion, for readers following the equations closely it would be better to assign variables for these different contexts. \nThe assertion made in the part of Section 5 lacks sufficient backing—\"It suggests that a retrieval based chatbot using SMN could offer a more favorable experience compared to the latest generation model in real world scenarios.\" The two methods are considered similar in 555 instances out of 1000 cases with the baseline performing than the suggested approach, in 238 of the remaining 445 cases.The authors ought to assess and present the relevance of this comparison. If the disparity is not statistically notable enough to warrant change in claims and assertions made in the proposal should be adjusted to indicate that the suggested approach is \"comparable \" than \"superior ”, to the VHRED baseline model. \nAdding labels like \"initial layer \" \"secondary layer,\" and \"final layer \" to the diagram, in Figure 1 mentioned in the text would improve its clarity. \nThe frequent use of the expression \"to meet \" such as, in \"an answer candidate can satisfy each statement \" is ambiguous and hard to understand. \nThere are some errors in spelling and grammar that need to be addressed in the text;. \"Gated recurrent unites\"; This should be corrected.. The word \"respectively \" mentioned on line 133 should be removed.. Punctuation errors on lines 186 and 188 need to be fixed.. \"Baseline model, over\"; This should be changed to \" model by.”. The phrase \"one cannot neglects\" needs correction. "
