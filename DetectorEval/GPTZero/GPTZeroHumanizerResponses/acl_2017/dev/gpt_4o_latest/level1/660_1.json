            "inputText": "A Paper Review, on the Automated Creation of Poetic Rhythms\nContributions \nThis paper introduces two methods for creating rhythmic poetry automatically in a natural way. One method uses a language model trained on phonetic codes to understand poetic structure and meaning effectively. The other method views poetry creation as solving a problem of meeting constraints; a generative language model focuses on content while a discriminative weighted finite state machine (WFST) ensures adherence to structural rules. The researchers show that their models are capable of producing poetry that follows rhythmic and structural guidelines, like Iambic Pentameter and can even create thematically cohesive poems. Through an assessment involving a group of individuals it was found that they struggled to differentiate between poetry created by machines and poetry written by humans; notably one of the machine generated poems even received the highest rating overall. \nThe main achievements of this study are; \nA new method involves using a two step process to create poetry with a character level LSTM for content generation and WFST for form enforcement.This method enables the generation of poetry, in forms and themes without being restricted to specific training data sets. \n\nHuman Assessment of Created Poetry; A thorough external assessment demonstrating that poetry generated by machines can closely resemble poetry written by humans; some poems are even considered beautiful and emotionally evocative. \nAreas of excellence \nThe character level models innovation lies in its ability to separate content and form effectivelyâ€”a notable progress in poetry generation technology utilizing WFST algorithms to uphold rhythmic constraints for enhanced flexibility and creative control in producing various poetic structures without the need, for retraining. \nThe authors performed a human assessment that not only examined the ability to differentiate between machine generated poetry and human created poetry but also evaluated its quality based on readability and emotional impact, in terms of form and content.The findings are persuasive as they demonstrate that machine generated poetry can compete with poetry created by humans. \nIntroducing themes and poetic devices like alliteration and assonance using boosting can significantly improve the aesthetic appeal of crafted poetry. \nThe article showcases a technical base by providing thorough explanations of phonetic encoding methods and transliteration techniques, alongside WFST based constraint modeling principles. A notable innovation highlighted in the paper is the application of Expectation Maximization to extract stress patterns from underlying structures. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe models limited generalization is worth noting as it relies heavily on corpus specific training and may not be easily applicable, to new poetic styles according to the authors acknowledgment of its constraints. \nBias in Evaluation; than basing the assessment purely on \"meaningless poetry \" human evaluation should consider a wider range of rich and meaningful human poems to better gauge the modelsâ€™ effectiveness, in capturing poetic quality across different styles and themes. \nDespite the rhythm, in many generated poems created by AI models that focus on phonetics at a detailed level may still contain grammatical mistakes that can lessen their overall quality. \nThe method of enhancing themes may work well. Its lacking, in depth as it doesn't fully grasp the intricacies of meaning and storytelling coherence required for crafting intricate poetry with deep layers of themes. \nQueries, for Writers \nHow well does the limited character level model do when creating poems in tongues or, without strict rhythmic patterns? \nIs it possible to enhance the phonetic level model by integrating morpheme level representations as proposed in the conclusion? \nHow well does the WFST based constraint system adapt to poetic forms or free verse that have less strict constraints? \nIn summary \nThis study significantly advances the area of automated poetry creation by focusing on a character level model that can effectively incorporate rhythmic and thematic limitations into the process. Although the phonetic level model may lack applicability due to its limited scope of use the overall research demonstrates strong technical proficiency and represents a notable step forward in producing poetry that mimics human expression. The paper is articulated well. The assessment is comprehensive; however there is potential for enhancement, in rectifying grammatical inaccuracies and integrating more intricate themes. It's an idea to approve it since the project shows progress, in the field of creative computing. "
