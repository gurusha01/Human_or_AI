The authors suggest a system that enables fixing attachments without being restricted by their direction, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies that only dealt with partial non monotonicity. In my opinion the main highlights of the paper are ;\nThe research paper enhances the Covington algorithm to allow non monotonicity in transitioning systems so that errors from the past can be fixed in both leftward and rightward arcs—a notable advancement, from previous studies that only dealt with projective trees and partial non monotonicity. \n   \nAn estimated dynamic oracle is created by the writers using limits of the loss to overcome the difficulties, in calculating exact losses in situations that are not monotonic or projective. This oracle has been proven through tests to deliver accurate results efficiently. \nThe study assesses the system using data from the CoNNL X and CoNNL X1 shared tasks in various languages and shows steady enhancements in parsing precision compared to traditional systems, for most languages examined. \nAdvantages; \nThe addition of non monotonicity for non projective parsing represents a significant step forward, in the field of transition based dependency parsing allowing for the resolution of a broader spectrum of errors. \n   \nUsing loss bounds is a practical and creative way to tackle the computational obstacles presented by non monotonicity issues according to empirical evidence proving the effectiveness and accuracy of these approximations, in real world scenarios. \nThe tests were really detailed. Looked at 19 languages while also comparing different ways of measuring loss in a convincing way that proves the non monotonic system does better than the basic one in most situations and has notably better outcomes, in several languages. \nThe flexibility of this method allows it to be used with network parsers and creates opportunities for additional studies and implementation, in contemporary parsing systems. \nAreas that need improvement; \nThe paper mentions the decrease in accuracy, for Basque. Lacks a thorough examination of why the non monotonic system struggles with this language specifically. \nThe article discusses ways to manage cycles in monotonic parsing without explaining convincingly why the selected method (, like deleting links to ensure no cycles exist ) is the best choice, which may open doors for different viewpoints or enhancements. \nThe experiments in the study depend on feature patterns, for the perceptron models performance analysis. While the authors do discuss the possibility of utilizing approaches the absence of trials involving neural models impacts the papers applicability to current cutting edge parsing systems. \nAsking Writers; \nCould you elaborate further on why the non monotonic system doesn't work well for Basque language processing? Are there particular language features or structural elements that pose difficulties, for your method in this context? \n   \nHow does the computational burden of the monotonic oracle stack up against that of the monotonic oracle, in real world scenarios and particularly with larger datasets? \nHave you thought about trying out the suggested oracle, with network based parsers and if you have done so already what difficulties do you foresee in adjusting the oracle for those systems? \nIn my opinion;   \nThis research significantly advances the field of dependency parsing by overcoming the constraints of systems and proposing a feasible method for complete non monotonicity integration. Despite areas, for additional investigation this study is well supported in its rationale methodologically robust and validated through empirical evidence. I suggest accepting it with revisions to rectify the identified shortcomings. "
