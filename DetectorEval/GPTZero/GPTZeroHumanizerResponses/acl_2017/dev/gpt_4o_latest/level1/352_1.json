The main advancement is in utilizing training and orthogonality constraints to guarantee that shared characteristics are independent of tasks while private characteristics stay specific to each task. The researchers test their method across 16 text categorization tasks and show its success, in lowering error rates when compared to current MTl benchmarks. Moreover the article examines how well information can be applied to tasks that have not been encountered before highlighting the usefulness of the gained common understandings.  \nThe key findings of the paper, in my understanding are outlined below; \nIntroducing training to cleanse the common feature space and avoid task related interference is a unique approach, in the realm of Multi task Learning (MTL).\nUtilizing orthogonality constraints to reduce overlap, between distinct feature spaces is a valuable methodological addition. \nSharing knowledge effectively enhances the value of the framework by showcasing how the acquired shared layer serves as readily available information, for new tasks expanding its versatility. \nAreas of expertise  \nTechnique;The integration of adversarial training and orthogonality constraints is groundbreaking and tackles a key drawback of current shared private MTL models.This method is well supported in theory. Has been proven effective through empirical evidence. \nThe researchers carried out experiments using 16 datasets to showcase how well the proposed method can be applied across various scenarios with positive outcomes seen consistently compared to existing methods, like SP MTL and FS MTL. \n\nQualitative Assessment; Observing how neurons behave and examining similarities and differences, in patterns offers an understanding of how the model operates and enhances the numerical findings. \nAreas of improvement  \nThe paper only compares its method with SP MTL, FS MTL MT CNN and MT DNN without evaluating recent or advanced MTL models that have been introduced in current literature. This exclusion undermines the assertion of achieving top notch performance. \nScalability Issues; The new framework may require computing resources because of the adversarial training and orthogonality constraints it involves. The research paper lacks an examination of the computational expenses or how well the method can scale up for handling bigger datasets or complex tasks. \nHyperparameter Sensitivity Note; The paper talks about using a grid search to fine tune hyperparameters but doesn't delve into how sensitive the model's, to these hyperparameters, which could affect the reliability and stability of the findings. \nAsking Authors Questions  \nHow well does the suggested framework perform when dealing with datasets or tasks that involve a higher number of classes? Did you test its efficiency in comparison, to simpler methods?   \nCould you please elaborate further on how the models sensitivity, to the hyperparameters λ. Γ impacts its performance across various settings?\"  \nAre there tasks or types of data that the suggested approach does not excel in performing well at ? If there are any instances what could be the underlying reasons, for that ?\nIn summary.  \nIn terms discussed in this paper show a fresh and skillful strategy for enhancing multi task learning by employing adversarial training and orthogonality constraints is put forward here The outcomes are persuasive and the suggested technique carries practical implications for both MTL and transfer learningHowever the paper could gain from more extensive comparisons with recent techniques and a thorough examination of computational efficiency and hyperparameter sensitivityI suggest accepting this paper under the condition that the authors tackle the highlighted flaws, in the rebuttal stage"
