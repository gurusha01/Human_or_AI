The models performance on three coherence assessment tasks shows that its results are cutting edge and surpass those of other models, by a notable margin. \nPrimary Contributions\nThe paper suggests a framework that enhances the well known entity grid models by enabling the representation of distant transitions, between entities and integrating entity specific characteristics while maintaining generalizaton capabilities effectively. \nThe authors present a structure to depict changes, in entities effectively and prevent the model from memorizing excessively long entity transitions. \nThe paper introduces a pairwise ranking method to train the model for a task and acquire task specific characteristics that enable comprehensive training and enhance the models effectiveness. \nAdvantages\nThe model delivers top notch performance on three coherence evaluation tasks showcasing its ability to capture local coherence effectively. \nThe neural structure and convolutional method allow the model to understand transitions between entities over distances and incorporate unique features of each entity.This makes it adaptable and applicable, to tasks and datasets. \nEnd to end training is made easier, with the pairwise ranking method as it simplifies the training process and enhances the models performance. \nAreas of improvement\nUnderstanding why the model makes decisions and what factors influence its performance can be tricky due, to the complexity of architecture and convolutional methods used. \nThe models effectiveness could be influenced by the selection of hyperparameters, like the quantity of filters or the size of the window and pool length; adjusting these factors can take up an amount of time. \nThe paper mainly focuses on comparing the model with existing entity grid models; however including a broader comparison, with other coherence models and neural architectures would add more value. \nQueries, for Writers\nHow are the writers aiming to deal with the challenge of understanding the model and what methods can be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the models reasoning process? \nCould the writers give information, about how they adjusted the hyperparameters and how the models performance was affected by different hyperparameter configurations? \nHow do the writers intend to expand the model to types of discussions, like conversations that happen at different times and what difficulties do they foresee in adjusting the model for these fresh areas?
