It assesses these acquired knowledge through tasks like identifying parts of speech (POS) and morphology in different languages with diverse morphological complexities. The researchers explore the influence of variables such, as using word based versus character based  representations, depth of the encoder the specific target language being translated and how responsibilities are divided between the encoder and decoder components. The research offers an analysis based on data to assess NMT models and reveals insights, into how these systems capture language elements. \nKey Contributions\nCharacter based Representations for Morphology Study shows that using characters for representations is more effective than using words when it comes to learning word structure and formulating systems in languages, with morphology. \nThe research shows that the lower levels of the encoder excel at grasping the structure of words whereas the higher levels prioritize capturing word meanings. Offering an insight into how NMT representations are organized hierarchically. ##Human like text, in English End##\nWhen translating into languages with grammar and fewer word forms is done so that source side representations improve according to the study mentioned in the paper mentioned here; it reveals an interesting connection, between the challenge of translation and the quality of representation. \nThe study shows that the decoder forms simplified word structures and relies heavily on the attention mechanism to transfer the responsibility of learning representations, to the encoder. \nAdvantages\nThe article conducts an organized assessment of NMT representations in various languages and setups, for different tasks. This extensive analysis enhances the applicability of the results. \nRecent Discoveries in Neural Machine Translation Structures; This research provides new perspectives into how the encoder and decoder elements collaborate and the significance of attention mechanisms and the influence of linguistic structures, in target languages. Aspects that have not been extensively explored in NMT studies. \nPractical Application Insights; The results offer insights for enhancing NMT systems by focusing on character based models for languages, with complex morphology and fine tuning encoder depth based on specific language tasks. \n Step 1; Thorough Approach; By utilizing indicators (such as parts of speech accuracy and tagging morphology) and conducting controlled trials (, like changing target languages while maintaining consistent source data) the credibility of the findings is guaranteed. \nAreas, for improvement\nThe paper mentions the lack of exploration into enhancing decoder learning through alternative architectures or solutions despite acknowledging the deficiencies, in decoder representations. \nThe research mainly looks at the structure and grammar aspects while not delving much into the meaning related features, like parsing or representation of meanings.This restricts the breadth of the discoveries made. \nEvaluating Based on BLEUs Scores; Relying solely on BLEUs scores to gauge translation quality may not accurately reflect the connection, between representation quality and translation effectiveness. \nThe experiments only focus on LSTM based models with attention and do not provide insight into how these results can be applied to newer architectures, like Transformer based models. \nAsking Authors Questions\nHave you thought about examining tasks, like semantic role labeling to assess the understandings acquired by NMT models? \nCan we reduce the impact of the decoder representations by using different structures in the decoder that focus on explicitly representing morphology? \nHow can we apply these results to Transformer based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models that currently play a role, in the field? \nAdditional Remarks \nThe article offers understandings into how NMT models function internally and their capacity to grasp language nuances effectively. Expanding the research to include present day structures and tasks related to meaning would enhance the relevance of the discoveries made here. In general this is a submission that adds substantial value to the domain. "
