Thank you.\"\nIn order to enhance the papers quality and depth of insight I recommend that the writers delve further into analyzing the outcomes especially highlighting the pros and cons of each learning approach. Furthermore they could offer insight into how Memory Networks were put into action like specifying the hyperparameters utilized and the number of hops. Lastly the authors might want to think about including instances of predictions generated by Memory Networks to help readers grasp a clearer picture of how the model functions. \nQuestions to Ask the Writers.\nCould the authors please provide explanation on the following points?\nHow did the writers decide on the settings, for the Memory Networks. How did changing the number of hops impact the models performance? \nCould the writers offer instances of the forecasts generated by Memory Networks in contexts where the model faced challenges like, in Task 3 and Task 5? \nWhat are the authors strategies, for expanding the test environment to include goal focused applications and what obstacles and constraints might they encounter in the process?
