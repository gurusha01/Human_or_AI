Conduct experiments to explore the connection between the high acuity area and zoom, in more detail. \nQueries, for the Writers \nTo better understand the paper I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; (1). Could you explain in detail how the kernel filters are initialized and their impact, on the layouts learned? (2). How do the outcomes vary when different datasets or task limitations are employed? (3). Can you talk about any constraints or shortcomings of your approach and possible ways to address them in research? "
