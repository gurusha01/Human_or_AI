The comprehensive experimental assessment involves comparing with studies and investigating the impacts of various objectives and hyperparameters. The findings indicate that the new method enhances upon research in distinguishing acoustic words and also excels in tasks related to recognizing words, across different perspectives and assessing word similarities effectively. \nMore Input Welcome \nTo enhance the paper further I recommend expanding on how the cost sensitive loss was implemented by delving into specifics such as the selection of hyperparameters and exploring the impact of margin values. It would also be intriguing to delve into an examination of the acquired embeddings complete with a representation of the embedding space and an assessment of word relationships. Lastly authors might contemplate including insights on potential uses for the suggested method encompassing speech recognition and query, by example search.\nQueries, for the Writers\nCould the authors please provide clarification on the following points?\nHow did the writers select the hyperparameters, for the cost loss and what impact did varying margin values have on the models performance? \nCould the writers elaborate further on how they applied the view contrastive losses, in their study. Specifically discussing their selection of negative examples and the impact of using various loss functions? \nHow do the writers intend to expand the suggested method to handle vocabularies and more intricate speech assignments like speech identification and search, by example queries?
