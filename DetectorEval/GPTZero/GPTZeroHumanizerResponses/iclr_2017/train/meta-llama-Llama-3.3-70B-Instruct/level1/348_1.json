            "inputText": "\nThe article discusses Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) a group of networks that are capable of producing notable results, on the CIFAR image classification test.The writers introduce a concept regarding steerable representations that unveils a structured way to combine basic feature types linked to specific symmetries.This concept enables the development of CNN models that efficiently utilize parameters to enhance effectiveness. \nChoice\nAfter consideration of the papers content and merits presented within it I have chosen to approve it for submission. There are two factors that have influenced my decision in a positive manner.\nThe article addresses an significant issue, in computer vision; enhancing the statistical effectiveness of deep learning techniques. \nThe method is convincingly. Situated within the context of previous research, on equivariant CNN models and group representation theory. \nPoints, in Favor\nThe article offers an brief overview of the concept of adaptable representations with robust backing from mathematical explanations and instances provided as evidence. The authors showcase the efficiency of their method in trials conducted on the CIFAR10 database by achieving cutting edge outcomes. Additionally to this success showcasing their approachs effectiveness is an examination of previous researches that emphasizes the links, between adaptable CNN models and other comparable neural network designs. \nMore feedback is needed.\nTo enhance the paper more effectively¸ I recommend that the writers offer additional insights and visual aids to assist readers in grasping the idea of adjustable representations and their structure fully. Furthermore¸ it would be beneficial to incorporate information, on the practicality of the suggested approach¸ especially concerning training duration and memory usage. \nInquiries, for the Writers\nTo make sure I've grasped the paper correctly. I'd appreciate it if the authors could address these queries; \nCould you show me a few instances of how the classification approach for adjustable representations could be applied to create CNN models, with particular patterns of symmetry? \nHow do the writers intend to expand the concept of CNN architectures to cover continuous groups and data, with high dimensions? \nCould you please give me information about how the steerable CNN models were put into practice and share details, about the specific designs and parameters tested in the experiments?
