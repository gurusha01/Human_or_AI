It would also be intriguing to observe experiments involving various kinds of neural networks, like recurrent neural networks or generative models. Furthermore the authors might want to elaborate on the expenses associated with Orthoregulating and its possible real world utilizations. \nDear Authors I have some queries for you. Can we discuss them?\nTo make sure I grasp the papers content correctly I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these queries; \nCould you explain further why it might be problematic to regularize features that are negatively correlated and how Orthoreg tackles this problem? \nHow do you intend to expand Orthoreg to include kinds of neural networks, like recurrent neural networks or generative models? \nCould you give me information, about the expenses associated with implementing Orthoreg and how it could be used in practical situations?
