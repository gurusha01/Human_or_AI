Demonstrates a notable enhancement compared to the standard character model. \nChoice\nAfter consideration I have chosen to approve this paper with some minor revisions based primarily upon the following reasons; \nThe article addresses an well defined issue in sequence, to sequence modeling; the challenge posed by fixed deterministic decompositions. \nThe strategy fits within the existing body of research and the authors offer a comprehensive and lucid examination of relevant studies. \nReasons, for Support \nThe document offers an succinct overview of the issue and the suggested resolution strategy presented by the authors is captivating and compelling in nature with a focus towards enhancing decomposing output sequences more flexibly as highlighted in the detailed LSD framework description provided within the document itself! What really stands out are the outcomes from the LSD model demonstration showcasing substantial enhancements surpassing those achieved by the standard character model as per baseline comparison metrics. Not to forget challenges overcome by introducing a convolutional network within the encoder that further boosts performance resulting in an exceptional state of the art outcome, for Wall Street Journals speech recognition task!\nExtra Input; thoughts.\nI recommend enhancing the paper by delving into the analyzed decompositions and how they connect with the input and output sequences in more detail for clarity and depth of understanding. Moreover it would be valuable to explore experiments on various sequence to sequence tasks like machine translation to highlight the overall adaptability of the LSD framework. The authors could also think about offering insights into the implementation of the LSD framework by elaborating on aspects such, as hyperparameter selection and training methods used. \nQueries for the writers.\nCould you please provide me with some clarification, on the paper by answering these questions?\nCould you offer information on the breakdowns that were understood and how they connect to both the input and output sequences? \nHow do you determine the hyperparameters, for the LSD framework like the vocabulary size and the encoder and decoder layer quantities? \nHave you thought about using the LSD framework for sequence to sequence tasks, like machine translation and if yes then what were the outcomes?
