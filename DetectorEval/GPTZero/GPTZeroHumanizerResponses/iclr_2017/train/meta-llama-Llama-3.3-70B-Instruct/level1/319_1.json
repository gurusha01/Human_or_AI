The research paper showcases findings from experiments conducted across different image classification datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet well as fine grained recognition challenges where notable enhancements, in results were observed through the application of attention transfer techniques. \nDecisions and the main factors considered.\nAfter reviewing the feedback provided to me about the paper in question I have chosen to approve it for submission.The primary factors influencing my decision are as follows; \nThe paper outlines a thought out method for transferring knowledge from a teacher network to a student network by incorporating attention mechanisms showing a strong grasp of existing research and offering a fresh take, on leveraging attention for knowledge transfer purposes. \nThe paper showcases experimental findings across different datasets to highlight the effectiveness of the attention transfer method proposed in the study.It consistently demonstrates enhancements, in performance levels revealing an adaptable approach. \nArguments, in favor \nThe research thoroughly examines how attention mechanisms are utilized in transferring knowledge showcasing how attention maps can pinpoint areas within input data and be passed from a teacher network to a student network for performance enhancement purposes with the experimental findings presented effectively for comparison, against alternative knowledge transfer techniques. \nMore. Inquiries\nTo enhance the paper more effectively. \nCould you please elaborate further on how the attention transfer approach was put into practice? I'm interested, in learning about the architectures that were utilized and the hyperparameters that were adjusted. \nYou might want to include insights, about the attention maps by providing visual representations and explanations of how they shed light on the networks decision making process. \nHow do the writers intend to expand the attention transfer method to tasks like object detection or localization, with weak supervision? \nCould the writers offer explanations regarding why the attention transfer technique outperforms other methods of transferring knowledge like knowledge distillation, in specific scenarios?
