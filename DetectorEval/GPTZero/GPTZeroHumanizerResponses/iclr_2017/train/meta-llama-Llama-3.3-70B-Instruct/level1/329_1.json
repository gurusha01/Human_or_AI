The authors showcase how well their method works on datasets like CIFAR 10 STL 10 and ImageNet while proving its superiority, over current techniques in terms of Inception score and visual appeal. \nChoice\nAfter consideration of the papers content and findings presented by the authors regarding their approach supported by empirical evidence and clear method explanations with promising experimental results showing a notable enhancement, in sample quality; I have chosen to approve this submission. \nPresenting Points of Support \nThe study addresses an issue within the realm of GAN technology – the challenge of training GAN models to generate top notch samples across varied datasets.The authors conduct an analysis of existing research and effectively justify their methodology by leveraging a denoising autoencoder to gauge the discriminator feature distribution.The experiments are meticulously. Showcase the success of the suggested technique through notable enhancements, in Inception score and visual fidelity. \nMore Input Required \nTo enhance the paper further suggestions can be made to the authors such as adding in depth information, about how the denoising autoencoder was implemented. Like its structure and the hyperparameters applied to it. Including additional visual samples of the generated outputs and conducting a thorough examination of instances where the model failed would greatly benefit. Lastly discussing constraints and future avenues for the proposed technique would add value to the overall discussion. \nQueries for the Writers. \nCould the authors kindly provide explanation on the following matters?\nHow did you decide on the settings for the denoise autoencoder and how much do these settings affect the outcomes? \nCould you give me information, about how the denoise autoencoder is set up and how it works in terms of the layers and units it uses? \nHow do you intend to tackle the issue of mode collapse that often arises during GAN training? \nCould you show me visual instances of the created samples with instances of unsuccessful outcomes and scenarios where the suggested approach surpasses current methods?
