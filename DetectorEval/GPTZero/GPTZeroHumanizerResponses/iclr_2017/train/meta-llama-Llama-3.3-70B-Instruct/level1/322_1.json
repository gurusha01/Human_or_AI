            "inputText": "The research paper presents an approach to automatically figuring out the best size for a neural network without needing any initial input about the task, at hand. The authors introduce neural networks as a method to optimize over all potential network sizes without relying on probabilistic calculations and show its validity by constraining network expansion using a penalty term. Additionally they create an optimization technique called Adaptive Radial Angular Gradient Descent (AdaRad) and showcase its success through experiments. \nThe paper focuses on the challenge of determining an optimal network size within a single training cycle without the need for extensive global searches or training numerous networks from the beginning.This method is well founded as it tackles a constraint in current neural network training techniques by reducing reliance, on manual hyperparameter adjustments or costly grid searches. \nThe document thoroughly examines the suggested framework by demonstrating its effectiveness and assessing its performance across standard datasets in a detailed manner. \nNevertheless the strategy has its constraints too; for instance the article highlights that nonparametric neural networks might not excel in datasets with classes or intricate connections between inputs and outputs Also the writers admit that the selection of hyperparameters, like the regularization parameter λ could greatly impact the frameworks effectiveness. \nTo enhance the paper further I recommend offering a thorough examination of the drawbacks of the methodology and potential directions for future studies.It would also be beneficial to present comparisons with cutting edge techniques, in neural network training and fine tuning hyperparameters. \nI have an inquiries that I hope the writers can address to help me better grasp the content of the paper; \nHow do the writers determine the value of λ. How does varying λ impact the frameworks performance? \nCould the writers delve deeper into the reasons behind why nonparametric neural networks might struggle on datasets containing classes or intricate connections, between inputs and outputs? \nHow does the AdaRad algorithm stack up against other optimization algorithms, like Adam or RMSprop when it comes to how it converges and how stable it is? \nI believe the paper should be accepted as it introduces an well founded approach to automatically finding the best size for a neural network and proves its efficiency through experiments. However the authors could enhance the discussion, on limitations and future research possibilities.  \nChoice made. Approved. \nMotives;  \nThe article addresses an issue, in training neural networks and the method is both well supported and innovative. \nThe document offers an examination of the suggested structures effectiveness and assesses how well it performs across various standard datasets. \nThe findings indicate that nonparametric neural networks can deliver results to parametric networks but with fewer parameters and reduced training time. \nI wish for the writers to delve deeper into discussing the constraints and potential paths for studies while also offering more comparisons to other cutting edge techniques, for training neural networks and fine tuning hyperparameters.  \nAdditional comments;  \nCould you expand on the drawbacks of this method. Suggest some ideas for future exploration, in more depth?\nLets explore comparisons with cutting edge techniques, in neural network training and fine tuning hyperparameters. \nPlease consider elaborating on why certain hyperparameters were chosen and how adjusting the regularization parameter λ impacts the performance of the framework, with varying values of λ.
