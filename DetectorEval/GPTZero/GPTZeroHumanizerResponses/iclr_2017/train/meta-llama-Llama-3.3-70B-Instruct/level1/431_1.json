Furthermore the authors might want to delve into the computational demands of various neural network structures and elaborate on how PALEO could optimize these structures for improved performance. \nQueries, for the Writers.\nTo make sure I grasp the paper correctly and support my evaluation, with proof if needed I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; \nCould you offer information, about how PALEO utilizes cuDDN heuristics to select algorithms for convolution operations? \nHow does the PALEO system handle tasks, like organizing work schedules and transferring data within learning frameworks while considering additional operational requirements? \nCould you please share details, about the platform percentage of peak (PPP)? I'm curious to learn how it is calculated for deep learning frameworks and hardware setups. "
