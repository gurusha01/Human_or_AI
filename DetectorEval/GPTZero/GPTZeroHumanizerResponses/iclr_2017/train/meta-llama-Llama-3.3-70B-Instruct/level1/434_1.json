Recommendations\nTo enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors offer an insight into the hyperparameter exploration conducted for every experiment. Furthermore it would be beneficial to incorporate visuals of the outcomes like graphs showing the progress, over time and diagrams representing the activations to provide a clearer comprehension of the advantages of the suggested method.\nAuthors I have some queries for you.\nTo make sure I get the paper in my head I have a few questions, for the authors; \nCould you please elaborate further on how the batch normalization parametersre set up and how they impact the effectiveness of the proposed method? \nHow do the writers intend to tackle the problem of escalating gradients when it comes to batch normalization, in deep recurrent neural networks? \nCould you please share details regarding the computational expenses associated with the suggested method and how it stacks up against other techniques for mitigating internal covariate shift, in recurrent neural networks?
