The well founded approach integrated within the existing literature on RNN regularization techniques and the comprehensive empirical support presented through detailed experiments and comparisons, with other regularizers. I have decided to approve it. \nReasons, in favor\nThe article offers an brief overview of the issue of regularization in RNNs and explains the importance of exploring a fresh perspective on the matter in detail.The authors extensively examine research on dropout and its modifications while pointing out the drawbacks of current techniques.The thorough experimental analysis encompasses tasks and datasets to showcase zoneouts positive impact on enhancing performance.Additionally the authors shed light on zoneouts advantages such, as introducing randomness and enhancing gradient flow. \nHere are some more thoughts and ideas for you to consider.\nTo enhance the paper more effectively for readers understanding and engagement with the topic at hand I recommend that the authors delve deeper into analyzing how zoneout probabilities are tuned as hyperparameters and investigate how zoneout can be applied in different RNN structures like GRUs and bidirectional RNNs. Furthermore it would be intriguing to see a comparison between zoneout and other regularization methods such, as weight decay and early stopping techniques. \nQueries, for the Writers \nTo better grasp the content of the paper in question. Gain insight from the authors directly. I'm interested in having them address the inquiries;  (1a.) Could you elaborate further on why zoneout's more effective than dropout in RNN settings and how the stochastic identity connections brought about by zoneout enhance gradient propagation?  (2a.) What are your strategies for extending zoneout to encompass complex deep learning architectures, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers? Could you share information, about the computing resources and training duration needed for the experiments and explain how zoneout impacts the training duration and convergence of RNN models? "
