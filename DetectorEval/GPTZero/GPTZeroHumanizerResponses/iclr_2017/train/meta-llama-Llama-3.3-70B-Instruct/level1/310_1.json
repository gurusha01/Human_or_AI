            "inputText": "In brief\nThe study outlines a structure for language acquisition that relies on agent communication dynamics where agents create their own language through interactive referential games.The researchers illustrate that basic neural network agents are capable of coordinating in games and attaching significance to symbols that encompass fundamental conceptual attributes of objects.They also indicate that establishing a connection between communication and natural language is viable, by integrating the game with a task. \nChoice\nUpon consideration of the manuscript in question and its associated merits and demerits within the academic discourse realm. I have come to a decision to give my approval for its acceptance for publication based on two pivotal aspects that caught my attention. Firstly. Foremostly is the well founded rationale underpinning the research approach adopted in this study. As it resonates deeply with prevailing theories from diverse fields such, as linguistics,m cognitive science and game theory. Secondly the empirical support provided throughout the paper through an array of experimental data is commendable. Especially highlighting findings from trials involving varied sender architectures and vocabulary sizes. \nReasons, for Support \nThe article addresses a question in AI – how to create agents that can interact well with humans effectively? The authors outline a defined framework for learning language and showcase the success of their method through experiments conducted in their study. They introduce the use of games as a platform for language learning which proves to be an innovative and intriguing addition, to the field of study; furthermore providing a detailed examination of the outcomes obtained. \nAnother round of feedback to consider.\nTo enhance the papers quality I recommend adding information about the experimental configuration and the specific hyperparameters utilized in the trials.In addition it would be intriguing to delve into analyzing the evolving language and its characteristics like syntax and meaning.The writers might also want to explore intricate situations such, as multi stage communication or communication involving multiple participants. \nQueries, for the Writers\nCould you kindly elaborate on the following points authors?\nHow are the writers intending to expand their method for dealing with challenging language learning activities, like discussions or conversations? \nCould the writers offer information on the characteristics of the developing language and how it connects to human language? \nHow do the writers intend to assess how well their method works in situations that're more lifelike. Like when humans interact with agents? "
