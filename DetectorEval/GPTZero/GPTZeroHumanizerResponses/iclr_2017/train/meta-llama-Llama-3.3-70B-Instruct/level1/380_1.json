The challenge of GAN models in producing accurate energy assessments for generated samples.The method adopted is well thought out. The authors present a comprehensive evaluation of their proposed approach.The practical findings align with the examination presented in the paper which is articulated in a clear and coherent manner.The overall quality of writing is commendable. Enhances readability, for readers. \nArguments, in favor\nThe research paper thoroughly describes the behavior of the discriminator in a parametric context and suggests two approaches to applying it in a more common parametric setup. The results from experiments support the findings on discriminator characteristics and demonstrate that the suggested framework produces high quality samples. Furthermore the authors offer an evaluation against standard models and investigate the performance variances, among the proposed approaches. \nFurther Comments\nTo enhance the paper more effectively in stepwise directions would be; Firstly emphasizing the reasoning behind selecting the convex function K(pgen) and how it influences the optimal discriminator would greatly benefit readership comprehension and engagement. Including a more intricate examination of the constraints associated with both variational inference based approximation and nearest neighbor based approximation could offer a deeper understanding of the models performance. Lastly exploring quantitative outcomes related to the efficiency of the acquired discriminator, in capturing density information is another avenue worth considering for a comprehensive paper presentation. \nQueries, for the Writers\nCould you please explain why the convex function K(pgen)s selection is important and how it affects the optimal discriminator? \nWhat are your strategies for overcoming the drawbacks of the inference based approximation and the nearest neighbor based approximation, in upcoming research efforts? \nCould you share numerical findings regarding the effectiveness of the discriminators learning and its capability to comprehend density details on complex datasets with many dimensions?
