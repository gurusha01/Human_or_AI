The writers present a concept named \"transformed Gramians,\" which records how local features are situated in relation, to each other. This enables the model to create textures with overall symmetry characteristics and use texture creation in the process of inpainting. \nChoice\nBased on two factors. The strong motivation behind the approach which is grounded in previous research, on texture synthesis and the notable enhancements shown in creating textures with long range patterns and symmetry limitations. I have chosen to approve this paper. \nReasons, in Favor\nThe paper presents an brief overview of the issue of texture synthesis and the constraints of current methods available for it are discussed clearly by the authors in detail. They justify their method by emphasizing the significance of preserving the structure in images over long distances. The technical segments are neatly laid out and through experiments they illustrate how their approach is successful across uses, like creating textures restoring missing parts in images and changing seasons. \nMore Input Required\nIn order to enhance the paper more effectively; I recommend that the authors delve deeper into the computational expenses associated with their method and look into methods to shorten the time it takes to generate results as well as present additional instances of employing their method on various transformation types, like rotations or scaling for a more comprehensive understanding. \nQueries for the writers.\nTo make sure I've grasped the paper correctly I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; \nCould you share details on why specific values, for δ are chosen for each layer and how they impact the outcomes? \nHow will you manage the expenses involved in your method. Are there any ways to enhance efficiency that you can consider? \nHave you considered implementing your method in fields, like video production or creating 2 dimensional textures and what difficulties and chances do you think exist in those areas?
