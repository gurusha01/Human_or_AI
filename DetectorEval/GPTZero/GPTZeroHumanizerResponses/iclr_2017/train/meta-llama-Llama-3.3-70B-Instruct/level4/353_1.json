Adding a comparison of the supervised classification performance of VAE and PixelVAEin would improve the overall quality of the manuscript as well. \nA related idea is discussed in another article submitted to ICLR titled \"Variational Loss Autoencoder.\" It would be intriguing and beneficial to include a discussion and comparison of these works, in the manuscript. \nThe responses to the questions did shed some light on the architectural specifics; however I suggest that the authors should incorporate precise details of the architecture for all experiments, in the paper and/or share the code openly. The current explanation is somewhat unclear. Makes replicating the experiments quite difficult. \nIn my inquiry question earlier on there was a suggestion to showcase two sets of MNIST samples in the appendix. One produced by PixelCNN and the other by PixelVAQ having the matching PixelCNN depth. To demonstrate how effectively PixelVAQs hidden code captures the overall structure. \nBy attending to these issues it would result in a rating, from my end. "
