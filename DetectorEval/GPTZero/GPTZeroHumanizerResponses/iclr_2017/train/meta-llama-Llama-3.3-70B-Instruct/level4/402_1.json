This discrepancy prompts inquiry into the nature of the task characteristics left unexplored in the report  suggesting that achieving comparable results to CVST within its error margins might have been possible with Hyperband, by merely opting for a random configuration sans any additional expenses incurred. For an assessment it would be best to conduct Hyperband for an equal length of time, as CVST. \nAdditionally The Hyperband experiment used a ή value compared to other experiments which raised questions about the level of method adjustment needed for the best results. It would be advantageous to explore the results of using the ή value of 5 as, in other experiments to gain a more thorough understanding. \nThis study delves into Hyperbands exploration as an expansion of the method introduced by Jamieson & Talwalkar in AISTATS 2016 called halving technique. Successive halving is an algorithm that assesses multiple setups and progressively removes the inferior half to effectively investigate different setups within a constrained resource allocation. \nAfter reviewing the paper again I still find it hard to understand the point of the studys contribution.The key enhancement of Hyperband compared to halving is its established worst case scenarios that are only up to five times worse, than a random search.However this benchmark can be easily met by dedicating some time to execute setups until they are finished. The theoretical discussion mentioned in the paper leads to inquiries, about whether the findings serve as the focus or are connected to a different study suggesting that the current paper mainly delves into an empirical examination of the methodology.It would be beneficial for the authors to provide clarification to address this uncertainty. \nThe results from the experiments do not show an advantage of Hyperband over successive halving when using the most aggressive setting of bracket b equals 1/2(3/3+1). In all the graphs presented in the study report or scientific paper. successive halving with b equals 1/2(3/3+1) is shown to be least as good as or sometimes even better than Hyperband in terms of performance improvement and optimization outcomes which are results or outcomes obtained by applying algorithms to optimize performance improvement. This implies that in real world applications or scenarios where practical considerationsre relevant. it may be preferable to use halving with b equals 1/2(3/3+1) instead of Hyperband for conducting further experiments or tests. If there is a need for ensuring that the performance is not than five times that of random search this can be accomplished by implementing random search, on a certain percentage of the machines used in the experiments. \nThe experiments also include a comparison, between Hyperband and Bayesian optimization techniques. Do not mention Multi task Bayesian Optimization methods that have been widely used for enhancing deep learning performance in recent times without explaining why they were left out of the study. \nThe way Hyperband is introduced as a method for hyperparameter optimization in the midst of established research on multitask Bayesian optimization might be misleading to some extent.The introduction could give a detailed insight into the significance of evaluating configurations in hyperparameter optimization processes like Bayesian optimization and emphasize the potential for significant performance improvements in a clearer manner.A possible way to address this is by including a paragraph in the introduction that offers a more grounded view, on the contributions made in the paper. \nWhen it comes to innovation and originality in the field of machine learning (ML) it's important to recognize that strategies for determining how resources are allocated for assessments have been explored in the ML field for over two decades now. As illustrated in Maron & Moores paper titled \"Hoeffding Races; Accelerating Model Selection Search for Classification and Function Approximation\" presented at NIPS in 1993. Understanding this context is key, to grasping where Hyperband fits in and how it contributes to the broader spectrum of techniques used for optimizing hyperparameters. "
