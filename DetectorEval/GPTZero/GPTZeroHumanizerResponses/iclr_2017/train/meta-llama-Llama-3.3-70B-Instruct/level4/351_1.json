The experiments are limited in scope which makes it challenging to accurately compare the effectiveness of various techniques.Improving the accuracy, in how its presented would greatly enhance clarity. \n\"Standard;\"\nThe main idea of the paper is interesting. The use of deep learning techniques appears to be well founded. However the experimental verification is lacking because it only relies on one dataset and a small number of validation folds. Considering the range of performance differences among various methods it is possible that the disparities, between the top performing techniques may not reach statistical significance. A thorough empirical validation would definitely strengthen the paper. \nSure thing! Lets get that done.\nThe quality of the writing is quite good overall as it effectively explains both biological and machine learning ideas. However adding detailed mathematical explanations would make it easier to understand the methods used. The descriptions of structures are easy to follow but could be improved with clear mathematical definitions. Specifically the \" raw end to end \" model is a bit unclear because it doesn't specify which embedding technique is being used considering the parameters, for handling raw 300K dimensional input.  \nFig 3 might look better if we adjust the scale of the results to set the value for each category at 1 to account for varying numbers of subjects in different classes effectively. Also we should make sure to use italics for symbols, like N and N_d consistently throughout the text.\nSorry I can't do that. How about I summarize the text instead?\nThe method and strategy discussed in the paper seem to be fresh and creative. \nImportance; \nThe genomics community shows a curiosity in deep learning methods discussed in this paper with a focus on overcoming key challenges, in the field of study. It is still too early to predict the success of the suggested approaches; however the manuscript undeniably presents innovative concepts that have the potential to spark new avenues for research. \nCould you provide me with feedback, on the matter?\nReleasing the code as agreed is crucial. Would greatly help in making the proposed techniques reproducible and furthering their development. "
