The study shows enhancements in effectiveness with fewer samples and resilience when contrasted with traditional approaches such as ones relying on image pixels or custom crafted keypoints along, with typical deep reinforcement learning algorithms. \nDecision approved.\nThe research paper shows motivation by presenting a fresh perspective in visual servoing and backing it up with solid real world data to validate its arguments, for approval are the following reasons;   \nNovelty and Impact; A new approach using trained deep features with bilinear predictive models and reinforcement learning, for visual servoing stands out for its creativity and has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of conventional methods that depend on manually crafted features and large datasets.   \nThe experiments conducted show a level of thoroughness in proving the effectiveness of the suggested approach even when dealing with challenges like obstructions and variations in visuals and distractions from the main task at hand. The significant enhancement in sample efficiency (more, than a hundredfold increase) as opposed to relying model free reinforcement learning methods is especially convincing.   \nPoints, in Favor \nThe papers relevance and motivation are clearly evident as it tackles an issue in the field of robotics by utilizing pre trained features and bilinear dynamics to minimize the necessity for extensive task specific engineering. A valuable contribution, to the domain.   \nMethodological Soundness Evaluation; Utilizing fitted Q learning, for determining feature weights is strongly. Computationally effective according to the researchers findings. They offer a defined description of their methodology that encompasses the integration of multiscale features and the bilinear dynamics model.   \nThe findings from the car following test are quite impressive showing that the new approach surpasses traditional image based visual servoing (IBVS) position based visual servoing (PBVS) and end to end deep learning methods, in terms of effectiveness and computational speediness.The ability to adapt to scenarios also highlights the applicability of this method.   \nWays to enhance your work.\nEnsuring understanding of the overall adaptability of this technique is crucial for its application to new vehicle models in simulated tests; however it would be beneficial to explore potential challenges in real life situations such as coping with environmental disturbances and sensor discrepancies, in intricate settings.   \nComparative Analysis with Data; The tests are carried out in a virtual setting but presenting findings, from real life data or tangible robots would greatly enhance the papers significance.   \nIn addition to comparing feature representations and weighting techniques in the papers analysis of the bilinear dynamics model (for example locally connected versus fully connected) conducting further ablation studies could offer more profound insights, into its impact and significance.   \nThe paper talks about how the process operates at 16Hz and highlights that a significant portion of the computation time is dedicated to feature extraction tasks. Offering insights into improvements, like employing lightweight networks could greatly benefit real time applications.   \nDear Authors I have some inquiries, for you. Could we discuss them?\nHow well does the method work in situations, with noisy or incomplete data points and have you thought about trying out the technique on actual robots?   \nIs it possible to expand the suggested approach to cover activities than tracking a goal, like handling objects or coordinating multiple agents?   \nHow much does the methods effectiveness depend on the selection of trained features (for example VGG compared to other architectures)?  \nThe study adds insights, to the realm of visual servoing and robotics which could be further improved by considering the suggestions mentioned above to boost its effectiveness and practicality.
