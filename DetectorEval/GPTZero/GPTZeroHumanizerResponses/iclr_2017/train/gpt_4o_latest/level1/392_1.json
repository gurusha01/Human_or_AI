The writers suggest a powerful technique to estimate gradients for non differentiable processes like quantization without changing the primary operations. They also introduce a sub pixel convolutional structure that allows real time decoding of large images, in high definition. The approach delivers results to JPEG 2000 in PSNR but surpasses it in SSIM and MOS ratings especially at increased data rates.The research emphasizes the adaptability of the suggested model that can be customized for types of content and measures while showcasing its computational effectiveness, over RNN dependent methods. \nOutcome determination made. Approved.\nThe paper is thoroughly. Offers a valuable contribution, to the field of lossless image compression while also showcasing thorough empirical confirmation of its findings. Key factors that led to its acceptance include; \nThe new approach solves the issue of non differentiability in training autoencoders, for compression effectively. Provides a practical solution that requires minimal computational resources. \nImpressive Empirical Findings. This approach excels in delivering top notch results with high resolution images and surpasses codecs such, as JPEG 2000 in terms of perceptual quality measures. \nSupporting points and reasons\nThe paper is effectively positioned within the realm of research by expanding on previous studies and tackling significant drawbacks of earlier techniques.It provides an analysis of comparable methods, like those presented by Ball√© et al.(2016) and Toderici et al.(2016) emphasizing the benefits of the suggested approach. \nThe authors meticulously outline their research methods, in depth by explaining the structure they used. The techniques employed in training and evaluation metrics utilized This study is thorough as it includes a wide range of assessments including both numerical and descriptive analyses which lead to persuasive outcomes. \nFlexibility and efficiency are factors that make this framework suitable for various content types and metrics in real world scenarios due, to its adaptability and computational effectiveness. \n\nThe clarity regarding Gradient Approximation is important in the context of quantization techniques outlined in the paper; however it would be beneficial to provide theoretical reasoning or conduct studies comparing it to alternative approximations, like additive noise to enhance the argument. \nThe trials mainly concentrate on real life images but showcasing outcomes across various media types such, as 360 videos or VR content could further showcase the methods versatility. \nThe paper would be improved by a detailed exploration of its constraints; for instance addressing possible difficulties with hardware execution or the balancing act between compression effectiveness and perceptual excellence, at extremely low data rates. \nThe authors touch upon the idea of enhancing autoencoders for metrics yet they do not delve deeply into this aspect of discussion or experimentation which could bring additional insights, to the table. \nInquiries, for the Writers.\nHow well does the suggested approach work at low bit rates in comparison, to JPEG 2000 and other techniques and are there certain scenarios where it faces challenges or difficulties? \nCan the suggested method for estimating gradients be applied to non differentiable operations apart, from quantization? \nHow does the methods computational efficiency stack up against that of codecs when encoding and decoding extensive datasets on a large scale? \nIn terms this document provides a valuable addition to the area of compressing images with quality loss and stands out as a promising contender, for approval.
