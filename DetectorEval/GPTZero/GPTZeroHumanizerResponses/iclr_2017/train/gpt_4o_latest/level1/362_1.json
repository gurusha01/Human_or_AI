The researchers depict optimization algorithms as policies. Employ guided policy search (GPS ) to teach these policies. This enables the identification of optimization strategies that surpass manually designed approaches. The trained optimizers are tested across a range of convex and non. Convex optimization challenges, such, as regression, resilient linear regression and neural network training. The findings show that the developed algorithms reach convergence and/or improved final objective values when compared to conventional techniques such as gradient descent and momentum among others, like conjugate gradient and L BFGS methods. The research is well grounded as it tackles the time consuming task of creating optimization algorithms and adds value to the expanding area of meta learning by emphasizing on learning optimization procedures instead of specific task patterns. \nThe choice is to approve.\nThe research paper presents an argument for approval based its unique approach of framing optimization algorithm design, as a reinforcement learning challenge and the real world data showcasing the effectiveness of the trained optimizers is impressive The findings are substantial. The research methodology is robust and thorough. \nJustifying Points \nThe paper tackles an issue within the realms of machine learning and optimization—the time consuming and repetitive nature of creating optimization algorithms manually is a key concern addressed here by suggesting an automated solution that aligns with the current trend of using machine learning to streamline manual design procedures. \nA new approach is proposed in the research paper that involves portraying optimization algorithms as policies within a reinforcement learning system—a novel and influential concept ! The rationale, behind utilizing GPS to grasp these policies is robustly justified in the paper. Is backed by ample background information to validate this decision. \nThe research findings are solid, with experiments conducted in various scenarios. Both convex and nonconvex ones included in the study.The new optimization technique consistently surpasses methods in terms of speed of convergence and achievement of end goals.This highlights its effectiveness. \nThe methodology is well explained. The experiments are carried out with proper benchmarks and metrics, in place.The visualization of optimization paths offers understanding of how the optimizer behaves. \nWays to Enhance \nGeneral Understanding Clarity; The paper examines how well the trained optimizer can adapt to objective functions that it hasn't encountered before but could benefit from elaborating more on the boundaries of this adaptability in order to enhance the researchs credibility. For instance it would be valuable to delve into how effective the optimizer's when faced with vastly distinct types of problems, like objectives that are highly irregular or not smooth. \nThe paper discusses research that was published on Arxiv after submission; however a more thorough comparison to this contemporary work (for example Andrychowicz et al., 2016) would offer further insights, into the originality of the suggested method. \nResearchers could conduct an ablation study to evaluate how elements of the suggested framework, such, as the selection of neural network design or the incorporation of GPS influence the effectiveness of the optimizer. \nScalability is key here—the experiments mainly tackle issues for now. It's important to delve into how well the approach can handle bigger datasets and more complex optimization challenges, for real world use. \nQueries, for the Writers \nHow much does the optimizers response change based on the hyperparameters chosen during training? For example; the amount of trajectories used or their length and the design of the network?\nIs the optimizer that has been trained capable of accommodating constraints or other specific requirements to the problem such as box constraints or sparsity?\nHow does the expense of training and utilizing the acquired optimizer stack up against approaches, for handling extensive issues in computational tasks? \nTo sum up this paper provides an effectively executed addition, to the realm of optimization and meta learning.With some clarifications and extra experiments it could have a long lasting influence.
