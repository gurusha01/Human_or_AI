The authors introduce a reliable method that relies on maximum softmax probabilities to differentiate between accurately classified samples and misclassified or OOD samples. They test this method on tasks in fields, like computer vision, natural language processing ( NLP ) and automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) proving its versatility. In addition to that point raised in the paper is the inclusion of a abnormality module \" using internal network representations to enhance detection accuracy in specific scenarios.The authors also provide tasks along with datasets and assessment criteria (AUROC and AUPR) aiming to support upcoming studies, in this field. \nDecision to approve.\nThe research paper adds an element by setting a solid starting point for identifying errors and out of distribution (OOD) data in AI safetyâ€”a field that hasn't received much attention but is crucially important.The study is well founded in motivation and rigorously scientific while being relevant to fields of study.The incorporation of tasks and measurement standards lays the groundwork for future investigations solidifying this paper as a useful reference, within the academic community. \nReasons, for Support \nThe paper discusses the impact of undetected failures in machine learning models in critical fields such as healthcare, within the larger framework of AI safety concerns. \nA solid starting point is the suggested foundation using softmax probabilities; it may be basic. Proves to be efficient, by delivering impressive AUROC and AUPR results across various datasets and tasks. \nThe research paper carefully assesses the standard and anomaly detection components, across datasets and models to ensure reliability and consistency in its findings. \nThere is still room for enhancement as per the abnormality module findings indicate that surpasses the baseline in instances which urges for more investigation to be done the authors also propose a few potential research paths, like utilizing intra class diversity and detailed detection techniques. \nWays to Enhance Your Work\nThe basic constraints of the model need to be considered further as its use of softmax probabilities may not be universally applicable across architectures and tasks.The authors should explore situations in which the baseline could falter and exhibit less, than performance. \nThe abnormality module holds potential. Doesn't always surpass the baseline consistently in the study findings indicate that a thorough examination of the instances and reasons, for the modules performance exceeding that of the baseline would enhance the papers quality significantly. \nThe study primarily examines datasets and structures but incorporating outcomes from more challenging tasks, like extensive vision or NLP datasets could improve the overall applicability of the conclusions. \nThe appendix presents metrics for assessing confidence models; however their real world applicability remains unexplored, in depth yet would be advantageous to discuss these metrics thoroughly in the main text. \nQueries, for the Writers\nHow well does the basic model fare when tested on structures like transformers or sophisticated vision models such, as ViTs?\nCan we expand the abnormality module to cover tasks outside of the ones already examined like reinforcement learning or generative models? \nHow much does the baselines performance change depending on the threshold chosen for AUROC and AUPR metrics and could using metrics like calibration error offer more insights? \nIn summary this study offers an advancement to the field by tackling a crucial issue using a straightforward and efficient starting point while also setting the stage for upcoming investigations. With some enhancements and explanations it could establish itself as a cornerstone in identifying errors and, out of distribution data. "
