The authors suggest a strategy where the scaling factors, for positive and negative weights ( W_max and 1 * W_max ) are adjustable parameters that allow the model to grasp ternary values and their allocations effectively. TTA accomplishes compression (16 times smaller models) enhancing energy efficiency and enabling usage on devices with limited resources such as smartphones.Its effectiveness has been proven through testing on CIFAR 10. Imagenet datasets where it surpasses full precision models like AlexNet and previous ternary quantization techniques, like TWNe in terms of accuracy.The authors notably showcase that TTA can undergo training from the beginning without relying on trained full precision models. This research adds to the expanding realm of deep learning by tackling the balance, between compressing models and maintaining accuracy. \nVerdict received for approval.\nThe article presents an argument in favor of approval basedon its innovative methodology and solid real world findings that have significant implications for implementing neural networks, in edge devices.These reasons underpin the decision making process. \nThe incorporation of scaling factors for ternary quantization represents a significant advancement that enhances precision and compression simultaneously—an essential breakthrough in making DNN deployment, on limited hardware more feasible and effective. \nThe technique shows performance on CIFAR. 10 And ImageNet when compared to both full precision and previous ternary models, through thorough experimental setups and comparisons. \nPoints, in favor \nThe research paper is well grounded in existing literature. Expands upon previous studies on binary and ternary quantization such as TWN and DoReFa. Net by addressing their shortcomings effectively.The author clearly explains the importance of achieving a balance between compression and accuracy with real world applications like deployment and energy efficiency, in mind. \nThe researchers thoroughly explain their methodology by outlining equations used and the training processes along with hyperparameter selections in detail in the study findings are strong as they consistently show enhancements across various datasets and models like ResNet and AlexNet The assertion of achieving a 16× compression with minimal compromise, to accuracy is well backed by real world data and evidence. \nPractical Application; Starting from scratch to train TTW models eases the process of deployment. Makes it more user friendly, for practitioners. \nWays to Enhance \nThough the paper is generally well written and structured appropriately. There are some areas that could benefit from enhancement.\nThe paper discusses the possibility of processing on specialized hardware but lacks specific data or thorough examination of speed improvements, during inference tasks, including real world performance benchmarks would enhance the credibility of the practical assertions made in the paper. \nExploring the relationship between sparsity and accuracy in the paper is important; however conducting ablation studies on how hyperparameters like the threshold factor t and the need, for trainable scaling coefficients impact the results would offer valuable insights. \nIn contrast to the methods such as TW*N and DoReFa N*t the existing research mainly examines how TT* fares, against modern quantization techniques, which could add value to the papers current context and significance. \nEnhancing the interpretability of results could be achieved by including visualizations such as sparsity patterns and convergence curves in addition, to kernel visualizations that are currently provided. \nDear Authors I have some inquiries, for you.\nHow well does TT using perform on types of structures, like MobileNet and EfficientNet that are made for limited resource settings Can it work effectively beyond ResNet and AlexNet? \nHave you tried running TTW uestions (for example; edge devices or FPGAs)on actual hardware platforms before Are there any improvements, in speed and energy efficiency compared to full precision and binary models that you have observed? \nCould we expand the approach to quantize activations along, with weights well as discuss any hurdles that might arise in doing so? \nFinally wrapping up this paper offers an advancement in the realm of effective deep learning techniques.. The unique strategy it brings to the table along, with its outcomes and real world applications definitely enhance the overall value of the conference material.. Some minor tweaks could potentially amplify its influence further.. "
