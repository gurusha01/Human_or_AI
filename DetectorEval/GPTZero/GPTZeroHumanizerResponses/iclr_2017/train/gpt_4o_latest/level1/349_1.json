The authors suggest two memory network models based on reinforcement learning. BaseRL and impRL. To address QRA challenges that require the agent to make deductions with information and inquire about pertinent details that are missing before responding accurately to difficult questions. Additionally the paper includes a learning model as a comparison standard, for evaluating the performance of the reinforcement learning agents. The researchers test their techniques on four QRAQ dataset categories that vary in complexity based on factors like depth and the number of variables as well as paraphrasing difficulty levels. The findings reveal that although both reinforcement learning agents excel with datasets impRL surpasses baseRL with the more intricate datasets. The study underscores the obstacles faced by reinforcement learning in reasoning assignments and pinpoints opportunities, for enhancing query efficiency and trajectory comprehensiveness. \nOutcome of the judgment favors acceptance. \nThe paper should be accepted because it introduces a problem statement with a well explained approach and comprehensive real world testing results.Its introduction of the QRAQ domain is an addition to the realm of task focused conversational systems as it connects reasoning and interaction in a complex multi turn context.The suggested structures and the thorough assessment of their effectiveness offer learnings for upcoming studies on using reinforcement learning, for reasoning assignments. \nPresenting reasons \nNovelty and Inspiration; The QRAQ realm represents an expansion of current synthetic reasoning challenges such as bAbI by emphasizing the importance of multi turn interactions and reasoning in situations with incomplete information.This is in line, with the overarching objective of creating conversational agents that can adeptly navigate real life uncertainties. \nThe study assesses the suggested structures across datasets with different levels of intricacy by employing a wide range of criteria like precision in answers and accuracy and completeness in trajectories for evaluation purposes.The incorporation of learning benchmarks establishes a distinct maximum performance benchmark for reinforcement learning (RL) shedding light on the hurdles and potential advancements, within the RL domain. \nThe impRL structure shows advancements compared to baseRL when dealing with intricate datasets thanks to its soft attention mechanism, across various memory iterations.This development marks progress in crafting RL agents for tasks involving reasoning. \nWays to Enhance Your Work\nThe problem setup in the QRA domain is well defined; however the papers examples are complex. Could be made more accessible to readers not familiar with the domain, by including additional visual aids or simpler explanations. \nThe paper could delve deeper into examining instances of failures to offer an analysis of RL agents facing challenges, with high depth problems This exploration would shed light on the existing architecture constraints and steer enhancements in future developments. \nThe ability of the suggested structures to adapt to real world data sets that are not artificially generated is uncertain in terms of scalability and performance, on a practical level would enhance the significance of the paper. \nQuery Effectiveness Concerns; Despite discouraging queries, in the document paper; the RL agents encounter challenges regarding the completeness of trajectories. Enhancing performance could be achieved by considering alternative query methods or reward frameworks. \nQueries, for the Writers \nHow does the QRA domain stack up against task oriented dialogue systems, in the world in terms of complexity and practicality and is there a roadmap to expand QRA to include more authentic datasets? \nCould the writers provide details about the difficulties impRL encounters in solving complex problems, with high depth levels and are there particular structural obstacles that could be tackled in upcoming research? \nHow much do the outcomes change based the selected hyperparameters, like the quantity of memory hops or the reward setup used? Could using dynamic memory hops enhance performance more? \nIn summary of the study presented here; it offers an advancement in the realm of conversational AI through the introduction of a fresh domain and the proposal of efficient architectures based on reinforcement learning (RL). Although there are areas that could be enhanced further in this works context; it stands as a catalyst for motivating exploration into reasoning and interaction, within task oriented dialogue systems.
