The method is efficient in terms of computation and does not prolong training time; it can be used with both RNN models and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Results from experiments prove the success of this technique in speech recognition assignments by displaying that pruned models perform better, than models of similar capacity size The writers also delve into real world applications and offer guidance on pruning schedules and sparsity patterns. \nOutcome Determination.
