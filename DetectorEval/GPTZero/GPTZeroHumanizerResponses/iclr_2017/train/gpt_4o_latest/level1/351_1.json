The focus is on predicting ancestry using nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data where there are significantly more input features than samples available, in the dataset which often causes overfitting in conventional models. The main idea presented in the paper is a network for predicting parameters that aims to decrease the amount of parameters by acquiring feature specific embeddings and treating parameter generation as a multi task learning challenge. They showcase the success of their method using the 1000 Genomes dataset by highlighting decreases in model complexity and error rates when compared to traditional techniques, like PCA and standard deep learning models. \nOutcome decided as accepted.\nThe paper merits acceptance for reasons; \nNovelty and Importance; The new Diet Networks suggest a reparametrization method that is well justified for high dimensional scenarios with limited sample sizes. Especially in genomics and precision medicine contexts. This represents an advancement, in the field. \nThe real world testing on the 1000 Genomes dataset shows that the approach is successful, in lowering error rates and model complexity when compared to methods. \nArguments, in favor \nThe authors demonstrate a dedication in their approach by conducting an extensive review of literature and placing their research within the framework of current techniques for analyzing genomic data and predicting network parameters effectively.Particularly convincing is the rationale, behind the desire to minimize model parameters in high dimensional scenarios. \nThe experiments are well planned. Follow a rigorous scientific approach with 5 fold cross validation to guarantee reliability in the results presented alongside relevant benchmarks such as PCA and conventional deep learning models where the suggested technique consistently demonstrates superior performance, over them. \nThe practical effect of applying Diet Networks to predicting ancestry holds significance in the field of precision medicine. Stands out for its capability to adapt to new variables effectively. \nIdeas, for Enhancement\nThe method is quite innovative; however the explanation of the parameter prediction network and how it interacts with the feature embeddings could be clearer for readers who're not familiar, with the concept.There should be a simplified diagram or pseudocode included to aid in understanding. \nFeature Embedding Analysis in the paper evaluates feature embedding methods such as random projections and histograms among others; however the reasons, behind their varying effectiveness are not thoroughly examined in depth within the papers content. A comprehensive conversation elucidating why some embeddings exhibit superior performance could enhance the quality of the paper. \nScalability is an aspect to consider here as the approach aims to decrease the parameter count; however there is a lack of discussion regarding the computational workload associated with training both the main network and the parameter prediction network concurrently without any insight, on training duration or resource needs provided for practical application purposes. \nInquiries, for the Writers\nWhat effect does selecting an embedding dimension (like N_feat = 500 ) have on balancing model effectiveness and computational speed ? Is there potential for improvement, in this aspect? \nThe document talks about applying learning to characteristics even without specific data labels mentioned in it Can you elaborate more on this or show some tests proving this ability? \nHow well does the approach handle datasets or more complex SNP data sets in terms of memory or computational resources limitations? \nThe paper significantly contributes to the realm of learning for genomic data and seems fitting for acceptance at the conference.The suggestions, for improvement could strengthen its influence and lucidity further.
