The writers suggest an optimization strategy, for balancing data compression and quality by employing stochastic gradient descent while addressing issues related to quantization non differentiability through a continuous relaxation method. The approach shows rate distortion performance when contrasted with regular JPEG and JPEG 2000 methods and brings about noteworthy enhancements in visual clarity across all data rates as confirmed by MS‑SSIM assessments.The study further links the suggested framework to autoencoders and underscores its particular emphasis on compression, in discrete domains. \nVerdict reached as approved.\nThe research paper is thoughtfully done with a scientific approach and offers valuable insights into the realm of image compression technology.The main factors that lead to its approval include; \nThe utilization of GDN nonlinearities and end to end optimization for image compression showcases innovation and substantial enhancements compared to used techniques such as JPEG and JPEG 2000 reflecting novelty and impact, in the field. \nThe research is comprehensive in its methodology and findings; it includes assessments using datasets and metrics such, as MSE (Mean Squared Error) MS‐SSIM (Multi Scale Structural Similarity) PSNR (Peak Signal to​‐Noise Ratio) and bit rates to support the conclusions effectively. \nReasons, in favor\nThe paper focuses on the issue of loss in image compression. Highlights the challenges faced by conventional methods such as JPEG and JPEG 2000 when operating at lower bit rates due to noticeable artifacts present in the images processed through them.The incorporation of inspired nonlinearities and end, to end optimization methods is well supported by existing research literature and is presented in a convincing manner. \nThe authors demonstrate a level of scientific rigor by presenting a thorough mathematical explanation of their approach which includes an in depth analysis of the relaxed optimization framework and its connection to variational autoencoders. The experimental findings are strong. Include direct comparisons with standard methods as well, as illustrative instances that showcase the visual benefits of the new technique. \nSignificance wise;The techniques capacity to strike a balance between rate and distortion effectively while producing appealing outcomes suggests its potential, as a viable option compared to current norms.The practical viability it displays with the use of an entropy code also bolsters its influence. \nWays to make things better\nThe paper should provide a look, into the computational expenses when compared to JPEG and JPEG 2000 to enhance the practical relevance of the method while acknowledging the efficiency of encoding and decoding mentioned earlier. \nThe authors mention that GDN nonlinearities are more effective than activation functions but they propose that comparable outcomes could be reached with other types of nonlinearities as well It would be beneficial to conduct a more in depth investigation or removal study on this topic to ascertain the importance of GDN, in the performance improvements observed. \n1 extensive comparisons could be made by also considering newer neural compression techniques, such, as those introduced by Toderici et al in 2016 to offer a thorough assessment of the benefits of the suggested approach. \nQueries, for the Writers \nHow does the speed of the suggested approach (, during both training and real time use) stack up against JPEG and JPEG 2000 in real world scenarios? \nCan this technique also be applied to compressing videos. If so what difficulties could potentially come up? \nIs the performance greatly affected by the training dataset selection and would using domain datasets, like medical images lead to notable changes, in the outcomes after retraining? \nIn terms this document makes a significant addition to the area of image compression and is suggested for approval, with minor revisions and enhancements.
