The writers suggest the SemiSupervised Skill Generalization ( S ³ G ) method as a solution that combines insights, from both \" labeled \" (where rewards are known ) and \" unlabeled \" (where rewards are unknown ) environments. By using methods to inverse reinforcement learning (IR) SSG infers reward functions in unlabeled settings based on past encounters so that the agent can develop a broader policy for learning purposes.Through experiments on continuous control assignments the study showcases the effectiveness of SSG and its enhanced adaptability over conventional RL and supervised reward estimation techniques.This research marks a progression towards practical lifelong learning systems that enable agents independent enhancement, in unorganized settings. \nThe decision has been approved.\nThe study presents an argument for SSRL as an essential advancement of RL in practical scenarios.The new S3G algorithm is well founded and innovative with empirical evidence backing its arguments.The study fills a void in RL research by merging supervised learning concepts with policy generalization.Its comprehensive experimental assessment showcases the methods effectiveness, on tasks. \nArguments, in favor \nThe paper addresses an significant issue concerning how to help RL agents generalize in situations where only partial reward functions are accessible—a key challenge faced by current RL techniques particularly in practical settings such, as robotics and dialog systems.The authors convincingly highlight the importance of SSRL by comparing it to supervised learning and lifelong learning practices. \nThe new S3G algorithm is original and based on existing methods such as IRL and guided policy search utilizing agent generated rollouts from labeled environments as pseudo demonstrations for reward inference which is an self sufficient strategy The iterative framework, for optimizing rewards and policies is carefully crafted and supported by theory. \nThe experiments in the study are strong and thorough as they encompass a range of tasks with different levels of difficulty.The findings effectively demonstrate that SSG performs better than methods like regular RL and supervised reward regression when it comes to adapting to new situations that were not previously encountered.The research also offers insights by discussing topics such as the importance of shaping rewards and the influence of experiences, without labels. \nRecommendations, for Enhancement \nThe paper is well written overall; however certain parts such as the details (like reward update and policy update) could be clearer with more explanations or visuals, like flowcharts included to help readers understand better and reach a wider audience by simplifying the mathematical notation in those sections. \nThe paper could benefit from a thorough comparison, between SSRL and transfer learning to enhance the clarity and depth of the works positioning. \nScalability and Real Life Viability. Although the writers talk about uses in real world settings they only tested the idea in simulated scenarios. It would be helpful if they also explored the demands and practical obstacles of implementing SSG in actual systems, like robots. \nExploring further through ablation studies could provide clarity on the distinct impacts of various elements, within the SSG algorithm like the significance of entropy regularization or the selection of policy optimization methods. \nQueries, for the Writers\nHow does the S4F algorithm react based o the amount and quality of labeled data available for its use ? For instance what changes, in performance can we expect if there is a scarcity of labeled MDP data or if it contains a lot of inaccuracies or errors? \nCan the suggested framework manage situations where there are shifts in domains, between labeled and unlabeled MDP instances? If not capable of doing currently; what modifications can be made to cater to such circumstances effectively? \nHave you thought about ways of estimating rewards in situations, without labels like using generative models or self supervised learning techniques instead of the IRL inspired method used in SSG? \nIn summary \nThis research paper greatly enhances the realm of reinforcement learning by presenting and verifying an approach for semi supervised reinforcement learning.Its S3G algorithm is well founded and thoroughly assessed with prospects for practical use.Although there are areas that could be refined in terms of delivery and further examination the paper meets the criteria for approval. Is expectedto inspire more exploration, in this key field. "
