However the outcomes, from their experiments do not align with this anticipation.   \nEven though Hyperband is meant to be an algorithm that can run at any time as needed by the users preferences and constraints of time and resources for training models or processing data sets efficiently and effectively; the researchers decided to run it for a much shorter period compared to CVST experiments resulting in consistently lower average outcomes across their trials when compared against those achieved with more prolonged runs on similar tasks. The difference in performance may seem marginal at glance; however it raises concerns about the absence of detailed information about specific features or characteristics used in their analysis which could have influenced these results significantly enough to warrant further investigation into whether using random settings might produce similar outcomes without additional overhead costs associated with fine tuning different parameters manually. Given these observations made by researchers regarding runtime disparities between both methods tested here (Hyperband and CVST) it would be interesting to see if adjusting Hyperbands runtime duration to match that of CVST could lead to a comparison, between the two approaches.   \nIn addition to that experiments details mentioned by the researchers varied the parameter \\(\\eta\\) for Hyperband compared to the rest of the experiments conducted earlier on in the study raises a crucial point to consider. How crucial is tuning in ensuring Hyperbands effectiveness and what outcome would have transpired if they had employed the same parameter \\(\\eta\\) value of 4 as, in all other experiments?   \nThis paper discusses Hyperband as an extension of the concept of halving introduced by Jamieson & Talwalkar at AISTATS 2016 conference presentation event in San Diego California held from January 7 to 9 that year where they presented their work on developing an algorithm to efficiently evaluate multiple configurations and gradually eliminate underperforming options while still ensuring thorough exploration, within a limited resource allocation.   \nUpon reviewing the paper and reflecting on it now during the Q&A session I find myself a bit puzzled about the main goal of this research work.It seems that the primary advantage of Hyperband compared to halving is in its theoretical worst case scenarios (not exceeding 5 times worse, than random search).However  achieving this limit is simple by dedicating twenty percent of the time to executing setups to the end and the theoretical examination that defines this limit is noted to be, outside the range of this document. This makes me question whether the theoretical findings are the aspect of this piece of work or if they are explained in a different article with the current submission mainly focusing as an empirical exploration of the technique. \"I'm looking forward to the authors addressing this in an updated version of their paper.\"  \nWhen it comes to the experiments discussed in the paper about Hyperband and halving with a bracket setting of \\( b = 4 \\) it's evident that throughout all the figures presented in the research paper \\( b = 4 \\) performs just as well as or even better, than Hyperband in some cases. This indicates that in real world scenarios I would lean towards choosing halving with \\( b = 4 \\) over Hyperband.. If I want Hyperband to ensure that it's no more than 5 times worse than random search, in terms of performance outcomes I could just dedicate twenty percent of my resources to random search.  \nThe experiments also involve comparing some optimization techniques but do not include comparisons with the most relevant Multi task Bayesian Optimization methods that have been quite successful in deep learning recently. For example,\"Multi task Bayesian Optimization\" by Swersky,Snoek and Adams (2013) showcased a 5fold acceleration, in deep learning through the use of smaller datasets and subsequent studies indicated even more significant accelerations.   \nIn light of the study on multitask Bayesian optimization mentioned earlier in this discussion I feel that the description of Hyperband in the introduction as a revolutionary method for optimizing hyperparameters is somewhat misleading. I would rather see a perspective that recognizes the increasing significance of \"configuration evaluation\" in hyperparameter optimization within Bayesian optimization as well since it has already demonstrated significant enhancements, in speed (as proven by previous research).The research paper could frame its significance by offering theoretical perspectives on assessing configurations and demonstrating their relevance even in basic scenarios like random exploration strategies adjustment by including an additional section, in the introductory portion.   \nIn conclusion about originality concerns it is important for the writers to recognize that the concept of distribution of resources for assessments has been a topic of exploration in the field of machine learning for over two decades now. As an instance the research paper by Maron & Moore presented at NIPS 1993 titled \" Hoeffding Races ; Speed up Model Selection Exploration, for Categorization and Function Estimation\" delved into notions."
