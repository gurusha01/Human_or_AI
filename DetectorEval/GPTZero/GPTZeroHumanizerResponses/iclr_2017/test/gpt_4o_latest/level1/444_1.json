By breaking down the output of the LSTM into elements and assigning importance scores to individual words while extracting key phrases; the authors establish a method to validate these patterns by creating a basic rule based classifier that mimics the LSTMs forecasts accurately.This strategy is employed in tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering to showcase its effectiveness, in LSTM functionality. The article suggests that the new additive cell decomposition approach offers visuals and better predictive performance than previous methods did before it was introduced.The writers also emphasize the understandability of the patterns they isolated that bring insights into how LSTMs make decisions. \nOutcome to be approved.\nThe research paper adds insights to the realm of understandable AI by tackling the lack of transparency in LSTMs. A commonly employed framework in language analysis tasks.The suggested approach is logically. Thoroughly assessed with noticeable enhancements both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to current methods.The clarity of the identified patterns and their verification, via a rule based classifier stand out as contributions. \nDetails to back up the point\nThe paper addresses the issue of interpretability in LSTMs which is crucial for scientific comprehension and real world use cases as well The emphasis on identifying relevant patterns resonates with the increasing need, for transparent AI systems. \nIn this research work on the cell decomposition method introduces a new aspect by expanding on previous studies and overcoming their drawbacks adequately in a well rounded manner with both mathematical explanations and practical testing that showcase the effectiveness of the newly suggested technique compared to older methods such, as importance scores based on gradients. \nIn testing their approach across tasks like sentiment analysis and question answering with different datasets the authors demonstrate that the identified patterns are clear and predictive. By using a rule based classifier that performs well they confirm the effectiveness of these patterns, in emulating LSTM behavior. \n\nThe mathematical derivations are clear overall. Could use more explanations or examples in certain sections, like Equations 8 12 to help a wider audience understand them better. \nThe paper mainly contrasts its approach with gradient based methods and cell difference techniques. Suggests that including other baselines, like attention based interpretability methods could enhance the assessment. \nError Analysis; The exploration of errors in approximations made by the LSTM and the rule based classifier is thought provoking but could benefit from elaboration. For example a more in depth examination of instances where failures occur and suggestions for solutions could offer valuable insights, for future research. \nScalability is a factor to consider when it comes to extracting phrases, from larger datasets; however this aspect is not thoroughly covered in the discussion of the method.This information would greatly improve the methods usefulness. \nQueries, for the Writers\nHow well can the suggested approach handle tasks that involve larger datasets or longer sequences and are there any limitations, in computational efficiency when extracting phrases? \nCould the patterns identified be utilized to enhance the training of LSTMs. By integrating them as prior knowledge or limitations? \nHow much does the method depend on selecting the hyperparameters like the threshold \\( c \\) which is used to select candidate phrases? \nIn summary the paper presents a motivated and thoroughly assessed addition, to the realm of explainable AI especially concerning LSTMs. By enhancing clarity and including comparisons the study could have a substantial influence.
