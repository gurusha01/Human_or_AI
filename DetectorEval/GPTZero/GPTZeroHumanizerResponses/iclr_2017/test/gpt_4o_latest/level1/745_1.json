Contributions\"\nThis article presents SYMSGDG. A parallel stochastic gradient descent (SGP) method that maintains the traditional SGDs sequential meaning on average. Unlike parallelization methods like HOGWILD!. Allreduce that can sacrifice sequential meaning and lead to slower convergence or decreased accuracy SYMSGDG guarantees that the overall model aligns, with the results of sequential SGD. The main breakthrough is in utilizing combiners that take advantage of reducing dimensions (using the Johnson Lindenstrauss lemma) making it possible to handle complex datasets efficiently. The research showcases the scalability and precision of SYMSGD on nine datasets by speeding up performance by up to 13 times on 16 cores without compromising the accuracy achieved with sequential SGD. Moreover the method is consistent and straightforward which simplifies the process of debugging and enhancing optimization. The authors back their findings with, in depth analysis, detailed algorithm explanations and thorough practical assessments. \nOutcome of the decision is approval.\nThe study greatly adds to the realm of parallel machine learning by tackling a drawback of current parallel SGD techniques. The proposed method is backed by reasoning and has been validated both theoretically and empirically. SYMSGGs mix of scalability accuracy and predictability represents a step forward, in parallel SGD studies. \n\"I will present some reasons to back up my points.\"\nThe paper addresses a defined and significant issue. How to parallelize SGD while maintaining its sequential semantics intact.The authors effectively outline the drawbacks of approaches, such as HOGWILD!s dependence on sparsity and ALLREDUCEs trade offs in accuracy and position their research as a remedy, to these challenges. \n   \nThe authors have rigorously developed statistically sound combiners using mathematical methods while also innovatively addressing scalability issues through dimensionality reduction and providing thorough analysis of variance control and design trade offs. \nThe experimental findings are thorough and inclusive as they encompass both datasets with varying densities. Sparse and dense alike. SYMSGD consistently demonstrates scalability enhancements (with a speedup of up to 13 times) while also maintaining accuracy levels comparable to those achieved by sequential SGD method. In comparison to HOGWILD! and ALLREDUCE in metrics SYMSGD outperforms them. The assessment methodology is reliable and rigorous due to hyperparameter adjustments and comparisons, with optimized benchmark models. \nThe algorithms usefulness in shared memory systems and its predictability make it very practical for real world machine learning projects while diving into implementation specifics, like SIMD optimizations adds to its usefulness. \nHere are some ideas, on how to make things better.\nThe article mentions that SYMSGD encounters a period of inconsistency in accuracy in the stages of the process also known as \"stutterinng\". The authors propose some solutions like combining models frequently but it would be beneficial to have a detailed analysis of these approaches to assist those, in the field. \n# Widespread Applicability; At the moment SYMSGD is limited to calculations involving SGD that have dependencies between steps in the process. The writers touch upon the potential of broadening this method to encompass dependencies by making use of approximations, like Taylor expansions. Delving deeper into this concept could greatly enhance the significance of the paper. \nWhen looking at shared memory systems in the paper mentioned earlier about SYMSGG methods scalability aspects would be clearer with a comparison to distributed SGD strategies such, as parameter servers. \nThe research paper discusses the impact of dimensionality reduction, on variance but does not investigate how this variance influences convergence rates in different datasets empirically a thorough analysis of which would strengthen the methodology. \nDear Authors I have some queries for you.\nWhat impact does the selection of projection size (denoted as k ) during the process of reducing dimensions have on balancing resources and precision levels ? Are there any guidelines or strategies to determine the value, for k based on the features of the dataset ?\nHave you investigated how SYMSGG affects areas than regression and classification tasks, like reinforcement learning or deep learning that also heavily utilize SGD? \nCould we modify the combiner method that relies on probability to work well in a parallel setup to enhance scalability even more? \nThis paper concludes that it provides theoretical and practical value to the study of parallel SGD research and could potentially become a cornerstone work, in the field with some refinements and expansions.
