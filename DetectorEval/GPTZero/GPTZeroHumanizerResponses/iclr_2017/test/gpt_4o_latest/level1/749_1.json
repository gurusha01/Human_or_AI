The researchers have outlined 14 design patterns meant to assist both beginners and seasoned professionals in creating CNN models for tasks such, as image classification. Moreover this study presents three architectures—Fractal of FractalNet (FoFN) Stagewise Boost Networks (SBNs) and Taylor Series Networks (TSNs)—developed based on these identified patterns. The researchers present findings from tests conducted on CIFAR datasets 10 and 100 to support their architectural advancements and show they can lead to quicker training and accuracy levels similar to standard models such, as FractalNet.The study also includes accessible code to improve its reproducibility and ease of access. \nConclusion reached. Decline.\nThe article introduces an imaginative method for CNN design; however it lacks strong empirical proof to support its arguments fully. Although the initial experimental findings show potential they need thorough comparisons with top tier models. Moreover the theoretical basis for design patterns and structures is not fully explored, leaving significant doubts, about their broader applicability unanswered. \nReasons to back up the decision.\nInsufficient Practical Testing; The study mainly examines the CIFAR datasets like CIFAR. 10 And CIFAR. 100 That're modest in scale for comparison purposes The absence of testing on larger datasets such as ImageNet restricts the applicability of the suggested models and structures Moreover there is a lack of detailed comparison with other advanced architectures, like DenseNet or EfficientNet which could provide a better perspective of how well the proposed methods perform\nTheoretical Gaps; Though the design patterns draw inspiration from software engineering principles in deep learning context is not extensively investigated theoretically yet.For instance the reasoning behind patterns, like \"Freeze Drop Path\" and \"Taylor Series Networks\" lacks convincing justification and their practical benefits are still uncertain. \nThe authors recognize that their findings are still in the stages and require additional investigation to thoroughly assess the suggested structures indicating that the paper is not yet prepared for publication, in its present state. \nWays to Enhance \nTo further validate our experiments thoroughly assess the suggested designs using varied datasets, like ImageNet to showcase their scalability and versatility effectively. Additionally compare these with cutting edge models to present a comprehensive view of the real world advantages of the proposed techniques. \nEnhance Theoretical Rationale; Offer an in depth theoretical examination of the suggested design principles with a focus, on how they influence model performance and training processes. Consider conducting ablation studies to separate the impacts of patterns utilized. \nThe usefulness of these design patterns for beginners, in the field may not be clearly shown despite their nature; it would be beneficial to incorporate case studies or real world examples to illustrate how these patterns can be put into practice to solve actual problems. \nImprove Clarity of Presentation; The document can be challenging to navigate in sections due to its density. Enhancing the explanations of the design patterns and incorporating visual elements, such, as architecture diagrams could enhance the readability of the content. \nQueries, for the Writers \nHow do the new designs stack up against the models, like DenseNet and EfficientNet in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency? \nCan the principles of design be used in kinds of neural networks, like recurrent or transformer based structures and if yes then how would they be implemented? \nWhat were some of the obstacles or restrictions you faced while putting the suggested structures into practice and how could these issues be dealt with in future projects? \nOverall the paper presents concepts and could spark further studies; however it needs additional thorough experimental and theoretical verification to align with the conferences criteria.
