The authors suggest a three step iterative method—weight division into groups quantization, by grouping and re training—that gradually quantizes weights while maintaining or enhancing model accuracy. Numerous tests on ImageNet with models like AlexNet and VGG16 show that INQuant achieves quantization at 5 bit precision and remains competitive even at 4 bit and lower precision levels like 3 bit and 2 bit. Moreover the study emphasizes the benefits of INQuant for speeding up hardware performance compared to quantization and compression techniques such, as deep compression and vector quantization. \nChoice made to approve. \nThe paper should be accepted as it offers a thought out strategy backed by thorough testing and important advancements in the low precision neural networks field. \nINQUIA presents a step by step approach that tackles important concerns in network compression like loss of accuracy and difficulties in convergence which makes it ideal for implementing deep convolutional neural networks on devices, with limited resources. \nThe empirical evidence is robust. Covers a wide range of scenarios showing better or similar precision, in various structures and data sizes compared to the best existing techniques. \nReasons, in favor\nA thoughtful strategy is presented in the paper that tackles two issues in CNN quantization. The decline in accuracy and the need for more training iterations. By introducing a progressive framework that builds upon existing pruning and quantization methods, in a fresh and significant manner. \nThe study exhibits scientific rigor by conducting comprehensive experiments across various architectures and bit width variations in a thorough manner. Furthermore the methods robustness is confirmed through the comparison of weight partitioning techniques inspired by pruning with partitioning. Moreover the paper delves into the balance between bit width and accuracy, in a detailed manner. \nThe methods capability to achieve quantization and its adaptability with hardware acceleration (such as substituting floating point multiplications, with bit shift operations) significantly contributes to enhancing efficient deep learning practices. \nWays to make things better\nAlthough the paper is generally well written and informative here are some suggestions to enhance its clarity and effectiveness; \nEnsuring clear Mathematical Notation is important; for instance equations like the one outlining the weight quantization process (like Equation 4) might be easier to understand with explanations or examples for readers who are not familiar, with the notation. \nHardware Implementation Specifics; Although the document discusses the possibility of utilizing hardware acceleration methods it would be helpful to incorporate findings or dialogues regarding practical hardware executions such, as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\nThe paper examines the effects of pruning techniques and random partitioning strategies but conducting additional tests to understand how hyperparameters such, as the number of iterative steps or re training epochs impact the results would enhance the empirical analysis further. \nThe paper could explore how INQuant method compares to recent quantization techniques to better position it within the current research context. \nInquiries, for the Writers\nHow well does INQuant perform in tasks than image classification like object detection or semantic segmentation and would the suggested approach work well, in these scenarios too? \nCould the writers offer information regarding the computational costs associated with the iterative quantization procedure they used in their study? For instance how does the time required for training using this method compare to that of quantization techniques? \nHave the authors delved deeper into combining INQuantum with precise activations and gradients, in their research work ? If they have done so what impact does this have on performance and hardware efficiency ?\nIn summary this study offers an addition to the realm of effective deep learning and stands out as a promising contender for approval.. The new INQu method is fresh thoroughly tested, and holds promise, for influencing a range of research and real world uses.."
