How infants learn associations.The authors present an Expectation Maximization training method where the networks output is compared to a distribution to enable learning without the need, for labeled data. \nMain Factors \n\"I have chosen to approve this paper for two reasons;\"\nThe article addresses an engaging issue; understanding the connection, between two sets of data without any predetermined labels. \nThe method is convincingly justified by the authors. They offer a straightforward description of how the EM training principle is used in tackling the task of classless association. \nArguments, in Favor \nThe paper thoroughly explains how the model is structured and trained while also assessing its performance on four datasets derived from MNIST to showcase its ability to understand the correlation, between input data samples effectively. \nMore. Recommendations, for Improvement \nTo enhance the paper more \nWhen delving into the hyperparameter tuning process further is important since the selection of hyperparameters greatly influences how well the model performs. \nIn the conclusion section of the paper mentioning the use of the model in diverse scenarios, like multimodal datasets was highlighted for further exploration. \nStudying how the models performance is influenced by employing statistical distributions beyond just the uniform distribution. \nQueries, for the Writers \nTo better grasp the contents of the document at hands intricacies and details clearly in my mind while making sure I have a complete understanding of it all top to bottom and front to backside through and through without missing any critical points or nuances along the way as I dive deep into this sea of knowledge and wisdom that lies within these written words, on this page before me now I kindly request the authors to kindly provide their responses to the following inquiries that I have prepared for them with much thought and consideration.\nCould you offer explanation on why the power function is chosen in the E step of the EM training rule? \nHow do you intend to expand the model to deal with situations where the quantity of categoriess uncertain or the distribution of data is not consistent? \nHave you thought about trying out structures, like convolutional neural networks instead of MLPs and how do you think this change could impact the models effectiveness?
