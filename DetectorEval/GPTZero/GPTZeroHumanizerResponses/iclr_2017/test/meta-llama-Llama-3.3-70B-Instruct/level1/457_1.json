            "inputText": "This article introduces an approach known as Incremental Network Quantization (INQ) which effectively transforms a pre trained high resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low resolution version without losing any important details or accuracy. The researchers argue that their technique can achieve low resolution quantization without sacrificing accuracy levels—a notable advancement compared to current methods that frequently result in visible reductions, in accuracy. \nThe article delves into the challenge of transforming a pre trained high resolution CNN model into a lower resolution version without compromising accuracy efficiently.It's a thought out strategy as it deals with a significant problem in the realm of deep learning. The demand to utilize CNN models on devices with restricted computing capabilities and storage space.The authors conduct an analysis of current techniques and point out their shortcomings making a case, for the necessity of a fresh perspective. \nThe research paper backs up its arguments with experiments conducted on the ImageNet large scale classification task utilizing different deep CNN models like AlexNet,VGG16, GoogleNet and ResNet architectures.The findings indicate that the suggested INQUIZ method is capable of attaining accuracy in comparison, to the standard full precision models even when using low precision weights like 5 bit 4 bit 3 bit and 2 bit ternary weights. The writers also show that their approach can be used alongside network trimming to achieve compression rates without compromising accuracy. \nAfter reviewing the findings and conducting a comprehensive assessment of the papers content and quality I have chosen to approve it for publication based primarily on the following key factors; \nThe article addresses an issue, in the field of deep learning and offers a fresh approach to overcome the drawbacks of current techniques. \nThe method is well. The authors offer a comprehensive evaluation of current techniques and their constraints. \nThe study includes a range of test outcomes that back up the assertions put forth by the writers and showcase how well the INI technique works as suggested. \nIn order to enhance the paper further \nFurther examination of the challenges and memory demands of the suggested INQuantization (INP) strategy is crucial for implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on devices, with constrained resources. \nLets delve deeper into comparing this method with cutting edge techniques and explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in more detail. \nA study on how the INq method can be used for computer vision tasks, like detecting objects and segmenting images. \nI have some queries that I hope the authors can address to help me better grasp the content of the paper; \nCould the writers offer explanation on why they chose the variable length encoding method and its impact, on the effectiveness of the INO technique? \nHow does the INQuiry method address situations where the pre trained high quality CNN model contains parameters and how does this impact the methods computational workload and memory needs? \nAre there any intentions to broaden the INW approach to include varieties of neural networks, like recurrent neural networks (RNNS) and long short term memory (LTSM)?"
