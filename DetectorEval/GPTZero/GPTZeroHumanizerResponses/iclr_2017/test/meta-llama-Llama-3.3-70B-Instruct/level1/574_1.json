            "inputText": "Synopsis \nThe research paper suggests a visual search platform to locate images of products similar to a fashion item provided by the users input.The platform outlines than 90 attributes related to fashion and employs these attributes in various combinations to portray numerous distinct styles, in fashion.The authors present a neural network (RNN) for identifying multiple fashion attributes seamlessly and implement an inverted indexing structure to expand the systems scalability. The study also captures the color and visual aspects of an area of a fashion piece to assess its similarity in appearance. \nChoice\nAfter consideration and evaluation of the paper presented to me for review I have chosen to approve it based on two significant factors; ( ) The proposed approach is clearly grounded in existing literature. Demonstrates strong motivation. ( ) The paper effectively substantiates its arguments with empirical evidence. \nPoints, in favor \nThe study focuses on an issue of determining likeness between various fashion itemsâ€”a complex task indeed! The writers offer a rationale for their methodology by highlighting the drawbacks of current techniques and emphasizing the necessity for a tailored model that mirrors how humans perceive similarities in fashion products. The paper is aptly positioned within the realm of research literature by referencing studies in computer vision technology along, with language modeling and multi label classification approaches. The practical outcomes show the success of the suggested system by achieving results on tests, like Holidays and UK Best Practices. \nAdditional Input Needed \nTo enhance the papers quality and depth further suggests the authors offer insights into the methodology of collecting the dataset by explaining how they defined and annotated fashion attributes accurately. Moreover the authors could explore uses of their system beyond just e commerce applications like fashion recommendation or style transformation. It would also be beneficial to incorporate visual demonstrations of the systems results by presenting retrieved images, for various inquiries. \nQueries, for the Writers\nTo ensure I grasp the paper correctly I kindly request the authors to address these inquiries; \nHow did you make sure that the fashion attribute annotations in the dataset were accurate and reliable, across the board? \nCould you give me information, about the ResCeption network structure and how it varies from the original inception vâ€‹. Architecture? \nHow do you intend to manage fashion attributes or new styles that are not part of the training data vocabulary?
