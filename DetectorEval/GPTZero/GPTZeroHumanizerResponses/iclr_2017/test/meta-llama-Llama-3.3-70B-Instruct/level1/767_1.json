            "inputText": "Summary of the contributions made in the paper.\nThe article suggests a method for teaching machine learning algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This involves using actor critic techniques from reinforcement learning (RL). They introduce an approach where a policy network (actor) determines the learning rate during training and a value network (critic) evaluates the decisions effectiveness, at each stage. The studies show that the new approach helps SGD converge effectively and reduces overfitting to some degree while outperforminig competitors designed by humans to an extent. \nThe primary factors influencing them.\nAfter reviewing the paper I have chosen to accept it for two main reasons; \nThe method is clearly backed by reasoning and is situated within the existing body of knowledge by tackling a crucial issue, in machine learning. The impact of learning rates on the sensitivity of SGD. \nThe research paper presents real world data and theoretical support for the algorithms effectiveness through different experiments and comparisons, with other cutting edge techniques. \nHere are the reasons to back up my points.\nThe article offers an brief overview of the issue by discussing the significance of learning rates, in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the drawbacks of current methods.The authors also conduct an examination of previous research findings while emphasizing the unique aspects of their method.The suggested algorithm is thoughtfully. The experiments are meticulously carried out to showcase its efficacy.The outcomes indicate that this new approach can outperform competitors designed by humans and mitigate overfitting to some degree. \nMore. Queries regarding the topic.  \nTo enhance the paper more thoroughly I propose that the authors take into account the following suggestions; \nCould you please share information regarding how the actor and critic networks were put into action? Specifically mentioning the design and settings, like the structure of the networks and the parameters utilized would be helpful. \nLets talk about the limitations that could arise from the suggested method and how it could be expanded to incorporate different optimization algorithms. \nIt might be helpful to include experiments to showcase how well the proposed approach can handle various datasets and models. \nI have a queries, for the authors that I hope they can address to help me better grasp the content of the paper; \nHow did the writers decide on the design and settings, for the actor and critic networks? \nIs it possible to apply the method to other optimization algorithms, like Adam or RMSprop? \nHow will the suggested approach manage situations where the rate of learning must be quickly adapted to changes, in online learning settings?
