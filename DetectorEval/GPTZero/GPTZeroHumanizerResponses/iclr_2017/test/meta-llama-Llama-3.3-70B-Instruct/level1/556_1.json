Researchers carry out tests on three different neural network designs to assess the efficiency of five commonly used gradient descent optimization strategies as well as a novel approach utilizing Runge Kutta integrators. The findings offer perspectives on the variations in local minima discovered by diverse optimization algorithms and shed light on the influences of batch normalization along with their repercussions, on generalization errors. \n\nThe research paper is well thought out. The method fits nicely within the existing literature context.The authors have carefully examined the loss surfaces. How various optimization techniques perform which helps us understand the shape of loss functions and how optimization algorithms behave. \nReasons, in Favor\nThe paper addresses an clearly defined research query. Exploring the structure of loss functions in deep neural networks and how various optimization techniques interplay, with these functions. \nThe authors thoroughly analyze the loss surfaces and performance of optimization methods to gain insights, into the types of local minima detected by different algorithms and the impact of batch normalization. \nThe paper shows a motivation and the approach fits well within the existing literature context.The authors give a review of previous work and exhibit a solid grasp of the core ideas. \nExtra Input; Comments. \nTo enhance the paper more so. The authors might want to ponder over these ideas; \nThe article gives a summary of previous studies; however it would be beneficial to include further details, on why the research question is important and what the findings could mean in practice. \nThe paper would be improved by providing a detailed explanation of the methods used to examine the loss surfaces and the effectiveness of various optimization techniques. \nThe authors should address any drawbacks by talking about the constraints of their method and the potential prejudices, in their outcomes to offer a detailed insight into the discoveries. \nQueries, for the Writers \nCould you please elaborate further on how the Runge Kutta integrator was put into action along with the optimization techniques, in practice? \nHow did you decide on the neural network designs and data sets, for the tests? \nWhat do the results mean for reducing mistakes. How can the research be used in real world situations? "
