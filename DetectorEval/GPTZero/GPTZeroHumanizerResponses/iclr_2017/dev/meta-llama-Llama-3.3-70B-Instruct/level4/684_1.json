            "inputText": "This study introduces a model driven method for reinforcement learning that forecasts forthcoming rewards by considering the present state and future actions using a \"residual recurrent neural network.\" The method is illustrated through tests, on Atari games where a basic playing approach is applied; assessing move sequences and picking the sequence with the best anticipated reward and minimal risk of failure. One interesting finding is that out of the three games examined in the study there was an improvement in performance when the agent underwent training, in a multitasking environment indicating the potential benefits of transfer learning techniques. \nThe document is quite easy to understand and the suggested reward prediction framework seems to be a unique and well founded idea.However some drawbacks exist that hinder this study from meeting the ICLR criteria as described below. \nThe algorithm explained in Section 3 differs from its application in Section 4 due, to a discrepancy noted between the expected outcome as described and the actual output shown during the experiments. Where it was split into two distinct values representing the likelihood of death and the chance of attaining a higher score without dying over time steps. While this adjustment could potentially lead to outcomes in performance metrics it strays from the original concept outlined in the paper and prompts inquiries into the efficacy of the initial suggestion. \nAdditionally\\* the studys findings are restricted as they only examine three games and do not include comparisons with other approaches in reinforcement learning like the Deep Q Network (DQN). Even though the main aim of the research is not to present cutting edge outcomes due, to the heuristic policy employed\\* the experiments ought to have investigated how the model could improve reinforcement learning methods. At the momentsorry! Sorry for any inconvenience. The model is basically working as a supervised algorithm that is being used with a manually defined policy rather than being part of a reinforcement learning setup like it could be in the future Additional experiments could have been done to check how accurate the predictions are like looking at classification error for death probability or mean squared error, for future rewards compared to simpler methods \nThe section on \" research \" is too brief and mainly focuses on discussing the Deep Q Network (DQN) while failing to offer a thorough analysis of model based reinforcement learning as a whole.\" It is particularly noticeable that there are no references provided for studies like \"Action Based Video Prediction using Deep Networks, in Atari Games \" which really should have been mentioned. \nMinor feedback consists of; \nUsing \"A represents a condition than a task in an unusual way may lead to misunderstandings and depart, from the typical notation used in reinforcement learning. \nUsing a dot for combining tensors may not be the choice since it is usually associated with a dot product, in mathematics. \nIn Section 3 the residual term \\(ri\\) differs from the reward \\(ri\\) mentioned earlier. \nThe description of \\( c_i \\), as \"The control that was carried out at time i \" appears to pertain to the control executed at time \\( i. 0Ne \\).\nIn Section 3 there seems to be a mix up, between \"mean\" and \"median.\"\nIn Observation 1 of the report avoid using the \\( x \\) since the \\( x \\) shown in Figure 3 does not undergo layer normalization. \nObservation 1 inequality should be based on the value of \\(xi\\) instead of just \\(xi\\) alone.\nObservation 1 and its proof take up much space for a result that is quite straightforward. \nIn Section 32 point 9 three oh three comma the \\( r j \\) must be corrected to \\( r i \\).\nThe sudden mention of the likelihood of death in Section 2 is surprising since it hasn't been clearly set up as a result of the model, on. \n\"The assertion that our method cannot benefit from strategies could be misleading—it may be more precise to state that it only learns from effective strategies.\"\nIt might help to explain that \"fc \" as shown in Figure 4 represents \" connected \" and to point out the differences in architecture compared to the traditional DQN architecture by Mnih et al.s study, from 2015. \nThere is a request, for information regarding \\( r_{ j 21} \\) based on the feedback provided in the OpenReview comments. \nTable 3s mention of \"After one iteration\" seems unclear since \"PRL Iteration 2\" is also present.\nIt seems that the assertion made in Figure 5 regarding the absence of decline in performance, in Pong and Demon Attack may not be entirely accurate. \nThe claim that a model trained solely through play can perform at least seven times better lacks a clear rationale, for the factor of seven. \nThe reference to an issue in the storyline of Demon Attack in Figure 5C appears disconnected, from any prior conversation.
