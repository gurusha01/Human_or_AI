The outcomes indicate that individuals can acquire tactics to manage the expenses of acquiring information and errors in diverse scenarios. \nChoice\nAfter considering all aspects of the paper I have decided to approve it for two main reasons;( the paper addresses a well defined and interesting question about acquiring knowledge on the physical attributes of objects through active engagement and the methodology is backed by solid evidence, from experiments and thorough examination. \nReasons, for Support \nThe paper offers an organized introduction to the issue at hand along with its underlying motivation and relevant research background.The authors create two settings where agents must engage with objects to deduce their characteristics and the outcomes demonstrate that agents can develop successful tactics to tackle these challenges.The paper also conducts an examination of the agents’ actions discussing the balance between gathering information and the potential, for errors. The application of reinforcement learning techniques and the creation of specific environments align well with the issue, at hand and the outcomes clearly showcase the effectiveness of this method. \nInput; Further Comments\nTo enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors look into these aspects; (1) Include information about how the environments were implemented and the reinforcement learning algorithm. (2) Examine the drawbacks and obstacles when expanding the method to more intricate environments. (3) Investigate transferring acquired knowledge to tasks or settings as a potential avenue, for exploration. \nQueries, for the Writers.\nTo better grasp the content of the document in question. Gain more clarity from the authors themselves. I am interested in having them address the inquiries; (1.) How does the approach of the agents evolve with heightened problem complexity. How does this impact practical use cases? (2.) Could the authors delve deeper into how the agents make decisions. In terms of managing exploration, versus exploitation? How might these findings be applicable to physical characteristics like friction or flexibility and how could this method be utilized in fields, like robotics or computer vision? "
