The practical outcomes showcase the efficiency of HM on a question answering project on a significant scale; moreover they present an, in depth contrast of various approximate K MIPS methods. \nFurther Input Required; \nTo enhance the paper further suggestions could be made to the authors by adding information about the computational intricacies of the HMNN design and its various elements I also recommend delving deeper into examining the balance between precision and acceleration that can be attained through using approximate K MIPS methods Furthermore it might be worth exploring potential uses of HMNN in different areas, like generating image descriptions or conversational interfaces\nQueries, for the Writers \nCould you please provide insight into the paper by addressing the following questions?\nCould you give me information, about the memory layout and how its structured in a hierarchical manner? \nHow do you decide on the hyperparameters, for the K MIPS methods and how do these hyperparameters impact the performance of HMNs? \nHave you ever thought about incorporating types of attention mechanisms like hard attention or reinforcement learning based attention, alongside HMNs?
