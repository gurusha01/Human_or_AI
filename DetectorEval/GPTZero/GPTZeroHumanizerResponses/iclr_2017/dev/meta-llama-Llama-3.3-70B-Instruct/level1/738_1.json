The paper offers an analysis of the issue at hand, with a straightforward yet efficient proposed solution. \n\"Arguments, in favor\" \nThe paper addresses an issue within the realm of deep learning. Enhancing the energy efficiency and decreasing the memory usage of LSTM based RNN models in a specific manner that fits well with prior research on sparsity focused optimization methods for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The authors conduct an examination of the uneven distribution of gate activations and its impact, on gradients which presents a crucial understanding supporting the solution they propose. The results of the experiment are quite persuasive as they show how well the suggested method works in scenarios and, with different sets of data. \nMore Input Needed \nTo enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors delve deeper into analyzing the trade offs between sparsity and performance and investigate how the proposed technique can be applied to other RNNs and deep learning models.It would also be intriguing to have a conversation about the potential hardware impacts of the proposed technique,such, as designing specialized hardware accelerators to leverage the induced sparsity. \nQuestions to Ask the Writers \nTo ensure I comprehend the paper fully and accurately grasp its content I kindly request the authors to address the inquiries; \nCould you explain further about how selecting a specific threshold value influences the balance, between having data points and achieving better results in practice? \nHow would you suggest incorporating the suggested method into deep learning frameworks and hardware accelerators? \nHave you thought about investigating whether the suggested method could be used with kinds of RNN models, like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) or Bidirectional RNN models?
