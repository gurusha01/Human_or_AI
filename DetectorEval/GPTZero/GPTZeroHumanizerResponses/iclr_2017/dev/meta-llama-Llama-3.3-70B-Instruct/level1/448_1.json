The authors introduce two distinct depth scales. Ξ𝑞 and Ξ𝑐. Which govern the transmission of information relating to the intensity of an input and the relationship between two inputs. They demonstrate that at the threshold between order and chaos in networks Ξ𝑐 shows divergence potentiality that enables the effective training of significantly deep networks, near critical points. The writers also create a field theory to explain the process of backpropagation and show a connection between forwarding signals and reversing gradients in their research work. They confirm their findings through tests, on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets by demonstrating how the depth scale ξc effectively forecasts the adjustable parameters feasible range. \nChoice\n\"I've chosen to approve this paper for a key reasons;\"\nThe article addresses an clearly defined issue, within the realm of neural networks; specifically exploring how untrained networks behave and pinpoint the depth scales that govern information transmission. \nThe method is clearly thought out. Based on the principles of mean field theory that form a strong basis, for the examination. \nThe document offers an detailed explanation of the theoretical findings by outlining the depth scales and creating a mean field theory, for backpropagation. \nArguments, in favor\nThe study offers an organized examination of how untrained neural networks behave.The authors give an brief overview of the issue at hand and then delve into the theoretical findings in detail.The tests conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 offer support, for the accuracy of the theoretical forecasts.They show that the depth scale ξc effectively anticipates the range of hyperparameters. \nMore Feedback, Please. \nTo enhance the paper more. Here are some recommendations, for the authors; \nCan you please explain in detail the significance and interpretation of the depth scales ζ and ζ0 in relation, to the networks behavior?\nLets explore further by analyzing intricate network structures, like convolutional neural networks to showcase the broad applicability of the findings. \nLets delve deeper into how the results could influence the development and education of networks by exploring their practical uses and upcoming advancements. \nQueries, for the Writers\nCan you offer explanation on how the depth scales Ξ_q and Ξ_c are connected and how they influence the networks performance? \nHow can we apply these findings to intricate network structures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?\nWhat impact could the outcomes of this study possibly pose for developing and educating networks and what future research avenues could be explored in this field?
