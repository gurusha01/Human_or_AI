GP enables the creation of distributed representations for texts and SGP incorporates text labels for improved representation learning guidance within the model structure shown by the authors successful application on five standard text classification datasets, with outstanding performance outcomes. \nChoice\nAfter consideration of the papers content and findings I have chosen to approve it for two main reasons; first the paper addresses a crucial issue in natural language processing—specifically the challenge of PV in deducing representations for unfamiliar texts; secondly the models put forward—GPW and SGPW—show exceptional results compared to current standard references, across various test datasets. \nArguments, in favor \nThe document presents a reason for the new models put forward by emphasizing the drawbacks of PV and the advantages of incorporating a full creative process into it. Additionally the authors give an in depth examination of studies placing their models in the landscape of established methods for learning text representations. The results from the experiments are persuasive showing how GPVC and SGPVC perform, across different text classification assignments. \nHere is some extra input, for you.\nTo make the paper even better in my opinion the writers should look into the following aspects; (1). Include a thorough examination of how hyperparameter configurations affect the models performance; (2). Investigate probabilistic distributions for paragraph and word vectors as suggested in the conclusion; and (3). Test their models on NLP tasks, like language modeling or machine translation to showcase their versatility. \nQueries, for the Writers \nIn order for me to grasp the paper better and gain clarity on the matter at hand. I kindly request the authors address the inquiries; (1.) What strategies are the authors considering employing to tackle the overfitting issue in the SGPV model due to its straightforward nature and reliance on a limited number of parameters?  (2.) Could you delve deeper into why the multivariate normal distribution was chosen as the distribution, for paragraph vectors and shed light on how this decision impacts the models overall performance? How do the authors anticipate the implementation of the GP* and SGP* models, in real world situations where there is a scarcity of labeled data ? "
