Predicting answers that vary in length is difficult.The authors suggest an attention mechanism and an integrated deep learning method.This enables the model to create and prioritize answer options dynamically.The outcomes achieved with the dataset are remarkable and the authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how well the model performs.This evaluation includes analyzing errors and conducting tests without components. \nMore Feedback Required\nTo enhance the quality of the paper further I recommend that the authors delve into depth regarding how they implemented the model. Including specifics like hyperparameter configurations and the training process. Additionally it would be beneficial to incorporate visual aids like attention weight plots to offer a clearer insight into how the model functions. Lastly the authors might want to explore testing the model on datasets, like CNN/Daily Mail to showcase its versatility and effectiveness. \nQueries for the writers.\nCould you please share information, about how the attention mechanism is put into practice in terms of selecting hyperparameters and carrying out the training process? \nHow do you intend to tackle the challenge of anticipating responses that typically involve opinions rather, than just factual information? \nHave you thought about testing the model on datasets, like the CNN/Daily Mail dataset to show how well it can adapt to various scenarios?
