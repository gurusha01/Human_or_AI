The researchers utilize a language model. Particularly a long short term memory (LSTM ) network. To grasp the semantic significance and connections, between system calls. To minimize alarms they introduce an ensemble approach that merges various thresholding classifiers. The effectiveness and adaptability of the suggested system are verified on benchmark datasets. \nChoice\n\"I have chosen to approve this paper for two reasons; Firstly because it addresses a crucial issue in computer security and the proposed method is well supported by existing research. Secondly the results, from the experiments clearly show that the method works well and the authors have thoroughly evaluated their system.\" \nArguments, in favor of the point.\nThe article offers an brief overview of the issue of detecting intrusions and the shortcomings of current methods in place to address it.The authors explain their method by emphasizing the significance of capturing the meaning and relationships between system calls.The system call language model they suggest is well crafted and their choice to use LSTM networks is well supported.The approach using a method is creative yet uncomplicated and the authors show its success, in decreasing false alarm occurrences. The extensive findings, from the study are well documented. Include a comprehensive evaluation when compared to current cutting edge techniques. \nAdditional Input Needed \nFor a paper enhancement suggestion would be to include more information about how their system was put into practice by the authors specifically mentioning the hyperparameters employed in the LSTM network and ensemble technique used for guidance. Visual aids showcasing learned representations could be beneficial like demonstrating a 2 dimensional projection of call data utilizing the embedding matrix. Furthermore discussing applications of their method outside of their current domain such as, in network intrusion detection or malware detection could add value to their work. \nInquiries, for the Writers\nCould you please provide some clarification on the paper by answering these questions for me?\nCould you share information, about the particular hyperparameters employed in the LSTM network and the ensemble approach please? \nHow do you intend to expand your strategy to identify intricate attacks, like mimicry attacks? \nWhat are the possible drawbacks of your method, like needing training data or the risk of overfitting?
