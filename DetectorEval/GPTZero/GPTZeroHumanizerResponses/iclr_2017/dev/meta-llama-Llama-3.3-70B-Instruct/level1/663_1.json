Product categorization. And introduces a fresh method to combine written descriptions with visual content, for improved accuracy. \n The authors thoroughly examine the mistakes made by networks and showcase the benefits of incorporating multiple modes of operation. \nPoints, in Favor \nThe research paper is well thought out and the approach fits nicely within the existing literature context.The authors give a summary of the obstacles in product categorization and the drawbacks of current techniques.The innovative decision level fusion strategy presented displays encouraging outcomes.The experiments are well thought out. The findings are carefully scrutinized.In addition, to that the authors delve into an exploration of both the possibilities and constraints of their method. \nMore Input Required \nTo enhance the paper further would be by suggesting the authors delve into greater depth about how they collected the dataset and conducted preprocessing tasks in detail. Moreover a compelling addition would involve studying the categories of products that gain the most advantage from utilizing a multi modal strategy. Additionally the authors might want to expand their work by comparing with cutting edge techniques and exploring potential uses of their approach, in various fields. \nQueries, for the Writers\nCould you share information, about the structure of the policy network and how the training is carried out? \nHow do you intend to tackle the problem of overfitting within the policy network? \nCould you share details on which kinds of products tend to see the greatest advantages, from utilizing a multi modal approach? \nHave you thought about incorporating methods, like audio or video into your strategy? \nHow do you intend to expand your method to cover fields and uses?
