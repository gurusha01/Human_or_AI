            "inputText": "A critique of the paper.\n\nThis article discusses the issue of exploring in reinforcement learning (RL) settings with limited rewards by suggesting a new framework for internal motivation centered around surprise value. In particular the writers present two reward structures. Unexpectedness and k step learning advancement. Which are defined based on the difference in probability distributions, between the actual environment transitions and a modeled dynamics system. The key advancements outlined in this study are; \nThere is proof that these natural incentives facilitate effective exploration in environments with limited rewards. Surpasses various rule of thumb techniques and attains similar results as cutting edge methods such as VIME but, with lesser computational expenses. \nThe new sparse Swimmer task has been introduced for benchmarking rewards alongside an evaluation of benchmarks to measure exploration incentives. \nA method that efficiently learns both the dynamics model and policy at the time. \nThe study is well founded as it places its findings in the context of existing research about drive and discovery in reinforcement learning (RL). The outcomes are convincing as they demonstrate performance in both continuous control tasks and Atari RAM challenges; the element of surprise emerges as a notably effective and computationally efficient motivator, for exploration. \nVerdict Received. Approved. \nThe paper should be accepted because it makes advances in enhancing motivation within reinforcement learning (RL) has been thoroughly tested through practical experiments and offers valuable insights for enhancing exploration in situations, with limited rewards. \nThe idea of using surprisal based rewards is both innovative and practical. It's a concept that makes sense in theory and works well in practice as shown by its effectiveness compared to approaches, like VIME. \nThe authors thoroughly assess their approaches, on a variety of benchmarks to demonstrate their capability to adapt and perform consistently well under different conditions. \nReasons to back up your stance \nThe paper takes a thought out approach by expanding on previous research in intrinsic motivation and effectively highlighting its unique contributions compared to other methods like VIME and L2 prediction error.The justification, for using surprisal and learning progress as rewards is convincing both theoretically and based on empirical evidence. \nThe experiments conducted were extensive. Included a wide range of tasks involving both continuous control and discrete action scenarios with deterministic and stochastic dynamics incorporated into them.The outcomes illustrated enhancements compared to standard techniques and showed competitive performance when pitted against cutting edge methods available, in the field. \nComputational efficiency plays a role when comparing the costs of the proposed methods, to VIME in large scale RL applications. \nWays to Enhance Your Writing\nThe paper should address its limitations better such as looking into scenarios where the proposed methods might not work well like when surprisal behaves in fully learned dynamics models. \n1\\. Wider Contrasts; When conducting the practical assessment phase of the study it may be beneficial to compare the findings with contemporary approaches to intrinsic motivation like those centered on pseudo count mechanisms or empowerment to provide additional context, for the research contributions. \nFurther examination is needed through studies on different aspects such as the architecture of the dynamics model and the selection of hyperparameters, like ή and κ to gain a better understanding of how the suggested methods perform under varying conditions. \nThe paper shows empirical results; however it could be enhanced by discussing potential theoretical assurances or limits for the suggested intrinsic rewards regarding exploration effectiveness. \nAsking Authors Questions\nHow much do the outcomes change based the hyperparameter selections? Specifically interested in how Η (the balance between exploring and exploiting options) and K (the magnitude of the divergence, between probability distributions) affect the results?\nCan the suggested approaches manage situations, with unpredictable behaviors as well as they do with predictable ones? If not the case; what adjustments could be needed in scenarios? \nHow do the bonuses for surprise and learning advancement stack up in terms of stability and convergence when dealing with tasks that are hierarchical, in nature? \nCould the techniques suggested be applied to situations involving agents in reinforcement learning settings where incentives, for exploration must consider how agents interact with each other? \nIn summary this study adds value to the realm of reinforcement learning through the introduction of scalable and efficient intrinsic motivation techniques for environments, with sparse rewards. By making some clarifications and conducting extra trials it could enhance its influence even more. "
