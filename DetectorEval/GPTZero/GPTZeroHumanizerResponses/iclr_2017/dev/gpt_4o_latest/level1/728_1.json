SAMDP merges the benefits of Semi Markov Decision Processes (SMDPs). Aggregated MDP (AMDP) simplifying policy analysis by reducing state space complexity and planning duration. The authors outline an approach, for developing SAMDP models, which involves selecting features clustering spatiotemporally identifying skills making inferences and choosing models. The study showcases the effectiveness of SAMDP by conducting experiments on a gridworld scenario and difficult Atari2600 games that were tackled using Deep Q Networks (DQN). Specifically highlighted are the benefits of the model in overseeing policies performance enhancements through a unique \"emergency exit\" feature and offering understandable explanations of policy actions taken. The research is thoughtfully executed as it tackles the task of comprehending and evaluating policies, within intricate reinforcement learning settings. \nDecision approved.\nThe research paper adds insights to the realm of Reinforcement Learning by introducing a fresh and applicable approach, to policy evaluation backed by thorough experiments and solid theoretical foundations. \nThe SAMDP model offers a perspective by blending spatial and temporal abstractions to meet the demand for understandable policy analysis, within the RL community. \nScientific Thoroughness; The method used is strong and well structured with descriptions of how SAMDP is built and evaluated along, with experimental outcomes that support the arguments made. \nReasons to Support \nThe paper is positioned within the existing literature by expanding on familiar ideas, like SMDPs and AMDPs and acknowledging their constraints effectively through SAMDP introduction is persuasive. Especially when examining deep neural network trained policy analyses where interpretability poses a known difficulty. \nThe practical testing phase confirms the effectiveness of the model in simplifying policy analysis and offering valuable insights through experiments conducted on gridworld and Atari2600 games.The inclusion of assessment standards, like VMSE (Variable Mean Squared Error) entropy measurements and correlation metrics bolsters the scientific reliability of the outcomes. \nThe functionality of the SAMDP in shared autonomy systems is exemplified by the \"Eject Button,\" underscoring its use and potential, for real world scenarios. \nWays to Enhance Your Work\nThe paper discusses the use of a customized K means algorithm for clustering methods in models but suggests that exploring advanced techniques, like spectral clustering could improve model quality further with more detailed comparisons or insights provided by the authors. \nThe paper recognizes that there may be differences, in how SAMDP modelsre created because of the randomness involved in clustering and feature extraction processes suggesting that future research could explore ways to achieve consistency across various iterations. \nScalability is an aspect that the paper could explore further by delving into the computational scalability of SAMDP construction in addressing larger scale RL challenges in settings, with continuous state and action spaces. \nFeature Representation; Although it makes sense to utilize t SNE for feature extraction as mentioned in the text above and recommended in the conversation section of the paper; it would be beneficial for the authors to investigate methods of dimensionality reduction that take into consideration temporal relationships explicitly. \nQueries, for the Writers \nHow well does the SAMDP model work in settings, with state and action spaces and have you thought about expanding the framework to address these scenarios? \nSure can you provide details on the pros and cons of various clustering techniques such as K means and spectral clustering specifically regarding their computational demands and effectiveness, in producing accurate models? \nHow much does the SAMDP model get affected by the selection of hyperparameters like the number of clusters (referred to as K) and window size (denoted as w)? Can you share details, about how parameter tuning is done for this model? \nThis paper makes a significant impact, on the RL community and the SAMDP framework could spark research in understandable and resilient policy analysis.
