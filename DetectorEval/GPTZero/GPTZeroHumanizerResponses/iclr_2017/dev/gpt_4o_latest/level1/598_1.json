It presents an Automatic Segmentation Criterion (ASD) which removes the requirement, for phoneme force alignment during training. The study shows that ASD is more straightforward and computationally efficient compared to the used Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion while maintaining similar accuracy levels. The model is tested on the LibriSpeech dataset. Shows good word error rates with MFCC features (7 0 percent) while also yielding positive outcomes, with power spectrum (nine point four percent) and raw waveform (ten point one percent). The research highlights the design of the system and how it demands less computing power compared to RNN based models while offering versatility in input feature selection. \nDecision approved.\nThe paper is thoroughly thought out. Presents a significant addition to the realm of speech recognition with scientifically sound findings.The key factors, for approval include; \nThe implementation of the ASW standard that streamlines training while maintaining accuracy is an advancement, in the field. \nThe performance outcomes in a benchmark test (LibriSpeech) along, with the efficiency of the suggested system position it as a viable option compared to current approaches. \nHere are some reasons to back up my point.\nThe paper focuses on the enduring issue of streamlining end to end speech recognition systems while upholding their performance levels effectively by eliminating the need, for force alignment and introducing the ASGraph approach—an pragmatic solution proposed by the authors. \nThe findings are backed by experiments that include evaluations against other methods, like CTC and Deep Speech.The authors also assess how the size of the training data and data augmentation affect their conclusions.This enhances the credibility of their arguments. \nPractical Implication; The systems computational complexity when compared to RNN based methods along with its capability to process raw waveform input makes it very attractive for practical use, in real world scenarios. \nTips, for Enhancing Your Work\nThe ASR criterions clarity is crucial; however its mathematical representation and distinctions from CTC should be elucidated in an intuitive manner for better comprehension. A visual juxtaposition of graphs (such, as Figures 2 and 3) could be seamlessly incorporated into the conversation to enhance understanding. \nDecoder Information; The article discusses a beam search decoder without delving into its performance trade offs when matched against more advanced decoders, in enough depth to back up the assertions of simplicity and effectiveness. \nThe outcomes from using raw waveform data show promise; however the paper should address why this type of feature is not as advanced as MFCC and power spectrum features.It would be beneficial to offer insights into enhancements or future paths, for utilizing raw waveform input. \nThe paper points out that the new system requires training data than Deep Speech models do but it would be beneficial to explore how the system would perform with larger datasets and if the performance gap could be narrowed down. \nQueries, for the Writers.\nHow well does the ASO standard hold up when applied to word pools or different languages with more intricate sound patterns? \nCould the suggested system see improvement by incorporating sophisticated language models or decoding techniques and how might this affect computational performance? \nWhat constraints does the existing structure face when handling sound wave data and how could these challenges be tackled in upcoming research endeavors? \nIn summary the study significantly adds value to the speech recognition domain through its ASR standard and effective ConvNet based structure. Implementing the proposed enhancements could boost its clarity and significance even more. "
