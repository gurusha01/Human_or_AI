Utilizing Reinforcement Learning, for Automated Neural Network Design.\"\nSummary \nThe article presents MetaQNN as a framework that uses reinforcement learning to automate the creation of neural network (CNN) structures. By treating the architecture search as a Markov Decision Process and utilizing Q learning with a greedy exploration approach and experience replay method the developers continuously uncover effective CNN designs without requiring human input. This innovative approach proves its worth by achieving results on well known image classification benchmarks such, as CIFAR10, SVHN and MNIST datasets. Meta QNN surpasses automated network design approaches and attains outcomes on par with cutting edge manually crafted structures in the field of AI research and development.The research paper also underscores the adaptability of the identified architectures to tasks and explores potential expansions, like integrating restrictions or fine tuning hyperparameters. \n\nThe research paper provides insights in the realm of automated machine learning (AutoML) introducing an innovative reinforcement learning driven technique, for CNN development that is backed by strong rationale and thorough assessment showing commendable results. \nUsing Q learning, for architecture search is an approach that tackles the time consuming task of manually designing CNNs with innovation and impact. \nEmpirical evidence supports the notion that Meta QNN surpasses automated techniques and either matches or surpasses manually crafted structures across various tests. \nReasons, for Support \nThe paper effectively outlines the issue of designing CNNs and presents Meta QNN as a viable solution to this challenge by emphasizing the scalability aspect of the approach. In justifying the reinforcement learning framework used in Meta QNNs design process and highlighting its reliance, on Q learning for managing discrete action spaces. \nThe authors thoroughly outline the Q learning procedure by explaining the design of state and action spaces and balancing exploration with exploitation, through experience replay mechanisms.The limitations set for the state action space are sensible. Contribute to effective learning outcomes. \nThe experimental findings are thorough as they encompass three datasets and compare against automated techniques alike.They showcase the effectiveness of Meta QNN in uncover performing designs while also shedding light onto transfer learning and ensemble performance aspects. \nEnhancing the reproducibility of the work involves providing details and training procedures along, with a project website that includes code and models. \nWays to enhance your work\nScalability and Efficiency Concerns; Even though the approach works well in practice the computational expense (requiring 10 GPUs over 10 days, per dataset) poses a challenge. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore ways to alleviate this cost by utilizing processing or implementing more streamlined exploration methods. \nThe paper should include a comparison with recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods that utilize reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms to better explain its contributions, in context. \nHyperparameter Sensitivity Concerns; The paper notes that consistent hyperparameters were applied across all explorations but conducting an assessment of how the outcomes are influenced by these hyperparameters could bolster the assertions made. \nState and action space design is crucial when it comes to discretization choices in the context of this research paper being discussed by the authors. They explain their reasoning behind it. Exploring the trade offs involved in such discretization like granularity, versus convergence speed would add significant value to the discussion. \nQuestions to Ask the Writers \nExploring the balance between exploration and exploitation in Meta QNN how much does the performance depend on the adjustment schedule of epsilon (ε)? Could using exploration strategies like softmax action selection lead, to better convergence? \nTransfer Learning Question; The study discusses how architectures identified in perform when applied to different tasks. But how does their performance stack up against architectures designed specifically for those tasks? \nAre there chances that certain limitations like restricting connected layers to only two might unintentionally restrict the use of architectures that could perform exceptionally well due to speed up convergence? \nUltimately On the paper offers a thoroughly executed and significant contribution, to the automated design of neural networks Sticking to the recommendations mentioned earlier could enhance its clarity and practicality even more.
