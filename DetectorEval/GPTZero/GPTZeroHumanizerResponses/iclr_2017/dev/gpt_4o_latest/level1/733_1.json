It utilizes Long Short Term Memory (LSTM ) networks to model system calls in a way. The authors suggest a technique that aims to lower the number of false alarms often seen in anomaly based intrusion detection systems. According to the paper the system call language model can identify connections, between system calls enhancing the ability to detect anomalies effectively. In their study using known datasets like ADFA LD and KDD98 among others as benchmarks for testing purposes the researchers show that their technique performs well compared to others with fewer false alarms and can be easily adapted to various systems.The suggested technique boosts detection accuracy more by blending several classifiers together.The research paper also emphasizes how efficient and concise the approach is,making it practical, for real life use. \nVerdict reached. Approved.\nThe article brings an addition to the study of intrusion detection by presenting a new approach using language modeling for system call sequences along, with a thoughtfully crafted ensemble technique.The outcomes are impressive. Show both theoretical depth and real world applicability.The main factors contributing to approval include; \nInnovation and Influence; Using LSTM based language models for system call sequences is groundbreaking. Tackles a key drawback of current approaches, in capturing long term connections and meaning relationships. \nImpressive empirical findings demonstrate that the new method surpasses techniques in terms of both false alarm rates and detection rates based on extensive experimentation, across various datasets. \nHere are some points to consider.\nThe authors offer an examination of previous research findings by pointing out the shortcomings of current techniques such as frequent false alarms and dependence on feature engineering while presenting their method as a significant step forward, in the field. \nScientific Precision; The studies are thorough. Encompass various datasets and comparisons, with standard baselines. By utilizing ROC curves and AUC values as evaluation metrics the findings effectively demonstrate that the suggested ensemble technique enhances detection capabilities while minimizing the occurrence of alerts. \n\"The ability of the model to work well across datasets, like KDD98 and UNH showcases its versatility and potential practical uses without needing to be retrained for each system.\"\nTips, for Enhancing \n\"Can you provide details on how the ensemble method works? Explaining its applications and intuition would make it easier, for readers who are not well versed in ensemble techniques to understand.\"\nThe paper evaluates its findings by contrasting them with techniques such as STIDE and HMM although a direct comparison, with newer deep learning strategies is missing which could enhance the assertion of cutting edge performance. \nScalability Consideration; Although the paper highlights the effectiveness of the suggested approach providing an examination of its scalability to bigger datasets or real time scenarios would be beneficial. \nLooking at patterns, in the visualization of learned representations could offer a better understanding of how the model differentiates between normal and abnormal sequences. \nQueries, for the Writers\nHow is the suggested approach prepared to deal with assaults or other intricate adversarial tactics effectively？Can the language model pick up on slight irregularities concealed within generally typical sequences？\nCan you give me information about the computational resources needed for training and inference tasks in comparison, to other methods based on deep learning? \nHow much does the models performance change based on the hyperparameters chosen (like LSTM cell size and number of layers)? Did you notice any differences in performance, among the three tested LSTM configurations? \nIn summary this study introduces an impactful method for detecting intrusions in computer systems. It is backed by testing and brings valuable additions, to this area of study. Although there are aspects that could use explanation and enhancement the research is poised for approval and could spark new investigations in this field. "
