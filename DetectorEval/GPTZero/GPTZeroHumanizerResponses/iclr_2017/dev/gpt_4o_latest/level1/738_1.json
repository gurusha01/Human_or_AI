An area that hasn't received much attention compared to CNN models.The authors highlight the presence of sparsity, in the gradients during propagation and suggest a straightforward method called \"sparsified SGD\" to introduce extra sparsity. The results from the experiment show that the new approach can achieve than 80 percent sparsity in linear gate gradients without negatively impacting the models performance.This results in cutting down multiply and add (MAC) operations by over 50 percent during training.The research paper highlights its contributions as a stride towards enhancing energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM based RNN models which could have implications, for hardware acceleration. \nOutcome of the decision is approval.\nThe research paper stands out for its motivation and significant contribution to the realm of optimizing LSTM based RNN models with a focus on sparsity techniques. It is particularly commendable for two reasons; Firstly the originality in investigating sparsity within LSTM gradient training methods – an area that has received less attention than CNN frameworks. Secondly the robust validation through experiments, across different applications and datasets lends solid support to the findings. The suggested approach is straightforward yet impactful. The results are backed by thorough scientific rigor. \nArguments, in favor.\nRelevance and Originality of the Issue; The study tackles a gap in existing research by expanding sparse optimization methods to LSTM based RNN models, which is a unique approach that stems from the imbalanced distribution of gate activations, in backward propagation gradients. \nScientific Rigor in the research is evident as the experimental findings are extensive and cover areas such, as language modeling,image captioning and machine translation.The authors showcase the versatility of their method through sensitivity tests involving network structures and sequence lengths. \nThe suggested sparsified SGD method is easy to put into practice and holds real world benefits for speeding up hardware processes. The decrease in MAC operations is noteworthy and positions the study as valuable, for enhancing energy efficiency in deep learning applications. \nWays to Enhance Your Writing\nThe paper discusses the possibility of implementing a threshold approach, in upcoming research suggesting that presenting initial findings or outlining the framework for such a method could enhance the papers quality. \nThe paper mentions the possibility of using hardware acceleration. Could provide more specific information or examples showing how sparsity could be utilized in practical hardware setups. \nThe paper should provide a comparison with other methods that promote sparsity, like reduced precision techniques to give more context to its contributions. \nQueries, for the Writers\nHow does the new sparsified SGD method stack up against ways to make gradients sparse in terms of how much computing power it needs and its impact, on performance? \nCan the thresholding method be applied to kinds of RNN cells, like GRUs or even non recurrent structures as well? If yes what difficulties could emerge in doing ? \nHow much does the suggested approach rely on the threshold selection when applied to datasets and tasks and would it be beneficial to incorporate an adaptable thresholding system, for more intricate scenarios? \n"
