To achieve invariance training using both positive and negative transformation examples the authors have implemented a network setup They have also expanded this model to generate multi scale representations that demonstrate a structured and resilient hierarchical design. The study shows how learned invariants outperform differential and integral invariants in experiments involving noise resistance sampling flexibility and shape recognition tasks. This research connects differential geometry, with deep learning providing a data focused option to conventional axioms. \nThe decision has been approved.\nThe article provides an addition by presenting a deep learning method for addressing a longstanding issue, in numerical differential geometry, which has been well received for the following reasons; \nThe paper introduces an approach by linking numerical geometry with metric learning providing a new angle, on creating geometric constants that are invariant. \nThe outcomes clearly show the strength and reliability of the technique when contrasted with conventional methods, in terms of consistency and numerical accuracy. \nReasons, for support.\nThe authors present an overview of invariant representations and the computational obstacles they pose in a compelling manner that underscores the importance of a learning driven approach.Siemens application of CNNs is convincingly. Linked to traditional techniques such as curvature scale space and integral invariants, with discernment. \nThe scientific rigor of the experiments is thorough as they test the proposed approach across scenarios such as noise levels and irregular sampling to evaluate shape retrieval effectiveness.The results consistently demonstrate that the acquired invariants surpass methods, in terms of resilience and versatility. \nTheoretical and Practical Contributions; Creating scale representations through data driven methods offers significant theoretical value. In terms the framework shows promise for use, in shape analysis, computer vision and similar fields. \nWays to enhance it.\nPresentation Clarity; Although the paper is well written in terms it contains some parts (such, as the sections discussing loss functions and architectures) which could be made more accessible through the inclusion of visual aids or simpler explanations. \nThe studies heavily depend on the MPEG dataset. It would be more beneficial to showcase outcomes from various datasets or real life scenarios to enhance the overall applicability of the method. \nComparison to techniques is vital in the papers evaluation of its method against traditional methods in shape analysis; however it would be advantageous to also incorporate comparisons, with other advanced deep learning based shape analysis approaches. \nComputational efficiency is not addressed in the paper regarding the cost of the framework in comparison, to conventional methods; adding this analysis would offer a more comprehensive evaluation. \nQuestions to Ask the Writers \nHow well does the technique work on curves with alterations, like affine or projective transformations and can the system be expanded to accommodate these scenarios? \nCan we understand the learned invariants in a way like we do with traditional invariants such, as curvature and if yes then how? \nHow does the framework react to hyperparameter choices, such, as the margin used in the contrastive loss function?\nCould the method be modified to deal with three curves or surfaces and what difficulties could come up in the process? \nIn summary the paper offers an groundbreaking solution to a long standing issue supported by solid empirical findings and opportunities, for future investigation. Though there are areas that could be enhanced they do not overshadow the quality of the research. "
