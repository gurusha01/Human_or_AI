            "inputText": "This research paper presents a model driven approach in reinforcement learning that focuses on forecasting rewards by considering the present situation and future actions taken into account.The technique utilizes a \" recurrent neural network\" to predict the anticipated rise in reward, at different time intervals ahead.To verify the effectiveness of this methodology tests are carried out using Atari games with a gameplay strategy which involves assessing random sequences of actions and opting for the one that promises the highest expected reward while minimizing the risk of losing a life. Remarkably in one of the three games assessed the player shows performance when trained on multiple tasks simultaneously indicating the presence of transfer learning. \nThe paper is nicely. Introduces a unique reward prediction framework that is technically robust. Yet I think there are some concerns that hinder it from meeting the criteria of a high caliber conference such, as ICLR as stated below. \nThe main issue here is the difference between the algorithm outlined in Section 3 and how its actually applied in Section 4 (during experiments). In Section 3s explanation of the model output as the expected reward gathered over time steps (basically a single number) there is a discrepancy, with what is observed in the experiments. Where the output comprises two distinct values; the likelihood of dying and the likelihood of attaining a higher score without dying. Although this different approach could yield results in practice it strays from the core concept outlined in the document without direct assessment. This prompts consideration of whether the initial design would function as intended if executed in a manner. \nFurthermore the testing of the method is restricted to three games that appear to have been chosen for their simplicity. There is a lack of comparison with reinforcement learning approaches like DQN and similar methods. Although I recognize that the main objective of the paper is not to reach state of the art performance but to show how the models predictions can be useful, for decision making the experiments do not fully illustrate how this model could enhance reinforcement learning algorithms. The current method doesn't actually use reinforcement learning per se; instead the model is trained through learning and implemented within a manually defined policy that is hardcoded in place.. Additionally r the study does not assess the accuracy of the models predictions (such as classification errors for mortality probabilities or mean squared errors, for rewards) nor does it compare them to simpler baseline techniques. \nThe section on related work doesn't cover ground; it mainly talks about Deep Q Networks (DQN) and doesn't delve much into model based reinforcement learning methods like it should have mentioned the paper \"Action Conditional Video Prediction using Deep Networks, in Atari Games \" which is quite relevant. \nMinor feedback; \nThe unconventional use of \"A \" denoting a condition than an activity, in this context raises potential confusion and strays from the usual reinforcement learning notation without any clear rationale. \nWhen it comes to linking tensors using a dot symbol isn't the best approach since dots usually indicate a scalar dot product instead. \nIn Section 3 point 3 point 3 point 3 point 3 point 5 in Section II of the document contains a variable called \\( ri \\) which serves as a term distinct from the reward variable \\( ri \\). This separation helps avoid confusion, between the two variables within the context of the discussion. \nAt time \\( i \\) \\( c_i \\) which is the designated control seems to correspond to the control executed at time \\( i. 2 \\).\nIn Section 3 there seems to be a mix up, between \"mean\" and \"median.”\nObservation 1 advises against using variable \\( x \\) as the \\( x \\) shown in Figure 3 does not go through layer normalization. \nObservation 1 should have an inequality, with \\( |xi|\\) not \\( xi\\).\nObservation 1. The evidence supporting it take up a considerable amount of room for a result that is rather straightforward and uncomplicated. \nIn Section 322 of the document or article we're referring to here; the initial \\( r_j \\) actually needs to be \\( r_i \\).\nIn Section 2 the sudden mention of the risk of mortality occurs without any indication that it would be a result of the model. \n\"The statement 'Our method cannot benefit from strategies appears to suggest 'solely from effective strategies.' Can you please provide clarification?\"\nPlease elucidate in Figure 4 that \"fc\" stands for \" connected.”\nIt would be beneficial to elaborate on the distinctions between the structure depicted in Figure 4 and the traditional DQN architecture outlined in Mnih et al.s work, from 2015. \nPlease explain the significance of \\( r_{ji}\\) as mentioned in your response, on OpenReviews comments section. \nTable 3 is a bit unclear as it mentions \"After one iteration \". It includes \"PRL Iteration 2.\"\nThe claim that \"Figure 5 indicates no decline in performance for Pong and Demon Attack \" may not be entirely accurate given that there is a decrease, in performance observed. \n\"The statement about a model improving sevenfold through random play lacks clarity – could you provide more insight into the basis, for this 'sevenfold' enhancement?\"\nIn Figure 5C (Demon Attack) the mention of \"an issue we previously brought up as a concern\" needs clarification—could you point out where this was discussed before?"
