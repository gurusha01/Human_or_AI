The authors introduce a technique where they deliberately hide some pitches and teach the model to anticipate and fill in those missing notes to follow the training principles of the NADE model. In terms of generating music samples from the model output; a typical method involves sampling that establishes an order, for organizing the generated outputs. The model analyzes the input at hand.
