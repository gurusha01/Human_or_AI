The proposed method, MinOIE, aims to \"minimize\" extractions by eliminating overly specific components and converting them into structured annotations of various types, akin to OLLIE. The authors apply MinOIE to a state-of-the-art OIE system (ClausIE) and evaluate it on two publicly available datasets. Their results demonstrate that MinOIE produces more concise extractions compared to standard OIE methods while maintaining accuracy.\nOverall, the paper tackles an important and somewhat underexplored aspect of OIE in a sound and methodical manner. It is well-written, sufficiently detailed, and supported by supplementary materials, including a clean Java implementation. However, my primary concern lies in the entirely static, deterministic, and rule-based nature of MinOIE. While I acknowledge that manually crafted rules can be effective when precision is paramount, such approaches are often difficult to scale, particularly across languages (a growing trend in OIE, as highlighted by Faruqui and Kumar, 2015; Falke et al., 2016). In essence, the contribution lacks novelty and depth, as it proposes a pipeline of engineered rules that are largely inspired by existing OIE systems (e.g., ClausIE and ReVerb). For instance, I would have appreciated an effort to learn these minimization rules rather than hard-coding them.\nAdditionally, the paper overlooks a recent line of research on \"semantically-informed\" OIE (e.g., Nakashole et al., 2012; Moro and Navigli, 2012; 2013; Delli Bovi et al., 2015), which augments traditional extractions with links to knowledge bases and sense inventories (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata, Yago, BabelNet). This omission is significant not only in terms of related work but also in terms of methodology. For example, incorporating an Entity Linking module into the OIE pipeline could automatically identify \"Bill of Rights\" (line 554) as a registered entity, regardless of its subconstituents. Similarly, a sense inventory could seamlessly handle the external information about collocations and multi-word expressions discussed in Section 6.2. Notably, the authors themselves rely on WordNet and Wiktionary to compile their dictionary of collocations, which could have been integrated more systematically.\nFinally, a few comments on the experimental evaluation:\n- Although MinOIE is claimed to be a general approach, the authors evaluate it solely with ClausIE as the underlying OIE system (likely the optimal pairing). It would have been valuable to test whether MinOIE's improvements are consistent across other OIE systems to better assess its flexibility as a post-processing tool.\n- Among the datasets used in Section 7, the recent OIE benchmark by Stanovsky and Dagan (2016) should have been included. This benchmark provides results for additional comparison systems not covered in this paper (e.g., TextRunner, WOIE, KrakeN).\nReferences:\n- Manaal Faruqui and Shankar Kumar.
