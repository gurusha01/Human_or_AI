            "inputText": "This paper introduces a method for morphology generation, specifically targeting gender and number, through the application of deep learning techniques. Starting from a morphologically simplified Spanish text, the proposed approach employs a classifier to reassign gender and number to tokens as needed. The authors benchmark their approach against other learning algorithms and evaluate its performance within the context of Chinese-to-Spanish (Zh Es) machine translation.\nWhile the task of generating gender and number has received limited attention recently, most morphology generation methods focus on morphologically rich languages such as German or Finnish. However, labeling this work as \"morphology generation\" seems somewhat overstated, as the method is explicitly limited to gender and number. Additionally, the reliance on handcrafted rules for this specific task raises concerns about the scalability of the approach to more complex morphology generation tasks in morphologically rich languages.\nThe paper is relatively clear in its presentation of the proposed method, and significant effort has been invested in its design. The approach has potential implications for various NLP tasks. However, the evaluation section is difficult to follow due to missing details about the methodology and rationale, making it challenging to assess whether the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. The lack of replicable experiments and the absence of result analysis further weaken the evaluation. Given that additional space is available in the paper, more information could have been provided to clarify the evaluation process. Moreover, the paper lacks sufficient motivation for the use of deep learning in this specific context. Why do the authors believe deep learning offers advantages for gender and number generation over existing state-of-the-art methods?\nThe use of the term \"contribution\" in the paper should be more precise, as the actual contributions are not always evident (specific points are detailed below).\nAbstract:\nThe term \"unbalanced languages\" requires clarification.\nSection 1:\nThe claim that the main contribution is the use of deep learning is unconvincing. Simply applying deep learning to an NLP task does not constitute a contribution.\nSection 2:\nThe assertion that neural machine translation (NMT), referred to as \"neural approximations,\" does not achieve state-of-the-art results for Zh Es is misleading. This claim should either be removed or substantiated, as prior work (e.g., Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016, at IWSLT) has demonstrated that NMT outperforms SMT by approximately 10 BLEU points for Zh Es using the UN corpus.\nSection 5.1:\nThe claim that using the Zh Es language pair is a contribution is unsubstantiated. While it is refreshing to see a focus on non-English-centric machine translation, merely using a specific language pair does not qualify as a contribution. Additionally:\n- Clarify whether the numbers in Table 2 were computed before or after preprocessing.\n- Justify the removal of sentences longer than 50 tokens.\n- Provide details on how development and test sets were obtained, as the lack of this information hinders reproducibility.\nSection 5.2:\nSpecify the version of Moses used, as its default parameters vary across versions.\nSection 5.3:\n- The term \"hardware cost\" needs clarification.\n- Table 3 lacks details on how the presented values were obtained. How were the classifiers trained and tested, and on what data? Was the same data used as in Section 6?\n- The process of simplifying Spanish is unclear. Explain how this was achieved (e.g., rules, software) and how the simplified Spanish was used to train the classifier and the SMT system.\nSection 6:\n- While the proposed method outperforms other classification algorithms, its performance relative to state-of-the-art methods remains unclear. Explain why the chosen classification algorithms were selected for comparison.\n- Discuss the impact of handcrafted rules on the results and provide an explanation for the high accuracy achieved by the method.\n- If the classification algorithms were not implemented by the authors, cite the frameworks or provide URLs.\n- Clarify whether the phrase table for SMT experiments was trained on simplified Spanish.\n- Justify the choice of METEOR over other metrics like BLEU. Specify the version of METEOR used, as it has evolved significantly since 2005. If the 2005 version was used, explain why; if a later version was used, clarify whether paraphrases were included.\n- Indicate whether the METEOR scores are statistically significant.\nSection 7:\nThe term \"further simplify morphology\" is misleading, as no simplification of morphology is presented in the paper.\nTypos:\n- \"femenine\" \"feminine\"\n- \"ensambling\" \"ensembling\"\n- \"cuadratic\" \"quadratic\"\nStyle:\n- Rewrite plain-text citations in the format \"Toutanova et al. (2008) built...\" instead of \"(Toutanova et al., 2008) built...\"\n- Place table captions below the tables, with more spacing between the table and its caption.\n- Update the paper to use the ACL 2017 template instead of the ACL 2016 template. Refer to the ACL 2017 FAQ and submission instructions for additional guidance, including the requirement to provide DOI or URL references for all ACL papers.\n---\nAfter Authors' Response:\nThank you for your response.\nYou clarified that rules are applied as post-processing, but it remains unclear whether they are used to compute classification results. If they are, I am still concerned about their impact on the reported results.\nYou mentioned that Spanish is simplified as shown in Table 1, but this does not address my question: How were these simplifications obtained (e.g., rules, software)? Readers need this information to replicate your approach.\nThe classification algorithms in Table 5 are not state-of-the-art, or if they are, appropriate citations are missing. Furthermore, the table demonstrates that deep learning outperforms other classification algorithms but does not provide evidence that the proposed approach is superior to state-of-the-art morphology generation methods for machine translation. A comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (as discussed in related work) is necessary to strengthen the paper.\nIf these issues are addressed, the paper would be significantly more convincing."
