            "inputText": "This paper presents a model for cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER). The authors utilize conditional random fields, maximum entropy Markov models, and neural network-based NER approaches. Additionally, they propose two methods for combining the outputs of these approaches (probability-based and ranking-based) and introduce a technique for selecting optimal training instances from cross-lingual comparable corpora. The cross-lingual projection is implemented using a modified version of Mikolov's method. Overall, the paper is well-structured, easy to follow, and written in clear English. The results obtained from the combined annotations are noteworthy.\nDetailed comments:\nI am curious about the motivation for proposing a variation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model. The paper does not provide sufficient details about this variation or the parameters used. Was the original CBOW model (or the Continuous Skip-gram model) yielding suboptimal results? I recommend including the results of the original CBOW model so that readers can better understand the improvements achieved by your approach. Since you employ a decay factor for the surrounding embeddings, I suggest considering the exponential decay method described in [1].\nIn line with the previous comment, I would like to see a comparison between the original Mikolov cross-lingual projection method and your frequency-weighted projection approach. These contributions would be more impactful if readers could clearly observe the superiority of your method.\n\"The proposed data selection scheme is very effective in selecting good-quality projection-labeled data and the improvement is significant\" â Have you conducted a statistical significance test? It would be helpful to confirm whether the differences in results reported in this work are statistically significant.\nI recommend integrating the content of Section 4.4 into the beginning of Section 4.2 for better organization. Additionally, I suggest moving the evaluation presented in Table 2 to the evaluation section for consistency.\nThe paper lacks a dedicated related work section. While the introduction includes some related work, I suggest dividing the introduction into two sections to clearly separate the background and related work.\nThe evaluation section is relatively brief (1.5 pages, including the conclusion). Since you achieve state-of-the-art results, I would appreciate a more detailed discussion and analysis of the results.\nSuggested references:\n[1] Iacobacci, I., Pilehvar, M. T., & Navigli, R.
