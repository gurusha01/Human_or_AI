            "inputText": "- Strengths:\n* The manuscript is exceptionally well-written. \n* It effectively demonstrates how stylometric analysis can aid in reasoning-based text classification. \n* The findings have significant implications for the design of NLP datasets. \n* The results could have broader implications for various text classification tasks. \n- Weaknesses:\n* The paper has very few weaknesses. The primary one is the lack of a clear definition of \"style,\" which is a central concept in the study. \n- General Discussion:\nThis paper presents two experiments investigating the relationship between writing tasks and writing style. Specifically, by controlling for vocabulary and topic, the authors demonstrate that features commonly used in authorship attribution and style analysis are highly effective in distinguishing between: 1) a natural story ending, 2) an ending written by a different author, and 3) a deliberately incoherent ending written by another author. \nThis is an engaging and well-executed paper that unquestionably deserves acceptance. The writing is clear and concise, and the authors thoroughly explain their methodology and rationale. By employing well-known, straightforward features and a simple classifier, they successfully validate a non-trivial hypothesis. While it is intuitive that writing tasks impose significant constraints on style, the authors' ability to demonstrate this in a controlled and rigorous manner is impressive. \nI particularly appreciated Section 8 and its discussion of the implications for the design of NLP tasks. This paper has the potential to be highly influential and widely cited. Excellent work. \nThe paper is already strong in its current form. However, I have one minor suggestion: the authors should define \"style\" early in the manuscript. They appear to be referring to \"a set of low-level, easily computable lexical and syntactic features.\" As it stands, this usage might be somewhat unclear to readers unfamiliar with computational stylometrics. \nThe selection of stylistic features is reasonable and well-justified. That said, were alternative features considered? If so, were they found to be less effective? A brief discussion of the feature selection process would add further clarity."
