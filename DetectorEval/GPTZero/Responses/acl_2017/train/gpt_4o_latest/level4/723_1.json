            "inputText": "This paper provides a compelling exploration of morphological segmentation using word embeddings. It introduces a system that leverages word embeddings to evaluate both the local semantic similarity of word pairs with potential morphological relationships and the global semantic validity of possible morphological segment types. The paper is well-written and offers a meaningful extension to prior approaches in semantically driven morphological segmentation.\nThe authors conduct experiments using the Morpho Challenge data for three languages: English, Turkish, and Finnish, which exhibit varying levels of morphological complexity. All systems are trained on text sourced from Wikipedia.\nThe results demonstrate that the proposed MORSE system achieves notable improvements in F1-score for English and Turkish when compared to the widely used Morfessor system, which serves as the baseline. However, the system underperforms relative to Morfessor for Finnish. As the authors suggest, this is likely due to the complexity of Finnish morphology, which results in data sparsity and consequently lowers the quality of the word embeddings. To enhance performance for Finnish and similarly complex languages, the authors might consider employing word embeddings that incorporate sub-word information. For instance:\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/CaoR16, \n author = {Kris Cao and \n Marek Rei}, \n title = {A Joint Model for Word Embedding and Word Morphology}, \n journal = {CoRR}, \n volume = {abs/1606.02601}, \n year = {2016}, \n url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02601}, \n timestamp = {Fri, 01 Jul 2016 17:39:49 +0200}, \n biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/corr/CaoR16}, \n bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org} \n} \n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/BojanowskiGJM16, \n author = {Piotr Bojanowski and \n Edouard Grave and \n Armand Joulin and \n Tomas Mikolov}, \n title = {Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information}, \n journal = {CoRR}, \n volume = {abs/1607.04606}, \n year = {2016}, \n url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606}, \n timestamp = {Tue, 02 Aug 2016 12:59:27 +0200}, \n biburl = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/corr/BojanowskiGJM16}, \n bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org} \n} \nThe authors also critique the existing Morpho Challenge data sets, highlighting issues such as the presence of incorrectly segmented words. Additionally, they point out that while some segmentations in the data set may have historical validity (e.g., the segmentation of \"business\" into \"busi-ness\"), these segmentations are no longer semantically meaningful. To address this, the authors introduce a new data set comprising 2,000 semantically motivated segmentations of English word forms derived from English Wikipedia. They demonstrate that MORSE achieves significant improvements over Morfessor on this new data set.\nIn summary, this is a well-crafted paper that delivers competitive results on the intriguing task of semantically driven morphological segmentation. The inclusion of code and a new data set further enhances the value of this submission."
