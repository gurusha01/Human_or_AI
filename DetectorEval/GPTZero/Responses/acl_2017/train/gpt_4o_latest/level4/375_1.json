Specifically, all \"network embedding\" studies should begin referencing and benchmarking against foundational work, such as the latent space model introduced by Peter Hoff et al., along with subsequent contributions in statistical and probabilistic machine learning literature:\nP.D. Hoff, A.E. Raftery, and M.S. Handcock. Latent space approaches to social network analysis. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., 97(460):1090\"\"1098, 2002.\nThis latent space model, which embeds nodes into a low-dimensional latent space, was developed as early as 2002, predating neural network-based network embeddings.\nGiven this paper's goal of modeling the varying roles of social network actors, it should also reference and compare its approach to the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB):\nAiroldi, E. M., Blei, D. M., Fienberg, S. E., & Xing, E. P. (2008). Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. Journal of Machine Learning Research.\nThe MMSB framework enables nodes to probabilistically adopt different \"roles\" when forming edges.\n- General Discussion:\nWhile the statistical models mentioned above do not incorporate textual data or employ scalable neural network implementations with techniques like negative sampling, they are grounded in principled generative modeling rather than heuristic neural network objectives. Moreover, there are more recent extensions of these models that improve scalability and incorporate textual information.\nIs the performance difference between CENE and CANE in Figure 3 statistically insignificant? (Additionally, were the experiments conducted multiple times with different random train/test splits?)\nRegarding the hyperparameter grid searches described in Section 5.3, were they performed using the test set (which would be problematic), a validation set, or the training set?"
