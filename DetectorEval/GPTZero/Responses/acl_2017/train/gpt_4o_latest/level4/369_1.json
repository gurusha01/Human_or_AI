            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel method for translating from morphologically impoverished languages (e.g., Chinese) to morphologically rich ones (e.g., Spanish) using a two-step process. First, the system generates a simplified version of the target language. Then, it selects morphological features for each target word and applies inflections based on those features.\nAlthough the authors focus on a single language pair, I find the problem addressed in this work to be both significant and underexplored in current machine translation (MT) research. The proposed approach diverges from many modern techniques, such as BPE and character-level models, and instead draws inspiration from earlier methods like \"Factored Translation Models\" (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) and \"Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages with Synthetic Phrases\" (Chahuneau et al., 2013). Unfortunately, these influential works are not cited in the paper.\nI am concerned, however, that the authors report only METEOR scores without presenting BLEU or qualitative evaluations. If BLEU scores do not improve, the authors should provide a justification for why their method remains beneficial, supported by METEOR results and example sentences.\nAdditionally, while the paper emphasizes handling gender and number as key linguistic features, it neglects person, which is also critical in morphologically rich languages. This omission might be due to the infrequent use of first- and second-person pronouns and verbs in news datasets, but the issue warrants at least a brief discussion. Moreover, the paper does not adequately explain why rescoring negatively impacts gender accuracy. If the accuracy is high, shouldn't the reranker learn to retain the 1-best hypothesis?\nFinally, while the content of the paper is promising, the manuscript contains numerous spelling, grammar, word choice, and stylistic issues that make it unsuitable for publication in its current form. Below, I provide a detailed list of errors and suggestions for improvement.\nOverall, I would like to see this work presented at a future conference, ideally with additional language pairs, more evaluation metrics, and after thorough proofreading.\nDetailed Error List:\n- Line 062: \"Zhand\" \"Zhang\"\n- Line 122: \"CFR\" \"CRF\"\n- Related Work Section: Replace consistent use of `\\cite` with `\\newcite` where appropriate.\n- Avoid filler phrases like \"it is important to mention that\" or \"it is worth mentioning that.\"\n- Line 182, 184: Clarify \"The popular phrase-based MT system\" ‚Äì does this refer to Moses or PBMT systems in general?\n- Line 191: \"a software\" \"software\"\n- Line 196: \"academic and commercial level\" ‚Äì should be pluralized, but consider whether \"levels\" is the correct term.\n- Line 210: \"a morphology-based simplified target\" \"a morphologically simplified target\"\n- Line 217: Consider rephrasing \"decide on the morphological simplifications.\"\n- Table 1: Fix extra spaces in \"cuesti√≥n\" (first line) and \"titulado\" (last line).
