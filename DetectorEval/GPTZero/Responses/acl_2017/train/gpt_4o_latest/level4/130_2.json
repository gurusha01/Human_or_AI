The authors propose a graph-based approach that utilizes co-occurrence information between words in the transcripts. Features are extracted based on various graph properties, including lexical and syntactic characteristics, among others. The results are evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation across multiple classifiers, with varying performance observed across the datasets. The study tackles a well-defined problem and employs appropriate datasets for the task. \nWeaknesses: \nThe paper has several limitations: \n1. The manuscript is difficult to follow due to poor English usage. A thorough review of grammar and spelling would significantly improve readability. \n2. The description of the main machine learning problem is inadequate. It is unclear what constitutes a single instance of classification. If each transcript is classified as MCI or No MCI, the dataset descriptions should provide transcript-level statistics. Tables 1, 2, and 3 should focus on describing the data rather than the studies that produced the transcripts. Additionally, patient age appears irrelevant to the classification task. A substantial portion of the text (approximately two pages) is devoted to describing dataset details that do not directly impact the classification task. Furthermore, there are inconsistencies in the dataset statistics. For example, Section 4.1.1 mentions 326 participants, but the total number of males and females in Table 1 is less than 100. \n3. The motivation for enriching the graph is unclear. Why not represent each word as a node in the graph and connect them based on the similarity of their vectors, independent of co-occurrence? \n4. Although the datasets are from a biomedical domain, no domain-specific tools or techniques have been utilized. \n5. The unclear class distribution in the datasets makes it difficult to assess whether accuracy is an appropriate evaluation metric. For a binary classification task, F1-score would have been a more suitable metric. \n6. Results are reported to four decimal places for very small datasets (e.g., 43 transcripts) without statistical tests to verify the significance of the improvements. This raises questions about the reliability of the reported gains."
