            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis work represents the first application of a neural network-based approach to argumentation mining. The authors employ a Pointer Network (PN) model combined with multi-task learning, achieving superior performance compared to prior methods in experiments conducted on two datasets.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe approach primarily applies PN to the domain of argumentation mining. While the integration of PN with multi-task learning is novel for this task, the level of innovation may not meet the standards for an ACL long paper. Additionally, the absence of qualitative and error analyses is a significant drawback.\n- General Discussion:\nApart from the aforementioned weaknesses, the justification for using PN is not sufficiently compelling. Although three characteristics of PN are outlined in lines 138-143, these do not provide a strong rationale for preferring PN over bi-directional LSTMs with attention mechanisms. The authors should elaborate on the specific problems addressed by PN and evaluate in the experiments how effectively these issues are resolved.\nFigures 2 and 3 are challenging to interpret. For instance, what do the self-link to D1 and the links from D2 to E1 and from D3/D4 to E2 represent? These appear to be outputs from the decoder rather than actual links. Furthermore, the decoder LSTM in these figures lacks an input from e_j, which contradicts Equation (3). In addition, the abbreviation \"FC\" in Figure 3 is not explained.\nEquation (8) is unclear. The method for calculating the probability of each component type involves computing the probability of E_i, which seems inconsistent.\nIn the experimental section, it is unclear why only \"PN,\" which is not a joint model, was evaluated on the microtext corpus.\nIt is also ambiguous whether the BLSTM model was trained using the joint-task objective.\nThe paper does not sufficiently address prior studies on discourse parsing that utilize attention mechanisms. The authors should clarify how their work differs from these studies.\n- Minor Issues:\nl.128: \"should related\" â ' \"should be related\" \nl.215: \"(2015)\" is improperly formatted and appears to be floating. \nl.706: \"it able\" â ' \"it is able\" \nAfter reviewing the authors' responses, I found their explanations convincing and have subsequently raised my recommendation score. I strongly encourage the authors to include discussions on improved examples generated by PN and provide detailed feature ablation analyses."
