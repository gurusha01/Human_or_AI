            "inputText": "- Strengths: \ni. The paper is well-structured and straightforward to follow. \nii. It provides comprehensive comparisons across various experimental settings and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. \n- Weaknesses: \ni. The experiments compare the proposed semi-supervised method with prior supervised approaches, even though the training data is sufficient for supervised learning. \n- General Discussion: \nThis study employs a pre-training strategy to enhance Chinese word segmentation. Building on transition-based neural word segmentation, the authors aim to pre-train incoming characters using external resources (e.g., punctuation, soft segmentation, POS, and heterogeneous training data) through multi-task learning. Each external resource is treated as an auxiliary classification task. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of seven datasets. \nThe paper is well-written and easy to comprehend. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive experiments. However, there is a notable concern. The proposed method relies on semi-supervised learning, leveraging external resources for character pre-training. Additionally, the paper incorporates heterogeneous training datasets, albeit only for pre-training purposes. Despite this, the baselines used in the experiments are based on supervised learning. Typically, semi-supervised learning outperforms supervised learning due to its ability to utilize abundant auxiliary information. Consequently, the experiments should have included comparisons with other semi-supervised approaches to ensure a fair evaluation. \nPost Author Response: \nThe reviewer's concern lies in the use of an additional \"gold-labeled\" dataset for pre-training character embeddings. While some baselines in the experiments utilize label information\"\"predicted automatically by their base models, as the authors noted\"\"ensuring a fair comparison requires identical conditions. Even if the \"gold\" dataset is not directly used to train the segmentation model, the use of this dataset for pre-training character embeddings creates an imbalance. Thus, the comparison appears unfair, as the proposed method benefits from an additional \"gold\" dataset."
