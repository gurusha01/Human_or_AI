            "inputText": "This paper addresses the cold-start problem in review spam detection. The authors begin by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the issue. They identify that, in realistic scenarios, there is insufficient prior data available for new users. Traditional features fail to effectively detect review spam in such cases. To address this, the authors leverage the abundant textual and behavioral information from existing reviewers to augment the limited information available for new users. Specifically, they propose a neural network that represents the reviews of new users using learned word embeddings and jointly encoded behavioral information. Through experiments, the authors compare their approach with traditional methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of their model.\n- Strengths:\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly articulated. The concept of jointly encoding textual and behavioral data is innovative. The cold-start problem is indeed a pressing issue for various online review analysis applications, and, to the best of my knowledge, prior research has not adequately addressed this challenge. The paper is significant and provides a sound analysis. Furthermore, the results of the proposed model could be beneficial for downstream detection models.\n- Weaknesses:\nIn the experiments, the authors set the window width of the filters in the CNN module to 2. Did they explore other window widths, such as width `1` for unigram features, `3` for trigrams, or a combination of these? \nAdditionally, the related work section could benefit from more detailed descriptions of prior research. Providing more specific explanations would help readers better understand the task. \nThere are also several typos that need correction: \n- Sec 1: \"making purchase decision\" \"making a/the purchase decision\" \n- Sec 1: \"are devoted to explore\" \"are devoted to exploring\" \n- Sec 1: \"there is on sufficient behaviors\" \"there are no sufficient behaviors\" \n- Sec 1: \"on business trip\" \"on a business trip\" \n- Sec 1: \"there are abundant behavior information\" \"there is abundant behavior information\" \n- Sec 3: \"The new reviewer only provide us\" \"The new reviewer only provides us\" \n- Sec 3: \"features need not to take much\" \"features need not take much\" \n- Sec 4: \"there is not any historical reviews\" \"there are not any historical reviews\" \n- Sec 4: \"utilizing a embedding learning model\" \"utilizing an embedding learning model\" \n- Sec 5.2: \"The experiment results proves\" \"The experiment results prove\"\n- General Discussion:\nOverall, this is a strong paper and should be accepted by ACL."
