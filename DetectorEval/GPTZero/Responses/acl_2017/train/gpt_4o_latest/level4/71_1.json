            "inputText": "- Strengths:\n - The paper clearly outlines its contributions from the outset. \n - The authors provide both the system and the dataset for reproducibility. \n - The figures effectively illustrate the proposed approach. \n - The approach is described in detail. \n - The authors evaluate their approach on additional datasets and compare its performance with prior published work. \n- Weaknesses:\n - Some paragraphs explaining the methods are overly detailed, lack references to related work, and repeat content from the corresponding method sections. The authors have committed to addressing this issue in the final version. \n - The dataset lacks a README file, but the authors have committed to adding one. \n- General Discussion:\n - In Section 2.2, the authors mention examples of DBpedia properties used as features. It is unclear whether all properties were used or only a subset. If it is a subset, the authors should list them explicitly. In their response, the authors provided further clarification, and I strongly recommend including a detailed list of all features in the final version to ensure clarity and replicability. \n - In Section 2.3, the authors employ the Bi-LSTM-CRF model from Lample et al. It would be helpful to explicitly state that the input consists of word embeddings, as in Lample et al.'s work. \n - In Figure 3, it is unclear whether the KNs are in the source language or in English (since the mentions were translated into English). The authors have acknowledged this and stated in their response that they will correct the figure. \n - Section 2.4 suggests that topical relatedness implies some features are domain-dependent. It would be valuable to assess the impact of domain-dependent features on performance. The authors have committed to including performance results for these features in the final version, as noted in their response. \n - In the related work section, the authors draw a strong comparison to the work of Sil and Florian, emphasizing the distinction between supervised and unsupervised approaches. While the proposed approach is supervised in terms of training, the generation of training data does not involve human intervention."
