            "inputText": "- Strengths: \nThis paper proposes a method for fine-grained IsA extraction by leveraging modifier interpretations. The motivation behind the work is clear, and the task itself is compelling. Furthermore, the proposed approach appears to be robust overall, and the experimental results demonstrate an increase in the number of fine-grained classes that can be populated.\n- Weaknesses: \nCertain sections of the paper are difficult to comprehend. For instance, it is not clear why \\( D((e, p, o)) \\) is multiplied by \\( w \\) in Equation (7) or why the weight for \\( e \\) in Equation (8) is described as the product of how frequently \\( e \\) has been observed with a particular property and the weight of that property for the class \\( MH \\). Additionally, it is unclear how much introducing compositional models contributes to increasing coverage. It seems that the modifier expansion plays a significant role in the coverage improvement, and this technique could potentially be applied to the baseline method, 'Hearst'. It would be valuable to see the performance of 'Hearst' with modifier expansion included.\n- General Discussion: \nIn summary, the task is intriguing, and the proposed approach is generally well-founded. However, due to the aforementioned weaknesses, I remain uncertain about this paper.\n- Minor Comment: \nSome notations in the paper are confusing. For example, the meaning of 'H' is unclear. It appears that 'H' sometimes represents a class, as in \\( (e, H) \\in O \\), but at other times it seems to denote a noun phrase, as in \\( (H, p, N, w) \\in D \\). Is this interpretation correct? \nIn the section titled \"Precision-Recall Analysis,\" why do the authors use the area under the ROC curve instead of the area under the Precision-Recall curve, given the title of the section?\n- After Reading the Response: \nThank you for addressing my concerns. However, I am not entirely satisfied with the response regarding modifier expansion. While I agree that modifier expansion may not be directly applicable to Hearst in the same way as the proposed method, I am curious whether there might be alternative ways to incorporate similar modifiers to enhance Hearst's coverage. I remain undecided between a score of 3 and 4, but since the effectiveness of introducing compositional models remains unclear, I will maintain my current recommendation."
