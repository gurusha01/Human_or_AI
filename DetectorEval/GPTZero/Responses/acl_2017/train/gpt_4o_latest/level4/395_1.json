            "inputText": "This paper proposes a method to derive sense embeddings from unannotated corpora by employing a modular process for sense selection and representation. The learning process is framed as a reinforcement learning problem and implemented using a message-passing scheme between the two modules.\n- Strengths:\nThe manuscript is generally well-written, with most ideas presented clearly and appropriate comparisons to related work where necessary. The experiments are well-structured, and while the results are not groundbreaking, they are solid. However, there are several issues with the paper that prevent me from fully endorsing it.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe primary concern lies in the overstatement of the paper's central claims, which do not always align with their actual contributions.\n1) The term \"deep\" is prominently featured in the title and throughout the paper. However, the authors employ a skip-gram architecture, which is not inherently deep. This constitutes a misrepresentation of the approach.\n2) Reinforcement learning is presented as a core aspect of the paper, but the motivation and implementation are not sufficiently clear. Section 3.2 attempts to frame the task as a reinforcement learning problem but acknowledges two major drawbacks, leading to the use of a Q-learning algorithm. This algorithm, however, does not align with the initially claimed policy, creating a disconnect in the narrative.\nAdditionally, the novelty of the modular approach is questionable. The method appears to closely resemble EM learning approaches, where the E step selects an optimal sense and the M step optimizes an objective to improve sense representations. The authors do not adequately differentiate their approach from EM or justify why reinforcement learning is preferable to EM in this context.\n3) The term \"pure-sense representations\" is repeatedly used and positioned as a key contribution. However, its meaning and benefits are not clearly defined or substantiated.\n4) The authors assert that their model achieves linear-time sense selection. This claim is not well-supported in the paper, and highlighting this aspect in the relevant sections would improve clarity.\n5) Finally, the claim of achieving state-of-the-art results is based solely on the MaxSimC metric. Other works have demonstrated superior performance using the AvgSimC metric. While achieving state-of-the-art results is not the sole criterion for evaluating a paper, the claim made in the abstract and introduction is somewhat misleading given the limited scope of the evaluation."
