Additionally, it is unclear whether the dataset used is sufficiently generalizable to other domains.\nGeneral Discussion:\nThis work introduces a rule-based approach for generating additional weakly labeled data for event extraction. The method is composed of three primary stages. First, Freebase is utilized to identify key slot fillers for matching sentences in Wikipedia (using all slot fillers is overly restrictive and results in too few matches). Second, FrameNet is employed to enhance the reliability of labeling trigger verbs and to identify nominal triggers. Finally, a multi-instance learning framework is applied to handle the noisily generated training data.\nOne of the strengths of this paper is its demonstrated improvement over the state-of-the-art on a challenging benchmark. The rules used in the method are relatively straightforward, which suggests that the approach could be valuable for practitioners aiming to enhance information extraction (IE) systems in other domains. However, the method does require some manual effort, such as mapping Freebase event types to ACE event types (as noted in Section 5.3, line 578). This manual component introduces challenges for future work in achieving direct comparability with this paper. Furthermore, the method itself does not appear to introduce substantial novelty.\nOther Comments:\n- I am concerned about the generalizability of the method to other domains. For instance, Section 2, line 262, mentions that 21 event types were selected from Freebase. How were these event types chosen, and what is their coverage relative to the 33 event types in the ACE dataset?\n- The paper is generally well-written, though there are areas for improvement. For example, in Section 3.1, line 316, the phrase \"arguments liked time, location...\" is unclear. If you are referring to roles or arguments, it would be helpful to clarify or provide concrete examples of time and location. Additionally, there are minor typographical errors, such as the missing \"that\" in line 357. While these issues are not major, addressing them would improve the overall clarity of the paper."
