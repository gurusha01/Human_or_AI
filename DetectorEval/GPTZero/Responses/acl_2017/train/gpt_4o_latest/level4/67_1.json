Some of the included methods are outdated and their relevance is questionable (e.g., Mpttern). \n- Memb is seemingly the prior state-of-the-art method, but no citation or reference is provided for it. \n- While the results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the previous best approach, the evidence presented is not entirely convincing. In particular, for the first dataset, the performance improvement over the prior state-of-the-art is minimal. \n- The paper requires significant proofreading and cannot be published in its current form. For instance, I identified 11 errors in just the first column of page 2. \n- The CilinE hierarchy used in the experiments is relatively shallow (only 5 levels). While it has been used in prior studies, I would expect that deeper hierarchies would pose greater challenges for adding new hyponym-hypernym relationships. This could potentially explain the very high performance reported, even in earlier studies. \nGeneral Discussion: \nThe proposed approach is not particularly novel or original, but it is applied to a problem that has not yet been explored using deep learning techniques. For this reason, the paper is of interest. However, there are two major issues that need to be addressed. \nThe first issue is the presentation. The paper contains numerous errors and typos, which need to be corrected before publication. While I initially attempted to list these errors to assist the authors, there are simply too many to enumerate. \nThe second issue relates to the evaluation. Although the reported performance is better than the prior state-of-the-art, the results are not entirely convincing for the reasons mentioned earlier. For instance, what exactly is Memb? Is it the method proposed by Shwartz et al. (2016)? If not, what were the results of this recent approach? The evaluation section needs to be reorganized to clearly outline the baseline systems, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, and highlight where competing methods fall short. Additionally, statistical significance tests are necessary, especially given the marginal improvement observed on one of the datasets."
