I find myself aligned with its goals in several respects. However, I have significant overarching concerns that the paper does not address. I hope the authors can tackle these issues in their response. \n1. I was surprised by the repeated references and comparisons to Wen (2016), which is a relatively obscure paper I was not previously familiar with. The authors would strengthen their argument by grounding their work in comparisons to more established corpora, such as those mentioned in Section 2. Additionally, there is a wealth of prior NLG research that has explored microplanning in the context of DBPedia. For example, a 2016 workshop featured numerous papers on NLG and DBPedia (see https://webnlg2016.sciencesconf.org/ and http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/3500). Earlier work by Duboue and Kutlak is also relevant. I would encourage the authors to shift their focus away from Wen (2016) and demonstrate broader awareness of the existing literature on NLG and DBPedia. \n2. Microplanning is highly dependent on the domain or genre. For instance, pronoun usage is far more prevalent in novels than in technical documents like aircraft maintenance manuals. This domain specificity is why much of the existing research has concentrated on domain-specific resources. Consequently, there are legitimate theoretical concerns about whether it is even feasible to train a \"wide-coverage microplanner.\" The authors do not acknowledge or address this issue, and they need to demonstrate an understanding of this challenge. \n3. I am skeptical about the quality of texts obtained via crowdsourcing. Many individuals do not write well, which raises doubts about whether collecting example texts from random crowdsourcers can yield a high-quality corpus suitable for training microplanners. It is important to remember that the ultimate goal of microplanning is to produce texts that are easy to read. Mimicking human writers, as this paper (and most learning-based approaches to microplanning) does, is only sensible if we can trust that the human writers have produced clear, well-written texts. This assumption is reasonable for professional writers, such as journalists, but far less so for unvetted crowdsourcers. \nFrom a presentation standpoint, the authors should ensure that all text in the paper adheres to the ACL font size requirements. Some text, particularly in Figures 1 and 2, is extremely small and difficult to read. This text should be resized to match the font used in the main body of the paper. \nAt this stage, I am assigning the paper a borderline rating. I look forward to the authors' response and will adjust my evaluation based on how well they address the concerns raised."
