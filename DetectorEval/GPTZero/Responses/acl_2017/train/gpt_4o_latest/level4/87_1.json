The \"first sentence\" heuristic has been a part of the summarization literature for a long time. This study essentially adapts this heuristic (in a refined form) to the context of keyword extraction. While this does not imply that the work lacks merit, it cannot be considered highly innovative. \nThe paper does not incorporate state-of-the-art or very recent methods. The evaluation of the system against state-of-the-art approaches relies primarily on strong baselines. Although the experiment successfully answers the question of whether the system outperforms these baselines, it does not convincingly demonstrate superiority over the current state-of-the-art. This limitation somewhat diminishes the overall impact of the work.\n- General Discussion: \nIn general, the paper is of good quality, and I recommend it for publication and presentation. \nHowever, I suggest that the authors better position their work and the system's performance in relation to: \n- MartinezâRomo, Juan, Lourdes Araujo, and Andres Duque Fernandez. \"SemGraph: Extracting keyphrases following a novel semantic graphâbased approach.\" Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 67.1 (2016): 71-82. \n(This work shares notable similarities with the current study in certain aspects.) \n- Le, Tho Thi Ngoc, Minh Le Nguyen, and Akira Shimazu. \"Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction: Introducing New Kinds of Words to Keyphrases.\" Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
