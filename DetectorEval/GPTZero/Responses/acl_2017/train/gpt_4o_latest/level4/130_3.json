            "inputText": "The paper presents an innovative application of predominantly existing representations, feature sets, and methodologies, specifically for detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in speech narratives. The problem, datasets, and domain are comprehensively described. Although some details are lacking, the proposed solution and experimental approach appear reasonable. Overall, the study is engaging and informative.\nHowever, the paper has several drawbacks that require attention. Significant editing is needed to enhance readability. Key concepts are insufficiently detailed. For instance, the multi-view learning approach is not explained; the set of \"linguistic features\" lacks clarity; and the datasets used to generate word embeddings are not explicitly identified (presumably the three datasets mentioned, which seem too small for this purpose). Additionally, the decision to exclude disfluencies (e.g., filled pauses, false starts, repetitions) is unclear, as these may be critical features in the context of MCI. The omission of the widely-used tf-idf weighting scheme for BoW classifications is also unexplained. Furthermore, the paper does not include tests for statistical significance to support the experimental conclusions. Lastly, the related work section is somewhat superficial and could benefit from more depth.\nDetailed comments are as follows:\nAbstract: The abstract should be more concise. See specific notes below.\n- Lines 22-23: Rephrase for clarity. \"However, MCI disfluencies produce agrammatical speech impacting in parsing results\" impacting the parsing results?\n- Lines 24-25: Clarify whether grammatical errors in transcripts are corrected manually. This is initially unclear and only becomes evident after reading the Introduction and Related Work sections. Including examples of disfluencies could help.\n- Lines 29-30: Rephrase for clarity: \"as it a lightweight and language independent representation.\"\n- Lines 34-38: Specify the three datasets explicitly. For example: \"the other two: Cinderella and …\"\n- Line 70: Clarify the meaning of \"15% a year.\"\n- Line 73: Rephrase for better readability.\n- Lines 115-117: Explain why BoW would also face challenges with disfluencies.\n- Lines 147-149: Clarify what is meant by \"the best scenario.\"\n- Line 157: Provide a link or citation for DementiaBank.\n- Line 162: Include a link or citation for the \"Picnic picture of the Western Aphasia Battery.\"\n- Line 170: Explain what the WML subtest entails.\n- Line 172: Add missing citations.\n- Lines 166-182: Expand the related work section. Include specific methods used in prior studies and compare them to the current work.\n- Line 185: Follow conference citation guidelines. For example: \"Aluisio et al. (2016) used…\"\n- Line 188: Define \"PLN.\"\n- Lines 233-235: Rephrase and clarify. Lemmatization is not necessarily the final step in text preprocessing; additional steps are often involved.\n- Lines 290-299: Specify whether the word embeddings were created using the MCI datasets or external datasets.\n- Line 322: Replace \"consisted of\" with \"consist of.\"\n- Lines 323-332: Rewrite for clarity. For instance: \"manually segmented of the DementiaBank and Cinderella\" What does \"segmented\" mean here? Why weren't all datasets automatically segmented? Define \"ABCD.\" Explicitly name the datasets instead of referring to them as \"first,\" \"second,\" or \"third.\"\n- Table 1 Caption: Include additional dataset statistics as described.\n- Lines 375-388: Justify the removal of filled pauses, false starts, and repetitions, as these may be important features for MCI detection.\n- Line 399: Rephrase: \"… multidisciplinary team with psychiatrists …\" consisting of psychiatrists…\n- Lines 340-440: Provide a link or citation for the transcription norms.\n- Section 4.2.1: Clarify which dataset was used to generate the word embeddings.\n- Line 560: Specify whether the shortest path refers to feature 6.\n- Section 4.2.2 Linguistic Features: Expand this section for greater clarity. Check conference guidelines regarding supplementary material for additional pages.\n- Line 620: Add a comma: \"In this work, term frequency was …\" Explain why tf-idf, a common weighting scheme, was not used.\n- Lines 641-645: Rewrite for improved readability.\n- Line 662: Clarify what is meant by \"the threshold parameter.\" Does this refer to the word embedding cosine distance threshold?\n- Line 735: Add a missing period.\n- Section 4.3 Classification Algorithms: Provide details on the multi-view learning scheme used. Include tests for statistical significance to support the results.\nIn summary, while the paper offers an interesting and valuable contribution, addressing the above issues will significantly improve its clarity, rigor, and overall quality."
