            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis study explores the application of NLP techniques to speech transcripts (narratives and descriptions) for identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, ICD-10 code F06.7). The authors report that their method can differentiate between healthy control participants and MCI patients (lines 141-144). However, in the conclusion (lines 781-785), they acknowledge that the accuracy, which ranges from 60% to 85%, indicates that distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with cognitive impairments remains challenging. While the introduction is more optimistic than the conclusion, the overall message is promising and piques the reader's interest in understanding the methodology and results in greater detail.\nThe dataset presented in the paper consists of transcripts from 20 healthy participants and 20 MCI patients (20+20). However, as the data is in Portuguese, it may be inaccessible to non-Portuguese speakers. Including more technical details in the paper, such as a translated example of a short transcript and possibly a (partial) sample network with embeddings for this transcript, would enhance its accessibility and clarity.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper begins with a comprehensive introduction and review of related work, but some of the cited references are tangential or unnecessary. For instance, (Salton 1989) in section 4.2.3 is primarily NLP background and could be omitted. Similarly, references to unrelated topics like \"sentiment classification\" and \"pedestrian detection in images\" (lines 652-654) are not directly relevant and could also be excluded. Overall, section 4.2.3 (lines 608-621) and the first five pages could be condensed to focus more tightly on the paper's core topic. Additionally, the authors could delve deeper into the technological innovations, including examples of English translations of the ABCD and/or Cinderella narratives.\nThe relatively short narratives in Portuguese, particularly in the ABCD dataset, raise questions about how word similarities were determined to construct word embeddings. In lines 272-289, the authors describe generating word-level networks from continuous word representations, but the source of these representations is unclear. Were they derived solely from the ABCD and Cinderella datasets, or were external corpora used? Similarly, in lines 513-525, the authors mention using sub-word level (n-grams) networks to generate embeddings, but the training source for these embeddings is not specified. It is also unclear whether combining the two types of networks improves accuracy. Furthermore, the origin of the \"out-of-vocabulary words\" mentioned in line 516 needs clarification.\n- General Discussion:\nThe study's focus on leveraging NLP to detect cognitive impairments is significant and valuable. Another noteworthy aspect is its application to Portuguese, a language with fewer NLP resources compared to English. The authors should elaborate on how embeddings were computed for Portuguese, given these resource constraints.\nThe manuscript would benefit from a revision to streamline sections 1-3, condense section 4.1, and provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup. Additionally, clarification regarding the NURC/SP N. 338 EF and 331 D2 transcription norms would be helpful.\n- Technical Comments:\n1. Line 029: \"… as it a lightweight …\" Should this be \"… as in a lightweight …\"?\n2. Line 188: \"PLN\" Should be \"NLP.\"\n3. Line 264: \"out of cookie out of the cookie\" Repetition of words.\n4. Table 3, row 2, column 3: \"72,0\" Should be \"72.0.\"\n5. Lines 995-996: The DOI number is identical to the one in lines 1001-1002.\n6. Lines 992-993: The hyperlink behind the title points to the subsequent paper in the list."
