What specific impact did these components have on relation extraction performance?\n- During prediction, how were illegal predictions handled by the system?\nMinor Comments:\n- The description of local optimization in the introduction is somewhat misleading. It is not entirely \"local,\" as it \"considers structural correspondences between incremental decisions.\"\n- The data points in Figures 6 and 7 should be connected using straight lines rather than curves.\n- How are entities represented in the \"-segment\" approach?\n- Some references are incomplete. For instance, Kingma et al. (2014) is published in ICLR, and Li et al. (2014) lacks page numbers."
