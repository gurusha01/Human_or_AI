The authors adapt and extend the methodology used to create the SICK corpus for English, addressing challenges specific to Polish, such as its fusional morphology and relatively free word order. The dataset comprises 10,000 sentence pairs annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment, with inter-annotator agreement metrics demonstrating satisfactory reliability. The authors claim that the dataset will facilitate the evaluation and development of CDS models for under-resourced languages. The primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. A novel adaptation of the SICK corpus methodology to Polish, including language-specific transformation rules and annotation processes.\n2. The creation of a high-quality Polish evaluation dataset for CDS models, with robust inter-annotator agreement metrics.\n3. A detailed procedure for dataset construction, which can serve as a blueprint for similar efforts in other under-resourced languages.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Practical Value: The paper addresses a significant gap in the field by creating a CDS evaluation dataset for Polish, an under-resourced language. This effort is likely to stimulate further research and development of NLP tools for Polish and other similar languages.\n2. Methodological Rigor: The authors provide a comprehensive and transparent description of their dataset construction process, including linguistic transformations, annotation guidelines, and quality control measures. The use of both Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's alpha to evaluate inter-annotator agreement adds credibility to the dataset's reliability.\n3. Reproducibility: The detailed documentation of transformation rules and annotation procedures makes the methodology replicable for other languages, enhancing the paper's broader impact.\n4. Evaluation Metrics: The inter-annotator agreement scores (Îº = 0.732 for entailment and Î± = 0.780 for relatedness) are satisfactory for a semantic annotation task, demonstrating the dataset's reliability.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Innovation in Dataset Design: While the adaptation of the SICK methodology to Polish is commendable, the paper does not introduce significant methodological innovations beyond language-specific adjustments. The core contribution is primarily an application of existing techniques.\n2. Dependence on English-Centric Resources: The reliance on the 8K ImageFlickr dataset, originally used for English, may introduce cultural or contextual biases that are not fully addressed in the paper. A discussion of how these biases might affect the dataset's utility for Polish CDS models would strengthen the work.\n3. Evaluation of Practical Utility: The paper does not provide empirical results demonstrating the dataset's utility for evaluating or improving CDS models for Polish. A preliminary evaluation using existing CDS models would enhance the paper's impact.\n4. Scalability: While the methodology is detailed, the reliance on human verification and post-corrections raises questions about the scalability of the approach for larger datasets or other languages.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you tested the dataset with any existing CDS models for Polish? If so, what were the results, and how do they validate the dataset's utility?\n2. How do you plan to address potential cultural or contextual biases introduced by using the 8K ImageFlickr dataset?\n3. Could the linguistic transformation rules you developed for Polish be generalized to other fusional languages, or are they highly language-specific?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by addressing the lack of resources for evaluating CDS models in under-resourced languages. While the methodological novelty is limited, the practical importance of the dataset and the rigor of its construction justify its acceptance. However, the authors are encouraged to address the weaknesses noted above, particularly by demonstrating the dataset's utility through empirical evaluation."
