            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel architecture for neural machine translation (NMT) that operates at the character level, addressing the limitations of large vocabulary requirements in word-level models. The proposed Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation (DCNMT) model introduces two key innovations: (1) a word encoder that learns morphological representations using two recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and (2) a hierarchical decoder that translates at the character level using a multi-layered RNN structure. The authors demonstrate that their model avoids the large vocabulary bottleneck, is more efficient to train than existing word-based and character-based models, and achieves competitive BLEU scores on English-French (En-Fr), English-Czech (En-Cs), and Czech-English (Cs-En) translation tasks. The paper also highlights the model's ability to learn morphology and handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and misspelled words effectively.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Architecture: The hierarchical structure of the model, combining a word encoder and a character-level decoder, is an innovative approach to addressing the limitations of both word-level and character-level NMT models. The explicit focus on learning morphology is a significant contribution.\n2. Efficiency: The model demonstrates competitive BLEU scores with significantly reduced training time compared to other character-level models, such as the purely character-based model by Luong and Manning (2016), which required three months of training.\n3. Practical Utility: The ability to handle OOV and misspelled words is a practical advantage, as demonstrated by qualitative examples. This feature is particularly useful for real-world applications where such issues are common.\n4. Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results on multiple language pairs (En-Fr, En-Cs, Cs-En), showing that the model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art systems while being more efficient in terms of training time and model size.\n5. Morphological Analysis: The analysis of learned representations and segmentation of morphemes is insightful and demonstrates the model's ability to capture linguistic structures, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Comparison with Baselines: While the paper compares the proposed model to several baselines, it does not include a direct comparison with some recent advancements in subword-level models, such as SentencePiece or other tokenization-free approaches.\n2. Incomplete Ablation Studies: The paper does not provide sufficient ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the word encoder and hierarchical decoder. For example, it is unclear how much of the performance gain is due to the hierarchical decoder versus the morphology-aware word encoder.\n3. Scalability Concerns: Although the model is efficient for training, the use of six RNNs may raise concerns about scalability for very large datasets or longer sequences. The paper does not discuss potential trade-offs in computational complexity.\n4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as potential challenges in extending the model to languages with highly complex morphology or non-alphabetic scripts.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model perform on languages with non-alphabetic scripts (e.g., Chinese or Japanese)? Would the character-level approach generalize well to such languages?\n2. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of the hierarchical decoder compared to other character-level models, especially for longer sequences?\n3. Have you considered combining your approach with pre-trained embeddings or transfer learning to further improve performance?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a novel and efficient approach to character-level NMT with strong empirical results and practical utility. While there are some areas for improvement, such as more comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies, the contributions are significant and relevant to the field. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the identified weaknesses during the revision process."
