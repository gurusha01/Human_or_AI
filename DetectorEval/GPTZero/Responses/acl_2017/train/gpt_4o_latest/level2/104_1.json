            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of ambiguity in entity mentions within a unified semantic space by proposing a Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding (MPME) model. The key contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding Model: The paper introduces a novel approach to generate multiple sense embeddings for each mention by jointly leveraging textual contexts and entities from a knowledge base. This is the primary contribution and is well-motivated by the need to handle ambiguity in semantic representations.\n \n2. Disambiguation via Language Modeling: The authors propose an efficient language model-based disambiguation method to map mentions to specific senses. This component adds practical utility to the proposed embedding model.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark entity linking dataset.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The idea of using multi-prototype embeddings to address mention ambiguity is novel and addresses a well-known challenge in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The integration of textual and knowledge-based signals is a meaningful contribution to the ongoing research on unified semantic spaces.\n2. Empirical Performance: The paper provides strong experimental evidence to support its claims. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on a benchmark entity linking task, which underscores its practical utility and effectiveness.\n3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and clearly structured. The methodology is explained in sufficient detail, making it relatively easy to follow the proposed approach.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors include both qualitative and quantitative analyses, which strengthen the validity of their claims. The use of multiple evaluation metrics and comparisons with strong baselines is commendable.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the scalability of the multi-prototype embeddings for large-scale knowledge bases or the potential computational overhead of the disambiguation method is not addressed.\n2. Insufficient Novelty in Disambiguation: While the multi-prototype embedding model is novel, the disambiguation method appears to be a relatively straightforward application of language modeling techniques. The paper could benefit from a more innovative or theoretically grounded approach to disambiguation.\n3. Reproducibility Concerns: Although the methodology is described in detail, the paper does not provide sufficient information about hyperparameter settings, training details, or access to the codebase. This could hinder reproducibility, especially for researchers attempting to replicate the results.\n4. Lack of Broader Impact Analysis: The paper does not explore the broader implications of its approach, such as its applicability to other NLP tasks beyond entity linking or its potential biases when dealing with ambiguous mentions.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed model scale when applied to very large knowledge bases with millions of entities? Have you tested its efficiency in such scenarios?\n2. Can you provide more details about the hyperparameter settings and training process to facilitate reproducibility?\n3. How sensitive is the performance of the disambiguation method to the quality of the knowledge base used?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and promising approach to addressing mention ambiguity in unified semantic spaces. While there are some concerns regarding scalability, reproducibility, and the novelty of the disambiguation method, the strong empirical results and the clear exposition make this a valuable contribution to the field. With some revisions, this work has the potential to make a significant impact."
