The proposed method allows the use of multiple words as anchors (anchor facets) instead of single words, addressing the limitations of existing anchor-based methods in terms of interpretability and flexibility. The authors demonstrate that tandem anchors improve topic quality, are more intuitive for users, and scale efficiently for interactive use on large datasets. The main contributions of this work are: \n1. A novel extension of the anchor words algorithm to incorporate multiword anchors, with several combination strategies (e.g., harmonic mean, vector average). \n2. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrating that tandem anchors outperform single word anchors in terms of topic quality, classification accuracy, and user satisfaction. \n3. A user study showing that tandem anchors are more intuitive and effective for interactive topic modeling compared to single word anchors. \nStrengths: \n1. Novelty and Practicality: The extension to multiword anchors is a significant improvement over existing anchor-based methods. By enabling users to combine multiple words, the method addresses the issue of ambiguous or unintuitive single word anchors, making the approach more practical for real-world applications. \n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation using both quantitative metrics (e.g., classification accuracy, clustering metrics, topic coherence) and qualitative user studies. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of tandem anchors over single word anchors. \n3. Scalability: The proposed method is computationally efficient, with runtimes suitable for interactive applications. This scalability is a critical advantage over other interactive topic modeling approaches, such as Interactive Topic Models and Utopian, which are too slow for real-time use. \n4. User-Centric Design: The inclusion of a user study highlights the practical utility of the method. The interface design and the ability to refine topics interactively align well with the needs of non-expert users. \nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Comparison with Baselines: While the paper compares tandem anchors to single word anchors and Gram-Schmidt anchors, it does not include a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art interactive topic modeling methods (e.g., Interactive Topic Models or Utopian) in terms of topic quality. The runtime limitations of these methods are acknowledged, but their exclusion weakens the comparative analysis. \n2. Dependence on Anchor Selection: The method relies heavily on the quality of user-provided anchor facets. While the harmonic mean combiner mitigates some issues, the paper could explore strategies for guiding users in selecting effective anchor words, especially for datasets without clear metadata. \n3. Evaluation Scope: The experiments focus primarily on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. While this is a standard benchmark, additional datasets from diverse domains would strengthen the generalizability of the findings. \nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does the method perform on datasets with less structured or noisier metadata compared to 20 Newsgroups? \n2. Could the authors elaborate on how the choice of anchor combination strategy (e.g., harmonic mean vs. vector average) impacts interpretability for end-users? \n3. Are there plans to extend the interface to provide automated suggestions for anchor facets to assist users? \nConclusion: \nThis paper presents a significant contribution to interactive topic modeling by addressing key limitations of existing anchor-based methods. The tandem anchors approach is novel, practical, and well-supported by experimental results. While the paper could benefit from broader comparisons and additional datasets, its strengths in scalability, user-centric design, and improved topic quality make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses."
