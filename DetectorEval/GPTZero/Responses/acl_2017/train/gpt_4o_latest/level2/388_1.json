            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThe paper introduces UDEPLAMBDA, a semantic interface for Universal Dependencies (UD) that maps natural language to logical forms in a largely language-independent manner. The primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Development of UDEPLAMBDA: A multilingual semantic parsing framework that extends DEPLAMBDA to handle Universal Dependencies, enabling cross-lingual applications.\n2. Multilingual Evaluation: The authors provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets, facilitating multilingual evaluation for semantic parsing.\n3. Empirical Results: UDEPLAMBDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on GraphQuestions for English and demonstrates competitive results across languages on both datasets.\nThe paper also highlights the framework's potential for broader natural language understanding tasks, such as entailment, summarization, and paraphrasing.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Multilingual Scope: UDEPLAMBDA represents a significant advancement over DEPLAMBDA by enabling semantic parsing across multiple languages. Its reliance on UD annotations ensures applicability to a wide range of languages, making it a valuable contribution to multilingual NLP.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are robust, with UDEPLAMBDA outperforming strong baselines on multilingual datasets. The authors' provision of translated datasets for German and Spanish is a commendable effort that enhances reproducibility and encourages further research.\n3. Task-Agnostic Design: The framework's language-independent approach and reliance on UD annotations make it adaptable to diverse tasks beyond question answering, as noted in the paper.\n4. State-of-the-Art Results: The framework achieves the strongest results to date on GraphQuestions for English, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling compositional and complex queries.\nWeaknesses\n1. Semantic Specificity Trade-offs: While UDEPLAMBDA achieves language independence, it sacrifices semantic specificity in certain cases. For example, it cannot disambiguate between active and passive constructions or canonicalize relations like \"broke\" and \"window\" without additional lexical context. This limitation could hinder its performance on tasks requiring fine-grained semantic distinctions.\n2. Limited Dataset Scope: The evaluation is restricted to question answering against Freebase, which may not fully capture the framework's potential for other natural language understanding tasks. Broader evaluations on tasks like summarization or entailment would strengthen the paper.\n3. Dependency on UD Enhancements: The framework relies on enhanced UD representations for certain linguistic phenomena (e.g., long-distance dependencies), which are not yet universally available for all languages. This reliance could limit its applicability in languages with incomplete UD annotations.\n4. Performance Gap in Non-English Languages: The results for German and Spanish are notably lower than for English, likely due to parser performance differences. This highlights a dependency on high-quality syntactic parsers, which may not be available for all languages.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does UDEPLAMBDA handle languages with significantly different syntactic structures or limited UD resources (e.g., morphologically rich or low-resource languages)?\n2. Could the framework be extended to incorporate lexicalized semantic information without compromising its language independence?\n3. Are there plans to evaluate UDEPLAMBDA on tasks beyond question answering, such as summarization or machine translation?\nConclusion\nThe paper presents a valuable contribution to multilingual semantic parsing by extending DEPLAMBDA to Universal Dependencies. While the framework demonstrates strong results and broad applicability, its reliance on enhanced UD representations and the trade-off in semantic specificity are notable limitations. Overall, the work is a significant step forward in cross-lingual natural language understanding and merits acceptance, with room for further exploration and refinement."
