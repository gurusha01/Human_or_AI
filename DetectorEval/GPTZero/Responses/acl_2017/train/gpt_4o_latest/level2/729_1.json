            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the critical problem of detecting rumors in microblog posts by leveraging propagation structures. The authors propose a novel kernel-based method, the Propagation Tree Kernel (PTK), and its context-sensitive extension (cPTK), to model the propagation trees of tweets. These kernels capture high-order patterns in propagation structures, incorporating user, content, and temporal features. Unlike traditional feature engineering or representation learning approaches, PTK and cPTK directly measure the similarity between propagation trees, enabling finer-grained classification of rumors into four classes: false rumor, true rumor, unverified rumor, and non-rumor. Experimental results on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in both general and early rumor detection tasks.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Use of Propagation Trees: The paper introduces a novel representation of tweet propagation as trees, which effectively captures the structural, temporal, and linguistic dynamics of rumor diffusion. This approach is a significant improvement over traditional feature-based methods that often oversimplify propagation patterns.\n \n2. Kernel-Based Framework: The use of PTK and cPTK to measure the similarity between propagation trees is a key contribution. The kernels allow for soft matching of subtrees, which is particularly useful for capturing nuanced propagation patterns. The context-sensitive extension (cPTK) further enhances performance by incorporating propagation paths.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors evaluate their methods on two real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over strong baselines, including feature-engineered models (e.g., RFC) and deep learning models (e.g., GRU). The results are robust across both general and early detection tasks.\n4. Practical Implications: The ability to classify rumors into finer-grained categories (false, true, unverified) is highly relevant for real-world applications, such as misinformation tracking and public safety.\n5. Early Detection Capability: The proposed methods excel in early rumor detection, achieving high accuracy within the first 24 hours of propagation. This is a critical feature for mitigating the spread of misinformation.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that cPTK may not be as effective for non-rumors, it does not thoroughly discuss other potential limitations, such as scalability to larger datasets or the computational cost of kernel-based methods.\n2. Dataset Bias: The datasets used (Twitter15 and Twitter16) are constructed from popular tweets, potentially introducing bias. The exclusion of less popular tweets may limit the generalizability of the findings to less impactful rumors.\n3. Interpretability of Kernel Models: While the kernel-based approach is powerful, it lacks interpretability compared to feature-engineered models. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the learned patterns or subtrees.\n4. Dependency on Annotated Data: The method relies on high-quality annotations for training, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios. The authors do not discuss how the approach would perform with noisy or incomplete labels.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the computational complexity of PTK and cPTK compare to other baseline methods, particularly for large-scale datasets?\n2. Can the proposed methods generalize to other social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Reddit) where propagation structures may differ significantly?\n3. Have you considered augmenting your approach with external knowledge sources (e.g., fact-checking databases) to improve performance?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of rumor detection by introducing a novel kernel-based approach that effectively captures the structural and temporal dynamics of information diffusion. While there are some concerns about scalability and dataset bias, the proposed methods are well-motivated and demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines. Encouraging further exploration of this approach, particularly in real-world settings, is warranted."
