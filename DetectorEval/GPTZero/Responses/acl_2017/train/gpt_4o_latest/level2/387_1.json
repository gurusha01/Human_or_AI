Unlike prior approaches that rely on handcrafted gaze-based features, the authors propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to automatically learn feature representations from both text and gaze data. The key contributions of the paper are: \n1. A multimodal CNN-based framework that integrates gaze and text components for feature extraction and classification. \n2. Empirical evidence demonstrating that automatically learned gaze features, when combined with textual features, improve classification performance over both traditional handcrafted feature-based systems and CNNs relying solely on text. \n3. A detailed analysis of the learned features, showing their ability to capture linguistic subtleties, particularly in semantically and pragmatically complex texts. \nStrengths: \n1. Novelty and Innovation: The paper presents a significant innovation by automating the extraction of gaze-based cognitive features, addressing the limitations of handcrafted approaches. The use of CNNs for gaze data is a novel and promising direction. \n2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental results on two publicly available datasets, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in performance for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection tasks. The use of McNemar tests to validate improvements adds credibility to the findings. \n3. Multimodal Integration: The framework effectively integrates gaze and text data, showing consistent performance gains over text-only models. This highlights the potential of cognitive NLP systems in addressing challenges posed by linguistic subtleties. \n4. Feature Analysis: The visualization and analysis of learned features provide valuable insights into the model's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced patterns, such as intensified negative opinions in sarcastic texts. \n5. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient details about the experimental setup, hyperparameters, and datasets, making the work reproducible. \nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Dataset Scope: The experiments are conducted on only two datasets, both of which are relatively small. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed framework to larger and more diverse datasets. \n2. Overfitting on Dataset 2: The results for Dataset 2 indicate potential overfitting, as training accuracy reaches 100% while validation accuracy remains low. This suggests that the model may not generalize well, and further regularization or dataset-specific tuning is needed. \n3. Scalability of Gaze Data: The reliance on eye-tracking data limits the scalability of the approach, as such data is not readily available for most NLP tasks. The authors do not discuss how the framework could be adapted for real-world applications where gaze data is unavailable. \n4. Limited Improvement for Sarcasm Detection: While the framework achieves significant improvements for sentiment analysis, the gains for sarcasm detection are marginal. This suggests that the gaze component may not be as effective for this task, possibly due to dataset characteristics or the inherent difficulty of sarcasm detection. \n5. Lack of Ablation Studies: The paper does not include detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (e.g., fixation vs. saccade channels, static vs. non-static embeddings). Such studies would strengthen the claims about the effectiveness of specific design choices. \nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does the proposed framework perform on larger datasets or datasets without gaze data? Can the model be adapted to infer gaze-like features from text alone? \n2. Have you considered alternative architectures (e.g., RNNs or transformers) for gaze feature extraction? How do they compare to CNNs? \n3. Could you elaborate on the challenges faced in optimizing hyperparameters, particularly for Dataset 2? \nConclusion: \nThis paper presents a promising approach to combining gaze and text data for sentiment and sarcasm classification, with clear improvements over existing methods. However, the limited dataset scope, scalability concerns, and marginal gains for sarcasm detection temper its impact. With further validation on larger datasets and exploration of gaze-free alternatives, the framework could have significant implications for cognitive NLP systems. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
