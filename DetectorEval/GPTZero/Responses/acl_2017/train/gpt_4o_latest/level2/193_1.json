            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper presents TUPA (Transition-based UCCA Parser), the first parser designed for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA), a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation framework. UCCA poses unique challenges for parsing due to its support for reentrancy, discontinuities, and non-terminal nodes, which result in directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures. The authors propose a novel transition-based parsing approach, leveraging bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) for feature representation and introducing new transitions tailored to UCCA's structural properties. The paper evaluates TUPA on English UCCA corpora in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating its superior performance compared to baseline parsers. The work also highlights the parser's potential applicability to other semantic DAG structures.\nThe main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are: \n1. Novel Transition-Based Parsing Framework: The paper introduces a transition set specifically designed to handle UCCA's unique properties, including reentrancy, discontinuities, and non-terminal nodes. \n2. Integration of BiLSTMs for Feature Representation: The use of BiLSTMs significantly enhances the parser's ability to capture complex semantic structures. \n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments, comparing TUPA against strong baselines, including bilexical dependency graph parsers and tree parsers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in both primary and remote edge prediction. \n---\nStrengths: \n1. Innovative Methodology: The proposed transition set and the integration of BiLSTMs represent a significant advancement in parsing technology, addressing structural challenges that existing parsers cannot handle. \n2. Strong Empirical Results: TUPA achieves state-of-the-art performance on UCCA parsing tasks, with substantial improvements over baseline parsers, particularly in handling remote edges. This demonstrates the robustness and generalizability of the approach. \n3. Reproducibility: The authors provide sufficient implementation details, including hyperparameters and training procedures, and commit to releasing their code and models, ensuring reproducibility. \n4. Broader Applicability: The parser's ability to handle general DAG structures suggests potential utility beyond UCCA, making it relevant for other semantic parsing tasks. \n---\nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper briefly mentions UCCA's inter-annotator agreement as a ceiling for parser performance, it does not thoroughly discuss other limitations, such as scalability to larger datasets or multilingual settings. \n2. Comparison to AMR Parsing: Although the paper positions UCCA as distinct from Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a more detailed comparison of the two frameworks, particularly in terms of practical applications, would strengthen the argument for UCCA's utility. \n3. Error Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed error analysis, which could provide insights into the types of structures or transitions where TUPA struggles, guiding future improvements. \n---\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does TUPA perform on languages other than English, given UCCA's cross-linguistic applicability? \n2. Could the proposed transition set be adapted for other semantic frameworks, such as AMR or SDP? \n3. What are the computational requirements of TUPA, and how does it scale with larger datasets or longer sentences? \n---\nConclusion: \nThis paper makes a significant contribution to semantic parsing by introducing a novel parser for UCCA and demonstrating its effectiveness. While there are areas for improvement, such as a more detailed discussion of limitations and error analysis, the work is well-executed and presents a strong case for acceptance. The proposed methodology has the potential to influence future research in semantic parsing and related fields."
