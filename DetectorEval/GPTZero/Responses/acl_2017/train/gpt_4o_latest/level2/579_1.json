            "inputText": "Review of \"MinIE: Minimizing and Annotating Open Information Extractions\"\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces MinIE, a novel Open Information Extraction (OIE) system designed to address the challenge of overly-specific extractions in existing OIE systems while maintaining informativeness and accuracy. The key contributions of the paper are:\n1. Minimization of Extractions: MinIE rewrites extractions by removing overly-specific components and annotating them with information about polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities.\n2. Annotated Extractions: MinIE introduces annotations to preserve semantic information lost during minimization, such as negative polarity or uncertainty.\n3. Multiple Minimization Modes: The system supports four modes (Safe, Frequency, Collocations, and Aggressive) to balance precision, recall, and extraction length based on user needs.\n4. Experimental Validation: The authors conducted experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating that MinIE achieves competitive or higher precision and recall compared to prior systems, while producing significantly shorter extractions.\nStrengths\n1. Practical Utility: The minimization and annotation approach addresses a critical limitation of existing OIE systems\"\"overly verbose or redundant extractions\"\"making MinIE highly useful for downstream tasks like question answering and knowledge base construction.\n2. Comprehensive Annotations: The inclusion of polarity, modality, attribution, and quantity annotations enhances the interpretability and usability of the extractions, especially for reasoning tasks.\n3. Empirical Rigor: The experimental evaluation is thorough, comparing MinIE against multiple state-of-the-art systems (ClausIE, OLLIE, Stanford OIE) on both large and small datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate MinIE's advantages in terms of precision, extraction length, and handling of redundant extractions.\n4. Flexibility: The introduction of multiple minimization modes allows users to tailor the system to their specific requirements, balancing aggressiveness and safety.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Core Techniques: While the minimization and annotation framework is well-executed, many of the underlying techniques (e.g., dependency parsing, lexical constraints) are incremental extensions of prior work (e.g., ClausIE, OLLIE). The novelty primarily lies in their combination and application.\n2. Handling of Nested Extractions: The paper acknowledges that MinIE does not handle nested extractions, which are crucial for representing complex relationships in sentences. This limits its applicability in certain domains.\n3. Dependency on External Resources: The Frequency and Collocations modes rely heavily on external dictionaries (e.g., WordNet, Wiktionary) or large corpora for training. This dependency may hinder the system's portability to low-resource languages or domains.\n4. Error Analysis: While the authors provide some insights into MinIE's errors, the analysis could be more detailed. For example, the impact of dependency parsing errors and limitations of the named entity recognizer could be quantified more rigorously.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does MinIE handle sentences with ambiguous negations or modality (e.g., double negatives or nested modal verbs)?\n2. Could the system's reliance on external dictionaries for collocations be mitigated through unsupervised learning techniques?\n3. Are there plans to extend MinIE to support nested extractions or temporal/spatial annotations, as mentioned in the conclusion?\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a well-motivated and practically useful system that advances the state of the art in OIE. While the novelty of individual techniques is limited, the combination of minimization and annotation is impactful and addresses a critical gap in the field. The experimental results are robust, and the system's flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. Addressing the identified weaknesses in future work could further enhance MinIE's utility and adoption."
