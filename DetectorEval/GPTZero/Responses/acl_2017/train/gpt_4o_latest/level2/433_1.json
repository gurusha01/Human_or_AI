            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach to dependency parsing for Singlish, an English-based creole, by constructing a Singlish dependency treebank under the Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme and leveraging English syntactic knowledge to improve parsing accuracy. The authors claim two primary contributions: (1) the creation of a Singlish dependency treebank with 1,200 annotated sentences, which is the first of its kind, and (2) the development of a Singlish dependency parser that integrates English syntactic knowledge via neural stacking, achieving a significant 36.51% relative error reduction in parsing accuracy. The authors also release their treebank, parser, and source code, making this work a valuable resource for low-resource languages.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Practical Contribution: The work addresses a significant gap in NLP research by focusing on Singlish, a low-resource language. The creation of a Singlish dependency treebank under the UD framework is a valuable resource for future research in creole languages and low-resource NLP.\n2. Effective Knowledge Transfer: The use of neural stacking to integrate English syntactic knowledge demonstrates a meaningful methodological contribution. The substantial improvement in parsing accuracy (84.21% UAS) highlights the effectiveness of this approach.\n3. Thorough Evaluation: The paper provides a detailed error analysis across different Singlish-specific grammatical phenomena (e.g., topic prominence, copula deletion), showcasing the parser's strengths and limitations. This analysis adds depth to the evaluation.\n4. Resource Availability: The release of the annotated treebank, parser, and source code significantly enhances the reproducibility and utility of the work for the broader NLP community.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Dataset Size: While the creation of the Singlish dependency treebank is commendable, its size (1,200 sentences) is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the parser. Expanding the dataset could improve the robustness of the results.\n2. Lack of Comparison with Other Creoles: The paper focuses exclusively on Singlish without exploring whether the proposed approach could generalize to other creole languages. A comparison with similar low-resource languages would strengthen the claims of broader applicability.\n3. Annotation Challenges: Although the authors describe the annotation process in detail, the inter-annotator agreement (UAS: 85.30%, LAS: 75.72%) indicates room for improvement in consistency. This could affect the reliability of the treebank.\n4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the neural stacking approach, such as its reliance on high-quality English resources or potential challenges in adapting the method to other low-resource languages with less overlap with English.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the relatively small size of the Singlish treebank in future work? Are there plans to expand the dataset or explore semi-supervised approaches?\n2. Could the neural stacking approach be adapted for other creole languages with less syntactic similarity to English? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. How does the parser perform on sentences with heavy code-switching between Singlish and English, which is common in real-world usage?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of low-resource NLP by addressing the unique challenges of parsing Singlish. While there are some limitations, the novelty, methodological rigor, and resource release make it a strong candidate for acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses and provide additional discussion on generalizability and limitations."
