            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces MORSE, a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that integrates morpho-syntactic regularities from word representations with orthographic features. Unlike prior approaches, MORSE incorporates both local and vocabulary-wide semantic information, addressing limitations in existing methods that rely solely on orthographic features. The authors also highlight deficiencies in current benchmarking datasets, such as the Morpho Challenge (MC) dataset, and propose a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) that adheres to compositionality principles. The paper claims state-of-the-art performance across multiple languages and demonstrates MORSE's robustness in avoiding over-segmentation errors common in MDL-based methods like Morfessor. Key contributions include:\n1. A novel framework that combines orthographic and semantic features for morpheme segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.\n2. A new dataset (SD17) designed to address compositionality issues in existing benchmarks.\n3. A detailed analysis of MORSE's performance across languages with varying morphological complexities.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Innovation: The integration of vocabulary-wide semantic information into morpheme segmentation is a significant advancement over existing methods. The use of difference vectors to model morphological relations is particularly innovative.\n2. Performance: MORSE demonstrates superior performance over Morfessor and other state-of-the-art methods, especially in English and Turkish. The results on SD17 highlight its ability to handle compositionality better than existing approaches.\n3. Dataset Contribution: The introduction of the SD17 dataset is a valuable contribution to the field, addressing critical weaknesses in the widely used MC dataset. The dataset's focus on compositionality provides a more reliable benchmark for future research.\n4. Robustness: MORSE effectively avoids over-segmentation errors by leveraging semantic cues, as demonstrated in its handling of non-compositional words.\n5. Practical Insights: The paper provides a detailed discussion of MORSE's hyperparameter tuning and its trade-offs between precision and recall, offering flexibility for downstream tasks.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Applicability to Rich Morphologies: MORSE underperforms on Finnish, a language with rich morphology, due to vocabulary size limitations and sparsity issues. This restricts its applicability to morphologically complex languages.\n2. Greedy Inference: The greedy inference approach can propagate initial segmentation errors, potentially impacting overall performance. A more global optimization strategy could improve results.\n3. Concatenative Morphology Assumption: MORSE is limited to concatenative morphology, making it less effective for languages with non-concatenative morphological processes.\n4. Dependency on Tuning Data: While the authors claim minimal supervision, MORSE requires a small dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which may limit its usability in truly unsupervised settings.\n5. Computational Efficiency: The training stage of MORSE is computationally intensive, particularly for languages with large vocabularies. This could hinder its adoption in resource-constrained environments.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does MORSE handle ambiguous cases where multiple valid segmentations exist (e.g., \"strafed\")? Does it prioritize certain criteria over others?\n2. Could the authors elaborate on the potential for extending MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology? Are there specific challenges or directions they foresee?\n3. How does the performance of MORSE vary with different word representation models (e.g., Word2Vec vs. contextual embeddings like BERT)?\n4. Is the SD17 dataset publicly available, and if so, are there plans to extend it to other languages?\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a significant step forward in morpheme segmentation by integrating semantic information at both local and vocabulary-wide levels. The introduction of the SD17 dataset and the detailed evaluation of MORSE across multiple languages strengthen its contributions. However, limitations in handling rich and non-concatenative morphologies, as well as computational inefficiencies, leave room for improvement. Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, with potential for substantial impact on the field of morphology learning."
