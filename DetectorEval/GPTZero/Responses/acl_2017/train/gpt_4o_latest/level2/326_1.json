The authors introduce three shared-private models (parallel, stacked, and skip-layer) under a multi-task learning paradigm, where a shared layer extracts criteria-invariant features and private layers extract criteria-specific features. Additionally, an adversarial training strategy is employed to ensure the shared layer learns robust, criterion-invariant features. The paper's main contributions are:\n1. The introduction of multi-criteria learning for CWS, leveraging shared-private models to integrate multiple segmentation criteria.\n2. The application of adversarial training to enforce the separation of shared and private feature spaces, with a novel objective function.\n3. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, including both simplified and traditional Chinese corpora, demonstrating significant performance improvements over single-criterion baselines.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Scope: The paper introduces a novel adversarial multi-criteria learning framework for CWS, which is a significant step forward in leveraging heterogeneous segmentation criteria. The inclusion of adversarial training to enforce feature separation is innovative and well-motivated.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct experiments on eight diverse datasets, making this one of the most extensive evaluations in the CWS domain. The results consistently show improvements in F-measure scores, particularly for smaller datasets that benefit from shared knowledge.\n3. Practical Utility: The proposed approach has clear practical implications, as it enables the integration of heterogeneous corpora, reducing the need for expensive single-criterion annotations.\n4. Error Analysis and Insights: The error analysis and examples provided (e.g., segmentation of personal names) effectively illustrate the benefits of adversarial training in correcting criterion-specific biases.\n5. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient details on the architecture, training procedure, and hyperparameters, facilitating reproducibility.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that adversarial training provides only marginal improvements in some cases, it does not sufficiently explore why this is the case or how the approach could be further refined.\n2. Scalability Concerns: The training process, particularly with adversarial training, is computationally expensive (16 hours for eight datasets). The authors do not discuss the scalability of their approach to larger datasets or additional criteria.\n3. Comparison with Related Work: Although the paper positions itself well against prior work, the comparison with other deep learning-based multi-task approaches (e.g., Chen et al., 2016) could be more detailed, particularly in terms of performance metrics and architectural differences.\n4. Ablation Studies: While the paper evaluates the three proposed models and adversarial training, it lacks ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components (e.g., shared-private architecture vs. adversarial training).\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the performance of the proposed models vary with the size of the training datasets? For example, does adversarial training provide greater benefits for smaller datasets?\n2. Could the proposed framework be extended to other NLP tasks with heterogeneous criteria, such as part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. How sensitive are the results to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weight coefficient (位) for adversarial loss?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to multi-criteria learning for CWS, with strong empirical results and practical implications. While there are some areas for improvement, particularly in discussing limitations and scalability, the contributions are significant and relevant to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses."
