The authors propose a novel neural network model that jointly embeds textual and behavioral information to detect spam reviews from new reviewers who have limited behavioral data. The key contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Problem Identification: The paper is the first to explicitly address the cold-start problem in review spam detection, highlighting the inadequacy of traditional linguistic and behavioral features in this context.\n2. Proposed Model: A neural network model that jointly encodes textual and behavioral information into review embeddings, leveraging global behavioral patterns from existing reviewers in an unsupervised manner.\n3. Experimental Validation: The model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional features and intuitive methods across two domains (hotel and restaurant), with significant improvements in F1-score and accuracy.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty: The paper tackles a unique and practically important problem that has not been addressed in prior work. The proposed approach is innovative in combining textual and behavioral information for cold-start scenarios.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct extensive experiments on a public Yelp dataset, comparing their model against traditional features and intuitive baselines. The results are statistically significant and demonstrate clear improvements in both F1-score and accuracy.\n3. Domain Adaptability: The model performs well across two distinct domains (hotel and restaurant), indicating its potential for broader applicability.\n4. Unsupervised Learning: The use of unsupervised methods to encode global behavioral information is a strength, as it reduces reliance on labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges the challenges of the cold-start problem, it does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations of the proposed model, such as its reliance on the quality and representativeness of existing review data.\n2. Interpretability: The neural network model, while effective, lacks interpretability. The paper could benefit from a discussion on how the embeddings capture specific behavioral or textual patterns indicative of spam.\n3. Generalization to Other Platforms: The experiments are conducted solely on the Yelp dataset. It is unclear how well the model would generalize to other review platforms with different user behaviors and review structures.\n4. Baseline Comparisons: While the paper compares its model to traditional features and intuitive methods, it does not benchmark against more recent state-of-the-art methods in spam detection, which could provide a stronger context for the improvements.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model handle noisy or inconsistent data in the review graph, such as mislabeled spam or incomplete reviewer profiles?\n2. Could the proposed method be extended to incorporate temporal dynamics, such as changes in reviewer behavior over time?\n3. What are the computational requirements of the model, and how scalable is it to larger datasets or other domains?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of review spam detection by addressing the cold-start problem with a novel neural network model. The experimental results are compelling, and the approach shows promise for practical applications. However, the paper could be strengthened by addressing its limitations, benchmarking against more recent methods, and providing additional insights into the interpretability and scalability of the model. Despite these weaknesses, the work is a significant step forward and merits acceptance."
