The authors propose a method to extract user-topic preferences from a large corpus of Japanese tweets using high-quality pro/con linguistic patterns and hashtags. The extracted preferences are then modeled as a user-topic matrix, which is decomposed into latent feature spaces via matrix factorization. The primary contributions of the paper are: \n1. The first attempt to model inter-topic preferences for unlimited targets using real-world data, enabling insights into user preferences across diverse topics. \n2. A demonstration that the proposed method achieves high accuracy (80â94%) in predicting missing preferences of users, particularly for less vocal users. \n3. Evidence that the latent vector representations of topics encode meaningful inter-topic preferences, validated through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. \nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper tackles a significant challenge in stance detection and social media analytics by directly modeling inter-topic preferences, a task that has not been addressed in prior work. This innovation has potential applications in public opinion surveys, election predictions, and online debates. \n2. Methodological Rigor: The use of matrix factorization to abstract user-topic preferences is well-motivated and effectively implemented. The authors carefully optimize parameters (e.g., latent dimensions) and evaluate reconstruction errors to validate their approach. \n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experimental results are robust, with both quantitative (prediction accuracy) and qualitative (crowdsourced inter-topic preference validation) analyses. The accuracy of 94% for vocal users demonstrates the method's practical utility. \n4. Scalability: The approach is scalable, leveraging a large corpus of over 35 billion tweets, and is adaptable to other languages and datasets. \n5. Real-world Applicability: The paper highlights practical applications of the model, such as bridging gaps between vocal and ordinary users, and provides examples of inter-topic preferences that align with commonsense knowledge. \nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization: The study is conducted exclusively on Japanese tweets, which may limit its generalizability to other languages or cultural contexts. While the authors claim the method is language-agnostic, no experiments are conducted to validate this. \n2. Sparse Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not adequately address potential limitations, such as biases introduced by the reliance on hashtags or the manual selection of linguistic patterns. These factors may affect the quality of extracted preferences. \n3. Crowdsourcing Evaluation: The evaluation of inter-topic preferences using crowdsourcing is subjective and lacks a clear benchmark. While the Spearman correlation is moderate (Ď = 0.22), the paper does not explore why the correlation is not stronger. \n4. Over-reliance on Matrix Factorization: The paper does not compare matrix factorization with alternative methods, such as neural embeddings or graph-based approaches, which could potentially yield better results. \n5. Reproducibility Concerns: While the methodology is described in detail, the paper does not provide access to the dataset or code, which may hinder reproducibility. \nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered applying your method to datasets in other languages to validate its generalizability? \n2. How do you ensure that the manually selected linguistic patterns are exhaustive and unbiased? \n3. Could alternative methods, such as neural embeddings or graph-based models, improve the performance of inter-topic preference modeling? \n4. What measures are in place to mitigate the potential biases introduced by the reliance on hashtags? \nAdditional Comments\nThe paper presents a promising approach to modeling inter-topic preferences and demonstrates its utility in real-world applications. However, addressing the concerns regarding generalizability, limitations, and alternative methods could strengthen the work further. Encouragingly, the paper lays a solid foundation for future research in this area. \nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions."
