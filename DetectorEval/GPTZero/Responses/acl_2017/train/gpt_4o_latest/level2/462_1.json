It introduces a novel approach that leverages Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models extended with word embeddings to improve sentiment analysis. Additionally, the paper explores methods for fusing textual features with factual market data, such as GARCH models and historical volatility, to enhance prediction accuracy. The authors also analyze sector-specific characteristics in the reports and their impact on volatility prediction. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both text-only and text-plus-market feature settings.\nMain Contributions\n1. Enhanced Sentiment Analysis with Word Embeddings: The paper introduces an innovative extension to IR term weighting models by incorporating word embeddings, which significantly improves prediction accuracy over existing sentiment analysis methods.\n2. Fusion of Textual and Market Data: The study proposes and evaluates multiple fusion methods (early fusion, stacking, and MKL) to combine textual features with market data, demonstrating the superiority of the stacking approach.\n3. Sector-Specific Analysis: The paper provides a detailed analysis of sector-specific risk factors and their influence on volatility prediction, highlighting the potential for domain-specific insights despite data limitations.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of Approach: The integration of word embeddings into IR term weighting models is a notable innovation that improves sentiment analysis performance. The method is well-motivated and supported by extensive experiments.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates its methods rigorously using multiple baselines, including state-of-the-art approaches, and demonstrates consistent improvements in prediction accuracy.\n3. Practical Relevance: The fusion of textual and market data addresses a real-world challenge in financial volatility prediction, and the results suggest that the proposed method is both effective and generalizable.\n4. Sector-Level Insights: The analysis of sector-specific characteristics provides valuable insights into the unique risk factors of different industries, which could inform future research and applications.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Sector-Specific Model Performance: While the paper identifies sector-specific risk factors, the sector-specific models underperform compared to the general model due to data limitations. This limitation is acknowledged, but the paper could have explored alternative approaches to mitigate the issue, such as transfer learning or data augmentation.\n2. Computational Complexity of MKL: The MKL method, while explored, is computationally expensive and underperforms compared to stacking. The paper could have provided more discussion on the trade-offs between computational cost and performance.\n3. Ambiguity in Keyword Analysis: The discussion of ambiguous terms (e.g., \"fire\" and \"beneficial\") is insightful but lacks a systematic approach to resolving such ambiguities. Incorporating contextual word embeddings or domain-specific disambiguation methods could strengthen this aspect.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could transfer learning or domain adaptation techniques be used to improve the performance of sector-specific models with limited data?\n2. How does the proposed method perform on other financial text datasets (e.g., news articles or earnings call transcripts)? Would the results generalize to these contexts?\n3. Have you considered using contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) instead of static word embeddings for term weighting? If so, how do they compare?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of financial market prediction by advancing sentiment analysis techniques and exploring the integration of textual and market data. While some limitations remain, the work is well-executed and provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. Encouraging further exploration of sector-specific models and contextual embeddings could enhance the impact of this research."
