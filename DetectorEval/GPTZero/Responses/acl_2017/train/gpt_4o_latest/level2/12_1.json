            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents SynTime, a novel rule-based time expression tagger that leverages syntactic types and heuristic rules to recognize time expressions in free text. The authors analyze time expressions across four datasets (TimeBank, Gigaword, WikiWars, and Tweets) and identify key observations: time expressions are short, use a small vocabulary, and exhibit consistent syntactic behavior. Based on these insights, SynTime defines three main syntactic types (time token, modifier, numeral) and applies heuristic rules to identify and merge time segments into time expressions. The proposed system is lightweight, expandable, and capable of real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SynTime outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (HeidelTime, SUTime, UWTime) on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in recall and performance on informal text like tweets.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. A detailed analysis of time expressions across datasets, providing evidence for the principle of least effort in language use.\n2. The introduction of SynTime, a type-based approach to time expression recognition, which simplifies rule-based taggers using syntactic types and heuristic boundary expansion.\n3. Comprehensive experiments showing SynTime's superior performance, especially in recall, across diverse datasets.\n---\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Simplicity: The paper introduces a novel type-based approach that departs from traditional semantic-based rule systems. The use of syntactic types and heuristic rules is a fresh perspective that simplifies the design of rule-based taggers.\n2. Strong Experimental Results: SynTime achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, particularly excelling in recall and handling informal text (tweets). The high recall rates (above 92% in relaxed match) highlight the robustness of the system.\n3. Practicality and Expandability: SynTime is lightweight, runs in real time, and is easily expandable by adding keywords for domain-specific text. This makes it highly practical for real-world applications.\n4. Thorough Analysis: The authors provide a detailed analysis of time expressions, offering valuable insights into their structure and behavior across datasets. This analysis strengthens the motivation for the proposed approach.\n5. Clear Presentation: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology, observations, and experimental setup.\n---\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Handling of Ambiguities: SynTime relies heavily on tokenization and POS tagging, which are prone to errors, especially in noisy text. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not propose strategies to mitigate it.\n2. Domain-Specific Expansion: While SynTime is expandable, the manual addition of keywords for domain-specific text (e.g., WikiWars) may limit scalability in highly diverse or evolving domains.\n3. Comparison with Machine Learning Methods: Although SynTime outperforms machine learning-based methods like UWTime, the paper does not explore hybrid approaches that combine rule-based and machine learning techniques, which could further improve performance.\n4. Normalization Exclusion: The paper focuses solely on time expression recognition and does not address normalization, which is a critical aspect of downstream applications. A brief discussion on how SynTime could integrate normalization would enhance its completeness.\n---\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does SynTime handle ambiguous tokens (e.g., \"May\" as a month vs. a modal verb) in cases where POS tagging fails? Are there fallback mechanisms?\n2. Could you elaborate on the computational efficiency of SynTime compared to baselines, particularly in large-scale datasets?\n3. Have you considered integrating SynTime with machine learning models to address its limitations in handling ambiguous or descriptive time expressions?\n---\nConclusion\nOverall, this paper presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to time expression recognition. SynTime's simplicity, expandability, and strong performance make it a valuable contribution to the field. While there are some limitations, such as reliance on tokenization and manual expansion, these do not overshadow the practical utility and novelty of the proposed method. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses and provide additional clarity on scalability and hybrid approaches."
