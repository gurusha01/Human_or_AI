            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions \nThis paper presents a novel method for automatically annotating unannotated Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) system outputs with error type information. The authors propose a two-step approach: (1) extracting edits between original and corrected sentences using a linguistically-enhanced alignment algorithm, and (2) classifying these edits using a dataset-independent, rule-based framework. The key contribution is the development of a deterministic, dataset-agnostic error classification system that bypasses the limitations of machine learning-based classifiers, such as dependency on training data and lack of transparency. The authors validate their method through a manual evaluation, achieving over 95% agreement on error type appropriateness, and apply it to the CoNLL-2014 shared task outputs to provide the first detailed error type analysis of GEC systems. The tool developed in this study is also made publicly available, which adds practical value to the research.\nStrengths \n1. Novelty and Practical Utility: The dataset-independent, rule-based classifier is a significant innovation, addressing the limitations of machine learning approaches in GEC. The method's transparency and reproducibility make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners. \n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct a detailed analysis of CoNLL-2014 outputs, offering insights into system performance across error types. This analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, providing actionable insights for future research. \n3. High Agreement in Validation: The manual evaluation of the classifier demonstrates strong inter-rater agreement, with over 95% of error types rated as \"Good\" or \"Acceptable.\" This validates the reliability of the proposed method. \n4. Public Availability of the Tool: By releasing the tool, the authors ensure that their work can be widely adopted and extended by the research community, enhancing its impact. \nWeaknesses \n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge that their method depends on the accuracy of automatic linguistic mark-up tools (e.g., POS taggers), they do not explore the potential impact of these errors in detail or propose mitigation strategies. \n2. Evaluation Scope: The manual evaluation of the classifier is limited to 200 edits, which may not fully capture the variability of GEC errors across diverse datasets. A larger-scale evaluation would strengthen the claims of generalizability. \n3. Complexity of Error Categories: The framework includes 25 error types with multiple subcategories, which, while comprehensive, may be overly complex for practical use in some scenarios. Simplifying or prioritizing key categories could improve usability. \n4. Focus on CoNLL-2014: The analysis is restricted to CoNLL-2014 outputs, which, while significant, may not represent the broader landscape of GEC systems. Applying the method to other datasets would demonstrate its robustness and generalizability. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. How does the performance of the rule-based classifier compare to state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers on a larger-scale evaluation? \n2. Have you considered the impact of errors in linguistic mark-up tools on the overall accuracy of the framework? Are there plans to address this? \n3. Could the proposed framework be simplified or adapted for real-time applications, such as educational tools or writing assistants? \nConclusion \nThis paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of GEC by introducing a dataset-independent, rule-based error classification framework and providing detailed insights into system performance. While there are some limitations in evaluation scope and discussion of potential weaknesses, the proposed method is robust, practical, and impactful. I encourage the authors to address the identified weaknesses and consider extending their analysis to other datasets. This work has significant potential to advance error analysis in GEC and should be of interest to the research community."
