The task requires identifying the most appropriate caption for an image from a set of similar options, including adversarially-generated decoys. The authors present several contributions: (1) an algorithm to generate challenging decoys, (2) a large-scale dataset (MCIC) derived from the COCO dataset, (3) human performance benchmarks on the task, (4) baseline and competitive learning models for the task, and (5) evidence that DMC performance correlates positively with related tasks like image captioning. The paper also proposes a multi-task learning model (Vec2seq+FFNN) that achieves state-of-the-art results on the DMC task while improving image captioning performance.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of the Task: The DMC task fills a gap in multi-modal research by focusing on the alignment of visual and textual representations. Unlike existing tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering, DMC emphasizes deeper semantic understanding and cross-modal reasoning.\n2. Dataset Contribution: The MCIC dataset is a significant contribution to the field, offering a large-scale, publicly available benchmark for multi-modal comprehension. The use of adversarial decoys makes the dataset particularly challenging and valuable for future research.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed models and the positive correlation between DMC performance and image captioning. The multi-task learning approach is well-motivated and empirically validated.\n4. Human Benchmarking: The inclusion of human performance results establishes an upper bound for the task and highlights the gap between human and machine comprehension, which is critical for contextualizing the results.\n5. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient details about the dataset generation process, model architectures, and evaluation metrics, making it easier for researchers to reproduce and build upon the work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Model Diversity: While the paper evaluates several baseline and neural network models, it does not explore transformer-based architectures, which are state-of-the-art in both vision and language tasks. This omission limits the scope of the empirical analysis.\n2. Decoy Generation Algorithm: The decoy generation relies heavily on paragraph vector embeddings and BLEU scores, which may not fully capture semantic nuances. More sophisticated techniques, such as transformer-based embeddings, could improve decoy quality.\n3. Evaluation Metrics: The paper primarily uses accuracy for the DMC task and CIDEr/ROUGE for captioning. Additional metrics, such as precision/recall for classification or SPICE for captioning, could provide a more nuanced evaluation.\n4. Generalization to Other Datasets: The paper focuses exclusively on the COCO dataset. It is unclear how well the proposed task and models generalize to other datasets or domains, such as medical imaging or autonomous driving.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered using transformer-based models (e.g., Vision-Language Transformers) for the DMC task? If not, what challenges do you foresee in adapting such models?\n2. How does the quality of decoys impact model performance? Have you conducted ablation studies to evaluate the effect of different decoy generation strategies?\n3. Can the proposed DMC task and dataset be extended to other domains, such as video understanding or specialized fields like medical imaging?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is a strong contribution to the multi-modal AI community, introducing a novel task and dataset with clear practical implications. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly by incorporating transformer-based models and exploring generalization to other datasets, could further strengthen the work. Overall, the paper is well-written, methodologically sound, and provides a solid foundation for future research in multi-modal comprehension."
