            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) through automated analysis of speech transcripts, using complex network (CN) features enriched with word embeddings. The authors propose a lightweight, language-independent approach that avoids the need for manual preprocessing, such as correcting disfluencies in transcripts. The study evaluates the proposed method on three datasets in English and Portuguese, demonstrating that CN features outperform traditional linguistic metrics in distinguishing MCI patients from healthy controls. Additionally, the paper explores ensemble and multi-view learning approaches, achieving up to a 10% improvement in accuracy on the Cinderella dataset and 80% accuracy on the Arizona dataset. The authors claim this is the first application of CN metrics to MCI detection in speech transcripts.\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n1. Novel Use of Complex Networks for MCI Detection: The paper introduces CN metrics enriched with word embeddings as a robust and scalable alternative to traditional linguistic features.\n2. Language Independence: The proposed method is designed to work across languages without requiring extensive linguistic resources or manual preprocessing.\n3. Improved Classification Accuracy: The ensemble and multi-view learning approaches improve performance, particularly on the Cinderella and Arizona datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Methodology: The use of CN features enriched with word embeddings is novel in the context of MCI detection and offers a scalable solution for analyzing disfluent speech transcripts.\n2. Language Independence: The method's applicability to both English and Portuguese datasets demonstrates its versatility and potential for broader adoption.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper evaluates the proposed approach on three distinct datasets, providing strong evidence of its effectiveness. The results consistently show that CN features outperform traditional linguistic metrics, particularly when combined with ensemble and multi-view learning.\n4. Automation: The approach eliminates the need for manual preprocessing, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n5. Comparison with Baselines: The authors compare their method with linguistic and Bag-of-Words features, providing a clear understanding of its relative strengths.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Dataset Size: The datasets used in the study are relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Larger, more diverse datasets would strengthen the claims.\n2. Insufficient Discussion of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge the need for publicly available datasets, they do not discuss other potential limitations, such as the impact of demographic factors or variability in speech patterns across populations.\n3. Complexity of Multi-View Learning: While the multi-view learning approach improves accuracy, its complexity and computational cost are not adequately discussed, which may hinder practical adoption.\n4. Lack of Interpretability: The paper does not provide insights into which specific CN metrics or word embeddings contribute most to the classification, limiting the interpretability of the results.\n5. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: Although the results are promising, the paper does not compare its method with other state-of-the-art approaches for MCI detection, which would provide a clearer benchmark.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the method handle variability in speech patterns across different demographics, such as age, education, or cultural background?\n2. Could you provide more details on the computational cost of the multi-view learning approach and its scalability to larger datasets?\n3. Which specific CN metrics or word embeddings were most influential in improving classification accuracy?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper presents a promising approach to MCI detection, leveraging complex networks and word embeddings. However, addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly the dataset size and interpretability, would enhance its impact. Encouragingly, the method shows potential for real-world applications, and further validation on larger datasets is recommended."
