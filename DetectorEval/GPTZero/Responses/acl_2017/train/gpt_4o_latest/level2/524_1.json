            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of incomplete coverage in parsing with Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) systems, specifically focusing on the English Resource Grammar (ERG). The authors propose and evaluate several robust parsing techniques, including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches, to mitigate coverage gaps. The paper also introduces a methodology for evaluating robust parsing techniques, particularly in scenarios where gold-standard annotations are unavailable. The primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Techniques for Robust Parsing: The paper evaluates five approaches for enhancing coverage in HPSG parsing, including novel hybrid methods that combine precision grammar with PCFG-based approximations.\n2. Evaluation Methodology: The authors propose a systematic intrinsic evaluation framework using datasets specifically designed to test robust parsing methods.\n3. Empirical Results: The paper provides a detailed comparison of coverage, parsing speed, and semantic accuracy (EDM F1 scores) across multiple datasets, highlighting trade-offs between coverage and accuracy.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates multiple robust parsing techniques across diverse datasets, providing a thorough analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. The use of both intrinsic metrics (e.g., EDM F1) and coverage statistics is commendable.\n2. Novel Hybrid Approach: The hybrid methods, particularly hybrid-ww, demonstrate strong performance in terms of both coverage and accuracy, representing a significant improvement over baseline ERG parsing.\n3. Practical Relevance: The work addresses a critical limitation of HPSG systems\"\"coverage gaps\"\"and proposes solutions that could be directly useful for downstream applications requiring robust parsing.\n4. Clear Methodology: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, parsing techniques, and evaluation metrics, ensuring reproducibility and clarity.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Extrinsic Evaluation: While the intrinsic evaluation is robust, the lack of extrinsic evaluation on downstream tasks limits the ability to assess the practical utility of the proposed techniques in real-world applications.\n2. Ambiguity Management: Techniques like bridging and Pacman suffer from high ambiguity, which leads to resource exhaustion and lower coverage on certain datasets. The paper does not explore strategies to mitigate this issue effectively.\n3. Speed vs. Accuracy Trade-off: The hybrid-ww system achieves the best overall performance but is computationally expensive, making it less practical for time-sensitive applications. The paper could benefit from a deeper discussion of how to balance these trade-offs.\n4. Dataset Limitations: The alchemy45 dataset, while valuable for testing robust parsing, is small and may not provide reliable generalizations. The authors acknowledge this but do not propose solutions to address the dataset's limitations.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered incorporating extrinsic evaluation on downstream tasks (e.g., information extraction or machine translation) to validate the utility of the proposed techniques?\n2. Could the ambiguity introduced by bridging and Pacman be mitigated through improved statistical ranking models or other disambiguation techniques?\n3. How do you envision adapting the hybrid methods for real-time or resource-constrained applications, given their computational overhead?\nOverall Assessment\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of computational linguistics by addressing a critical limitation of HPSG parsing systems and proposing practical solutions. The hybrid-ww method, in particular, shows promise for improving coverage and accuracy, albeit at a computational cost. While the lack of extrinsic evaluation and ambiguity management strategies are notable shortcomings, the paper provides a solid foundation for future work in robust parsing. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above."
