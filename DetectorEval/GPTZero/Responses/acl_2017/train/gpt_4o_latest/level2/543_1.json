            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for character-level compositional embeddings using visual features derived from character images processed through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The authors argue that in logographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the meaning of characters often derives from their visual components, which are ignored by traditional embedding methods. The proposed method generates embeddings by rendering characters as images and using CNNs to extract visual features, which are then integrated into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for downstream tasks such as text classification. The main contributions of the paper are:\n1. A new approach to character embeddings that leverages visual information, enabling better handling of rare characters.\n2. A dataset of Wikipedia article titles in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, designed to evaluate the compositionality of character embeddings.\n3. Empirical results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method for rare characters and low-resource scenarios, as well as its complementarity with traditional lookup embeddings.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The paper tackles an underexplored problem of character-level compositionality in logographic languages, presenting a novel solution that generalizes across multiple languages. This is particularly relevant for tasks involving rare or unseen characters.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, with evaluations on multiple datasets and tasks. The results convincingly show that the proposed method outperforms traditional embeddings for rare characters and low-resource scenarios.\n3. Qualitative Analysis: The visualization of embeddings and heatmaps showing the contribution of different character parts provide strong qualitative evidence for the interpretability and effectiveness of the model.\n4. Complementary Fusion Methods: The exploration of fusion techniques (early, late, and fallback) highlights the complementary strengths of visual and lookup embeddings, further enhancing the utility of the proposed approach.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Baseline Comparisons: The paper primarily compares the proposed method against a single baseline (lookup embeddings). Including additional baselines, such as radical-based embeddings or subword models, would strengthen the evaluation.\n2. Dataset Bias: The dataset is limited to Wikipedia titles, which may not generalize well to other domains. Additionally, the reliance on short titles may overemphasize the importance of individual characters, potentially inflating the performance gains of the proposed method.\n3. Scalability Concerns: The use of CNNs for character-level embeddings introduces computational overhead, which may not scale well for large datasets or real-time applications. This is not discussed in the paper.\n4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge that visually similar characters with different meanings may introduce noise, this limitation is not explored in depth. For example, how does the model handle homographs or polysemous characters?\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method perform on tasks beyond text classification, such as named entity recognition or machine translation?\n2. Have you considered using pre-trained CNNs for visual feature extraction to reduce computational overhead?\n3. Can the method be extended to handle polysemous characters or homographs more effectively?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and addresses a significant gap in character-level modeling for logographic languages. However, the inclusion of more diverse baselines and a broader discussion of limitations would strengthen its impact. The proposed method shows promise for applications in low-resource and historical language processing, and future work in these directions would be valuable."
