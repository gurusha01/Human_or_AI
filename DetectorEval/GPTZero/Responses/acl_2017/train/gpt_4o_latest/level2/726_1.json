            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach for rapidly building natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) that map user utterances directly to SQL queries. The method leverages neural sequence-to-sequence models, bypassing intermediate meaning representations, and employs a feedback-based learning loop to iteratively improve performance with minimal human intervention. The key contributions of this work are:\n1. Direct SQL Generation: The model directly generates SQL queries, avoiding the limitations of intermediate representations and enabling full SQL expressivity.\n2. Interactive Feedback Loop: The system incorporates user feedback to flag incorrect queries and uses crowdsourced annotations to iteratively improve the model.\n3. Data Augmentation: The authors propose schema templates and paraphrasing techniques to bootstrap the model and enhance generalization.\n4. Real-World Deployment: The approach is validated through a live deployment for an academic database, demonstrating its practicality and adaptability to new domains.\n5. New Dataset: The release of the SCHOLAR dataset, which includes natural language utterances and SQL queries for academic database search, is a valuable contribution to the community.\nStrengths\n1. Practicality and Scalability: The feedback-based learning loop and the ability to crowdsource SQL annotations make this approach practical for real-world applications. The system's adaptability to new domains is a significant strength.\n2. Direct SQL Mapping: By directly generating SQL, the method avoids the need for domain-specific engineering and intermediate representations, which are often not widely supported outside academic research.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the model on benchmark datasets (GEO880 and ATIS) and demonstrates competitive performance. The live deployment experiment further validates the approach's effectiveness.\n4. Data Augmentation Techniques: The use of schema templates and paraphrasing improves the model's performance and reduces the reliance on large labeled datasets.\n5. Open Dataset: The release of the SCHOLAR dataset and its accompanying database will likely spur further research in this area.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Neural Architecture: While the application of sequence-to-sequence models to SQL generation is effective, the neural architecture itself is not novel, as it builds on existing encoder-decoder models with attention mechanisms.\n2. Incomplete Error Analysis: The paper provides limited discussion on failure cases, particularly for complex SQL queries or queries involving aggregation. Understanding these limitations would help improve the system.\n3. Dependency on User Feedback Quality: The system's reliance on user feedback introduces potential noise, as evidenced by the 6.3% error rate in user feedback. More robust mechanisms to handle noisy feedback could strengthen the approach.\n4. Initial Performance: The system's accuracy in the initial deployment stage (25%) is relatively low, which may discourage user engagement. Strategies to improve early-stage performance could enhance usability.\n5. Evaluation Scope: While the live deployment is a strength, the evaluation is limited to a single academic domain. Broader testing across diverse domains would better demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the system handle ambiguous user queries where multiple SQL interpretations are possible?\n2. Could the schema templates be expanded or adapted dynamically based on user interactions to improve early-stage performance?\n3. What strategies could be employed to mitigate the impact of noisy user feedback on model performance?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and addresses a significant challenge in semantic parsing for NLIDBs. The combination of direct SQL generation, interactive learning, and data augmentation is compelling, and the live deployment experiment adds credibility to the approach. However, addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly in error analysis and generalizability, would further strengthen the work. Encouragingly, the release of the SCHOLAR dataset is a valuable contribution that will likely benefit the research community."
