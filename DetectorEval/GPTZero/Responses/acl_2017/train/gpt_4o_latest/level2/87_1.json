            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThe paper introduces PositionRank, a novel unsupervised graph-based algorithm for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents. The primary contribution is the integration of word position information into a biased PageRank model, which assigns higher importance to words appearing earlier in a document while also considering their frequency. The authors demonstrate that PositionRank significantly outperforms existing PageRank-based models (e.g., TextRank, SingleRank) and other strong baselines (e.g., TF-IDF, ExpandRank, TopicalPageRank) on three datasets of research papers. The reported improvements in MRR, precision, recall, and F1-score are statistically significant, with relative performance gains of up to 29.09%. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the impact of model parameters and position aggregation, establishing the robustness of the proposed approach.\nStrengths: \n1. Novelty and Innovation: \n The integration of position information into an unsupervised keyphrase extraction model is novel. Unlike prior supervised approaches that use only the first position of a word, PositionRank aggregates information from all occurrences, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving performance.\n2. Empirical Validation: \n The paper provides extensive experimental results across three datasets, showing consistent and statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. The use of multiple evaluation metrics (MRR, precision, recall, F1-score) strengthens the validity of the findings.\n3. Practical Utility: \n By relying solely on the target document without requiring external resources (e.g., training data or topic models), PositionRank is computationally efficient and easily adaptable to other domains. This makes it highly practical for real-world applications such as document indexing and retrieval.\n4. Clarity and Reproducibility: \n The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The detailed description of PositionRank's algorithm and parameters facilitates reproducibility.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Scope of Evaluation: \n The experiments focus exclusively on research papers. While the authors suggest potential applicability to other document types (e.g., web pages, emails), no empirical evidence is provided to support this claim. A broader evaluation would strengthen the paper's impact.\n2. Comparison with Supervised Methods: \n The paper does not compare PositionRank with recent supervised keyphrase extraction methods. Although the focus is on unsupervised approaches, including such comparisons would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of PositionRank's effectiveness.\n3. Scalability Analysis: \n While the computational efficiency of PositionRank is implied, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of its scalability to larger datasets or documents with significantly longer text (e.g., full-length papers or books).\n4. Position Weighting Justification: \n The choice of inverse position weighting (e.g., summing 1/position) is intuitive but lacks theoretical justification or comparison with alternative weighting schemes. This could be explored further.\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. Have you considered evaluating PositionRank on non-scholarly datasets (e.g., news articles, emails)? If so, what challenges do you anticipate? \n2. How does PositionRank perform when applied to full-length research papers, rather than just titles and abstracts? \n3. Could alternative position weighting schemes (e.g., exponential decay) improve the model's performance? \nConclusion: \nThis paper presents a compelling and well-executed contribution to unsupervised keyphrase extraction. Despite some limitations in scope and evaluation breadth, the novelty, strong empirical results, and practical utility of PositionRank make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses."
