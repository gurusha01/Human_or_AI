            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper addresses the challenging task of evaluating creative language generation, specifically ghostwriting rap lyrics, by proposing a novel evaluation methodology. The authors make three primary contributions: (1) a comprehensive manual evaluation framework assessing fluency, coherence, and style matching, (2) an improvement to an existing semi-automated evaluation methodology by introducing entropy-weighted rhyme density to handle repetitive text, and (3) the creation of a publicly available dataset of rap lyrics from 13 artists, annotated for stylistic similarity. The authors also demonstrate the utility of their evaluation framework by analyzing the performance of an LSTM-based ghostwriting model, highlighting its strengths and limitations.\nStrengths: \n1. Comprehensive Evaluation Framework: The paper's key strength lies in its multifaceted evaluation methodology, which combines manual and automated approaches to assess fluency, coherence, and stylistic similarity. This comprehensive framework addresses a significant gap in the evaluation of creative language generation tasks.\n2. Dataset and Annotations: The creation of a publicly available dataset with stylistic annotations is a valuable contribution to the field, enabling reproducibility and fostering future research on stylistic text generation.\n3. Improved Automation: The authors enhance the semi-automatic evaluation method by introducing an entropy-weighted rhyme density metric, which effectively handles repetitive text and scales the evaluation process.\n4. Insightful Analysis: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the LSTM model's performance, revealing its ability to capture an artist's \"average\" style while exposing its limitations, such as difficulty in incorporating new vocabulary and generating coherent verses for artists with larger datasets.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Novelty in Model Evaluation: While the evaluation methodology is robust, the generative model itself (LSTM) lacks novelty, as it builds on prior work by Potash et al. (2015). The paper could have explored more advanced generative architectures, such as transformers, to provide a stronger baseline.\n2. Subjectivity in Manual Evaluation: The manual evaluation tasks, particularly style matching, rely heavily on annotator judgment, leading to relatively low inter-annotator agreement (e.g., 0.43 for coherence). While this is acknowledged, additional steps to improve agreement or reduce subjectivity would strengthen the results.\n3. Limited Generalization Beyond Rap Lyrics: Although the authors suggest that their methodology could be applied to other creative tasks, such as poetry or visual art, the paper does not provide concrete evidence or experiments to support this claim.\n4. Sparse Discussion of Ethical Implications: The paper does not address the ethical considerations of ghostwriting or the potential misuse of such generative systems, which is an important aspect of deploying creative AI systems.\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. Have you considered evaluating the LSTM model against more modern generative architectures, such as transformers, to establish a stronger baseline? \n2. Could you elaborate on how the proposed evaluation methodology might generalize to other creative tasks, such as poetry or prose generation? \n3. How do you envision addressing the ethical concerns surrounding ghostwriting, particularly in creative industries like music?\nConclusion: \nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the evaluation of creative language generation by proposing a robust and multifaceted methodology. While the generative model itself lacks novelty, the insights gained from the evaluation experiments and the publicly available dataset make this work a valuable resource for the community. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly by exploring more advanced models and reducing subjectivity in manual evaluation, could further enhance the impact of this research. I recommend this paper for acceptance, with minor revisions to address the outlined concerns."
