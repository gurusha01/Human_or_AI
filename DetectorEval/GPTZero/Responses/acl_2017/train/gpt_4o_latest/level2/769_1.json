            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel symmetric collaborative dialogue setting where two agents, each with private knowledge, must communicate strategically to identify a shared item. The authors present a new dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits rich linguistic and strategic phenomena, and propose a neural model, Dynamic Knowledge Graph Network (DynoNet), to address the challenges of this setting. DynoNet combines structured knowledge representation with unstructured language understanding by dynamically updating knowledge graph embeddings as the dialogue progresses. The paper claims three main contributions: (i) the introduction of a new dialogue setting and dataset, (ii) the development of DynoNet, which integrates structured and unstructured representations, and (iii) comprehensive evaluations using automatic and human metrics, demonstrating DynoNet's effectiveness and human-likeness compared to baseline models.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Setting and Dataset: The symmetric collaborative dialogue task is a fresh and challenging problem that bridges the gap between task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems. The dataset is large, diverse, and well-documented, providing a valuable resource for the community.\n2. Innovative Model Design: DynoNet's dynamic knowledge graph embeddings are a significant innovation, enabling the model to represent evolving dialogue states effectively. The integration of structured knowledge with neural representations is well-motivated and addresses limitations of prior approaches.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper employs both automatic and human evaluations, including partner and third-party assessments, to rigorously validate the model's performance. The analysis of linguistic phenomena and strategies further strengthens the evaluation.\n4. Practical Relevance: The proposed model and dataset have clear applications in human-computer collaboration tasks, negotiation, and other strategic dialogue scenarios, making the work highly relevant to the field.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Baseline Comparisons: While the paper compares DynoNet to a rule-based system and a static variant (StanoNet), it lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art dialogue models, such as Memory Networks or POMDP-based systems, which could provide a more comprehensive benchmark.\n2. Scalability Concerns: The reliance on dynamic knowledge graph updates may pose scalability challenges for more complex tasks or larger knowledge bases. The paper does not discuss the computational efficiency of DynoNet in detail.\n3. Dataset Limitations: Although the dataset is large, it focuses on a single task (MutualFriends), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other domains or dialogue settings.\n4. Limited Discussion of Failures: While the paper highlights DynoNet's strengths, it does not provide sufficient analysis of its failure cases or areas where it underperforms compared to humans or baselines.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does DynoNet perform when scaled to larger or more complex knowledge bases? Have you tested its computational efficiency in such scenarios?\n2. Could the dataset be extended to include other collaborative dialogue tasks to improve generalizability?\n3. How does DynoNet compare to other state-of-the-art dialogue systems, such as Memory Networks or POMDP-based approaches, in terms of performance and scalability?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of dialogue systems by introducing a novel task, dataset, and model. While there are some limitations in baseline comparisons and scalability discussions, the strengths of the work outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, as the paper is likely to stimulate further research in collaborative and strategic dialogue systems."
