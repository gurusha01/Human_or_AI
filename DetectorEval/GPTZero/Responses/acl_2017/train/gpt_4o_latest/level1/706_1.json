            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper introduces Voxelurn, a system designed to bridge the gap between natural language interfaces and programming languages for performing complex tasks. The authors propose a novel interactive language learning paradigm called \"naturalization,\" where users incrementally teach the system new syntax and concepts by defining them in terms of a core programming language. The system is seeded with a core language and evolves as users collaboratively build a shared, more expressive naturalized language. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through experiments in a voxel world, where 70 users collectively defined new language constructs and built 230 voxel structures. The results show that users increasingly preferred the naturalized language, with 74.7% of the last 10,000 accepted utterances utilizing the induced language.\nMain Contributions\n1. Interactive Language Naturalization Framework: The paper introduces a novel framework where users collaboratively evolve a programming language into a more natural and expressive interface. This approach is a significant departure from traditional semantic parsing, as it leverages user-defined definitions to directly augment the system's grammar.\n2. Community-Based Language Evolution: The system allows multiple users to simultaneously contribute to and benefit from the evolving language, demonstrating the scalability and adaptability of the approach in a collaborative setting.\n3. Empirical Validation in a Voxel World: The authors provide strong experimental evidence of the system's effectiveness, showing that users were able to create complex structures and increasingly relied on the naturalized language over time.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of the Approach: The concept of \"naturalization\" is innovative and addresses a critical gap in natural language interfaces by enabling users to actively shape the language they use. This is a fresh perspective compared to traditional semantic parsing methods.\n2. Scalability and Collaboration: The system's ability to generalize definitions across a community of users is a strong point, as it demonstrates the potential for large-scale adoption and collective language evolution.\n3. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, with clear metrics (e.g., percentage of induced rules, program length vs. utterance length) that convincingly demonstrate the system's effectiveness. The use of real-world users from Amazon Mechanical Turk adds credibility to the results.\n4. Practical Utility: The system has practical implications for a wide range of applications, such as data analysis, robot instructions, and semi-structured data querying. The discussion section effectively highlights these broader use cases.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization Beyond Voxelurn: While the authors claim the approach is generalizable, the experiments are confined to the voxel world. It would strengthen the paper to include results or simulations in other domains, such as data querying or robotics, to validate the broader applicability.\n2. Usability Concerns for Non-Technical Users: Although the system aims to make programming more accessible, the reliance on users to define new constructs might still be challenging for non-technical users. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how the system supports users with varying skill levels.\n3. Evaluation Metrics for Language Quality: While the paper tracks the adoption of induced rules and program length, it does not explicitly evaluate the quality or intuitiveness of the naturalized language. Metrics such as user satisfaction or ease of use could provide additional insights.\n4. Ambiguity in Grammar Induction: The grammar induction process, while described in detail, might lead to spurious or overly specific rules. The authors acknowledge this but do not provide quantitative evidence on how often such issues arise or how they impact user experience.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the system handle conflicting definitions provided by different users? Is there a mechanism to resolve such conflicts or prioritize certain definitions?\n2. Have you considered evaluating the system's usability with non-technical users or novices? If so, what were the results, and if not, why?\n3. Could you provide more details on the scalability of the system in larger communities? For example, how does the system perform when thousands of users are contributing simultaneously?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to interactive language learning. Addressing the weaknesses and providing additional evidence of generalizability and usability could further strengthen the submission."
