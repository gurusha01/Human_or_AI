Unlike prior work that treats utterances as independent entities, the proposed method models the temporal relations between utterances, thereby improving sentiment classification. The framework incorporates textual, audio, and visual modalities, and employs both hierarchical and non-hierarchical fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration. Experimental results demonstrate a 5-10% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (MOSI, MOUD, and IEMOCAP) under speaker-independent settings.\nMain Contributions\n1. Contextual Modeling of Utterances: The primary contribution is the introduction of a contextual LSTM framework that models interdependencies among utterances within a video. This approach addresses a significant gap in the literature, where utterances are often treated independently, and demonstrates improved performance in sentiment classification tasks.\n2. Hierarchical Fusion Framework: The hierarchical fusion strategy, which combines contextual unimodal features before multimodal integration, is another notable contribution. This approach outperforms non-hierarchical fusion and demonstrates the importance of context-sensitive unimodal features in multimodal sentiment analysis.\n3. Speaker-Independent Evaluation: The paper emphasizes the robustness of the proposed method by evaluating it under speaker-independent settings, a challenging yet realistic scenario often overlooked in prior work.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Performance Gains: The proposed method achieves substantial improvements (5-10%) over state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in speaker-independent settings, which underscores its practical applicability.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple datasets (MOSI, MOUD, and IEMOCAP) and modalities (text, audio, visual). The inclusion of cross-dataset evaluations further highlights the model's generalizability.\n3. Novel Contextual Framework: The use of LSTMs to capture contextual dependencies among utterances is a meaningful advancement in multimodal sentiment analysis, addressing a critical limitation of prior methods.\n4. Qualitative Analysis: The paper provides insightful qualitative examples that illustrate the strengths and limitations of different modalities, adding depth to the evaluation.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the contextual LSTM framework is effective, it primarily builds on well-established techniques (e.g., LSTMs, hierarchical fusion). The novelty lies more in the application and integration rather than in the underlying methodology.\n2. Lack of Attention Mechanism: The absence of an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of utterances or modalities is a missed opportunity, especially given the paper's focus on context. This could address cases where irrelevant or weakly contextual utterances negatively influence predictions.\n3. Cross-Lingual Limitations: The cross-dataset evaluation (MOSI â ' MOUD) reveals poor performance for textual and audio modalities due to language differences. While this is acknowledged, the paper does not propose solutions for handling cross-lingual scenarios, which limits its applicability in multilingual settings.\n4. Insufficient Discussion on Computational Efficiency: The paper does not discuss the computational overhead introduced by the hierarchical LSTM framework, which may be a concern for real-time applications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed framework handle cases where the context is ambiguous or contradictory across utterances? Would an attention mechanism improve performance in such cases?\n2. Can the hierarchical framework be extended to incorporate cross-lingual embeddings or translation mechanisms to improve performance in multilingual datasets like MOUD?\n3. What is the computational cost of the hierarchical LSTM framework compared to non-contextual baselines? Is it feasible for real-time sentiment analysis applications?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework. However, incorporating an attention mechanism and addressing cross-lingual challenges could further enhance its impact."
