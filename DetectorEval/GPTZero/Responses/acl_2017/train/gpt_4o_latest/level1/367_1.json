The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 21 metrics across three datasets and systems, revealing that existing metrics correlate poorly with human judgments, particularly at the sentence level. They identify key issues, such as scale mismatches and dataset/system-specific metric performance. The proposed RAINBOW metric achieves significantly higher correlations with human judgments (up to Ď = 0.81) compared to existing metrics (maximum Ď = 0.33). The paper also provides a detailed error analysis and makes its code and data publicly available.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. RAINBOW Metric: The introduction of a combined metric that significantly improves sentence-level correlation with human judgments, leveraging ensemble learning to integrate WBMs and GBMs.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: A large-scale comparison of 21 metrics, including novel grammar-based metrics, across multiple datasets and systems, highlighting their limitations and dataset/system-specific behavior.\n3. Error Analysis: A detailed exploration of why existing metrics fail, identifying issues such as scale mismatches, the influence of dataset characteristics, and the quality of training data.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Metric with Strong Performance: The proposed RAINBOW metric demonstrates a significant improvement in correlation with human judgments, addressing a critical gap in NLG evaluation. Its robust performance across datasets and systems is a major strength.\n2. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of existing metrics, including both word-based and grammar-based approaches, offering valuable insights into their limitations.\n3. Error Analysis and Practical Insights: The detailed error analysis identifies key issues, such as the inability of metrics to handle outputs of medium quality and the influence of dataset-specific factors. These findings are actionable and relevant for future research.\n4. Reproducibility: By making the code and data publicly available, the authors ensure that their work can be easily reproduced and extended by the research community.\n5. Broader Implications: The study highlights the need for more robust and generalizable evaluation metrics, which has implications beyond NLG, extending to related fields like machine translation and dialogue systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization of RAINBOW: While RAINBOW performs well, it relies on a large number of features, which may limit its scalability and applicability in real-time or resource-constrained settings. The reduced Top5 model, while more efficient, sacrifices some performance.\n2. Dependence on Human References: Despite its improvements, RAINBOW still relies on human-generated references, which can be noisy and inconsistent. The paper does not explore reference-less evaluation approaches in depth, which could be a promising direction.\n3. Evaluation Scope: The evaluation focuses primarily on sentence-level correlations. While this is a critical issue, the paper could have explored extrinsic evaluation metrics, such as task success in dialogue systems, to provide a more holistic view of metric performance.\n4. Complexity of RAINBOW: The ensemble learning approach, while effective, adds computational complexity compared to simpler metrics like BLEU or ROUGE. This may limit its adoption in certain applications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the RAINBOW metric perform in extrinsic evaluations, such as task success in dialogue systems or user satisfaction?\n2. Have you considered incorporating reference-less evaluation methods into RAINBOW, and if so, how might this impact its performance?\n3. Could the RAINBOW metric be adapted for real-time evaluation scenarios, and what trade-offs might this entail?\nAdditional Comments\nThis paper addresses a critical issue in NLG evaluation and presents a well-justified, innovative solution. While there are some limitations, the contributions are significant, and the work is likely to have a substantial impact on the field."
