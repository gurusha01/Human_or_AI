            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of generating diverse and meaningful responses in open-domain conversational systems, a known limitation of neural encoder-decoder models. The authors propose a novel framework based on Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to model discourse-level diversity by introducing latent variables that capture conversational intents. The key contributions of the paper are:\n1. Novel CVAE-based Dialog Model: The paper introduces a CVAE-based dialog model that captures discourse-level variations, enabling the generation of diverse responses using only greedy decoders. This is a significant improvement over prior work that focused on word-level diversity.\n \n2. Knowledge-Guided CVAE (kgCVAE): The authors extend the CVAE framework by integrating linguistic prior knowledge, such as dialog acts, into the model. This enhances both performance and interpretability, offering a more structured approach to response generation.\n3. Bag-of-Word Loss for Training: A novel auxiliary loss function is proposed to address the vanishing latent variable problem, a common issue in training VAEs for natural language generation. This method is shown to improve the optimization process and ensure meaningful latent representations.\nStrengths\n1. Discourse-Level Diversity: The paper makes a compelling case for modeling one-to-many relationships in dialog generation, demonstrating that the proposed CVAE and kgCVAE models outperform baseline encoder-decoder models in generating diverse and contextually appropriate responses.\n \n2. Integration of Linguistic Knowledge: The kgCVAE model's ability to incorporate dialog acts as explicit features is a notable strength. This not only improves response quality but also makes the model outputs more interpretable and controllable, addressing a key limitation in neural dialog systems.\n3. Effective Training Techniques: The introduction of the bag-of-word loss is a novel and practical solution to the vanishing latent variable problem. The experiments convincingly show that this approach leads to better latent variable utilization and improved performance.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors employ both quantitative and qualitative analyses, including metrics like BLEU, bag-of-word embeddings, and dialog act match, to evaluate the models. The use of multiple reference responses and entropy-based analysis adds depth to the evaluation.\n5. Promising Future Directions: The paper outlines clear extensions of the proposed framework, such as capturing other linguistic phenomena (e.g., sentiment, named entities) and using the recognition network for dialog management, indicating the broader applicability of the work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in CVAE Application: While the adaptation of CVAE to dialog generation is well-executed, the use of CVAE itself is not entirely novel. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with prior CVAE-based dialog models to highlight its unique contributions.\n2. Scalability of Linguistic Features: The reliance on manually extracted linguistic features (e.g., dialog acts) raises concerns about scalability to other datasets or domains where such annotations may not be readily available. The authors could discuss potential solutions, such as unsupervised feature extraction.\n3. Evaluation Limitations: Although the authors attempt to address the lack of multiple references in dialog evaluation, the reliance on automatically retrieved and filtered candidate responses introduces potential noise. A more robust human evaluation of the generated responses would strengthen the claims.\n4. Generality of Bag-of-Word Loss: While the bag-of-word loss is effective in this context, its generalizability to other tasks or datasets is not explored. Additional experiments on diverse datasets would provide stronger evidence of its utility.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed kgCVAE model perform on datasets with limited or noisy dialog act annotations? Could the model adapt to such scenarios without significant performance degradation?\n2. Have you considered alternative methods for mitigating the vanishing latent variable problem, such as hierarchical latent structures or attention mechanisms? How do these compare to the bag-of-word loss?\n3. Can the proposed framework be extended to incorporate multimodal inputs (e.g., visual or audio cues) for dialog generation? If so, what modifications would be required?\nConclusion\nOverall, this paper presents a well-motivated and technically sound approach to improving response diversity in open-domain dialog systems. The integration of linguistic knowledge and the novel training techniques are particularly noteworthy. While there are some concerns about scalability and novelty, the contributions are significant enough to warrant acceptance. The work provides a solid foundation for future research in diverse and interpretable dialog generation."
