            "inputText": "Review of Submission\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper presents a novel approach to automatically annotate Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) system outputs with error type information, addressing a long-standing limitation in the field where system outputs lack detailed error type annotations. The authors propose a two-step pipeline: (1) extracting edits between original and corrected sentences using a linguistically-enhanced alignment algorithm, and (2) classifying these edits into error types using a rule-based, dataset-independent framework. The approach is validated through a manual evaluation, achieving high accuracy (95% of error types rated as \"Good\" or \"Acceptable\"). The authors apply their method to the CoNLL-2014 shared task outputs, providing the first detailed error type analysis of GEC systems. The tool developed for this purpose is also made publicly available.\nMain Contributions\n1. Rule-Based Error Type Classification Framework: The primary contribution is a dataset-independent, rule-based framework for classifying grammatical errors. Unlike machine learning-based approaches, this method does not require labeled training data, making it generalizable across datasets. It also ensures transparency and consistency in error classification.\n2. Detailed Error Type Analysis of GEC Systems: By applying their method to CoNLL-2014 shared task outputs, the authors provide the first comprehensive evaluation of system performance across 25 error types, revealing strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.\n3. Public Release of Annotation Tool: The authors contribute to the research community by releasing their annotation tool, which can standardize evaluation practices and facilitate further research in GEC.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Practical Utility: The proposed framework addresses a critical gap in GEC evaluation by enabling detailed error type analysis without requiring labeled training data. This is a significant step forward for the field.\n2. High Classification Accuracy: The manual evaluation demonstrates that the rule-based classifier is robust, with over 95% of error types rated as \"Good\" or \"Acceptable.\" This validates the efficacy of the approach.\n3. Comprehensive Analysis: The application of the method to CoNLL-2014 outputs provides valuable insights into system performance, highlighting complementary strengths of different approaches and identifying areas for improvement.\n4. Transparency and Reproducibility: The rule-based nature of the classifier ensures interpretability, and the public release of the tool promotes reproducibility and broader adoption.\n5. Separation of Alignment and Evaluation: The authors' decision to treat edit extraction and evaluation as separate tasks is methodologically sound and avoids biases introduced by dynamic edit boundary prediction in existing metrics like the M2 scorer.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Comparison with Existing Metrics: While the authors critique the M2 scorer, a more thorough quantitative comparison between their method and existing metrics would strengthen the paper. For example, demonstrating how their method aligns with or diverges from M2 scores across various systems would provide additional validation.\n2. Error Propagation from Preprocessing Tools: The reliance on automatic POS tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing introduces potential sources of error. While the authors acknowledge this, a deeper analysis of how such errors impact overall performance would be beneficial.\n3. Scalability to Larger Datasets: The paper does not discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed method, particularly for large-scale datasets. This could be a concern for practical deployment.\n4. Limited Exploration of Multi-Token Edits: The analysis of multi-token edits is relatively brief, despite their importance for fluency corrections. A more detailed investigation into why systems struggle with these edits would be valuable.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does your method compare quantitatively with existing metrics like the M2 scorer across a broader range of datasets and systems?\n2. Can you provide more details on the computational efficiency of your approach? How does it scale to larger datasets?\n3. Have you considered incorporating strategies to mitigate errors introduced by preprocessing tools (e.g., POS tagging errors)?\n4. Could your framework be extended to handle more complex error types, such as those involving semantic or discourse-level corrections?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of GEC by introducing a robust, dataset-independent framework for error type classification and providing the first detailed analysis of system performance across error types. While there are some limitations regarding scalability and comparison with existing metrics, the strengths of the approach, particularly its transparency, accuracy, and practical utility, make it a valuable addition to the GEC research community. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses and questions."
