            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary\nThis paper addresses the task of lexical substitution (lexsub), proposing a novel method to improve substitute rankings by integrating word sense inventories. The authors introduce a multi-view clustering approach to generate substitutable sense clusters from the Paraphrase Database (PPDB). These clusters are designed to enhance lexical substitution rankings when applied as a filter over existing vector- and embedding-based models. The authors evaluate their method using the CoInCo dataset and demonstrate improvements in substitutability metrics and lexical substitution performance.\nContributions\n1. Multi-View Clustering for Substitutability: The primary contribution is the introduction of a multi-view clustering algorithm that incorporates multiple representations of paraphrase similarity, including contextual substitutability, paraphrase similarity, WordNet synsets, and shared translations. This approach generates sense clusters that are more substitutable and coherent than existing sense inventories.\n2. Sense Filtering for Lexical Substitution: The paper demonstrates how the generated sense clusters can be used as a filter to improve the rankings of existing lexsub models. The authors conduct both oracle and practical experiments to show the effectiveness of this filtering approach.\n3. Evaluation of Substitutability: The authors propose an extended B-Cubed F-Score metric to evaluate the substitutability of sense inventories, providing a robust framework for assessing the quality of sense clusters in the context of lexical substitution.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of the Clustering Approach: The multi-view clustering method is well-motivated and effectively integrates diverse sources of information to create substitutable sense clusters. The inclusion of substitutability as a key criterion is a significant advancement over prior clustering methods.\n2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides comprehensive experiments, including oracle and practical evaluations, to demonstrate the utility of the proposed sense clusters in improving lexical substitution rankings. The results consistently show improvements over baseline models and existing sense inventories.\n3. Scalability and Generalizability: The proposed method is scalable, leveraging large paraphrase resources like PPDB, and is generalizable across parts of speech and languages. This makes it a valuable contribution to the broader NLP community.\n4. Evaluation Metric: The introduction of the extended B-Cubed F-Score for measuring substitutability is a thoughtful addition, offering a precise way to quantify the alignment between sense clusters and human-annotated substitutes.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Performance for Nouns: The proposed method underperforms for nouns compared to the TWSI inventory, suggesting that the clustering approach may require part-of-speech-specific optimizations. This limitation is acknowledged but not sufficiently addressed in the paper.\n2. Simple WSD Method: The practical implementation of sense filtering relies on a basic word sense disambiguation (WSD) method, which introduces bias and limits the achievable improvements in GAP scores. A more sophisticated WSD approach could enhance the practical utility of the method.\n3. Dependency on PPDB: While the use of PPDB provides high coverage, it also introduces noise, as acknowledged by the authors. The reliance on a single resource may limit the applicability of the method to domains or languages where PPDB is less effective.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the performance of the proposed method vary across different parts of speech beyond nouns? Are there specific optimizations that could improve performance for nouns?\n2. Could a more advanced WSD method, such as one leveraging contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT), further enhance the practical effectiveness of sense filtering?\n3. How does the method perform when applied to other paraphrase resources or languages beyond English and PPDB?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and provides a thorough exploration of the proposed method and its applications. However, addressing the limitations in noun performance and WSD could further strengthen the contribution."
