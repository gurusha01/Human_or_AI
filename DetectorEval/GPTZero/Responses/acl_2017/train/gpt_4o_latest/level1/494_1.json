            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces morph-fitting, a post-processing method to improve word vector spaces by injecting morphological constraints. The approach leverages simple, language-specific rules to encode inflectional and derivational morphology, pulling semantically similar word forms closer and pushing antonyms apart. Unlike prior work that relies on curated lexicons, morph-fitting is resource-light and adaptable to morphologically rich languages. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness across four languages (English, German, Italian, Russian) in intrinsic word similarity tasks and a downstream dialogue state tracking (DST) application. Key contributions include:\n1. Morph-fitting Methodology: A novel and resource-light post-processing approach that incorporates morphological constraints into pre-trained word vectors, improving their semantic quality.\n2. Multilingual Evaluation: Extensive experiments across four languages, showing consistent improvements in intrinsic word similarity tasks (SimLex-999, Morph-SimLex) and DST performance.\n3. Practical Impact: Demonstration of significant gains in DST for morphologically rich languages, setting new state-of-the-art results for Italian and German.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Simplicity: The morph-fitting approach is innovative in its use of simple morphological rules rather than curated lexicons, making it highly portable and scalable to low-resource languages. The method is computationally efficient and can be applied as a post-processing step to any pre-trained word vector space.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides robust empirical evidence, including intrinsic evaluations (SimLex-999, Morph-SimLex) and extrinsic evaluations (DST). The introduction of Morph-SimLex, a dataset that evaluates word inflections, adds further rigor to the analysis.\n3. Language-Agnostic Applicability: The method is shown to work across multiple languages, with particularly strong results for morphologically rich languages like German and Italian. This demonstrates the generalizability of the approach.\n4. Downstream Impact: The improvements in DST performance, particularly for German (+6%) and Italian (+4%), highlight the practical utility of morph-fitting for real-world NLP applications.\n5. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology and experimental setup. The inclusion of supplemental material (e.g., rules and datasets) enhances reproducibility.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Exploration of Morphological Rules: While the simplicity of the rules is a strength, the paper does not explore the impact of more sophisticated or exhaustive morphological rules. It would be valuable to understand whether additional rules could further improve performance.\n2. Focus on Morphologically Rich Languages: Although the method is evaluated on English, the gains are less pronounced, raising questions about its utility for morphologically simpler languages. A deeper analysis of why English shows limited downstream improvements would strengthen the paper.\n3. Comparison with Character-Level Models: The paper does not directly compare morph-fitting with character-level or subword-based models, which are also designed to handle morphological variation. Such a comparison would provide a clearer picture of the method's relative strengths.\n4. Limited Downstream Tasks: While the DST results are compelling, the evaluation is restricted to a single downstream task. Testing morph-fitted vectors on other tasks (e.g., machine translation, parsing) would better demonstrate the method's versatility.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the performance of morph-fitting compare with character-level or subword-based models (e.g., FastText, Byte-Pair Encoding)?\n2. Could more sophisticated or exhaustive morphological rules (e.g., irregular inflections) further improve the results? If so, how would this impact the method's portability?\n3. Why does English show limited downstream improvements despite intrinsic gains? Could this be related to the simplicity of its morphology or the nature of the DST task?\n4. Have you considered applying morph-fitting to other downstream tasks beyond DST? If so, what were the results?\nOverall Assessment\nThis paper presents a novel and impactful contribution to word vector post-processing, particularly for morphologically rich languages. The method is simple, resource-light, and effective, with strong empirical results in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. While there are some limitations, such as the lack of comparison with character-level models and the focus on a single downstream task, these do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the work. The paper is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. \nRecommendation: Accept."
