            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper presents a novel approach to building natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) that directly maps user utterances to SQL queries using neural sequence-to-sequence models. The system is designed to improve iteratively through user feedback and minimal intervention, leveraging crowdsourced annotations for incorrect predictions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on benchmark datasets (GEO880 and ATIS) and a live deployment for an academic database. Additionally, they release a new dataset (SCHOLAR) for academic database queries.\nMain Contributions\n1. Direct Mapping to SQL: The paper proposes a neural sequence-to-sequence model that bypasses intermediate meaning representations, directly generating SQL queries. This approach leverages the full expressivity of SQL and avoids the limitations of prior systems that rely on handcrafted rules or intermediate representations.\n2. Feedback-Driven Interactive Learning: The authors introduce an iterative feedback loop where user feedback is used to flag incorrect queries, and crowd workers annotate these errors to improve the model. This framework reduces the annotation effort while enabling rapid deployment in new domains.\n3. Data Augmentation Techniques: The paper employs schema-agnostic templates and paraphrasing to bootstrap the model with synthetic data, enabling the system to handle complex queries even in the early stages of deployment.\n4. Live System Deployment: The authors demonstrate the practicality of their approach by deploying a live system for an academic database. This is a significant contribution, as it showcases the feasibility of building semantic parsers in real-world settings with minimal manual intervention.\n5. New Dataset Release: The release of the SCHOLAR dataset, consisting of natural language utterances and SQL queries for academic database search, is a valuable resource for the semantic parsing community.\nStrengths\n1. Practicality and Scalability: The feedback-driven learning framework is well-suited for real-world applications, as it minimizes manual engineering and adapts to new domains with user-driven improvements.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed model achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets (GEO880 and ATIS) despite the increased difficulty of directly generating SQL. The live deployment further validates the system's effectiveness.\n3. Innovative Data Augmentation: The use of schema templates and paraphrasing is a creative solution to address the cold-start problem, enabling the system to handle complex queries from the outset.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper includes both benchmark experiments and a live deployment, providing a holistic evaluation of the approach. The simulated interactive learning experiments further highlight the system's adaptability.\n5. Resource Contribution: The release of the SCHOLAR dataset and the associated database is a significant contribution that will benefit future research in semantic parsing and NLIDBs.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Error Analysis: While the paper discusses user feedback quality, it lacks a detailed error analysis of the model's failures (e.g., specific SQL constructs or query types where the model struggles). This would provide deeper insights into the limitations of the approach.\n2. Dependency on Crowdsourcing: The reliance on crowd workers for annotating incorrect queries may not scale well for domains requiring specialized knowledge (e.g., medical or legal databases). The paper does not address how this limitation could be mitigated.\n3. Evaluation on Complex Queries: While the model performs well on GEO880 and ATIS, these datasets are relatively small and contain limited query complexity. A more thorough evaluation on larger, more complex datasets would strengthen the claims of generalizability.\n4. Interface Usability: The user interface for collecting feedback is described briefly, but there is no quantitative evaluation of its usability or its impact on feedback quality. A user study could provide valuable insights here.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model handle ambiguous or incomplete user queries where multiple valid SQL outputs are possible?\n2. Can the proposed approach be extended to handle other query languages like SPARQL or ElasticSearch without significant modifications?\n3. What specific challenges were encountered during the live deployment, and how were they addressed?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of semantic parsing and NLIDBs, particularly in its focus on practical deployment and iterative improvement. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above could further enhance the impact of this work."
