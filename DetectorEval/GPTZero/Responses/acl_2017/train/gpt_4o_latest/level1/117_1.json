            "inputText": "Review of the Submitted Paper\nSummary and Contributions:\nThis paper proposes a novel hierarchical recurrent neural network (HR-BiLSTM) enhanced by residual learning for relation detection in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems. The authors address key challenges in KBQA relation detection, such as handling a large number of relation types, unseen relations during training, and multi-relation chains. The proposed HR-BiLSTM model leverages hierarchical matching between questions and relations at both word-level and relation-level representations, with residual connections to improve training and representation abstraction. Additionally, the paper introduces a simple KBQA pipeline that integrates the proposed relation detection model to achieve state-of-the-art results on both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA benchmarks.\nThe main contributions of this work, as I see them, are:\n1. Hierarchical Residual BiLSTM (HR-BiLSTM): The proposed model effectively combines hierarchical matching and residual learning to address the challenges of relation detection in KBQA, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.\n2. Integration into KBQA Pipeline: The authors demonstrate how improved relation detection enhances the overall KBQA system, particularly through a novel entity re-ranking step that leverages relation scores to disambiguate entities.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides extensive experiments and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed model and its components across multiple datasets and tasks.\nStrengths:\n1. Novel and Effective Model Design: The HR-BiLSTM model introduces a well-motivated hierarchical matching mechanism with residual learning, which significantly improves relation detection performance. The ablation studies convincingly demonstrate the importance of each component.\n2. State-of-the-Art Results: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both SimpleQuestions and WebQSP datasets, highlighting its robustness and generalizability across single-relation and multi-relation tasks.\n3. Practical KBQA Pipeline: The integration of the relation detection model into a KBQA pipeline is straightforward yet impactful, particularly the entity re-ranking step, which addresses a common bottleneck in KBQA systems.\n4. Thorough Evaluation: The paper provides detailed comparisons with strong baselines, ablation studies, and error analyses, ensuring the claims are well-supported by empirical evidence.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Exploration of Zero-Shot Learning: While the paper mentions the challenge of unseen relations, the proposed approach primarily relies on word-level representations for generalization. It would be valuable to explore more explicit zero-shot learning techniques, such as leveraging pre-trained embeddings or transfer learning.\n2. Scalability Concerns: The use of BiLSTMs and hierarchical matching may raise concerns about computational efficiency, especially for large-scale KBs with millions of relations. A discussion on scalability and runtime performance is missing.\n3. Simplistic KBQA Pipeline: While the pipeline achieves strong results, it lacks advanced components like joint inference or feature-based re-ranking, which could further improve performance. The authors could explore combining their approach with such techniques.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How does the proposed HR-BiLSTM model perform in terms of computational efficiency compared to baseline models, particularly on large-scale KBs?\n2. Have you considered incorporating pre-trained embeddings or transfer learning techniques to further improve generalization to unseen relations?\n3. Could the hierarchical matching framework be extended to incorporate attention mechanisms more effectively, particularly for longer sequences or multi-relation chains?\nConclusion:\nOverall, this paper presents a significant advancement in relation detection for KBQA systems, with a novel model design and strong empirical results. While there are some areas for further exploration, the contributions are substantial and well-supported. I recommend acceptance of this paper."
