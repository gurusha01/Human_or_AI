            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the nuanced task of political framing analysis on Twitter, a domain that has been underexplored compared to longer political texts like Congressional speeches. The authors propose a weakly supervised approach leveraging Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) to model dependencies between tweet frame predictions and social/behavioral interactions of Twitter users. The paper introduces a novel dataset of tweets from U.S. Congress members, annotated with 17 frames (14 from Boydstun et al. and 3 Twitter-specific frames). The key contributions of the paper are:\n1. Weakly Supervised Collective Classification Framework: The authors propose a global probabilistic model that combines lexical features (e.g., unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) with behavioral features (e.g., retweets, temporal activity, and follower networks) to predict frames. This approach achieves a significant improvement in unsupervised F1 scores (+21.52 points) over a lexical baseline.\n \n2. Dataset and Annotation: The authors compile and annotate a dataset of 184,914 tweets from U.S. Congress members, adapting the Policy Frames Codebook for Twitter. This dataset, along with the annotation process, provides a valuable resource for the community.\n3. Framing Analysis Insights: The paper demonstrates the utility of its models by analyzing framing patterns over time and identifying aisle-crossing politicians based on their framing behaviors. This analysis provides novel insights into political discourse on Twitter.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of Approach: The use of PSL to integrate both language-based and behavioral features for framing prediction is innovative. The incorporation of social and temporal dependencies is particularly compelling and demonstrates the potential of collective classification in political discourse analysis.\n2. Performance Improvements: The proposed method achieves substantial gains in both supervised and unsupervised settings. The unsupervised results are particularly noteworthy, as they address the challenge of dynamic and evolving political discourse without requiring extensive labeled data.\n3. Real-World Applicability: The qualitative analysis of framing patterns over time and the identification of aisle-crossing politicians highlight the practical relevance of the proposed method. These insights could be valuable for political scientists and policymakers.\n4. Dataset Contribution: The annotated dataset of Congressional tweets is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a foundation for future research on political framing in social media.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization Beyond U.S. Politics: While the authors claim that the approach can generalize to other political contexts, the paper does not empirically validate this claim. A case study or experiment in a different political setting would strengthen the paper.\n2. Evaluation Metrics and Analysis: The paper primarily focuses on F1 scores but does not provide a detailed error analysis or qualitative examples of misclassified frames. Such an analysis would help clarify the limitations of the model and guide future improvements.\n3. Over-Reliance on PSL: While PSL is a powerful framework, its scalability to larger datasets or more complex social networks is not discussed. The computational efficiency of the approach, especially in real-time applications, remains unclear.\n4. Ambiguity in Frame Overlap: The issue of overlapping frames (e.g., bigrams appearing in multiple frames) is acknowledged but not fully addressed. This could lead to ambiguities in multilabel classification, particularly in the unsupervised setting.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model handle tweets that are highly ambiguous or contain overlapping frames? Are there specific strategies to mitigate this issue?\n2. Could you provide more details on the scalability of the PSL-based approach, particularly for larger datasets or real-time applications?\n3. Have you considered applying your method to political discourse in non-English or non-U.S. contexts? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of political discourse analysis on social media. While there are some limitations in generalizability and evaluation depth, the proposed approach and dataset are valuable resources for future research. The paper is well-written and provides a clear exposition of the methodology and results. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses."
