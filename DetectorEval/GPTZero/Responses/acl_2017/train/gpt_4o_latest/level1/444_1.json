The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation methodology that combines manual and automated approaches to assess fluency, coherence, and stylistic similarity of generated verses. They also introduce a publicly available dataset of rap lyrics from 13 artists, annotated for stylistic similarity, which serves as a benchmark for future research. The methodology is applied to evaluate an LSTM-based generative model, highlighting its strengths and limitations in capturing the unique style of individual artists while maintaining novelty.\nMain Contributions\n1. Evaluation Methodology: The paper introduces a novel and comprehensive evaluation framework for creative text generation, combining manual annotation (fluency, coherence, and style matching) with automated metrics (rhyme density, textual uniqueness). This is the most significant contribution, as it provides a robust foundation for evaluating creative language tasks.\n2. Annotated Dataset: The authors compile and annotate a dataset of rap lyrics from 13 artists, including stylistic similarity annotations. This dataset is a valuable resource for future research in creative text generation.\n3. Improved Automation: The paper enhances the semi-automatic evaluation method proposed by Potash et al. (2015) by introducing an entropy-based weighting mechanism to handle repetitive text, enabling fully automated large-scale analysis.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Evaluation Framework: The proposed methodology captures multiple facets of the ghostwriting task, including fluency, coherence, and style matching, which are often overlooked in prior work. The combination of manual and automated metrics ensures a holistic evaluation.\n2. Publicly Available Dataset: The annotated dataset of rap lyrics is a significant contribution, as it provides a benchmark for future research and facilitates reproducibility.\n3. Insightful Analysis: The evaluation results offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of the LSTM model, such as its ability to capture an artist's \"average\" style but struggles with coherence when trained on large datasets.\n4. Generalizability: The authors argue that their evaluation methodology can be extended to other creative generation tasks, such as style transfer in visual art, making the work broadly applicable.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Model Innovation: The paper primarily focuses on evaluation and does not introduce significant advancements in generative modeling. The LSTM model used is relatively standard, and no novel generation techniques are proposed.\n2. Subjectivity in Manual Evaluation: While the manual evaluation methodology is well-defined, the inter-annotator agreement for coherence (0.43) is relatively low, indicating subjectivity in the task. This could limit the reliability of the results.\n3. Dataset Preprocessing: The dataset preprocessing is heuristic-based and may still contain non-verse text (e.g., dialogue or chorus lines). This could introduce noise into the training and evaluation processes.\n4. Scalability of Manual Evaluation: Although the authors emphasize automation, the manual evaluation tasks (fluency, coherence, style matching) remain labor-intensive and may not scale well for larger datasets or more complex models.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the scalability of manual evaluation for larger datasets or more complex models? Could crowdsourcing or active learning approaches be integrated?\n2. Can the proposed evaluation methodology be adapted to other creative text generation tasks, such as poetry or storytelling? If so, what modifications would be necessary?\n3. How does the LSTM model's performance compare to more recent generative models, such as transformers or diffusion-based approaches, on the same dataset?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the evaluation of creative language generation tasks. While the focus is primarily on evaluation rather than generation, the insights and resources provided are likely to have a lasting impact on the field. Addressing the scalability of manual evaluation and exploring more advanced generative models would further strengthen the work."
