            "inputText": "Review of the Paper on Weakly Supervised Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of building Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems for new languages without requiring human-annotated data. It proposes two weakly supervised approaches: (1) Annotation Projection, which uses a heuristic data selection scheme to filter noisy projection-labeled data from comparable corpora, and (2) Representation Projection, which maps word embeddings from a target language into a source language (English) space to enable direct model transfer. Additionally, the paper introduces two co-decoding schemes to combine the outputs of these approaches for improved performance. The methods are evaluated on in-house and CoNLL datasets across multiple languages, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER systems.\nThe main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Heuristic Data Selection for Annotation Projection: The proposed method effectively filters noisy data, yielding substantial performance gains, particularly for languages with low alignment accuracy (e.g., Korean and Japanese).\n2. Representation Projection for Direct Model Transfer: The use of cross-lingual word embeddings to enable universal NER model transfer is novel and eliminates the need for re-training on target languages.\n3. Co-Decoding Schemes: The rank-based and confidence-based co-decoding strategies combine the strengths of the two approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Performance Gains: The proposed methods achieve strong results, often approaching supervised learning performance, and outperform two state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER systems (TÃ¤ckstrÃ¶m et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2016). The improvements are particularly notable for low-resource languages like Korean and Japanese.\n2. Robustness to Noisy Data: The heuristic data selection scheme for annotation projection is well-motivated and empirically validated, showing significant gains in F1 scores by filtering low-quality data.\n3. Scalability and Practicality: The representation projection approach is highly scalable, as it requires only monolingual embeddings and a small bilingual dictionary, making it suitable for adding new languages without retraining.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple languages and datasets (both in-house and CoNLL), and include comparisons with supervised baselines and prior cross-lingual methods.\n5. Smart Combination of Systems: The co-decoding schemes are simple yet effective, leveraging the complementary strengths of the two projection-based approaches.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Representation Projection: While the use of cross-lingual embeddings for NER is interesting, the approach builds heavily on existing methods (e.g., Mikolov et al., 2013b). The novelty lies more in its application to NER rather than in the method itself.\n2. Dependence on Alignment Quality: The annotation projection approach relies on alignment models, which can vary significantly in quality across languages. For languages with poor alignment accuracy, the method may still struggle despite the data selection scheme.\n3. Lack of Error Analysis: The paper does not provide a detailed qualitative analysis of errors made by the systems, which could offer insights into their limitations and areas for improvement.\n4. Limited Discussion of Scalability: While the representation projection approach is scalable, the computational cost of training embeddings and alignment models for new languages is not discussed in detail.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How sensitive are the results to the size and quality of the bilingual dictionary used for representation projection? Would a smaller or noisier dictionary significantly degrade performance?\n2. Could the proposed co-decoding schemes be extended to incorporate additional weakly supervised or unsupervised NER systems? If so, how would this affect performance?\n3. Have you considered applying the proposed methods to languages with non-standard scripts or those with limited monolingual corpora? If so, what challenges did you encounter?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes strong contributions to the field of cross-lingual NER, particularly in its heuristic data selection for annotation projection and its co-decoding schemes. While the representation projection approach lacks significant novelty, its practical utility and integration into the overall framework are commendable. The results are compelling, and the paper sets a strong baseline for weakly supervised cross-lingual NER. I recommend acceptance, with minor reservations regarding the lack of error analysis and scalability discussion."
