The authors propose a novel approach that frames knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two interrelated tasks: (1) learning relative physical knowledge of object pairs and (2) inferring the physical implications of actions when applied to those objects. The work introduces a probabilistic factor graph model to integrate these tasks, leveraging semantic similarities, action-object compatibilities, and cross-knowledge correlations. Additionally, the authors present a new dataset, VERBPHYSICS, which compiles crowd-sourced knowledge about physical properties of objects and actions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baselines in predicting both object relations and action implications.\nMain Contributions \n1. Novel Task Definition: The paper introduces a new task of extracting commonsense physical knowledge from text, focusing on physical implications of actions and relative object relations. This task is well-motivated and fills a gap in existing commonsense reasoning research. \n2. Probabilistic Factor Graph Model: The proposed model effectively integrates multiple sources of evidence, including action-object compatibilities, semantic similarities, and cross-knowledge correlations, to jointly infer object and action knowledge. This joint inference approach is a key methodological contribution. \n3. VERBPHYSICS Dataset: The creation of a crowd-sourced dataset for physical knowledge extraction is a valuable resource for the community, especially given the lack of existing datasets targeting these specific dimensions of physical knowledge. \nStrengths \n1. Clear Motivation and Problem Definition: The paper is well-motivated, with a clear explanation of the challenges posed by reporting bias in natural language and the need for physical commonsense knowledge in AI applications like robotics and vision. \n2. Comprehensive Model Design: The factor graph model is thoughtfully designed, incorporating diverse factors such as verb and object similarities, action-object compatibilities, and cross-attribute correlations. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of these components. \n3. Empirical Validation: The model achieves strong performance across multiple tasks, outperforming baselines by a significant margin. The use of both sparse (5%) and richer (20%) seed knowledge configurations highlights the robustness of the approach. \n4. Broader Applicability: The paper convincingly argues that the extracted knowledge has applications beyond language understanding, such as in robotics and computer vision, where physical reasoning is essential. \nWeaknesses \n1. Limited Novelty in Dataset Construction: While the VERBPHYSICS dataset is valuable, the methodology for its creation (crowdsourcing) is relatively standard. The dataset could have been enriched with additional modalities (e.g., visual or multimodal data) to further validate the approach. \n2. Handling of Metaphorical Language: The paper briefly mentions challenges with metaphorical uses of verbs (e.g., \"x contained y\" in abstract contexts) but does not propose a concrete solution. This limitation could affect the model's generalizability to more nuanced language. \n3. Scalability Concerns: The reliance on crowd-sourced seed knowledge and manual frame refinement raises questions about the scalability of the approach to larger datasets or more diverse knowledge domains. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. How does the model handle cases where physical implications of verbs vary significantly across contexts (e.g., \"contain\" in physical vs. abstract senses)? \n2. Could the dataset and model be extended to incorporate multimodal data (e.g., images or videos) to improve grounding of physical knowledge? \n3. What are the computational costs of training and inference for the factor graph model, and how do they scale with larger datasets? \nOverall Assessment \nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of commonsense reasoning by addressing a challenging and underexplored problem. The proposed model is innovative, and the empirical results are compelling. While there are some concerns about scalability and handling of abstract language, these do not detract significantly from the overall impact of the work. I recommend acceptance."
