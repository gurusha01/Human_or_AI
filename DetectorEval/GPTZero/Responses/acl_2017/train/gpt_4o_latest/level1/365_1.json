The authors propose a series of encoder-decoder architectures, including a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that leverages grapheme-to-phoneme mappings as auxiliary data. The models are evaluated on 44 datasets of Early New High German, achieving a 2% absolute improvement over the state-of-the-art. The paper also provides an analysis of how MTL implicitly learns to focus attention, reducing the need for explicit attention mechanisms. The authors make their implementation publicly available, contributing to reproducibility and further research.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel Application of Encoder-Decoder Architectures: The paper is the first to apply encoder-decoder models to historical text normalization, demonstrating their effectiveness over traditional baselines.\n2. Multi-Task Learning with Auxiliary Data: The use of grapheme-to-phoneme mappings as an auxiliary task significantly improves performance, particularly in low-resource settings.\n3. Analysis of MTL and Attention Mechanisms: The paper provides a detailed analysis showing that MTL can implicitly learn attention-like behavior, offering insights into the relationship between MTL and attention mechanisms.\nStrengths\n1. State-of-the-Art Performance: The proposed models outperform competitive baselines by a significant margin, with the best architecture achieving a nearly 3% improvement in word accuracy. This demonstrates the practical value of the approach.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The models are rigorously evaluated across 44 datasets, ensuring robustness and generalizability. The inclusion of multiple baselines strengthens the validity of the results.\n3. Innovative Use of MTL: The integration of grapheme-to-phoneme mappings as an auxiliary task is both novel and effective, addressing the challenge of limited training data. The approach is well-motivated and empirically validated.\n4. Insightful Analysis: The paper goes beyond performance metrics to analyze the learned representations and the interplay between MTL and attention. This adds depth to the work and provides a foundation for future research.\n5. Reproducibility: By making their implementation publicly available, the authors contribute to transparency and facilitate further exploration of their methods.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Contextual Modeling: The models operate at the word level, ignoring broader token context, which could improve normalization for ambiguous cases. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not explore potential solutions like contextual embeddings or language models.\n2. Attention Mechanism Underexplored: While the paper claims that MTL reduces the need for attention, it does not fully explore scenarios where attention and MTL might complement each other. This could have provided a more nuanced understanding of their interaction.\n3. Dataset-Specific Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters are tuned on a single manuscript, which may introduce bias. While the authors argue this is realistic for low-resource scenarios, a more systematic exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity would strengthen the claims.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide more details on why attention mechanisms degrade performance when combined with MTL? Are there specific cases where attention still adds value?\n2. Have you considered incorporating token-level context (e.g., sentence-level embeddings) to address ambiguities in normalization? If so, what challenges do you foresee?\n3. How does the performance of your models vary across different dialectal regions in the dataset? Are there specific dialects where the models struggle?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and makes a strong case for the use of encoder-decoder architectures and MTL in historical text normalization. Addressing the weaknesses mentioned above could further enhance the impact of this work. Overall, it is a valuable contribution to the field."
