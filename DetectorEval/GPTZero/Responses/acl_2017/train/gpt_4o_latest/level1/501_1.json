The authors propose a dataset, MCIC, generated using a decoy-creation algorithm that ensures challenging distractors. The paper also benchmarks several baseline and advanced models, including a hybrid Vec2seq+FFNN model, and demonstrates that performance on the DMC task correlates positively with image captioning performance in a multi-task learning setup.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel Task and Dataset: The DMC task is a significant contribution as it emphasizes deeper semantic alignment between vision and language modalities. The MCIC dataset, with its carefully designed decoys, provides a challenging benchmark for this task.\n2. Decoy Generation Algorithm: The proposed algorithm for generating decoys based on linguistic and embedding similarities is innovative and ensures that the task is non-trivial for both humans and machines.\n3. Empirical Insights on Multi-Task Learning: The study demonstrates that solving the DMC task can improve performance on related tasks like image captioning, highlighting the utility of multi-task learning setups.\nStrengths\n1. Task Novelty: The DMC task fills a gap in multi-modal AI research by focusing on semantic alignment rather than surface-level keyword matching, which is an important step forward for vision-language understanding.\n2. Dataset Quality: The MCIC dataset is well-designed, with a rigorous decoy generation process and a large-scale setup. Human evaluation results provide a meaningful upper bound for machine performance.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates a range of models, from simple baselines to advanced neural architectures, and provides detailed insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The inclusion of multi-task learning experiments adds depth to the analysis.\n4. Correlation with Image Captioning: The finding that DMC performance correlates with image captioning performance is compelling and suggests broader applicability of the task in improving vision-language systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Model Diversity: While the paper evaluates several models, the focus is primarily on neural architectures. It would be valuable to see comparisons with other state-of-the-art multi-modal methods, such as transformer-based models (e.g., CLIP or BLIP), which are not discussed.\n2. Decoy Generalization: The decoy generation algorithm is specific to the COCO dataset, and its adaptability to other datasets or domains is not explored. This limits the generalizability of the proposed approach.\n3. Human Performance Analysis: While human evaluation results are presented, the paper does not analyze the sources of disagreement among annotators or provide qualitative insights into the types of errors made by humans versus machines.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed DMC task compare to existing multi-modal benchmarks like VQA or image-text retrieval in terms of difficulty and practical applications?\n2. Could the decoy generation algorithm be adapted to other datasets or tasks, such as video captioning or document understanding? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. Have you considered evaluating transformer-based models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP) on the DMC task? If not, how do you anticipate their performance would compare to the Vec2seq+FFNN model?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and addresses an important gap in vision-language research. However, exploring the generalizability of the task and dataset, as well as including state-of-the-art transformer models, could strengthen the contribution further."
