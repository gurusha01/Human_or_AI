The authors adapt and extend the design principles of the SICK corpus, which is widely used for English CDS evaluation, to accommodate the unique characteristics of Polish. The resulting dataset contains 10,000 sentence pairs annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment, with inter-annotator agreement metrics demonstrating its reliability. Key modifications to the SICK methodology include language-specific sentence transformation rules, bidirectional entailment annotations, and human verification of automatically transformed sentences.\nMain Contributions:\n1. Development of a Polish CDS Evaluation Dataset: The primary contribution is the creation of a high-quality, publicly available dataset for evaluating CDS models in Polish. This fills a critical gap for a language with limited NLP resources and offers a benchmark comparable to the SICK corpus for English.\n \n2. Language-Specific Adaptations to the SICK Methodology: The authors introduce novel linguistic transformation rules tailored to Polish, addressing challenges such as free word order and fusional morphology. These rules are a significant contribution to the broader field of multilingual NLP.\n3. Bidirectional Entailment Annotation: The paper highlights the importance of annotating entailment relations in both directions, a refinement that enhances the dataset's utility for evaluating CDS models.\nStrengths:\n1. Significant Resource Contribution: The dataset is a valuable resource for the NLP community, particularly for researchers working on under-resourced languages. Its comparability to the SICK corpus ensures its relevance for cross-linguistic studies.\n \n2. Rigorous Methodology: The authors provide a detailed and transparent description of their dataset creation process, including linguistic transformations, annotation guidelines, and inter-annotator agreement metrics. This rigor enhances the reproducibility and credibility of their work.\n3. High Annotation Quality: The inter-annotator agreement scores (Îº = 0.732 for entailment and Î± = 0.780 for relatedness) indicate that the dataset is reliable and suitable for its intended purpose.\n4. Adaptability of the Methodology: The paper demonstrates how the proposed procedure can be adapted to other under-resourced languages, making it a valuable reference for future multilingual CDS research.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the dataset is a significant contribution, the methodology largely builds on the SICK corpus design. The novelty lies in its adaptation to Polish, but the broader methodological innovation is limited.\n \n2. Dependence on Human Verification: The reliance on human verification and post-correction for transformed sentences may limit scalability to larger datasets or other languages without similar linguistic expertise.\n3. Evaluation of CDS Models: The paper does not include an empirical evaluation of existing CDS models on the dataset. Such an evaluation would have demonstrated the dataset's practical utility and highlighted its challenges.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How do you envision the dataset being used for evaluating CDS models beyond Polish, e.g., in cross-linguistic transfer learning or multilingual NLP tasks?\n2. Could you elaborate on the scalability of your methodology to other under-resourced languages, particularly those with significantly different linguistic structures from Polish?\nAdditional Comments:\nOverall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by addressing the lack of evaluation resources for CDS models in Polish. While the methodological novelty is limited, the dataset itself is a significant step forward for multilingual NLP research."
