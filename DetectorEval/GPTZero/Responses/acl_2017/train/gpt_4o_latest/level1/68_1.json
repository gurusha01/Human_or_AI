            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary of the Paper \nThis paper addresses the underexplored area of Vietnamese text readability by constructing a new, large-scale corpus and proposing a novel formula for predicting text readability. The authors collect and annotate a dataset of 1,000 documents across three difficulty levels (easy, normal, and difficult) and develop a regression-based formula using features such as average sentence length, word length, and the percentage of difficult words. Their experiments demonstrate that the proposed formula achieves an overall accuracy of 81% in predicting text readability.\nMain Contributions \n1. Corpus Creation: The authors build a new Vietnamese text readability corpus, which is significantly larger and more diverse than previous efforts. This corpus includes 996 documents categorized into three difficulty levels, with annotations provided by experts. The inclusion of Fleiss' kappa to measure inter-annotator agreement (moderate agreement with K=0.422) adds credibility to the dataset. This contribution is foundational for future research in Vietnamese text readability. \n2. Novel Readability Formula: The paper introduces a new readability formula tailored to Vietnamese, leveraging features such as average sentence length (in characters), average word length (in characters), and the percentage of difficult words. The formula achieves high predictive accuracy (81%) and demonstrates its utility in practical applications. \n3. Empirical Validation: The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation using cross-validation and correlation analysis to select features and validate the formula. The results show strong performance across all difficulty levels, with accuracies of 76%, 85%, and 78% for easy, normal, and difficult texts, respectively.\nStrengths \n1. Significant Contribution to Vietnamese NLP: The creation of a large, annotated corpus addresses a critical gap in Vietnamese text readability research, which has been stagnant for decades. This resource will likely serve as a benchmark for future studies. \n2. Practical Applicability: The proposed formula demonstrates robust performance and can be directly applied in educational, publishing, and legal domains to assess text readability. \n3. Methodological Rigor: The use of cross-validation, correlation analysis, and regression modeling ensures that the proposed formula is both statistically sound and interpretable. The paper also provides detailed insights into feature selection, which enhances reproducibility. \nWeaknesses \n1. Limited Feature Exploration: While the selected features yield good results, the paper does not explore deeper linguistic or syntactic features, such as part-of-speech tags or sentence structure, which could improve the formula's accuracy further. \n2. Moderate Inter-Annotator Agreement: The Fleiss' kappa score of 0.422 indicates only moderate agreement among annotators, which may affect the reliability of the corpus annotations. Further efforts to refine the annotation process could enhance the dataset's quality. \n3. Domain-Specific Limitations: The corpus appears to focus on general texts, and the applicability of the formula to domain-specific texts (e.g., legal, medical) is not discussed. This limits the generalizability of the results. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. Have you considered incorporating syntactic or semantic features (e.g., part-of-speech tags, sentence complexity) into the formula? If so, what were the challenges? \n2. Could you elaborate on how the corpus was balanced across different document types and sources to ensure representativeness? \n3. Do you plan to release the corpus and the formula for public use? If not, what are the barriers to doing so? \nConclusion \nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to Vietnamese NLP by addressing a long-standing gap in text readability research. The creation of a large corpus and the development of a novel formula are significant achievements. However, the work could be strengthened by exploring additional features and addressing domain-specific limitations. Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance."
