            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper presents a novel system for generating mnemonic encodings of numeric sequences using the major system, with a focus on creating memorable and syntactically plausible sentences. The authors propose several encoding models, including baseline, preliminary, and a final \"Sentence Encoder\" model, which combines part-of-speech (POS) sentence templates with an n-gram language model. The system is evaluated through a user study on password memorability, demonstrating that the Sentence Encoder produces more memorable encodings compared to other models and numeric sequences. The study also highlights the potential of the system to improve security practices by aiding in the memorization of numeric passwords.\nMain Contributions\n1. Development of the Sentence Encoder Model: The primary contribution is the Sentence Encoder, which combines POS templates with an n-gram language model to generate memorable and syntactically plausible sentences. The model introduces innovations such as template sampling, digit-weighted trigram scoring, and post-processing to optimize memorability.\n2. Empirical Evaluation via User Study: The paper provides a comprehensive user study comparing the Sentence Encoder to the n-gram encoder and numeric sequences. The study evaluates short-term recall, long-term recall, recognition, and subjective user preferences, offering strong evidence for the Sentence Encoder's effectiveness.\n3. Analysis of Existing Tools and Related Work: The authors position their work within the context of existing mnemonic systems and password memorability research, identifying gaps in prior approaches and addressing them with their proposed method.\nStrengths\n1. Clear and Well-Motivated Problem: The paper addresses a practical and underexplored problem\"\"improving the memorability of numeric sequences\"\"while grounding the work in established mnemonic techniques and language modeling.\n2. Innovative Model Design: The Sentence Encoder is a significant improvement over baseline and preliminary models, balancing syntactic plausibility, brevity, and memorability. The use of POS templates and digit-weighted scoring is particularly novel.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The user study is well-designed and provides robust evidence for the Sentence Encoder's superiority in terms of memorability and user preference. The inclusion of multiple evaluation metrics (recall, recognition, and subjective ranking) strengthens the findings.\n4. Potential for Practical Impact: The system has clear applications in password security and memorization tasks, making it relevant to both academic and real-world contexts.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Long-Term Recall Results: While the Sentence Encoder outperforms the n-gram model in short-term recall and recognition, the long-term recall results are inconclusive. This weakens the claim that the system significantly improves memorability over time.\n2. Narrow Scope of User Study: The study focuses on 8-digit sequences, which may not fully demonstrate the advantages of the Sentence Encoder for longer numeric sequences. Additionally, the sample size (66 valid participants) is relatively small after removing fraudulent responses.\n3. Computational Efficiency: The Sentence Encoder's reliance on template sampling and post-processing raises questions about scalability for longer sequences or real-time applications. This aspect is not thoroughly analyzed in the paper.\n4. Fraudulent Responses in User Study: The presence of a large number of fraudulent responses (101 out of 167) raises concerns about the robustness of the study's recruitment and data validation methods.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of the Sentence Encoder, particularly for longer numeric sequences or real-time applications?\n2. How do you plan to address the inconclusive long-term recall results in future studies? Would daily recall prompts or longer numeric sequences provide more definitive insights?\n3. Could the Sentence Encoder be extended to encode alphanumeric sequences or incorporate additional linguistic features, such as semantic coherence or emotional salience, to further enhance memorability?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and provides a thorough exploration of the problem and proposed solution. Addressing the weaknesses identified above, particularly through additional user studies and scalability analysis, would further strengthen the work. Overall, this submission makes a valuable contribution to the field of mnemonic systems and password memorability."
