            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary\nThis paper investigates neural approaches for end-to-end computational argumentation mining (AM), framing the problem as dependency parsing, sequence tagging, and multi-task learning (MTL). The authors evaluate these methods on the Persuasive Essays (PE) dataset and compare them to a feature-based Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model. Key findings include the effectiveness of sequence tagging models, the limitations of dependency parsing for AM, and the benefits of multi-task learning for capturing subtasks like component segmentation and relation identification. The paper also highlights the trade-offs between modularity and constraints in different neural framings.\nContributions\n1. Neural Sequence Tagging for AM: The paper demonstrates that sequence tagging models, particularly BiLSTM-CRF-CNN (BLCC), outperform dependency parsing and the ILP baseline for component and relation identification. This contribution is significant as it establishes a robust, feature-free alternative to traditional approaches.\n \n2. Multi-Task Learning for AM: The authors show that incorporating auxiliary tasks (e.g., component detection) in a multi-task learning setup improves performance. This highlights the potential of leveraging task interdependencies in AM.\n3. Critical Evaluation of Dependency Parsing: The paper provides a thorough analysis of why dependency parsing is suboptimal for AM, particularly for long sequences, due to its global complexity and sensitivity to data sparsity. This insight is valuable for guiding future research away from less effective framings.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates multiple neural framings (dependency parsing, sequence tagging, MTL) and compares them rigorously against a strong ILP baseline. The inclusion of both paragraph-level and essay-level experiments adds depth to the analysis.\n \n2. State-of-the-Art Results: The proposed sequence tagging and multi-task learning approaches achieve new state-of-the-art results on the PE dataset, demonstrating the practical impact of the work.\n3. Insightful Analysis: The authors provide detailed error analyses and discuss the trade-offs between modularity and constraints in different framings. This level of introspection strengthens the paper's contributions.\n4. Elimination of Feature Engineering: By relying on neural methods, the paper eliminates the need for hand-crafted features and ILP constraints, addressing a key limitation of prior work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Methods: While the application of neural models to AM is novel, the individual methods (e.g., BiLSTM-CRF, MTL) are well-established in NLP. The paper's primary contribution lies in adapting these methods to AM rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques.\n2. Dependency Parsing Framing: The inclusion of dependency parsing, despite its poor performance, feels less impactful. While the analysis is insightful, the framing itself does not advance the state of the art and could have been omitted or replaced with more promising alternatives (e.g., encoder-decoder models).\n3. Dataset-Specific Insights: Many findings, such as the effectiveness of sequence tagging and the limitations of dependency parsing, are tied to the structure of the PE dataset. It is unclear how well these insights generalize to other AM datasets with different characteristics.\n4. Relation Identification Challenges: The paper acknowledges that relation identification remains a bottleneck, particularly for long documents. However, it does not propose concrete solutions to address this issue beyond the current experiments.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the proposed models generalize to other AM datasets with different argument structures? Have you considered testing on additional datasets?\n2. Could you elaborate on why encoder-decoder models were not explored, given their potential for capturing complex relationships in AM?\n3. For multi-task learning, did you experiment with other auxiliary tasks (e.g., stance detection) beyond component detection and relation identification?\nOverall Recommendation\nThis paper makes significant contributions to computational argumentation mining by demonstrating the effectiveness of neural sequence tagging and multi-task learning approaches. While the novelty of the methods is limited, the thorough evaluation and state-of-the-art results justify its acceptance. Addressing the generalizability of findings and proposing solutions for relation identification could further strengthen the work."
