            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper addresses the challenge of incomplete coverage in parsing with Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) by proposing and evaluating several robust parsing techniques. The authors augment the English Resource Grammar (ERG) with four methods: two involving low-precision HPSG rules (bridging and Pacman) and two involving automatic constraint relaxation (PCFG approximation and hybrid approaches). The paper also introduces a methodology for evaluating robust parsing techniques, particularly in the absence of gold-standard annotations for unparseable inputs. The experimental results demonstrate that these techniques can significantly improve coverage (up to 100% in some datasets) while maintaining or improving semantic accuracy as measured by EDM F1 scores.\nMain Contributions\n1. Development and Evaluation of Robust Parsing Techniques: The paper's primary contribution is the systematic comparison of five robust parsing methods (baseline, bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches). The hybrid-ww method achieves the best overall performance, combining high coverage with strong semantic accuracy.\n2. Evaluation Methodology for Robust Parsing: The authors propose a novel evaluation methodology that uses datasets with fabricated or updated gold standards to assess the performance of robust parsing techniques. This methodology is particularly valuable for evaluating inputs outside the grammar's original coverage.\n3. Insights into Trade-offs Between Coverage, Accuracy, and Efficiency: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the trade-offs inherent in robust parsing, including the computational cost of ambiguity management and the impact of different techniques on parsing speed and accuracy.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates multiple robust parsing techniques across four datasets, providing a thorough comparison of their strengths and weaknesses. The use of both intrinsic (EDM F1) and extrinsic (coverage) metrics strengthens the validity of the results.\n2. Significant Coverage Improvements: The proposed methods, particularly the PCFG-based and hybrid approaches, demonstrate substantial improvements in coverage, addressing a critical limitation of HPSG-based parsers.\n3. Practical Relevance: The work has clear implications for real-world applications, such as information extraction and machine translation, where robust parsing is essential.\n4. Clarity of Experimental Design: The detailed descriptions of datasets, parsing systems, and evaluation metrics make the experimental setup reproducible and transparent.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Extrinsic Evaluation: While the intrinsic evaluation is robust, the lack of extrinsic evaluation on downstream tasks limits the ability to assess the practical utility of the proposed methods.\n2. Ambiguity Management Challenges: Techniques like bridging and Pacman suffer from high ambiguity, leading to resource exhaustion and lower coverage in some datasets. The paper does not propose concrete solutions to address this issue.\n3. Parsing Speed: The hybrid-ww and csaw-ww methods, while achieving high coverage and accuracy, are computationally expensive. This may limit their applicability in time-sensitive applications.\n4. Ranking Model Limitations: The statistical parse ranking model is not adapted to the novel robust parsing scenarios, potentially limiting the accuracy of the hybrid approaches.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you elaborate on how the statistical ranking model could be adapted to better handle robust parsing scenarios? Are there specific features or datasets that could improve its performance?\n2. Have you considered evaluating the proposed methods on downstream tasks, such as semantic role labeling or machine translation, to assess their extrinsic utility?\n3. How scalable are the hybrid approaches to larger datasets or longer sentences? Are there plans to optimize their computational efficiency?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of robust parsing with HPSG, offering practical solutions and a clear evaluation framework. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly through extrinsic evaluation and ambiguity management, could further enhance the impact of this work."
