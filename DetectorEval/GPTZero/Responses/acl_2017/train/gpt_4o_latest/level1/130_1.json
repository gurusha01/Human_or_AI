            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper presents a novel approach for detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using complex network (CN) features derived from speech transcripts. The authors propose modeling transcripts as complex networks enriched with word embeddings to address challenges posed by disfluencies and short text lengths in neuropsychological assessments. The method is evaluated on three datasets (DementiaBank, Cinderella, and Arizona-Battery) and compared against traditional linguistic metrics and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. The results demonstrate that CN features outperform linguistic metrics and BoW in classification tasks, with further improvements achieved through ensemble and multi-view learning.\nMain Contributions\n1. Introduction of Complex Networks for MCI Detection: The paper introduces the use of complex network features, enriched with word embeddings, as a lightweight and language-independent representation for detecting MCI. This approach is novel in the context of neuropsychological assessments and addresses the limitations of traditional linguistic features, such as their reliance on grammatical text and manual preprocessing.\n2. Empirical Evaluation Across Multiple Datasets: The authors evaluate their method on three distinct datasets, including English and Portuguese narratives, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach. The results show consistent improvements in accuracy compared to linguistic and BoW features.\n3. Ensemble and Multi-View Learning: The paper explores ensemble and multi-view learning to combine different feature spaces and classifiers, achieving significant accuracy improvements (e.g., 10% on the Cinderella dataset and 4.71% on the Arizona dataset).\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Use of Complex Networks: The application of complex network features enriched with word embeddings is a significant contribution. This approach effectively handles disfluencies and short text lengths, which are common in MCI speech transcripts, without requiring extensive manual preprocessing.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the proposed method on three datasets with varying characteristics, including different languages and narrative lengths. This strengthens the claim of the method's robustness and generalizability.\n3. Improved Classification Accuracy: The results demonstrate that CN features outperform traditional linguistic metrics and BoW features in most cases. The use of ensemble and multi-view learning further enhances performance, showcasing the potential of combining feature spaces.\n4. Practical Implications: The proposed method is lightweight and language-independent, making it suitable for large-scale and automated MCI assessments, which is a critical need in clinical settings.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the paper compares its results to linguistic and BoW features, it does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for MCI detection. This makes it difficult to contextualize the performance improvements.\n2. Interpretability of Complex Network Features: The interpretability of the complex network features is not thoroughly discussed. While the method achieves good results, understanding how these features relate to cognitive impairment could strengthen the clinical relevance of the work.\n3. Dataset Limitations: The datasets used in the study are relatively small, particularly the Cinderella and Arizona datasets. This raises concerns about the scalability and generalizability of the method to larger and more diverse populations.\n4. Threshold Selection for Word Embedding Enrichment: The process for selecting the cosine similarity threshold for enriching networks with word embeddings is not fully justified. A more systematic approach or sensitivity analysis would improve the robustness of the method.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art approaches for MCI detection, such as those using deep learning or advanced acoustic features?\n2. Can you provide more insights into the interpretability of the complex network features? For example, which specific topological properties are most indicative of MCI?\n3. How does the method perform on larger datasets or datasets with more diverse linguistic and demographic characteristics?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper introduces a promising approach for MCI detection, leveraging complex networks and word embeddings. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the interpretability of features, would further strengthen the contribution."
