The model leverages the interaction between content and discourse to improve performance on both tasks. A variation of the model is also presented, where discourse relations are treated as latent variables. Experimental results on the AMI and ICSI meeting corpora demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms SVM-based baselines in both phrase selection and discourse relation prediction. Additionally, the paper evaluates the model's utility in predicting consistency of understanding (COU) among team members, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.\nMain Contributions\n1. Joint Modeling of Content and Discourse: The primary contribution is the development of a joint model that simultaneously predicts salient phrases and discourse relations, outperforming SVM-based baselines. This approach is novel in its ability to integrate content and discourse structure, filling a gap in prior work which treated these tasks independently.\n2. Latent Discourse Relation Modeling: The paper introduces a variation of the model that treats discourse relations as latent variables, enabling the use of the model in scenarios where gold-standard discourse labels are unavailable. This is a practical and scalable solution for large datasets.\n3. Application to Consistency of Understanding (COU): The paper demonstrates the utility of the model in predicting COU, a higher-level task that evaluates team alignment in decision-making. Features derived from the model significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art methods.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Joint Modeling Framework: The integration of content and discourse prediction into a single framework is innovative and addresses a key limitation in prior work. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the benefits of this approach.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The model is evaluated on multiple tasks (phrase selection, discourse relation prediction, and COU prediction) and across two widely used datasets (AMI and ICSI), showcasing its versatility and robustness.\n3. Practical Contributions: The latent discourse variation makes the model applicable to real-world scenarios where annotated discourse structures are unavailable, significantly enhancing its practical utility.\n4. Strong Baseline Comparisons: The paper compares its model against strong baselines, including SVMs and state-of-the-art methods, and provides statistically significant improvements.\n5. Insightful Error Analysis: The paper identifies key challenges, such as semantic variation and context dependency, and suggests potential directions for future work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization Beyond Meetings: While the model performs well on meeting corpora, its applicability to other types of dialogues (e.g., customer service or negotiations) is not explored. This limits the scope of the contribution.\n2. Complexity of Joint Inference: The proposed joint inference process is computationally expensive due to the large search space. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of runtime performance or scalability to larger datasets.\n3. Dependence on Predefined Discourse Structures: Although the model can operate without gold-standard discourse labels, it still relies on predefined tree structures for discourse units. The robustness of the model to alternative discourse representations is not discussed.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model perform on other dialogue types, such as customer service transcripts or negotiation dialogues? Could the joint modeling approach generalize to these domains?\n2. What is the runtime complexity of the joint inference process, and how does it scale with larger datasets or longer discussions?\n3. Could alternative discourse representations (e.g., graph-based structures) be used instead of tree structures? If so, how would this impact the model's performance?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed model. However, further exploration of the model's scalability and applicability to diverse dialogue types would strengthen its impact. Overall, the contributions are significant, and the work is a valuable addition to the field of dialogue analysis."
