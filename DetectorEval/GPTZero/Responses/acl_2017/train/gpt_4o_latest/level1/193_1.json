            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper presents TUPA (Transition-based UCCA Parser), the first parser for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA), a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation framework. UCCA poses unique challenges for parsing due to its structural properties, including reentrancy (DAG structures), discontinuities, and non-terminal nodes. The authors propose a novel transition-based parsing approach that incorporates a custom transition set and features derived from bidirectional LSTMs. The parser is evaluated on in-domain and out-of-domain UCCA corpora, demonstrating its superiority over existing parsers for related tasks. The authors also highlight the broader applicability of their method to other semantic DAG parsing tasks.\nMain Contributions\n1. Development of TUPA, the First UCCA Parser: The paper introduces a novel transition-based parser specifically designed to handle UCCA's unique structural properties, such as reentrancy, discontinuities, and non-terminal nodes. This is a significant contribution, as no existing parser supports the conjunction of these properties.\n2. Novel Transition Set and Features: The authors propose an extended transition set tailored to UCCA's requirements, including operations for creating remote edges and handling discontinuities. They also introduce a BiLSTM-based feature extractor that enhances the parser's performance.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The evaluation demonstrates that TUPA outperforms strong baselines, including bilexical graph parsers and tree parsers, in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. The parser achieves high F-scores on primary and remote edges, showcasing its effectiveness for UCCA parsing.\nStrengths\n1. Addressing a Clear Gap in the Literature: The paper fills a critical gap by providing the first parser for UCCA, enabling the framework's broader application in NLP tasks. The parser's ability to handle complex semantic structures is a notable advancement.\n2. Technical Novelty: The proposed transition set and integration of BiLSTM-based features are innovative and well-motivated. These contributions are likely to inform future work on parsing DAG-based semantic representations.\n3. Strong Empirical Results: The parser achieves impressive performance, particularly on remote edges, where existing parsers struggle. The results are robust across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.\n4. Broader Applicability: The authors convincingly argue that their method can generalize to other semantic DAG parsing tasks, making it a valuable contribution beyond UCCA parsing.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Generalization: While the authors claim that the parser can generalize to other semantic frameworks, this is not empirically demonstrated. A comparison with other DAG-based semantic representations (e.g., AMR) would strengthen the paper.\n2. Complexity of the Transition Set: The extended transition set, while effective, introduces significant complexity. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational efficiency and scalability of the approach.\n3. Limited Error Analysis: The paper does not provide a thorough error analysis to identify specific challenges or failure cases in parsing UCCA structures. This would help clarify areas for future improvement.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide empirical evidence or experiments to demonstrate the parser's generalizability to other semantic frameworks, such as AMR or SDP?\n2. How does the computational efficiency of TUPA compare to existing parsers, particularly in terms of runtime and scalability for large datasets?\n3. Could you elaborate on the impact of the \"ratio\" feature introduced as a regularizer? How critical is this feature to the parser's performance?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and addresses a significant challenge in semantic parsing. The proposed parser is a valuable contribution to the field, and its broader applicability makes it a promising direction for future research. However, addressing the weaknesses identified above would further strengthen the work."
