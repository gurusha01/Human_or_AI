            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of dependency parsing for Singlish, an English-based creole with significant lexical and syntactic deviations from standard English. The authors construct a Singlish dependency treebank of 1,200 sentences under the Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme and propose a neural stacking approach to integrate English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser trained on the Singlish treebank. The resulting parser achieves an unlabeled attachment score (UAS) of 84.21%, representing a 36.51% relative error reduction. The authors also release their annotated treebank, parser, and source code for public use.\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n1. Singlish Dependency Treebank: The creation of a 1,200-sentence dependency treebank annotated under the UD scheme is a significant resource for low-resource language processing. The authors carefully address the unique grammatical features of Singlish, such as topic prominence, copula deletion, and discourse particles, providing a robust linguistic foundation for future research.\n2. Neural Stacking for Knowledge Transfer: The use of neural stacking to incorporate English syntactic knowledge into the Singlish parser is a novel and effective approach. This method respects the distributional differences between Singlish and English, leading to substantial performance improvements.\n3. Empirical Evaluation and Open Resources: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their parser, including error analysis across different syntactic categories, and make their resources publicly available, which is a valuable contribution to the NLP community.\nStrengths\n1. Resource Creation: The Singlish dependency treebank is a valuable addition to the field, addressing a significant gap in resources for creole languages. The authors' detailed annotation process and adherence to UD guidelines ensure high-quality data.\n2. Innovative Methodology: The neural stacking approach demonstrates strong empirical results, with a 36.51% error reduction in parsing accuracy. This method could be extended to other low-resource languages and creoles, showcasing its broader applicability.\n3. Thorough Evaluation: The paper provides comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons with baseline models, error analysis across unique Singlish grammatical features, and an investigation of distributed lexical semantics. These analyses offer deep insights into the challenges and solutions for parsing Singlish.\n4. Open-Source Contribution: By releasing their treebank, parser, and source code, the authors enable reproducibility and further research, aligning with the values of the NLP community.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Dataset Size: While the Singlish treebank is a valuable resource, its size (1,200 sentences) is relatively small compared to treebanks for major languages. This limitation may restrict the generalizability of the parser to broader Singlish usage.\n2. Evaluation on Downstream Tasks: The paper focuses solely on dependency parsing and does not evaluate the impact of the parser on downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or information extraction, which could strengthen the case for its practical utility.\n3. Lack of Comparison with Other Transfer Learning Methods: While the neural stacking approach is effective, the paper does not compare it with alternative transfer learning techniques, such as multilingual embeddings or zero-shot parsing, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the parser perform on Singlish sentences with high lexical borrowing from non-English languages (e.g., Malay, Tamil)? Are there plans to incorporate additional linguistic resources for these languages?\n2. Could the neural stacking approach be extended to incorporate syntactic knowledge from other creoles or regional languages? If so, what challenges might arise?\n3. Have you considered evaluating the parser on downstream tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, information extraction) to demonstrate its broader applicability?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and addresses an important problem in low-resource NLP. The combination of linguistic insights, computational methods, and resource creation makes it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, addressing the weaknesses mentioned above could further enhance the impact of the work."
