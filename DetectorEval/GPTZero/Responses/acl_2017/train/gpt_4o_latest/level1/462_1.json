            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the problem of financial volatility prediction by leveraging sentiment analysis on 10-K annual disclosures of companies, combined with factual market data. The authors propose a novel approach that incorporates state-of-the-art Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models enhanced with word embeddings to improve sentiment analysis. Additionally, they explore various fusion methods to integrate textual and market data, and analyze sector-specific characteristics of financial reports. The primary contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Enhanced Sentiment Analysis with Word Embeddings: The paper introduces an innovative extension of traditional IR term weighting schemes by incorporating word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. This approach significantly improves volatility prediction accuracy compared to prior methods.\n \n2. Fusion of Textual and Market Data: The authors propose and evaluate multiple fusion strategies (early fusion, stacking, and MKL) to combine textual features with factual market data. Their results demonstrate that combining these modalities improves prediction performance, particularly in long-term forecasting.\n3. Sector-Specific Analysis: The paper provides a detailed analysis of sector-specific risk factors and investigates the potential of training models tailored to individual sectors. While the general model outperforms sector-specific models due to data limitations, the study highlights the unique characteristics of different sectors and their implications for volatility prediction.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Methodology: The use of word embeddings to extend term weighting schemes is a significant advancement over prior approaches. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of this method in improving prediction accuracy.\n \n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper conducts extensive experiments, including cross-validation, temporal validation, and sector-specific analyses. The use of multiple baselines (e.g., GARCH, prior text-based methods) strengthens the validity of the findings.\n3. Practical Relevance: The focus on long-term volatility prediction and the integration of textual and market data address real-world challenges in financial forecasting. The findings have clear implications for both academia and industry.\n4. Sector-Level Insights: The analysis of sector-specific risk factors provides valuable insights into the heterogeneity of financial reports. The identification of ambiguous terms and their sector-dependent meanings is particularly noteworthy.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Data for Sector-Specific Models: While the paper acknowledges that sector-specific models underperform due to data scarcity, it does not explore potential solutions, such as transfer learning or data augmentation, which could mitigate this issue.\n2. Computational Complexity of Fusion Methods: The MKL method, while promising, is computationally expensive. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion of its scalability or feasibility for large-scale applications.\n3. Interpretability of Results: Although the paper highlights the importance of certain terms (e.g., \"fire,\" \"beneficial\") in specific sectors, it lacks a systematic analysis of how these terms influence model predictions. A more detailed exploration of feature importance could enhance interpretability.\n4. Generalizability: The dataset is limited to U.S. stock market reports, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other markets or regions. This limitation is not explicitly discussed.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered using transfer learning or other techniques to address the data scarcity issue in sector-specific models? If not, how do you plan to address this limitation in future work?\n \n2. Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the MKL method compared to other fusion approaches? How scalable is it for larger datasets?\n3. How robust is your method to changes in the financial lexicon over time? For example, how would it handle the emergence of new terms or concepts in financial reports?\n4. Have you explored the potential of incorporating additional textual features, such as syntactic or contextual information, beyond bag-of-words representations?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes meaningful contributions to the field of financial volatility prediction and demonstrates the value of combining textual and market data. However, addressing the limitations related to sector-specific modeling, scalability, and interpretability could further strengthen the work."
