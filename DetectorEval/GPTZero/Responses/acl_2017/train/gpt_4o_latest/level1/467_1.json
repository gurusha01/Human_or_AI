            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel self-learning framework for learning bilingual word embeddings with minimal bilingual resources. The method iteratively refines a dictionary and embedding mapping, starting with a small seed dictionary (as few as 25 word pairs) or even an automatically generated numeral list. The authors claim that their approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on richer bilingual resources, such as large dictionaries or parallel corpora. The primary contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Self-Learning Framework: The iterative self-learning framework is the central contribution. It effectively uses structural similarities between embedding spaces to refine mappings and dictionaries, achieving strong results even with minimal bilingual evidence.\n2. Minimal Resource Requirement: The method demonstrates that high-quality bilingual embeddings can be learned using only a 25-word dictionary or a numeral list, significantly reducing the reliance on bilingual data.\n3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Reduction in Resource Requirements: The ability to achieve competitive results with as little as a 25-word dictionary or a numeral list is a major strength. This makes the method highly applicable to low-resource language pairs, where large bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora are unavailable.\n2. Simplicity and Efficiency: The proposed method is simple to implement and computationally efficient. The authors use an analytical solution for embedding mapping and vectorized dictionary induction, ensuring scalability.\n3. Strong Empirical Results: The method consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art approaches in bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity tasks, even when using minimal resources.\n4. Theoretical Insight: The paper provides a clear explanation of the implicit optimization objective being solved by the self-learning framework. This theoretical grounding strengthens the validity of the approach and opens avenues for further research.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Evaluation on Diverse Language Pairs: While the paper evaluates the method on three language pairs (English-Italian, English-German, and English-Finnish), it does not test on more typologically diverse or low-resource languages, such as those with non-Latin scripts or significant morphological differences.\n2. Dependence on Initial Seed Quality: Although the method performs well with small seed dictionaries, the authors acknowledge that random initialization performs poorly. This highlights a dependence on the quality of the initial seed, which could be a limitation in truly unsupervised scenarios.\n3. Lack of Comparison to Recent Unsupervised Methods: The paper does not compare its results to recent advancements in fully unsupervised bilingual embedding methods, such as adversarial approaches. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative novelty and competitiveness of the proposed method in the broader context of unsupervised learning.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the method perform on typologically distant language pairs, such as English-Chinese or English-Arabic? Does the structural similarity assumption hold in such cases?\n2. Could the proposed framework be extended to handle non-linear transformations, and if so, how would this impact performance and computational efficiency?\n3. Have you considered incorporating additional weak signals (e.g., cognates or phonetic similarities) to improve performance in cases where even a small seed dictionary is unavailable?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and provides a thorough explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical underpinnings. The experiments are comprehensive within the scope of the chosen language pairs, but further evaluation on more diverse languages and a comparison to recent unsupervised methods would strengthen the work. Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of bilingual word embeddings, particularly for low-resource scenarios."
