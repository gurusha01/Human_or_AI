            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions \nThis paper addresses the challenge of zero-resource neural machine translation (NMT) by proposing a novel teacher-student framework. The method assumes that parallel sentences in a source-pivot language pair and pivot-target language pair should have close probabilities of generating a target sentence. The proposed approach directly trains a source-to-target NMT model (\"student\") using a pivot-to-target NMT model (\"teacher\") and a source-pivot parallel corpus. The authors introduce both sentence-level and word-level teaching strategies to guide the student model, avoiding the error propagation and inefficiency issues inherent in pivot-based methods. Experimental results on the Europarl and WMT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in BLEU scores over state-of-the-art pivot-based and multilingual approaches.\nThe main contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Teacher-Student Framework for Zero-Resource NMT: The paper introduces a novel framework that directly trains a source-to-target NMT model without parallel corpora, leveraging a teacher model and source-pivot data. This approach eliminates the need for two-step decoding, addressing error propagation and computational inefficiency.\n2. Word-Level and Sentence-Level Teaching Strategies: The authors propose two distinct strategies for guiding the student model, with word-level teaching (via sampling) showing superior performance by introducing greater data diversity.\n3. Empirical Validation and State-of-the-Art Results: The proposed method achieves significant BLEU score improvements (e.g., +3.29 BLEU on Spanish-French and +3.15 BLEU on German-French) over existing zero-resource methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple datasets and language pairs.\n---\nStrengths \n1. Innovative Framework: The teacher-student framework is a novel and elegant solution to the zero-resource NMT problem, addressing key limitations of pivot-based methods (e.g., error propagation and inefficiency).\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides thorough experimental results on multiple datasets (Europarl and WMT) and language pairs, demonstrating consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines.\n3. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed word-level sampling method not only outperforms pivot-based and multilingual methods but also rivals standard NMT models trained on parallel corpora, highlighting its practical utility.\n4. Theoretical and Practical Insights: The paper offers a clear theoretical foundation (e.g., translation equivalence assumptions) and practical implementation details (e.g., beam search, sampling), making the approach reproducible and interpretable.\n5. Low-Resource Adaptability: The method is shown to be effective even with limited source-pivot data, making it applicable to real-world low-resource scenarios.\n---\nWeaknesses \n1. Limited Analysis of Word-Level Sampling: While word-level sampling achieves the best results, the paper does not fully explore why it outperforms other methods or the trade-offs between data diversity and KL divergence.\n2. Scalability Concerns: The computational cost of word-level sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo estimation) is not thoroughly discussed, particularly for large-scale datasets or high-resource languages.\n3. Assumption Validation: While the translation equivalence assumptions are empirically validated, the analysis is limited to specific datasets and may not generalize to more diverse or morphologically complex languages.\n4. Comparison with Multilingual Methods: The paper briefly compares its approach to multilingual NMT methods but does not explore hybrid approaches that combine multilingual training with the proposed framework.\n---\nQuestions to Authors \n1. How does the performance of the proposed method vary with different pivot languages? For example, would a morphologically rich pivot language affect the results?\n2. Could the teacher-student framework be extended to multilingual scenarios, where multiple pivot languages are available?\n3. How does the computational cost of word-level sampling compare to sentence-level methods and pivot-based approaches in practice?\n---\nOverall Recommendation \nThis paper makes a significant contribution to zero-resource NMT by introducing a novel and effective teacher-student framework. The strong empirical results, combined with the practical applicability of the method, make it a valuable addition to the field. However, further analysis of the word-level sampling method and scalability considerations would strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
