            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper presents an automated scoring and support system for Japanese short-answer tests, specifically designed for the new National Center Test for University Entrance Examinations. The system combines machine learning (Random Forests) with human oversight to evaluate short written answers based on semantic similarity and surface-level criteria. The authors conducted experiments on social studies test items and demonstrated that the system achieves a reasonable level of agreement with human raters, with score differences within one point for 70\"\"90% of the data. The paper claims to address the technical challenges of short-answer scoring by incorporating both surface-level and semantic features into the scoring process.\nThe primary contributions of the paper, as I see them, are: \n1. Development of a Hybrid Scoring System: The integration of automated scoring with human oversight provides a practical approach to addressing the limitations of purely automated systems, particularly in handling nuanced semantic judgments. \n2. Use of Random Forests for Multi-Level Classification: The adoption of Random Forests for scoring demonstrates the system's ability to handle multiple predictors and classify scores across different levels effectively. \n3. Evaluation on Real-World Data: The system was tested on actual test items from a nationwide trial examination, providing evidence of its applicability in real-world educational settings.\nStrengths: \n1. Practical Relevance: The system addresses a critical need in the Japanese education system, where short-answer tests are being introduced as part of university entrance exams. The hybrid approach aligns well with the practical requirements of ensuring scoring accuracy while maintaining efficiency. \n2. Robust Methodology: The use of Random Forests is well-justified, given its ability to handle multiple predictors and provide insights into variable importance. The inclusion of both surface-level and semantic features enhances the system's robustness. \n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides detailed performance metrics, including probabilities of score agreement within one point and variable importance rankings, which lend credibility to the system's effectiveness. \n4. Flexibility in Scoring Criteria: The system's ability to handle synonyms, partial phrases, and mandatory phrases demonstrates its adaptability to various test formats and scoring requirements.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Generalization Beyond Social Studies: The system's evaluation is restricted to social studies test items, which require less nuanced semantic understanding compared to subjects like Japanese literature. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence of the system's scalability to more complex domains. \n2. Reliance on Human Oversight: While the hybrid approach is practical, the system's reliance on human raters for final judgment limits its potential for full automation. This aspect could reduce its scalability for large-scale testing scenarios. \n3. Imbalanced Training Data: The paper acknowledges that many written answers received zero scores, which likely affected the machine learning model's performance. The lack of well-balanced training data is a significant limitation that could hinder the system's accuracy in real-world applications. \n4. Lack of Novelty in Core Techniques: While the system is well-implemented, the core techniques (e.g., Random Forests, cosine similarity) are standard and do not represent a significant methodological advancement.\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does the system perform on more semantically complex subjects like Japanese literature, where textual entailment and nuanced understanding are critical? \n2. What steps have been taken to address the imbalance in training data, and how does this affect the system's generalizability? \n3. Could the system be extended to handle essay-length responses, or is it strictly limited to short-answer formats? \nAdditional Comments: \nOverall, this paper provides a practical solution to a pressing problem in educational assessment. However, its contributions are primarily in application rather than methodological innovation. Further work is needed to demonstrate the system's scalability and applicability to more complex test items."
