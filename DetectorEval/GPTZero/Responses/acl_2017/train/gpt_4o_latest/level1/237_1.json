The authors construct sentiment dimensions within high-dimensional vector spaces and calculate word polarities based on cosine distances from reference vectors. The proposed methods are evaluated against the PMI-IR algorithm (Turney, 2002) and demonstrate superior performance. The study also compares two popular embedding models, Word2Vec and GloVe, to assess their effectiveness in sentiment analysis tasks. The primary contributions of this work are:\n1. Introduction of a sentiment dimension in vector space models: The paper innovatively applies dimensionality reduction (PCA) to identify a sentiment axis in high-dimensional word embeddings, enabling the calculation of sentiment orientations for individual words.\n2. Empirical comparison of unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches: The study evaluates the effectiveness of unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, demonstrating that the semi-supervised Word2Vec model achieves the highest accuracy (66%) in sentiment classification tasks.\n3. Robustness against data sparsity: The proposed methods, particularly those based on dense vector modeling (Word2Vec), outperform PMI-IR and GloVe in handling data sparsity, a common challenge in collocation-based sentiment analysis.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Methodology: The introduction of a sentiment dimension in vector space models is a creative and theoretically grounded approach. By leveraging PCA, the authors provide a principled way to extract sentiment information from word embeddings.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper rigorously compares its methods against a well-established baseline (PMI-IR) and across two embedding models (Word2Vec and GloVe). The results are well-documented, with clear visualizations and statistical correlations.\n3. Practical Implications: The proposed methods are shown to be more data-efficient and robust to sparsity compared to PMI-IR, making them suitable for real-world applications where labeled data or large corpora may be unavailable.\n4. Reproducibility: The authors provide detailed descriptions of their experimental setup, including datasets, parameter settings, and evaluation metrics, which enhances the reproducibility of the work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Performance Compared to Supervised Approaches: While the proposed methods outperform PMI-IR, their classification accuracy (maximum 66%) falls short of state-of-the-art supervised models, which typically achieve over 80% accuracy. This limits the practical competitiveness of the approach.\n2. Suboptimal Reference Vector Construction: The reliance on simple vector averaging for constructing reference vectors may not fully capture the sentiment domain. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not explore alternative strategies in depth.\n3. Lack of Generalization Across Domains: The experiments are limited to movie review datasets (IMDB and Stanford Sentiment Treebank). It is unclear how well the proposed methods generalize to other domains or languages, which could affect their broader applicability.\n4. Insufficient Analysis of GloVe's Poor Performance: While the paper highlights that GloVe underperforms compared to Word2Vec, it does not provide a thorough analysis of why this is the case, beyond speculating about collocation-based limitations.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered alternative methods for constructing reference vectors, such as supervised fine-tuning or clustering techniques, to improve the representation of sentiment polarity?\n2. How do you anticipate your methods would perform on datasets from different domains (e.g., product reviews, social media posts) or in languages other than English?\n3. Could you provide more insights into why GloVe consistently underperforms compared to Word2Vec? Are there specific characteristics of the embedding models that explain this discrepancy?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper presents a promising direction for unsupervised and semi-supervised sentiment analysis using vector space models. While the results do not yet rival supervised approaches, the methods are innovative and address key challenges like data sparsity. Further exploration of reference vector construction and domain generalization could significantly enhance the impact of this work."
