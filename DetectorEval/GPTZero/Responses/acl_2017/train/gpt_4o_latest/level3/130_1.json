            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions:\nThis paper explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and complex network (CN) modeling to identify Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in patients based on speech transcripts. The authors propose a novel approach by enriching CNs with word embeddings to improve the representation of short texts often produced in neuropsychological assessments. The study evaluates its methodology on three datasets, including English and Portuguese narratives, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 85%. The primary contributions of this work are: \n1. The integration of complex networks and word embeddings for MCI detection, which outperforms traditional linguistic metrics in individual classifier performance. \n2. The demonstration of ensemble and multi-view learning methods to enhance classification accuracy, particularly in under-resourced languages like Portuguese. \n3. The provision of a lightweight, language-independent representation for automated MCI detection, reducing reliance on manual preprocessing. \nStrengths:\n1. Innovative Use of Complex Networks: The paper introduces a creative methodology by combining CNs with word embeddings, which is particularly effective for handling short, disfluent texts. This approach is promising for applications in neuropsychological assessments. \n2. Focus on Under-Resourced Languages: By including Portuguese datasets, the study addresses a significant gap in MCI detection research, which is often limited to English. This inclusion broadens the applicability of the proposed method. \n3. Improvement Through Multi-View Learning: The use of ensemble and multi-view learning demonstrates a thoughtful approach to improving classification accuracy, with notable gains in the Cinderella and ABCD datasets. \nWeaknesses:\n1. Overly Detailed Introduction and Literature Review: The introduction and related work sections are excessively detailed, including references that are tangential to the paper's core contributions. These sections could be compressed to improve readability and focus. \n2. Lack of Clarity in Methodology: The source of word embeddings and training data is not clearly specified, raising concerns about reproducibility and the validity of the results. Additionally, the handling of out-of-vocabulary words and the combination of CNs with linguistic metrics require further elaboration. \n3. Dataset Limitations: The datasets are relatively small (e.g., 20 MCI and 20 control patients for the Portuguese Cinderella dataset), which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the study would benefit from including translated examples to demonstrate cross-linguistic applicability. \nTechnical Comments:\n1. Typographical errors such as \"PLN -> NLP\" and repeated words should be corrected. \n2. Formatting issues in Table 3 and DOI references need to be resolved. \n3. The transcription norms and preprocessing steps should be clarified, particularly for the Portuguese datasets. \nQuestions to Authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the source and training of the word embeddings used in this study? \n2. How does the proposed method handle out-of-vocabulary words, and how does this impact the accuracy of the enriched networks? \n3. Could you elaborate on the rationale behind the choice of thresholds for cosine similarity in enriching CNs? \nConclusion: \nThis paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of automated MCI detection, particularly for under-resourced languages. However, significant revisions are needed to improve clarity, address methodological gaps, and enhance the paper's overall impact. With these improvements, the work has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to cognitive health diagnostics."
