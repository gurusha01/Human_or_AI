            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the task of entity disambiguation/linking (EDL) by introducing an intermediate layer of \"mention senses\" to bridge textual mentions and knowledge base entities. The proposed approach involves two steps: (1) mapping mentions to mention senses and (2) mapping mention senses to entities, with embeddings jointly trained for words, mention senses, and entities. The authors claim that this multi-prototype mention embedding model effectively handles mention ambiguity and achieves state-of-the-art results on a benchmark dataset for entity linking.\nThe primary contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Introduction of Mention Senses: The concept of mention senses as an intermediate layer between mentions and entities is novel, though its added value over direct mention-to-entity mapping remains unclear.\n2. Joint Embedding Framework: The joint training of word, mention sense, and entity embeddings is a technically sound contribution that aligns with current deep learning practices.\n3. Empirical Results: The paper demonstrates improved performance on a benchmark dataset for entity linking, suggesting the practical utility of the approach.\nStrengths\n1. Technical Soundness: The joint embedding framework is well-aligned with modern deep learning methodologies, and the inclusion of a smoothing parameter (Section 6.4.2) is a thoughtful addition that enhances the robustness of the model.\n2. Empirical Validation: The reported improvements in entity linking performance on a benchmark dataset are a positive indicator of the method's effectiveness.\n3. Focus on Ambiguity: The paper tackles the important challenge of mention ambiguity in text-knowledge integration, which is a critical issue in EDL.\nWeaknesses\n1. Unclear Rationale for Mention Senses: The paper does not sufficiently justify the need for the intermediate layer of mention senses over a direct mention-to-entity mapping. It is unclear what unique role mention senses play and how they differ from entities in practice.\n2. Lack of Detail on Mention Senses: The process for creating and differentiating mention senses is inadequately described. The paper does not clarify how many unique words mention senses contribute beyond entity profiles, leaving their utility ambiguous.\n3. Incorrect Claim of Novelty: The claim in Section 6 about being the first to address mention ambiguity in text-knowledge integration is factually incorrect, as similar tasks have been evaluated in TAC KBP challenges. The authors' dismissal of this prior work is unsatisfactory.\n4. Evaluation Focus: The authors emphasize embedding quality over application performance. However, embedding quality should ultimately be judged by its impact on downstream tasks, such as entity linking.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you clarify the specific added value of mention senses compared to entities? How do they differ in terms of functionality and representation?\n2. How are mention senses created and differentiated? What criteria are used to define them, and how many unique words do they contribute beyond entity profiles?\n3. Why was a two-step process chosen over a direct mention-to-entity mapping? What specific challenges does the intermediate layer address?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper has potential but requires significant clarification and justification of its core contributions, particularly the role and necessity of mention senses. Additionally, the authors should acknowledge prior work in TAC KBP challenges and position their approach more accurately within the existing literature."
