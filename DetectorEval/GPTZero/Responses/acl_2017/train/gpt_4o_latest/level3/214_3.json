The authors propose a novel macro-micro unified discourse representation schema and annotate 97 news wire articles, providing a valuable resource for discourse structure analysis. Preliminary experiments on discourse relation and primary-secondary relation recognition demonstrate the potential of the proposed schema and dataset. The contributions of this work, as I see them, are:\n1. Macro-Micro Unified Schema: The integration of macro discourse structures with micro-level structures like RST is a significant theoretical advancement, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of discourse.\n2. Dataset Release: The annotated MCDTB dataset is a valuable resource for the NLP community, with potential applications in machine translation, summarization, and question answering.\n3. Preliminary Experimental Validation: The experiments provide initial evidence of the utility of the proposed schema and corpus for discourse structure analysis tasks.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Integration of Macro and Micro Structures: The proposed macro-micro unified schema fills a critical gap in discourse analysis by combining logical semantics and pragmatic functions. This approach complements existing theories like RST and Van Dijk's macrostructure theory, offering a holistic view of discourse.\n2. Dataset Utility: The release of the MCDTB dataset is a significant contribution, as annotated corpora for macro discourse structures are scarce. This dataset has the potential to benefit a wide range of NLP applications, including summarization and sentiment analysis.\n3. Practical Annotation Strategy: The combination of top-down and bottom-up annotation strategies is well-justified and aligns with human reading habits, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive annotation process.\n4. Preliminary Results: The experimental results, though limited, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed schema and provide a foundation for future research.\nWeaknesses\n1. Insufficient Comparisons with CDTB: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison between the proposed MCDTB and the existing Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB). This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the novelty and advantages of the proposed work over prior resources.\n2. Unclear Distinction Between Primary-Secondary Relationships and Nuclearity: The distinction between the primary-secondary relationships proposed in this work and the concept of nuclearity in RST is not clearly articulated. This lack of clarity may confuse readers and hinder the adoption of the proposed schema.\n3. Incomplete Experimental Methodology: The experimental setup is not described in sufficient detail. For instance, the choice of features, classifiers, and evaluation metrics could be elaborated further to enable reproducibility and better assess the validity of the results.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed MCDTB compare quantitatively and qualitatively to the existing CDTB in terms of coverage, annotation quality, and utility for downstream tasks?\n2. Could you clarify how the primary-secondary relationships differ from nuclearity in RST, particularly in terms of their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications?\n3. What specific steps were taken to address the imbalanced distribution of discourse relations in the dataset, beyond the re-sampling strategy mentioned?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper presents an interesting and valuable contribution to discourse analysis, particularly in the context of Chinese language processing. However, addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly the lack of comparisons with CDTB and the unclear distinction between primary-secondary relationships and nuclearity, would significantly strengthen the work."
