            "inputText": "Review\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to character-level language modeling by leveraging visual features extracted from character images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework is particularly aimed at addressing challenges in processing rare or unseen characters in logographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The authors combine visual embeddings with traditional one-hot encodings and evaluate their model on a Wikipedia title classification task. The main contributions of the paper, in order of significance, are:\n1. Novel Use of Visual Features: The paper proposes a unique method of encoding characters based on their visual appearance, which is particularly relevant for logographic languages. This approach is generalizable to other languages and writing systems.\n2. Fusion of Visual and Symbolic Embeddings: The authors explore multiple fusion strategies (early, late, and fallback fusion) to combine visual and symbolic embeddings, demonstrating complementary strengths of the two representations.\n3. Qualitative Insights: The paper provides insightful visualizations of character embeddings, highlighting the model's ability to capture semantic and visual similarities among characters.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Idea: The use of visual features for character embeddings is a novel and promising direction, especially for logographic languages where character composition carries semantic and phonetic information.\n2. Promising Results for Rare Characters: The model shows improved performance on rare and unseen characters, addressing a critical limitation of traditional character embedding methods.\n3. Qualitative Analysis: The visualizations of character embeddings and occlusion sensitivity analyses provide compelling evidence of the model's ability to focus on semantically meaningful parts of characters.\n4. Generalizability: The proposed approach is not limited to specific languages and could be extended to other writing systems, including historical scripts.\nWeaknesses\n1. Incremental Gains: While the idea is novel, the experimental results show only minor improvements over the baseline, particularly in overall classification accuracy. This limits the practical impact of the proposed method.\n2. Evaluation Task Misalignment: The chosen evaluation task (Wikipedia title classification) does not directly test the model's ability to handle rare or unseen characters, which is the core claim of the paper. A more targeted evaluation would strengthen the argument.\n3. Reproducibility Concerns: The paper lacks sufficient details about the baseline implementation, making it difficult for others to reproduce the results. For example, the exact configurations of the baseline embeddings are not described.\n4. Statistical Significance: The paper does not report statistical significance for the observed improvements, leaving the robustness of the results unclear.\n5. Underexplored Unseen Character Evaluation: While the experiment on unseen characters is promising, it is underexplored and should be emphasized more in the evaluation.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide more details about the baseline implementation, including hyperparameters and training configurations, to improve reproducibility?\n2. Have you conducted statistical significance tests to validate the improvements reported in the experiments?\n3. Why was Wikipedia title classification chosen as the evaluation task, and how does it directly test the model's ability to handle rare or unseen characters?\n4. Could you explore the impact of different fallback fusion thresholds and justify the choice of the current threshold (0)?\nAdditional Comments\n- Figure 4 is difficult to interpret and should be revised for clarity. Highlighting the specific contributions of the model in the figure would be helpful.\n- Adding translations to Figure 6 would make the results more accessible to non-Chinese speakers.\n- Exploring alternative evaluation tasks, such as rare character prediction or low-resource language modeling, could better demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents a novel and promising idea, the limited empirical gains, misaligned evaluation task, and reproducibility concerns weaken its overall impact. I recommend major revisions to address these issues before acceptance."
