            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a kernel-based method, Propagation Tree Kernel (PTK), and its context-sensitive extension (cPTK) for detecting rumors in microblog posts by leveraging propagation tree structures. The authors propose modeling the diffusion of tweets as propagation trees, capturing high-order patterns that differentiate rumor types (false, true, unverified, and non-rumors). The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and early detection performance, as demonstrated on two real-world datasets (Twitter15 and Twitter16). The paper's primary contributions are:\n1. Propagation Tree Kernel (PTK): A novel kernel-based method that captures structural, linguistic, and temporal patterns in propagation trees for rumor detection.\n2. Context-Sensitive PTK (cPTK): An extension that incorporates propagation paths for enhanced context-sensitive modeling, achieving superior performance across rumor types.\n3. Finer-Grained Classification: The method addresses a more challenging multi-class problem (false rumor, true rumor, unverified rumor, and non-rumor) rather than the traditional binary classification.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Effectiveness: The kernel-based approach is innovative and effectively captures high-order propagation patterns, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and early detection tasks. The integration of structural, linguistic, and temporal features is a significant advancement over existing methods.\n2. Early Detection Capability: The method demonstrates superior performance in early rumor detection, achieving high accuracy within the first 24 hours of propagation. This is crucial for mitigating the spread of misinformation.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method. The comparison with multiple baselines highlights the strengths of PTK and cPTK.\n4. Finer-Grained Classification: The focus on a multi-class problem adds practical value, as it aligns with real-world scenarios where rumors can have varying levels of veracity.\nWeaknesses\n1. Clarity of Mathematical Explanations: The mathematical formulations in Section 4, particularly the recursive computation of subtree similarity and the context-sensitive extension, are not always clear. Additional examples or visualizations could improve understanding.\n2. Dataset Availability: The datasets used in the study are not publicly available, which limits reproducibility and future research. The authors should consider releasing the annotated propagation trees to the research community.\n3. Presentation Issues: The paper contains typos, missing information, and inconsistent formatting, which detracts from its readability. For instance, Figure 5 is too small and difficult to interpret, and some equations lack sufficient explanation.\n4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the method is effective, the paper does not discuss its potential limitations, such as scalability to larger datasets or sensitivity to noisy data.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more intuitive examples or visualizations to clarify the recursive computation of subtree similarity in PTK and cPTK?\n2. Are there plans to release the annotated datasets to facilitate reproducibility and further research?\n3. How does the method scale with larger datasets or more complex propagation structures? Have you tested its computational efficiency in such scenarios?\nAdditional Comments\nThe proposed method is a significant contribution to rumor detection, particularly in its ability to capture high-order structural patterns and address finer-grained classification. However, addressing the clarity of mathematical explanations, improving the presentation, and making the dataset publicly available would further strengthen the paper."
