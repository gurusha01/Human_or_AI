            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper presents a systematic investigation of different context types (linear vs. dependency-based) and context representations (bound vs. unbound) for learning word embeddings. The authors evaluate these configurations across six tasks, including intrinsic evaluations (word similarity and analogy) and extrinsic tasks (POS tagging, chunking, NER, and text classification). The primary contribution is the comprehensive experimental framework that highlights the nuanced trade-offs between context types and representations. The work provides actionable insights for selecting context configurations based on task requirements, making it a valuable resource for the word embedding community. Additionally, the authors contribute a new toolkit, word2vecPM, to facilitate reproducibility and further research.\nStrengths: \n1. Thorough Experimental Design: The paper evaluates context configurations across a diverse set of tasks, ensuring that the findings are broadly applicable. The use of downstream tasks rather than solely intrinsic evaluations enhances the practical relevance of the results.\n2. Actionable Insights: The paper provides clear guidelines on when to use specific configurations. For example, unbound representations are shown to excel in syntactic word analogy tasks, while bound representations are essential for sequence labeling tasks.\n3. Reproducibility: The release of the word2vecPM toolkit is a commendable effort to ensure transparency and enable further research.\n4. Novelty in Context Representation Analysis: The paper goes beyond existing studies by systematically comparing bound and unbound representations, which is an underexplored area in the literature.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Insufficient Justification for Objective Function Modifications: The authors modify the GBOW and GSG objective functions but fail to provide adequate justification or comparison with the original objectives. This raises concerns about the validity of the reported results.\n2. Lack of Hyperparameter Analysis: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the impact of hyperparameter settings on task performance. Given the sensitivity of word embeddings to hyperparameters, this omission weakens the robustness of the conclusions.\n3. Model Description Ambiguity: Sections 3.4 and 3.5 lack clarity regarding whether the same model is used across tasks. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the findings.\n4. Terminology Issues: The use of \"unbounded\" to describe bag-of-words contexts is potentially confusing and should be revised for clarity. Similarly, inconsistent terminology (e.g., \"Deps\" vs. \"DEPS\") detracts from the paper's readability.\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. What motivated the modifications to the GBOW and GSG objective functions? How do these changes affect the comparability of your results with prior work? \n2. Could you provide a detailed analysis of the hyperparameter settings used in your experiments and their impact on the results? \n3. Are the same models used across all tasks, or are task-specific adjustments made? If the latter, how do these adjustments influence the conclusions?\nConclusion: \nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to the study of word embeddings by systematically analyzing context types and representations. However, the lack of justification for objective function modifications and insufficient hyperparameter analysis are significant weaknesses. Addressing these issues in the author response period would strengthen the paper's validity and impact. With revisions, this work has the potential to serve as a practical guideline for the community."
