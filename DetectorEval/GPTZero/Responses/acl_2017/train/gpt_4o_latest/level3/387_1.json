            "inputText": "Review of the Research Paper\nSummary and Contributions:\nThis paper presents a novel framework for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection by combining textual features with cognitive features derived from eye-movement data. The authors propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture that automatically learns features from both modalities, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The key contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Novel Multimodal Framework: The integration of gaze data with textual features through a CNN-based approach is innovative, addressing challenges in capturing semantic and pragmatic subtleties in text classification tasks.\n2. Empirical Evaluation: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework on two publicly available datasets enriched with eye-movement information, showing improvements over both traditional feature-based systems and CNNs relying solely on text.\n3. Insightful Analysis: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the learned features, offering insights into how gaze data contributes to the classification tasks.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper tackles a unique and underexplored problem by leveraging cognitive features for NLP tasks, which is highly relevant given the increasing interest in multimodal approaches.\n2. Well-Structured and Clear Presentation: The paper is well-written, with a logical organization, detailed explanations of the methodology, and illustrative plots that enhance understanding.\n3. Empirical Rigor: The results are convincing, with statistically significant improvements over baseline methods for most configurations. The inclusion of comparisons with prior work strengthens the validity of the claims.\n4. Insightful Observations: The discussion on the interplay between gaze and text features, as well as the visualization of learned features, adds depth to the analysis and highlights the potential of the proposed approach.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Incomplete Abstract and Introduction: The abstract and introduction fail to adequately reflect the mixed findings, particularly the weaker performance on one dataset and the limited improvement for sarcasm detection. This could mislead readers about the overall impact of the work.\n2. Unclear Treatment of Sarcastic Utterances: It is unclear whether sarcastic utterances were included in the sentiment analysis task and how the model performed on them. This lack of clarity limits the interpretability of the results.\n3. Justification for Gaze Features: The utility of gaze data for non-sarcastic sentiment classification is not fully justified. While the results show improvements, the paper does not provide a strong theoretical or empirical rationale for why gaze features are beneficial in these cases.\n4. Overfitting Concerns: The overfitting observed on Dataset 2 raises questions about the generalizability of the proposed approach. The authors acknowledge this issue but do not explore solutions such as hyperparameter tuning or additional regularization techniques.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. Were sarcastic utterances included in the sentiment analysis task? If so, how did the model perform on these examples compared to non-sarcastic ones?\n2. Could you provide more justification or evidence for the utility of gaze data in non-sarcastic sentiment classification? Are there specific patterns in the gaze data that contribute to the improvements?\n3. How does the proposed framework perform when applied to larger datasets or datasets without gaze information? Could the learned features from gaze data be transferred to text-only scenarios?\nRecommendation:\nDespite some limitations, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach that advances the state of the art in sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. The combination of textual and cognitive features is promising, and the results, while mixed, demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework. With revisions to address the identified weaknesses, this paper would make a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
