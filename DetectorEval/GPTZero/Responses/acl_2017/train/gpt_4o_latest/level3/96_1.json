            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, presenting a dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets paired with five human-provided non-sarcastic interpretations each. The authors propose Sarcasm SIGN, a system based on the Moses machine translation (MT) framework, which targets sentiment words to generate non-sarcastic interpretations. The key contributions of the paper are:\n1. Dataset Creation: The authors provide a publicly available parallel corpus for sarcasm interpretation, which is a valuable resource for future research in this domain.\n2. Novel Task Definition: The paper formalizes sarcasm interpretation as a monolingual MT task, which is a meaningful extension of existing work on sarcasm detection.\n3. Sarcasm SIGN System: The proposed system leverages sentiment word clustering and de-clustering to improve the adequacy and sentiment polarity of sarcasm interpretations, outperforming the baseline Moses system on human evaluation metrics.\nStrengths\n1. Dataset and Task Novelty: The dataset is the first of its kind, and the authors provide clear documentation of its creation process, including the use of Fiverr workers for human annotations. This dataset fills a significant gap in the field and will likely catalyze further research on sarcasm interpretation.\n2. Human-Centric Evaluation: The use of human judgments for fluency, adequacy, and sentiment polarity provides a robust evaluation framework that complements traditional MT metrics like BLEU and ROUGE.\n3. Focused Algorithm Design: Sarcasm SIGN's emphasis on sentiment words is a thoughtful approach to the task, as sentiment transformation is central to sarcasm interpretation. The clustering and de-clustering methodology is well-motivated and demonstrates clear improvements in adequacy and sentiment accuracy.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Dataset Statistics: The paper does not provide essential dataset statistics, such as average tweet length, vocabulary size, or distribution of sentiment words. These details are crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics and its challenges.\n2. Baseline Selection: Moses, while a reasonable starting point, is not an ideal baseline for this task due to the small dataset size and its inability to handle rare words effectively. A comparison with neural MT systems trained with data augmentation or pre-trained language models would have been more informative.\n3. Unsupported Assumptions: The assumption that sarcastic tweets differ from their non-sarcastic interpretations primarily in sentiment words is not sufficiently supported by data. Many sarcastic tweets require contextual or world knowledge for accurate interpretation, which SIGN struggles to handle.\n4. Statistical Evidence Missing: The authors do not provide statistical evidence to justify their focus on sentiment words. For instance, an analysis of how often sarcasm hinges on sentiment words versus other linguistic features would strengthen their argument.\n5. BLEU Score Limitations: The paper relies on BLEU and other n-gram-based metrics, which are known to be unreliable for short texts and tasks involving paraphrasing. This limitation is acknowledged but not adequately addressed.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide additional dataset statistics, such as average tweet length, vocabulary size, and the distribution of sentiment words?\n2. How does Sarcasm SIGN perform on sarcastic tweets that lack explicit sentiment words or require world knowledge for interpretation? Do you have plans to address these cases in future work?\n3. Have you considered using pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) or data augmentation techniques to address the dataset's small size and improve rare word handling?\nConclusion\nWhile the paper makes notable contributions in defining the task and providing a dataset, its methodological assumptions and baseline choices limit its impact. The Sarcasm SIGN system shows promise but requires further refinement to handle more complex sarcasm cases. The paper is a valuable starting point for sarcasm interpretation research, but addressing the identified weaknesses would significantly enhance its contribution."
