            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach to weakly supervised cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) without requiring human annotation in the target language. The authors propose two methods: (1) an annotation projection approach with a heuristic data selection scheme to improve the quality of noisy projection-labeled data, and (2) a representation projection approach that leverages cross-lingual word embeddings to directly transfer an English-trained NER model to other languages. Additionally, two co-decoding schemes (probability-based and ranking-based) are introduced to combine the outputs of these methods. The paper demonstrates that the combined system outperforms state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER approaches on multiple datasets.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Heuristic Data Selection for Annotation Projection: A novel data selection scheme that significantly improves the quality of weakly labeled data, particularly for languages with low alignment accuracy.\n2. Representation Projection with Frequency-Weighted Embedding Mappings: An enhancement of Mikolov's cross-lingual embedding mapping approach by incorporating frequency weights, enabling better direct model transfer.\n3. Co-Decoding Schemes: Effective combination strategies that leverage the strengths of both projection-based approaches, achieving superior performance compared to individual methods.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Combination of Methods: The co-decoding schemes effectively integrate the annotation and representation projection approaches, resulting in consistent improvements across multiple languages and datasets.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors evaluate their methods on both in-house and public datasets, demonstrating robust performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines.\n3. Practical Relevance: The proposed methods address a critical challenge in multilingual NLP by eliminating the need for human-annotated data in the target language, making the approach highly scalable.\n4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the methods and detailed experimental results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Comparison with CBOW: While the authors propose a variant of Mikolov's CBOW model, they do not include results for the standard CBOW model, making it difficult to assess the relative improvements.\n2. Insufficient Analysis of Frequency-Weighted Projections: The differences between the proposed frequency-weighted projections and Mikolov's original method are not thoroughly analyzed, leaving the impact of this modification unclear.\n3. Evaluation Section is Brief: The evaluation section lacks in-depth discussion of the results, particularly in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More analysis of error cases and the performance of individual components would strengthen the paper.\n4. Statistical Significance: The paper does not report statistical significance tests, which are essential to validate the effectiveness of the proposed data selection scheme and co-decoding methods.\n5. Organization and Related Work: Section 4.4 (Related Work) should be integrated into a dedicated related work section rather than being embedded within the methodology. Additionally, Table 2 would be better placed in the evaluation section for clarity.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed frequency-weighted projection compare quantitatively to Mikolov's original method? Can you provide ablation results to isolate its impact?\n2. Why were results for the CBOW model omitted? Including these would help contextualize the improvements from your embedding variant.\n3. Have you considered using exponential decay for embeddings, as suggested in prior work? If so, how does it affect performance?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes significant contributions to cross-lingual NER and proposes practical solutions to a challenging problem. However, the lack of statistical significance tests and insufficient analysis of some key components slightly weaken the submission. With minor revisions to address these issues, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance."
