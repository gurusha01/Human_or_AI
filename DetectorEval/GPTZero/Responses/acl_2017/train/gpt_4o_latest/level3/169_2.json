            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel evaluation method for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems that addresses the longstanding issue of error type performance being measured only in terms of recall due to the lack of annotated system outputs. The authors propose a linguistically-enhanced alignment algorithm to extract edits between parallel original and corrected sentences and classify them using a rule-based framework that is dataset-independent. The primary contributions of this work are:\n1. A Dataset-Independent Rule-Based Classifier: The proposed classifier eliminates the need for labeled training data and provides deterministic and transparent error type classifications.\n2. Detailed Error Type Evaluation: The method enables a granular analysis of GEC systems, including multi-token errors and specific error categories, which were previously underexplored.\n3. Human Validation of Error Tags: The classifier's outputs were rated as \"Good\" or \"Acceptable\" in over 95% of cases by human experts, demonstrating its reliability.\n4. Application to CoNLL-2014 Systems: The method was applied to the CoNLL-2014 shared task, providing the first detailed error type analysis of these systems.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Advancement in GEC Evaluation: The proposed method represents a major step forward in analyzing GEC system behavior, particularly by enabling precision computation by error type without requiring manual annotation.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates a wide range of GEC systems, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses across various error types.\n3. Robustness to Multi-Token Errors: The approach effectively handles multi-token errors, a challenging aspect of GEC evaluation.\n4. High Human Approval Rates: The classifier's outputs were validated by human experts, lending credibility to the method's reliability and accuracy.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Rule Transparency: The rules for deriving error types are not described in sufficient detail, which hinders replicability and adaptation to new datasets.\n2. Limited Classifier Evaluation: The evaluation of the classifier lacks a detailed error analysis, particularly regarding cases where human raters marked tags as \"Bad\" or \"Appropriate.\" This limits insights into areas for improvement.\n3. Language-Specific Focus: The method is evaluated only on English, and its adaptability to other languages, especially those with discontinuous error spans (e.g., German separable verbs), remains unclear.\n4. Gold vs. Auto Reference Comparison: The comparison between gold and auto references focuses on boundary alignment but neglects the impact on classification accuracy. Additionally, the significance testing methodology is not well-documented.\n5. Missing Raw Metrics: The absence of raw values for true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) limits the interpretability of system comparisons.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a detailed description of the rules used for error type classification? How were these rules designed, and what linguistic principles guided their development?\n2. How does your method handle discontinuous error spans, such as separable verbs in German or other morphologically complex languages?\n3. What specific steps can be taken to adapt your approach to non-English languages? Have you considered testing it on other datasets?\n4. Can you elaborate on the methodology used for significance testing in the gold vs. auto reference comparison? How robust are the results to variations in this methodology?\n5. Could you provide raw TP, FP, TN, and FN values for the evaluated systems to enable a more detailed comparison?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a promising and impactful contribution to GEC evaluation, particularly in its ability to provide detailed error type analyses and handle multi-token errors. However, the lack of transparency in rule derivation, limited classifier evaluation, and unclear generalizability to other languages are significant concerns. Addressing these issues would strengthen the paper's impact and replicability. Pending satisfactory responses to the questions above, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
