            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents KB-InfoBot, a multi-turn dialogue agent designed to facilitate user interactions with a Knowledge Base (KB) without requiring users to compose complex queries. The key contribution of the work is the introduction of a differentiable \"Soft-KB lookup\" mechanism, which replaces traditional symbolic KB queries with a probabilistic framework. This innovation enables the integration of KB access within an end-to-end trainable system, allowing reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize dialogue policies effectively. The paper also proposes a fully neural end-to-end (E2E) agent trained entirely from user feedback, showcasing its potential for personalized dialogue systems.\nThe contributions of the paper, ranked by significance, are:\n1. Soft-KB Lookup: The differentiable KB access mechanism is a substantial improvement over traditional hard lookups, enabling better policy discovery and end-to-end training.\n2. Two-Phase Training Approach: The combination of imitation learning and RL for joint optimization is a robust training strategy that balances exploration and stability.\n3. Empirical Evaluation: The paper provides extensive experiments with simulated and real users, demonstrating the advantages of Soft-KB over Hard-KB methods.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Differentiable KB Access: The Soft-KB lookup is a significant technical contribution that addresses the non-differentiability of traditional symbolic KB queries. This innovation is well-motivated and empirically validated, showing improvements in task success rates and rewards.\n2. Comprehensive Experimental Setup: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple KB sizes, simulated user evaluations, and real-user studies. The comparison between rule-based, RL-based, and E2E agents is insightful and highlights the trade-offs between these approaches.\n3. Practical Deployment Strategy: The proposed deployment strategy, where a rule-based or RL agent transitions to a personalized E2E agent over time, is pragmatic and aligns with real-world application needs.\n4. Strong Learning Capability of E2E Agent: Despite its limitations, the E2E agent demonstrates robust learning potential, particularly in adapting to noisy environments, which is crucial for personalization.\nWeaknesses\n1. Handcrafted Response Generation: The system is not fully end-to-end, as the response generation remains template-based. This limits the generalizability and scalability of the approach, particularly for diverse or open-domain tasks.\n2. Overfitting of E2E Agent: The E2E agent overfits to the simulator vocabulary and performs poorly in human evaluations. This raises concerns about its practical utility and the broader value of E2E learning compared to Soft-KB access.\n3. Limited Exploration of RL Algorithms: The use of the REINFORCE algorithm, known for high variance, is not well-justified. Alternative methods like actor-critic, which could potentially stabilize training, were not explored.\n4. Focus on E2E Learning: While the Soft-KB lookup is the most impactful contribution, the paper places significant emphasis on the E2E agent, which underperforms in real-user evaluations. A stronger focus on Soft-KB's performance improvements would have strengthened the narrative.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you elaborate on why actor-critic methods were not considered as an alternative to REINFORCE for RL training?\n2. How would the system handle scenarios where the KB is highly dynamic, with frequent updates or new entities being introduced?\n3. Can you provide more details on the limitations of the current E2E architecture and how you plan to address them in future work?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a significant contribution with its Soft-KB lookup mechanism and provides a well-rounded experimental evaluation. However, the handcrafted response generation and the underperformance of the E2E agent in real-user studies are notable limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, with a suggestion to shift the focus more towards the Soft-KB's performance and to address the limitations of the E2E agent in future iterations."
