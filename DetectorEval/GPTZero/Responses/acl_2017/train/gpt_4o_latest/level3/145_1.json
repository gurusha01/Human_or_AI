            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel approach for learning multimodal word distributions using Gaussian mixtures, addressing the limitations of unimodal Gaussian word representations in capturing polysemy. The proposed model, termed Word to Gaussian Mixture (w2gm), extends the work of Vilnis and McCallum (2014) by representing words as mixtures of Gaussians, where each component corresponds to a distinct word meaning. The authors employ an energy-based max-margin objective with an expected likelihood kernel as the energy function, ensuring analytic tractability and scalability. The model demonstrates superior performance on several benchmark tasks, including word similarity and entailment, and provides qualitative insights into polysemous word representations. Key contributions include:\n1. A multimodal Gaussian mixture framework for word embeddings, which effectively captures polysemy and reduces variance for ambiguous words.\n2. An energy-based training objective leveraging the expected likelihood kernel for efficient learning of multimodal distributions.\n3. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, showing improved performance over unimodal Gaussian embeddings and deterministic models like word2vec.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Expressiveness: The extension from unimodal to multimodal Gaussian embeddings is a significant advancement, allowing the model to better represent polysemous words. The qualitative results (e.g., Table 1) convincingly demonstrate this capability.\n2. Methodological Rigor: The use of the expected likelihood kernel as an energy function is well-motivated and ensures both analytic tractability and scalability. The authors also address practical challenges, such as numerical stability and initialization, in detail.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including comparisons with baseline models (e.g., word2vec, unimodal Gaussian embeddings) and state-of-the-art multiprototype approaches (e.g., Huang et al., 2012). The results on word similarity and entailment tasks are compelling.\n4. Scalability: The model is shown to scale efficiently to large corpora, with training on billions of tokens completed in days, which is a practical advantage over many probabilistic models.\nWeaknesses\n1. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper compares its results with some related approaches, the discussion of Tian et al. (2014) and other multiprototype models is limited. A more detailed comparison, both conceptually and empirically, would strengthen the paper.\n2. Missing Citations: The paper omits key references, such as Neelakantan et al. (2014) and Li and Jurafsky (2015), which also address polysemy in word embeddings. Including these citations and discussing their relevance would provide a more comprehensive context for the proposed work.\n3. Evaluation Gaps: The results of related approaches are not included in Tables 3 and 4, which makes it difficult to directly compare the proposed model's performance with prior work. Adding these baselines would enhance the clarity and impact of the evaluation.\n4. Performance Drop in SWCS Analysis: The observed performance drop of w2gm compared to w2g in the SCWS analysis is not adequately explained. This raises questions about the robustness of the proposed model in certain contexts.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you elaborate on the reasons behind the performance drop of w2gm compared to w2g in the SCWS analysis? Is this due to the choice of similarity metrics or the nature of the dataset?\n2. How does the proposed model compare with Neelakantan et al. (2014) and Li and Jurafsky (2015) in terms of methodology and performance? Are there specific advantages or limitations relative to these works?\n3. Have you considered extending the model to incorporate external lexical resources (e.g., WordNet) to further enhance the representation of polysemous words?\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a significant contribution to the field of word embeddings by introducing a multimodal Gaussian mixture framework that effectively addresses polysemy. While the methodology is robust and the results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with related work and additional baselines in the evaluation. Addressing these weaknesses would further solidify the impact of this work. Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, with minor revisions recommended."
