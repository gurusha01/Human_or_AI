            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to improve two-step machine translation, specifically targeting the Chinese-to-Spanish language pair. The key contributions of the work are:\n1. Decoupling Translation and Morphology Generation: The authors propose a two-step approach where translation is first performed into a morphologically simplified target language, followed by a deep learning-based morphology generation step to recover gender and number inflections.\n2. Novel Classification Architecture: The morphology generation module employs a hybrid architecture combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNN + LSTM), achieving high classification accuracy (98.4% for gender and 93.7% for number).\n3. Rescoring with Language Models: A rescoring step is introduced to select the best translation variant using a graph-based representation and a language model, further improving translation quality.\nThe method demonstrates significant improvements over baselines, achieving a 0.7 METEOR gain on a large corpus. The authors also claim language independence for their approach, though this is not empirically validated beyond the Chinese-Spanish pair.\n---\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Use of Deep Learning for Morphology Generation: The proposed CNN + LSTM architecture outperforms traditional methods like SVMs and random forests in classification tasks, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for sequence labeling in machine translation.\n2. Significant Translation Quality Improvement: The method achieves measurable gains in METEOR scores, particularly on the large corpus, highlighting its practical impact on translation quality.\n3. Challenging Language Pair: The focus on Chinese-to-Spanish, a relatively underexplored language pair, addresses a meaningful gap in machine translation research and provides insights into handling morphologically rich target languages.\n4. Rescoring Step: The integration of a language model for rescoring adds robustness to the system and demonstrates thoughtful consideration of translation quality beyond the initial classification.\n---\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Comparison with Standard Deep Learning Baselines: The paper does not compare its proposed CNN + LSTM architecture with widely used baselines like bidirectional LSTMs or transformer-based models, which are well-suited for sequence labeling tasks. This omission weakens the claim of novelty and superiority.\n2. Unclear Justification for Not Using RNNs in Standard Frameworks: While the authors propose a hybrid architecture, they do not adequately justify why standard RNN-based sequence labeling frameworks were not adopted or compared.\n3. Ambiguity in Rescoring Step: The rescoring process is insufficiently detailed. It is unclear whether n-best sentences or weighted graph paths are used, and how the language model is integrated into the graph-based approach.\n4. Impact of Word Embeddings: The paper notes that larger embeddings increase training time but does not discuss their impact on final results. This omission leaves questions about the trade-offs between computational cost and performance.\n5. Counterintuitive Results with Source Sentence Information: The negative impact of incorporating source sentence information is counterintuitive and requires further explanation, ideally with concrete examples or analysis.\n---\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Why were bidirectional LSTMs or transformer-based models not used or compared as baselines for the classification task? How does your architecture compare to these methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?\n2. Can you clarify the rescoring process? Are n-best sentences or weighted graph paths used, and how is the language model integrated into the graph-based representation?\n3. Why does adding source sentence information negatively impact classification accuracy? Can you provide examples or a deeper analysis to explain this phenomenon?\n4. How does the proposed method generalize to other language pairs? Have you tested it on any other morphologically rich target languages to validate the claim of language independence?\n---\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper contains numerous typos and grammatical errors, which detract from its readability and professionalism. A thorough proofreading is necessary to ensure its suitability for presentation. Additionally, terminology should be standardized (e.g., \"femenine\" should be corrected to \"feminine\"), and ambiguous phrases should be clarified."
