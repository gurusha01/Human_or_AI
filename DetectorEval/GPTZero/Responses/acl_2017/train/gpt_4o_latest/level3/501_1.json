            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-modal task, the Dual Machine Comprehension (DMC) task, which involves selecting the most appropriate textual description for a given image from a set of similar options. The authors propose an extensible algorithm for generating challenging decoys, create a large-scale dataset (MCIC) for the task, and conduct human evaluations to establish an upper bound on performance. The paper also benchmarks several baseline and advanced models, including a hybrid Vec2seq+FFNN architecture, and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on the DMC task and the image captioning task in a multi-task learning setting. The dataset and code are made publicly available, which could foster further research in this area.\nStrengths\n1. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it easy to follow the contributions and experimental setup. The motivation for the DMC task is clearly articulated, and the empirical results are presented with sufficient detail.\n2. Task Motivation: The proposed DMC task is well-motivated as a means to evaluate and improve the alignment of visual and linguistic representations. Its potential utility as a post-generation re-ranking method for image captioning models is compelling.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation, including human performance benchmarks, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies, which strengthen the validity of their claims.\n4. Multi-task Learning Insight: The positive correlation between DMC task performance and image captioning performance highlights the broader applicability of the proposed task and dataset.\nWeaknesses\n1. Decoy Generation Algorithm: The algorithm for generating decoys relies heavily on paragraph vector similarity and surface-level linguistic features, which may not always ensure that decoys are truly inappropriate. Some decoys could still be valid descriptions for the target image, undermining the task's reliability.\n2. Ground-Truth Label Validity: The validity of ground-truth labels is questionable, as human accuracy on the task is only 82.8%. This suggests that some decoys are indistinguishable from the true target, either due to dataset noise or inherent ambiguity in the task.\n3. Keyword Recognition Bias: The dataset may inadvertently favor models that rely on simple keyword matching, as many decoys can be filtered out based on obvious mismatches. This could limit the task's ability to evaluate deeper semantic understanding.\n4. Experimental Conclusions: While the authors claim a positive correlation between DMC and image captioning performance, the experimental setup does not fully address whether this improvement is due to the DMC task itself or other factors in the multi-task learning framework.\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting task and provides a strong empirical foundation, the concerns about the dataset and decoy generation algorithm significantly undermine the validity of the experimental conclusions. The reviewer leans toward rejecting the paper unless these issues are addressed. Specifically, the authors should:\n- Improve the decoy generation algorithm to ensure that decoys are both challenging and clearly inappropriate.\n- Provide additional analysis to validate the ground-truth labels and address the ambiguity in human performance.\n- Demonstrate that the dataset encourages models to go beyond keyword recognition, perhaps through additional experiments or dataset modifications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you address the concern that some decoys may be valid descriptions of the target image? Can you provide examples or additional analysis to validate the ground-truth labels?\n2. Have you considered alternative methods for generating decoys that rely on more sophisticated semantic or contextual understanding?\n3. How do you ensure that the dataset evaluates deeper semantic alignment rather than simple keyword recognition? Could you provide evidence or experiments to support this claim?\nAdditional Comments\nThe proposed task has potential, but addressing the dataset and algorithmic concerns is critical to its adoption as a reliable benchmark for vision-language comprehension."
