            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper introduces Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA) as a semantic parsing target and presents TUPA, a transition-based parser specifically designed for UCCA. UCCA is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation framework that supports complex structures such as reentrancy, discontinuity, and non-terminal nodes. The authors adapt existing transition-based parsing techniques with novel extensions to handle UCCA's unique properties, including a new transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs. The empirical evaluation demonstrates strong performance across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, outperforming credible baselines. The paper also highlights the potential of UCCA to inspire new approaches to semantic representation.\nThe primary contributions of this work are: \n1. Development of TUPA: The first parser specifically designed for UCCA, incorporating novel transitions and features to support general directed acyclic graph (DAG) parsing. \n2. Empirical Validation: Convincing experimental results showing TUPA's superiority over baseline parsers in both primary and remote edge prediction. \n3. Broader Implications: The parser's ability to handle UCCA's structural properties has implications for other semantic DAG parsing tasks and cross-linguistic applications.\nStrengths: \n1. Novelty and Design: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of parsing UCCA's complex structures, which are unsupported by existing parsers. The transition set and BiLSTM-based feature extraction are well-motivated and effectively implemented. \n2. Empirical Rigor: The evaluation is thorough, comparing TUPA to a range of baselines and demonstrating significant improvements, especially in handling remote edges\"\"a key aspect of UCCA. The inclusion of out-of-domain evaluation strengthens the results. \n3. Cross-Linguistic Potential: UCCA's universal aspirations and its abstraction from syntactic details make it a promising framework for multilingual semantic parsing, even though this potential is not fully explored in the paper. \n4. Code Availability: The authors' commitment to releasing the code and models ensures reproducibility and facilitates future research.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Lack of Multilingual Evaluation: While UCCA is designed to be cross-linguistically applicable, the paper evaluates only English datasets. This is a significant limitation, as the universal applicability of the framework remains untested. \n2. Debatable \"Grammarless\" Claim: The authors describe their approach as \"grammarless,\" but UCCA's compositional abstract representation resembles a grammar. This claim could be better clarified or nuanced. \n3. Limited Discussion of Practical Applications: While the paper mentions potential applications (e.g., machine translation evaluation), it does not provide concrete examples or experiments to demonstrate the parser's utility in real-world tasks.\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does TUPA perform on non-English datasets, and what challenges do you anticipate in extending the parser to other languages? \n2. Can you elaborate on the \"grammarless\" nature of the model, given that UCCA defines a compositional structure? \n3. Have you considered integrating TUPA into downstream applications, such as machine translation or summarization, to evaluate its practical impact?\nConclusion: \nThis paper makes a significant contribution to semantic parsing by introducing a well-designed parser for UCCA and demonstrating its effectiveness. The lack of multilingual evaluation and the debatable \"grammarless\" claim are notable limitations, but they do not detract from the overall quality and impact of the work. I recommend acceptance, with the expectation that future work will address these limitations and further explore UCCA's potential in multilingual and applied contexts."
