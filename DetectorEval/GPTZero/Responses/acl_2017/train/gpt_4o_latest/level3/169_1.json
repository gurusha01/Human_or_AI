            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel method for automatically annotating Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) system outputs with explicit edit spans and error type information. The authors propose a rule-based framework that is dataset-independent, relying solely on automatically obtained linguistic features like POS tags and lemmas. The tool enables fine-grained evaluation of GEC systems, addressing a gap in the field where error type performance was previously limited to recall-based metrics. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach by analyzing system outputs from the CoNLL-2014 shared task, providing insights into system strengths and weaknesses across various error types. The main contributions of the paper are:\n1. A dataset-independent, rule-based framework for error type classification that eliminates the need for labeled training data.\n2. A detailed analysis of GEC system performance at the error type level using outputs from the CoNLL-2014 shared task.\n3. A publicly available tool for automatic annotation of GEC system outputs, which could standardize evaluation practices in the field.\nStrengths\n1. Practical Application: The proposed approach has clear utility for teachers, learners, and researchers, enabling a more detailed and actionable evaluation of GEC systems. This fine-grained analysis can guide system improvements and better address specific error types.\n2. Dataset Independence: The rule-based framework is designed to be dataset-agnostic, which is a significant advantage over machine learning approaches that require domain-specific training data. This makes the approach more adaptable and scalable across different datasets.\n3. Transparency and Consistency: The deterministic nature of the rule-based classifier ensures transparency in decision-making and avoids biases inherent in human or machine learning-based annotations. This consistency is a valuable contribution to the field.\nWeaknesses\n1. Superficial System Description: The paper provides insufficient details about the rules used in the framework, making it difficult to assess the novelty and robustness of the proposed method. For example, the rationale behind specific rule choices and their linguistic basis is not elaborated.\n2. Evaluation Methodology: The evaluation process has several shortcomings. The gold standard creation is not well-documented, and the reliance on rater averaging raises concerns about subjectivity. Additionally, the test data details are sparse, limiting reproducibility.\n3. Domain Dependency: Despite claims of reduced domain dependency, the use of manually created rules and test data introduces domain-specific biases. This undermines the claim of dataset independence.\n4. Error Categories: The decision to design a new set of error categories is not well-justified. Existing tagsets appear sufficient, and the added complexity of a new framework may not provide proportional benefits.\n5. Motivation Ambiguity: The paper lacks clarity in its primary motivation. It is unclear whether the focus is on the system, the error categories, or the evaluation of CoNLL-2014 outputs, leading to a fragmented narrative.\n6. Presentation Issues: The paper contains typos, unclear notations (e.g., \"50-70 F1\"), and inconsistent reference formatting, which detracts from its overall readability and professionalism.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details about the specific rules used in the classifier? How were these rules designed, and what linguistic principles guided their creation?\n2. Why was a new set of error categories deemed necessary? How does it improve upon existing frameworks, and what evidence supports its superiority?\n3. How do you address the potential domain dependency introduced by manually created rules and test data? Can you provide examples of how the framework performs across diverse datasets?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents a promising approach with practical applications, the lack of methodological clarity, questionable evaluation practices, and presentation issues significantly weaken its impact. I recommend a major revision to address these concerns before acceptance."
