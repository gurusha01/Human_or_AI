            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces WATSET, a novel graph-based approach for generating sense-disambiguated synsets from synonymy dictionaries and word embeddings. The method involves constructing a weighted graph of synonyms, applying word sense induction to disambiguate ambiguous terms, and performing fuzzy clustering to create synsets. The authors evaluate WATSET on four datasets (two each for English and Russian), demonstrating its performance against five state-of-the-art methods. The claimed contributions are:\n1. A meta-clustering algorithm that combines hard clustering with word sense induction to enable fuzzy clustering of ambiguous synonym graphs.\n2. A method that does not rely on pivot lexical resources like WordNet, making it more adaptable to under-resourced languages.\n3. Empirical evidence showing WATSET outperforms existing methods in terms of F-score on multiple datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with clear explanations of the methodology, experiments, and results. The inclusion of detailed comparisons with baseline methods strengthens the paper's credibility.\n2. Addressing Practical Challenges: The authors effectively address the issue of vocabulary mismatches between synonym dictionaries and gold standards, which is a common challenge in synset induction tasks.\n3. Empirical Validation: The evaluation is thorough, covering multiple datasets and languages, and demonstrates WATSET's robustness and adaptability, particularly for under-resourced languages like Russian.\n4. Reproducibility: The authors provide an open-source implementation of WATSET, which enhances the reproducibility of their results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Misrepresentation of Prior Work: The paper mischaracterizes prior resources like OmegaWiki, BabelNet, and UBY. For instance, OmegaWiki is incorrectly described as unstructured, and UBY is falsely claimed to rely on WordNet as a pivot. These inaccuracies undermine the paper's motivation and credibility.\n2. Overstated Criticism of BabelNet: The authors critique BabelNet's reliance on WordNet and error-prone mapping, but these criticisms are overstated and fail to acknowledge BabelNet's strengths, such as its multilingual coverage and integration of diverse resources.\n3. Limited Quantitative Comparison: While the paper critiques TWSI and JoBimText for including non-synonyms, it does not provide a quantitative comparison of this issue with WATSET, leaving the argument incomplete.\n4. Formatting and Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from minor formatting inconsistencies, such as the switching between Times and Computer Modern fonts, illegible figures/tables, and unclear puns. These issues detract from the overall readability.\nRevisions Needed\n1. The introduction and related work sections should focus more on the general problem of synset induction rather than specific criticisms of BabelNet and UBY.\n2. The authors should correct their mischaracterizations of prior resources and provide a more balanced discussion of their strengths and limitations.\n3. Quantitative comparisons with TWSI and JoBimText should be included to substantiate the claims about WATSET's superiority.\n4. Minor formatting issues should be addressed, and the date of the Wiktionary database dump should be specified for better reproducibility.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you clarify the specific advantages of WATSET over BabelNet in terms of multilingual scalability, given that BabelNet integrates multiple resources across languages?\n2. How does WATSET handle cases where synonymy dictionaries are sparse or incomplete? Would incorporating distributional similarity to enhance graph connectivity improve recall?\n3. Could you provide a quantitative comparison of the inclusion of non-synonyms in TWSI, JoBimText, and WATSET?\nConclusion\nThe paper presents a promising and well-validated approach to synset induction, particularly for under-resourced languages. However, its misrepresentation of prior work and overstated criticisms weaken its motivation. With revisions to address these issues and improve presentation, the paper would make a strong contribution to the field of lexical resource construction."
