            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel iterative self-learning framework for creating bilingual word embeddings with minimal bilingual resources. The primary contribution is the ability to achieve competitive results using as little as a 25-word seed dictionary or even an automatically generated list of numerals, significantly reducing the reliance on large bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. The method builds on existing dictionary-based mapping techniques, iteratively refining the mapping and dictionary until convergence. The authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the implicit optimization objective, demonstrating that the method leverages the structural similarity of embedding spaces. The experimental results on bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity tasks validate the approach, showing its robustness across language pairs with varying linguistic proximity.\nStrengths\n1. Minimal Resource Requirement: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance using extremely limited bilingual resources, making it particularly valuable for low-resource languages. This is a significant advancement over prior methods that require thousands of dictionary entries or parallel corpora.\n2. Simplicity and Generality: The proposed framework is simple yet effective, and it can be combined with any existing embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique. This generality enhances its applicability across different tasks and datasets.\n3. Theoretical Insight: The paper provides a clear theoretical explanation of the implicit optimization objective, offering valuable insights into why the method converges to meaningful solutions. This analysis strengthens the paper's scientific rigor.\n4. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments across multiple language pairs (English-Italian, English-German, and English-Finnish) demonstrate the robustness of the method. The results are particularly impressive for distant language pairs like English-Finnish, where structural similarity is weaker.\n5. Reproducibility: The authors provide sufficient details about the experimental setup and promise to release the code and resources, ensuring reproducibility.\nWeaknesses\n1. Error Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the method's failure cases. For example, it is unclear how the approach handles polysemy or different senses of the same word, which could impact performance in certain scenarios.\n2. Impact of Seed Word Frequency: The authors do not explore whether the frequency of seed words in monolingual corpora affects the quality of the learned embeddings. This could provide further insights into the method's limitations.\n3. German Compounds and Preprocessing: For languages like German, where compound words are prevalent, the paper does not address whether preprocessing (e.g., splitting compounds) could improve performance.\n4. Upper Bound Analysis: While the method performs well with minimal resources, the paper does not analyze its theoretical upper bound or how it compares to methods using richer bilingual resources. This would help contextualize the results.\n5. Convergence Behavior: Although the method converges reliably, the authors do not discuss potential adjustments to avoid poor local optima when using random initialization, which could make the method fully unsupervised.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the frequency of seed words in the monolingual corpora impact the performance of the method? Would using more frequent words as seeds lead to better results?\n2. How does the method handle polysemous words or words with multiple translations? Does it tend to favor one sense over others?\n3. For languages with prevalent compound words (e.g., German), would preprocessing steps like compound splitting improve the quality of the embeddings?\n4. Could you provide more details on the error cases where the method fails? For example, are there specific linguistic phenomena or language pairs where the approach struggles?\n5. Have you considered alternative initialization strategies to avoid poor local optima, especially when starting without any bilingual evidence?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a significant contribution to the field of bilingual word embeddings, particularly for low-resource languages. While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the method and its potential impact outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the lack of error analysis and additional discussions on the method's limitations."
