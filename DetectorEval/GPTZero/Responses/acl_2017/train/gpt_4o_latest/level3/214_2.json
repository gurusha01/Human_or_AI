The authors propose a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB), which annotates 97 news wire articles by integrating micro-level logical semantics and macro-level pragmatic functions. The primary contribution is the introduction of a unified framework that bridges micro and macro discourse structures, which has potential implications for discourse structure analysis and downstream NLP tasks. Secondary contributions include the annotation of a new corpus (MCDTB) and preliminary experiments on discourse relation and primary-secondary relation recognition, which evaluate the proposed schema.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Perspective on Discourse Structure: The redefinition of nuclearity into \"primary-secondary\" relationships and its extension to macrostructure is an interesting conceptual contribution. This perspective could inspire further research into discourse structure representation, especially in underexplored macro-level discourse analysis.\n2. Corpus Creation: The annotation of MCDTB provides a valuable resource for the community, particularly for Chinese discourse analysis, which has fewer resources compared to English. The corpus includes both micro and macro-level annotations, which is a commendable effort.\n3. Preliminary Evaluation: The authors provide experimental results on primary-secondary relation recognition and discourse relation recognition, demonstrating the potential utility of their corpus and schema.\nWeaknesses\n1. Inaccurate and Outdated Related Work: The paper misrepresents established discourse theories, such as RST and Van Dijk's macrostructure theory, and relies on outdated references in the computational models section. This undermines the credibility of the theoretical foundation.\n2. Unclear Annotation Description: The macrostructure annotation process lacks clarity, and the statistical reporting is insufficient. For instance, the agreement metrics are only briefly mentioned and limited to leaf nodes, leaving the overall annotation quality ambiguous.\n3. Limited Evaluation: While the main contribution is the integration of macro and micro structures, the evaluation focuses primarily on micro-level relations. The lack of baseline comparisons and detailed analysis of macro-level performance weakens the empirical validation.\n4. Unexplained Features: Certain features used in the experiments, such as \"hierarchical characteristics,\" are not adequately explained, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the methodology.\n5. Presentation Issues: The paper contains grammatical errors, and Figure 7 lacks accompanying text to explain the example, which hampers readability and understanding.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you address the inaccuracies in your description of RST and Van Dijk's macrostructure theory? Could you clarify how your approach differs from these theories?\n2. Can you provide more details on the annotation process, particularly for non-leaf nodes, and elaborate on how agreement was calculated?\n3. Why was the evaluation limited to micro-level relations? Could you include baseline comparisons and a more detailed analysis of macro-level performance in future work?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents a novel perspective and a valuable resource, the theoretical inaccuracies, lack of clarity in annotation, and limited evaluation significantly weaken its impact. I recommend major revisions to address these issues before acceptance."
