            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces TUPA (Transition-based UCCA Parser), the first parser for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA), a semantic representation framework. UCCA poses unique challenges due to its support for reentrancy, discontinuous structures, and non-terminal nodes, properties not fully supported by existing parsers. The authors propose a novel transition system tailored to these challenges, coupled with three different classifiers (sparse perceptron, feedforward neural network, and BiLSTM). The experimental results demonstrate that TUPA, particularly with the BiLSTM classifier, achieves superior performance compared to baseline parsers on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. The work also highlights the limitations of existing bilexical and tree-based parsing methods for UCCA-like representations.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Novel Transition System for UCCA Parsing: The proposed transition system effectively handles UCCA's unique structural properties, including reentrancy and discontinuities, setting a new standard for semantic DAG parsing.\n2. Thorough Experimental Evaluation: The authors rigorously evaluate TUPA across multiple settings, demonstrating its superiority over existing parsers and highlighting the challenges of UCCA parsing.\n3. Relevance to Broader Semantic Parsing: The work has implications beyond UCCA, as the transition system could inform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Novelty and Impact: This is the first parser specifically designed for UCCA, addressing a critical gap in semantic parsing research. The novel transition system is well-motivated and demonstrates strong performance, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation, comparing TUPA to a range of baseline parsers, including bilexical graph parsers and tree-based parsers. The inclusion of both in-domain and out-of-domain experiments strengthens the validity of the results.\n3. Well-Written and Clear: The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the challenges of UCCA parsing, the design of the transition system, and the experimental results. This makes the work accessible to researchers unfamiliar with UCCA.\n4. Broader Applicability: While focused on UCCA, the proposed transition system has the potential to generalize to other meaning representations, such as AMR and SDP, making the work relevant to a broader audience.\n5. Open-Source Contribution: The authors' commitment to releasing their code and models ensures reproducibility and encourages further research in this area.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Generalization: While the authors mention that the transition system could inform parsers for other frameworks like AMR or SDP, they do not provide concrete evidence or experiments to support this claim. This leaves an open question about the broader applicability of the approach.\n2. Complexity of the Transition System: The proposed transition system, while effective, is relatively complex, with multiple transitions and constraints. This could make it challenging to adapt or extend for other frameworks or tasks.\n3. Focus on English Data: The experiments are conducted only on English datasets, limiting the demonstration of UCCA's cross-linguistic applicability. Evaluating TUPA on non-English UCCA corpora would strengthen the paper's claims about its generality.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could the proposed transition system be directly applied to other frameworks like AMR or SDP, or would modifications be required? If so, what specific changes might be needed?\n2. Have you considered evaluating TUPA on UCCA corpora in other languages to demonstrate its cross-linguistic applicability?\n3. How does the complexity of the transition system impact parsing speed, particularly for larger datasets or real-time applications?\nRecommendation\nThis paper addresses an important problem in semantic parsing and provides a well-motivated, novel solution with strong empirical results. Despite minor limitations, the work is a significant contribution to the field and should be accepted for publication."
