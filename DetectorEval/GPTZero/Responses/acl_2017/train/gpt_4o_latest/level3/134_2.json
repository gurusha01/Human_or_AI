The authors frame AM as both a token-based dependency parsing problem and a sequence tagging problem, incorporating multitask learning to improve performance. The paper's primary contributions are: \n1. Demonstrating that neural models, particularly sequence labeling and LSTM-ER, outperform the ILP-based state-of-the-art approach, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features and constraints. \n2. Highlighting the ineffectiveness of dependency parsing for AM at the token level, contrary to its success in coarser-grained systems. \n3. Establishing that multitask learning significantly enhances sequence labeling models, particularly when auxiliary tasks like claim detection are included. \n4. Providing a comprehensive evaluation of neural models for AM, including detailed experimental setups and hyperparameter optimization. \nStrengths: \n1. Thorough Evaluation and Comparisons: The paper rigorously evaluates multiple neural approaches using F1 scores for both components and relations, offering a detailed comparison with the ILP-based baseline. The inclusion of paragraph- and essay-level evaluations adds depth to the analysis. \n2. Novel Insights on Model Performance: The finding that sequence labeling and LSTM-ER outperform dependency parsing and ILP-based models is significant. The paper also highlights the robustness of LSTM-ER at the paragraph level and the benefits of multitask learning for sequence labeling models. \n3. Comprehensive Supplementary Material: The inclusion of details on model training, hyperparameter optimization, and experimental setups demonstrates a commitment to reproducibility and transparency. \n4. Practical Implications: The work provides actionable recommendations for framing AM tasks, such as decoupling component and relation detection for improved performance, and offers guidance for handling short versus long documents. \nWeaknesses: \n1. Potential Data Leakage: The concern about overlapping topics between training and test sets raises questions about the validity of the reported results. While this issue affects all models equally, it warrants further clarification and mitigation. \n2. Clarity Issues: Certain sections, such as tree-to-graph reconstruction and the decoupling of relations and entities, are not explained clearly, potentially limiting accessibility for readers unfamiliar with these concepts. \n3. Order of Presentation: The sequence of presenting approaches (e.g., sequence labeling before dependency parsing) could be reorganized for better readability and logical flow. \n4. Out-of-the-Box Model Concern: The LSTM-ER model, while effective, is an off-the-shelf application from related work. This raises questions about the novelty of the contribution, as the paper primarily adapts existing methods rather than proposing fundamentally new ones. \n5. Cross-Paragraph Relations: The paper does not address whether paragraph-based models might miss cross-paragraph relations, which could be critical for certain AM tasks. \nQuestions to Authors: \n1. Could you provide more details on how the potential data leakage between training and test sets was addressed? \n2. How do you envision adapting the proposed models to capture cross-paragraph relations, especially for essay-level tasks? \n3. Given that LSTM-ER is an off-the-shelf model, what specific adaptations or innovations in your implementation contribute to its success in this context? \nRecommendation: \nDespite the noted weaknesses, the paper is a thorough and well-executed investigation of neural approaches to argumentation mining. Its contributions to understanding the performance of various models and its practical recommendations for framing AM tasks make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend this paper for publication, contingent on addressing the clarity and data leakage concerns."
