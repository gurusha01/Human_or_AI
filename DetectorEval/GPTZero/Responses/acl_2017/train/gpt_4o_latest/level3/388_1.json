            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces UDEPLAMBDA, a semantic interface for Universal Dependencies (UD) that maps natural language to logical forms in a largely language-independent manner. The primary contribution lies in proposing an automated conversion of UD grammar structures into semantic logical forms using an inside-out approach with intermediate forms. The authors evaluate UDEPLAMBDA on semantic parsing for question answering (QA) against Freebase, demonstrating its multilingual capabilities by providing German and Spanish translations of WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets. The results show that UDEPLAMBDA outperforms baselines across languages and datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GraphQuestions for English.\nStrengths\n1. Multilingual Applicability: The paper addresses an important challenge in natural language understanding by proposing a framework that works across multiple languages with minimal language-specific modifications. This is a significant step forward in creating universal semantic representations.\n \n2. Clear and Simple Conversion Procedure: The conversion from dependency structures to logical forms is well-defined, cleaner, and simpler compared to its predecessor, DEPLAMBDA. The use of a non-neural approach is refreshing amidst the dominance of neural methods, offering interpretability and scalability.\n3. Empirical Evaluation: The evaluation on two QA datasets in three languages is thorough, with UDEPLAMBDA consistently outperforming baselines. The multilingual translations of datasets provided by the authors are a valuable resource for future research.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Semantic Depth: The logical forms generated by UDEPLAMBDA are not truly semantic but rather close rewrites of dependency structures. Key semantic features such as quantification, negation, modals, inter-event relationships, and temporal indexing are either missing or inadequately addressed. This limits the expressiveness and utility of the framework in handling complex linguistic phenomena.\n2. Event Role Assignment Flaws: The assignment of event roles based strictly on syntactic roles is a critical flaw. For example, the inability to canonicalize relations like \"John broke the window\" and \"The window broke\" highlights the lack of semantic generalization.\n3. Insufficient Analysis of QA Results: The paper does not provide sufficient detail on the types of questions that UDEPLAMBDA fails to handle or answers incorrectly. This lack of error analysis limits insights into the framework's weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n4. Unacknowledged Limitations: While the paper briefly mentions some limitations, it does not adequately acknowledge or discuss the implications of its shortcomings. For instance, the absence of semantic specificity and reliance on unlexicalized information are not critically examined. Referencing frameworks like FrameNet could have provided a roadmap for addressing these issues in future work.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide examples of specific question types or linguistic phenomena that UDEPLAMBDA struggles to handle? How do these limitations affect performance across the datasets?\n2. How does the framework handle ambiguous or underspecified dependency structures? Are there plans to incorporate lexical or contextual information to improve semantic specificity?\n3. Could you elaborate on how UDEPLAMBDA could be extended to address missing semantic features such as quantification, negation, or temporal indexing?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper makes a valuable contribution to multilingual semantic parsing, the lack of true semantic depth and insufficient error analysis are significant concerns. The authors should acknowledge these limitations more explicitly and outline future directions to address them. With revisions, this work has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference."
