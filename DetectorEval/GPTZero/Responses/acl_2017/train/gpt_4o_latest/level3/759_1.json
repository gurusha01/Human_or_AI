The authors propose a novel framework that leverages the interaction between content and discourse structures, outperforming SVM-based classifiers on both tasks. The model is evaluated on two meeting corpora (AMI and ICSI), demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and F1 scores. Additionally, the paper explores practical applications, including meeting summarization and predicting team understanding consistency, showcasing the broader utility of the proposed approach. The authors also present a variation of the model that treats discourse relations as latent variables, enabling its use in scenarios where annotated discourse labels are unavailable.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. A novel joint modeling framework that integrates phrase selection and discourse relation prediction, achieving superior performance compared to SVM-based baselines.\n2. A demonstration of the model's utility in downstream tasks such as extractive summarization and team understanding consistency prediction, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.\n3. An exploration of a latent discourse variation, which broadens the applicability of the model to datasets lacking annotated discourse structures.\nStrengths\n1. Technical Rigor and Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides detailed technical explanations of the proposed model, including its learning and inference algorithms. The inclusion of feature descriptions and experimental setups enhances reproducibility.\n2. Experimental Performance: The model achieves significant improvements over SVM-based baselines in both phrase selection and discourse relation prediction tasks. The results are robust across multiple datasets (AMI and ICSI) and evaluation metrics.\n3. Broader Applications: The evaluation of the model in practical applications, such as extractive summarization and consistency prediction, highlights its versatility and potential impact. The ROUGE scores for summarization and the F1 improvements in consistency prediction are particularly noteworthy.\n4. Comparative Analysis: The paper provides thorough comparisons with related work, including baselines and state-of-the-art methods, which strengthens the validity of the results.\n5. Latent Discourse Variation: The inclusion of a model variation that treats discourse relations as latent variables is a valuable contribution, addressing the challenge of limited annotated data.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Intuitive Explanation: While the technical details are thorough, the paper lacks an intuitive explanation of how the joint modeling of phrase extraction and discourse relations enhances performance. A more accessible discussion of the interplay between content and discourse would benefit readers unfamiliar with the domain.\n2. Validity of SVM Comparisons: The paper does not explicitly justify the use of SVM-based classifiers as the primary baseline. While SVMs are a reasonable choice, discussing why they are representative of the state-of-the-art would strengthen the comparative analysis.\n3. Error Analysis and Limitations: Although the authors provide some error analysis, the discussion is limited. For example, the challenges in handling semantic variations (e.g., synonyms) and context-dependent discourse relations could be explored further, along with potential future directions to address these issues.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide a more intuitive explanation or visualization of how the joint modeling framework leverages the interaction between content and discourse relations to improve performance?\n2. Why were SVM-based classifiers chosen as the primary baseline for comparison? Are there other machine learning or deep learning methods that could serve as stronger baselines?\n3. How does the model handle cases where discourse relations are ambiguous or context-dependent? Are there specific features or mechanisms that address such challenges?\nRecommendation\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of dialogue analysis and meeting summarization. The proposed joint model demonstrates strong experimental performance and practical utility, making it a valuable addition to the literature. However, addressing the weaknesses\"\"particularly the lack of intuitive explanations and the justification of baselines\"\"would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
