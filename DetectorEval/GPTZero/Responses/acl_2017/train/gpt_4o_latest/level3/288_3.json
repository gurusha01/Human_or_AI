            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Main Contributions\nThis paper investigates how different writing tasks influence writing style and demonstrates the utility of stylometric analysis for reasoning-like text classification. Using the story cloze task as a case study, the authors show that stylistic features can effectively distinguish between three types of writing tasks: writing an entire story, writing a coherent story ending, and writing an incoherent story ending. The study establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze task, outperforming deep learning models by leveraging simple stylistic features and a logistic regression classifier. Additionally, the paper highlights the implications of these findings for NLP dataset design, particularly emphasizing the need to carefully consider task instructions to avoid unintended biases.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Stylometric Analysis for Task Differentiation: The paper demonstrates that stylistic features can capture subtle differences in writing style imposed by different writing tasks, achieving strong classification results without relying on story context.\n2. State-of-the-Art Performance on the Story Cloze Task: The proposed classifier achieves a significant improvement over prior benchmarks, and its combination with a neural language model further enhances performance.\n3. Insights for NLP Dataset Design: The discussion in Section 8 provides valuable guidance for designing NLP tasks, emphasizing the impact of task framing and author instructions on dataset quality.\nStrengths\n1. Clarity and Methodological Rigor: The paper is well-written, with a clear explanation of its methodology, experiments, and findings. The use of controlled experiments to validate the hypothesis is commendable.\n2. Non-Obvious Hypothesis Validation: The study proves a non-trivial hypothesis\"\"that writing tasks impose measurable stylistic differences\"\"using simple features and a linear classifier. This simplicity adds to the robustness and interpretability of the findings.\n3. Significant Implications for NLP: The paper's findings have broad implications for NLP, particularly in dataset design and task framing. The discussion in Section 8 is insightful and likely to influence future research in the field.\n4. Practical Contributions: The combination of stylistic features with neural models demonstrates a practical approach to improving performance on reasoning-like tasks, bridging the gap between traditional stylometry and modern deep learning techniques.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of a Clear Definition of \"Style\": The paper does not provide a formal definition of \"style,\" which is a central concept in the study. This omission makes it harder to generalize the findings or compare them with prior work.\n2. Limited Discussion on Feature Selection: While the paper identifies character n-grams as the most effective feature type, it does not provide sufficient discussion on why these features are particularly salient for distinguishing writing tasks.\n3. Choice of Stylistic Features: The paper does not justify its choice of stylistic features in detail or explore alternative feature sets. A more comprehensive analysis could strengthen the findings.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you define \"style\" in the context of this study, and how does this definition align with prior work in stylometry and NLP?\n2. Could you elaborate on why character n-grams are particularly effective for distinguishing between writing tasks? Are there theoretical or empirical reasons for this observation?\n3. Did you explore alternative stylistic features or feature selection methods? If so, how did they compare to the features used in this study?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of NLP by demonstrating the utility of stylometric analysis for text classification and providing actionable insights for dataset design. While the lack of a clear definition of \"style\" and limited discussion on feature selection are notable weaknesses, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality and impact of the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these issues."
