            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding (MPME) model that addresses the challenge of ambiguity in entity mentions by learning multiple sense embeddings for each mention. The model integrates textual context and knowledge base information into a unified semantic space, offering a novel approach to disambiguation. The authors propose a language model-based disambiguation mechanism and demonstrate the effectiveness of their embeddings through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The primary contributions of this work, as I see them, are:\n1. Unified Modeling of Entities, Mentions, and Senses: The paper integrates entity, mention, and sense modeling into a single framework, which is a novel and promising direction for semantic representation.\n2. Simple and Broadly Applicable Training Procedure: The proposed method is straightforward to train, making it adaptable to a wide range of tasks.\n3. Empirical Results on Entity Linking: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset, showcasing its potential for practical applications.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Approach: The integration of multiple sense embeddings for mentions within a unified framework is a strong conceptual contribution. It addresses a key challenge in semantic representation and has broad applicability.\n2. Simplicity and Scalability: The training procedure is simple and efficient, which enhances the model's usability across diverse tasks and datasets.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results, particularly on entity linking, demonstrate the model's effectiveness. The qualitative analysis further supports the claim of high-quality embeddings.\n4. Potential for Broader Applications: While the paper focuses on entity-related tasks, the approach has potential for broader semantic tasks, which could be explored in future work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Novelty Concerns: The method shares conceptual similarities with Yamada et al. (2016). While the authors claim novelty, the differences are not sufficiently highlighted. A more detailed comparison is necessary to clarify the unique contributions of this work.\n2. Clarity Issues: The presentation is inconsistent in quality. Section 3 lacks clarity, and Figure 2 is underexplained, making it difficult to fully grasp the method. Additionally, some terminology is redundant and could be streamlined.\n3. Limited Scope of Evaluation: The empirical evaluation is primarily focused on entity-related tasks. To strengthen the broader applicability claim, the authors should demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings on other semantic tasks.\n4. Incremental Performance Gains: While the results are good, the performance improvements over existing methods are not groundbreaking, which may limit the perceived impact of the work.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method fundamentally differ from Yamada et al. (2016)? Could you provide a more detailed comparison, both conceptually and empirically?\n2. Can the embeddings be applied effectively to tasks beyond entity linking, such as semantic similarity or relation extraction? If so, why were these not included in the evaluation?\n3. Could you clarify the details of Figure 2 and provide additional explanation for Section 3 to improve clarity?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper presents a promising approach with strong ideas and good empirical results. However, the novelty concerns, clarity issues, and limited scope of evaluation need to be addressed to strengthen the submission. I encourage the authors to refine their presentation and provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better demonstrate the broader impact of their work."
