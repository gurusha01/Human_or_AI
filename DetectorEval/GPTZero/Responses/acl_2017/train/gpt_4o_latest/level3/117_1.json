            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses a critical problem in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA): mapping natural language questions to knowledge base (KB) relations, particularly in scenarios involving partial argument information and a large number of target relations. The authors propose a novel hierarchical recurrent neural network (HR-BiLSTM) enhanced by residual learning to improve relation detection. The method integrates word-level and single-token representations of relation names and questions, enabling hierarchical matching. The paper also introduces a simple KBQA pipeline that incorporates a re-ranking step post-entity linking, leveraging relation detection to resolve ambiguities. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA benchmarks.\nThe primary contributions of this work are:\n1. Hierarchical Relation Detection: A novel HR-BiLSTM model that combines word-level and relation-level representations for hierarchical matching, enhanced by residual learning.\n2. Entity Re-Ranking: A re-ranking mechanism that uses relation detection to improve entity linking, addressing ambiguities in entity disambiguation.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: Demonstration of improved performance on two widely used QA benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nStrengths\n1. Relevance and Novelty: The paper tackles a highly relevant problem in QA, particularly the challenge of handling a large number of KB relations and unseen relations. The hierarchical matching approach is novel and well-motivated.\n2. Methodological Innovation: The HR-BiLSTM model is a significant contribution. By combining word-level and single-token representations, the method effectively balances generalization and specificity. The use of residual learning further enhances training stability and performance.\n3. Entity Re-Ranking: The re-ranking step is a practical and impactful addition to the KBQA pipeline, addressing a common bottleneck in entity linking.\n4. Empirical Results: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SimpleQuestions and WebQSP datasets, with thorough ablation studies to validate the contributions of individual components.\n5. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology and comprehensive experimental evaluation.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Dataset Evaluation: The approach is evaluated on only two datasets (SimpleQuestions and WebQSP). While these are standard benchmarks, additional evaluations on more diverse datasets would strengthen the generalizability claims.\n2. Structural Organization: Section 3.1, which discusses different granularity in KB relations, could be moved to the related work section. This would allow Section 3.2 to focus more cohesively on the proposed methodology.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed HR-BiLSTM model generalize to other KBQA datasets or domains with different characteristics (e.g., medical or legal KBs)?\n2. Can the residual learning mechanism be extended to other sequence-matching tasks beyond relation detection? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. Were there any challenges in scaling the approach to the full Freebase KB for WebQSP, and how were they addressed?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes significant contributions to the field of KBQA, particularly in relation detection and its integration into the QA pipeline. Despite the limitation of dataset diversity, the novelty of the proposed method and its empirical success justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve the structural organization of the paper."
