            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel method for building dialogue agents tailored to symmetric collaborative tasks that require strategic communication to achieve a shared goal. The authors introduce a new dataset of 11K human-human dialogues and propose a neural model, Dynamic Knowledge Graph Network (DynoNet), which combines structured knowledge representation with unstructured language modeling. The main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Dataset Creation: The authors present a large-scale dataset for symmetric collaborative dialogues, which exhibits rich linguistic and strategic phenomena. This dataset is a valuable resource for advancing research in task-oriented dialogue systems.\n2. Dynamic Knowledge Graph Network (DynoNet): The proposed model integrates structured knowledge (via dynamic knowledge graphs) with unstructured dialogue history, enabling more flexible and contextually grounded representations compared to traditional slot-value approaches.\n3. Evaluation Framework: The paper employs a comprehensive evaluation framework, including automatic metrics, bot-bot interactions, and human evaluations, to assess the model's performance in terms of fluency, cooperation, and human-likeness.\nStrengths\n1. Focus on Strategic Communication: The paper addresses an important gap in dialogue systems by exploring symmetric collaborative tasks, which require agents to reason strategically and communicate effectively. This is a meaningful contribution to the field.\n2. Dataset Quality and Scale: The dataset is well-designed, with diverse scenarios and linguistic phenomena, making it a valuable benchmark for future research. The scale of 11K dialogues is impressive and enables robust model training and evaluation.\n3. Model Innovation: DynoNet's use of dynamic knowledge graphs to represent evolving dialogue states is innovative and bridges the gap between structured and open-ended dialogue systems. The ablation studies further validate the importance of its key components, such as message passing and entity abstraction.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The combination of partner and third-party evaluations provides a nuanced understanding of the model's performance, particularly in human-likeness and cooperation.\nWeaknesses\n1. Domain Specificity: While the paper claims to address symmetric collaborative tasks broadly, the proposed method appears to be most applicable to tasks that can be represented as graph operations, such as finding intersections between objects. This limits its generalizability to other symmetric tasks.\n2. Richness of the Domain: The authors argue that the domain is too complex for slot-value semantics, but this claim is not fully substantiated. Attribute-value pair-based semantics, such as first-order logic, could potentially handle the domain's complexity.\n3. Clarity of Section 3.2: The explanation of the graph embedding mechanism in Section 3.2 is difficult to follow, and Figure 2 does little to clarify the process. This hinders the reader's ability to fully understand the model's architecture and its operation.\n4. Lack of Novelty in Symmetric Dialogue Settings: Symmetric collaborative dialogue has been studied in prior works, such as Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) and Walker's furniture layout task (2000). The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from these earlier studies.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide more justification for why slot-value or attribute-value pair-based semantics are insufficient for this domain? Have you compared DynoNet with models using such representations?\n2. How does the proposed model handle ambiguity or incomplete information in the dialogue? Are there specific mechanisms to address these challenges?\n3. Could you elaborate on the scalability of DynoNet to other symmetric collaborative tasks beyond graph-based representations?\nConclusion\nOverall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of dialogue systems, particularly in its focus on symmetric collaborative tasks and the introduction of a large-scale dataset. However, the domain specificity of the proposed approach and the lack of clarity in some sections limit its broader applicability and accessibility. Addressing these concerns could significantly strengthen the paper."
