            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces SynTime, a rule-based system for time expression extraction that leverages syntactic patterns and heuristic rules. The authors analyze time expressions across four datasets and make key observations, including the brevity of time expressions, the small vocabulary involved, and the syntactic consistency of their components. Based on these insights, SynTime defines three syntactic types\"\"time tokens, modifiers, and numerals\"\"and applies heuristic rules for boundary expansion to identify time expressions. The system is evaluated on three datasets (TimeBank, WikiWars, and Tweets) and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art rule-based and machine learning (ML) systems, particularly in recall.\nThe primary contributions of this work are:\n1. Empirical Observations: The analysis of time expressions across datasets provides evidence for the principle of least effort in language usage, offering a theoretical basis for the proposed approach.\n2. Novel Methodology: SynTime introduces a syntactic type-based framework and heuristic rules for time expression extraction, which simplify rule-based systems and improve flexibility.\n3. Strong Empirical Results: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in recall and robustness across domains.\nStrengths\n1. Empirically Grounded Design: The observations about time expressions are well-motivated and provide a strong foundation for the proposed approach. The connection to linguistic principles, such as the principle of least effort, adds depth to the work.\n2. Performance: SynTime demonstrates significant improvements in recall (e.g., 95.87% on Tweets) and competitive F1 scores across datasets, outperforming both rule-based and ML-based systems.\n3. Simplicity and Efficiency: The lightweight, rule-based nature of SynTime allows it to run in real time and makes it easily extensible to new domains with minimal effort.\n4. Clarity of Writing: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology, observations, and experimental results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Reproducibility Concerns: Some implementation details are underspecified, such as the exact rules for boundary expansion and the handling of ambiguous cases. This lack of detail may hinder reproducibility.\n2. Handling of Special Cases: The paper does not adequately address how SynTime handles complex or culturally specific time expressions, such as \"Ramadan month\" or \"Holiday Season.\"\n3. Dataset Inconsistency: The paper inconsistently refers to the number of datasets analyzed (e.g., \"two benchmark datasets\" vs. \"three datasets\"), which may confuse readers.\n4. Performance Ceiling: The recall of 92% is close to the theoretical ceiling of 93% token presence, raising questions about further room for improvement.\n5. Limited Examples: The paper would benefit from an example of a time expression without a time token to clarify the system's capabilities.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does SynTime handle culturally specific or ambiguous time expressions, such as \"Ramadan month\" or \"Holiday Season\"?\n2. Can you clarify the discrepancy in the number of datasets analyzed (two vs. three)?\n3. Are there plans to release the full set of rules or the software to improve reproducibility?\n4. How does SynTime perform on time expressions without explicit time tokens? Could you provide an example?\n5. Given the performance ceiling, what are the next steps to further improve recall?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a strong case for acceptance due to its novel, linguistically motivated approach and strong empirical results. However, addressing the reproducibility concerns and providing additional clarifications during the author response period would strengthen its impact."
