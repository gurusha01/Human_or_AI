            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents a comprehensive study on neural end-to-end computational argumentation mining (AM). The authors propose and evaluate multiple framings for AM, including dependency parsing, sequence tagging, multi-task learning (MTL), and a hybrid sequential-tree structure model (LSTM-ER). The primary contributions of this work are as follows:\n1. Novel Neural Frameworks for AM: The paper introduces neural methods for end-to-end AM, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and integer linear programming (ILP) constraints. These methods outperform traditional feature-based models in many settings.\n2. Sequence Tagging with Distance Encoding: The authors propose a sequence tagging framework (STagT) that encodes both component and relation information, achieving robust performance across different scenarios.\n3. Insights into Task Coupling: The study demonstrates that coupling component and relation detection naively is suboptimal, and treating them as separate but jointly modeled tasks yields better results.\n4. Empirical Evaluation: The paper provides an extensive experimental evaluation, comparing neural models with traditional ILP-based approaches and analyzing their performance on both paragraph- and essay-level data.\nStrengths\n1. Well-Written and Clear Presentation: The paper is well-structured, making complex concepts accessible. The methods and results are presented clearly, with sufficient context for understanding the challenges of AM.\n2. Interesting and Relevant Problem: The focus on end-to-end AM is timely and addresses key limitations of existing pipeline approaches, such as error propagation and reliance on hand-crafted features.\n3. Comprehensive Experiments: The experiments are substantial, with proper baselines and comparisons. The results are insightful, particularly the trade-offs between different neural framings and their performance on short vs. long documents.\n4. Practical Recommendations: The paper provides actionable insights, such as the preference for simpler sequence tagging models for long texts and the benefits of multi-task learning for subtasks in AM.\nWeaknesses\n1. Dataset Size and Overfitting Concerns: The dataset used (320 training essays) is small for training neural models, raising concerns about overfitting. The paper does not analyze overfitting or provide training and development loss curves.\n2. Model Stability and Variance: The paper lacks an analysis of model stability. Results from multiple runs, standard deviations, and statistical significance tests are missing, which undermines the reliability of the reported findings.\n3. Limited Discussion on Regularization: Given the small dataset, the paper does not adequately address regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, which could mitigate overfitting.\n4. Hyperparameter Optimization: The current approach to hyperparameter tuning is not detailed. Bayesian optimization or grid search could have been explored for better performance.\n5. Supplementary Material: Key details, such as pre-trained embeddings and error analysis, are relegated to supplementary material. These should be included in the main paper for better reproducibility and clarity.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model handle overfitting given the small dataset size? Could you provide training and validation loss curves to support your claims?\n2. What regularization techniques were applied, if any, to improve model generalization?\n3. Could you elaborate on the choice of hyperparameter optimization methods and their impact on the results?\n4. Why were statistical significance tests omitted from the experimental results? Could you provide these in the final version?\nAdditional Comments\n- The inclusion of inter-annotator agreement scores for the dataset would strengthen the evaluation of system performance and highlight potential areas for improvement.\n- Figure 1 should be revised to use distinct colors or patterns for better readability in black-and-white prints.\n- Reporting F1-score ranges, means, and variances would improve the reproducibility and robustness of the results.\nIn conclusion, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of computational argumentation mining. However, addressing the concerns about dataset size, overfitting, and model stability would greatly enhance its impact and reliability."
