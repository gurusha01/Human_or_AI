It evaluates these configurations across six tasks, including intrinsic (word similarity and analogy) and extrinsic (POS tagging, chunking, NER, and text classification) evaluations. The primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. A comprehensive experimental framework that compares context types and representations across multiple tasks, offering actionable insights for researchers.\n2. The development of a generalized toolkit, word2vecPM, which extends existing word embedding models (Skip-Gram, CBOW, and GloVe) to support arbitrary contexts. This toolkit is a valuable resource for the community.\n3. Empirical evidence that context representations (bound vs. unbound) play a more critical role than context types (linear vs. dependency-based) in determining the effectiveness of word embeddings for specific tasks.\nStrengths:\n1. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written and systematically organized, making it accessible to a broad audience. The clear delineation of context types and representations, along with their effects on various tasks, is commendable.\n2. Thorough Evaluation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering a wide range of tasks and providing nuanced insights. For instance, the distinction between functional and topical similarity in word similarity tasks is well-articulated.\n3. Practical Contributions: The release of the word2vecPM toolkit enhances the reproducibility and applicability of the work, making it a valuable asset for the research community.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Novelty: While the paper provides a systematic comparison, the novelty of the work is limited. The concept of comparing linear and dependency-based contexts is not new, and the paper primarily consolidates and extends existing ideas rather than introducing fundamentally new methodologies.\n2. Fairness of Comparisons: The reliance on predicted dependency parsing results for dependency-based contexts raises questions about the fairness of comparisons. Parsing errors could disproportionately affect the performance of dependency-based embeddings, potentially skewing the results.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How do parsing errors impact the performance of dependency-based contexts across tasks? Have you quantified the effect of parsing quality on the results?\n2. Could you elaborate on the computational efficiency of the word2vecPM toolkit compared to existing implementations, particularly for large-scale datasets?\nConclusion:\nThis paper provides a valuable resource and a well-executed empirical study that will benefit the NLP community. However, its limited novelty and potential issues with fairness in comparisons temper its impact. I recommend acceptance, contingent on clarifications regarding the fairness of comparisons and the impact of parsing errors."
