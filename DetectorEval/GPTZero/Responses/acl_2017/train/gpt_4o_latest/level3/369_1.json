            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of translating from a morphologically impoverished language (Chinese) to a morphologically rich one (Spanish) by proposing a two-step machine translation (MT) method. The first step involves translating into a morphologically simplified version of the target language, and the second step uses a neural-based classification architecture to generate the correct morphological inflections. The authors claim significant improvements in translation quality, achieving up to a 0.7 METEOR score increase. The paper introduces a novel classification architecture combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNN + LSTM), which outperforms traditional machine learning techniques for gender and number classification tasks. Additionally, the method is designed to be language-independent, with potential generalizability to other language pairs.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of Approach: The proposed two-step translation method diverges from modern byte-pair encoding (BPE) and character-level models, drawing inspiration from older methods like Factored Translation Models. The integration of deep learning for morphology generation is innovative and demonstrates measurable improvements.\n2. Strong Classification Results: The proposed CNN + LSTM architecture achieves high accuracy in gender (98.4%) and number (93.7%) classification for the small corpus, outperforming baseline methods such as SVMs and random forests. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the architecture in handling morphological challenges.\n3. Challenging Language Pair: The focus on Chinese-Spanish\"\"a less commonly studied language pair in MT research\"\"adds value to the paper. The authors leverage multiple corpora, including the United Nations and TAUS datasets, to evaluate their method, which is commendable.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Language Pair Evaluation: The method is only applied to the Chinese-Spanish pair, raising concerns about its generalizability. Testing on additional language pairs, such as English-German or English-Russian, would strengthen the claims of language independence.\n2. Citation Oversight: The omission of key related works, such as Koehn and Hoang (2007) and Chahuneau et al. (2013), is a significant flaw. These works are foundational in the area of morphology-aware MT and should have been cited and discussed.\n3. Evaluation Metrics: The reliance solely on METEOR for evaluation is insufficient. The absence of BLEU scores or qualitative examples limits the robustness of the results. Including multiple metrics would provide a more comprehensive assessment of translation quality.\n4. Neglect of Linguistic Features: While the focus on gender and number is justified, the omission of person as a morphological feature is a notable gap. A brief discussion of this limitation would have been helpful.\n5. Writing Quality: The paper contains numerous grammatical, spelling, and stylistic errors, which detract from its readability and professionalism. It requires thorough proofreading before being considered for publication.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Why was the method not applied to additional language pairs to validate its generalizability?\n2. Can you clarify why rescoring negatively impacts gender accuracy and how the reranker handles 1-best outputs?\n3. Why were BLEU scores or qualitative examples not included in the evaluation? Would these metrics align with the METEOR results?\nRecommendations for Future Work\n1. Apply the proposed method to additional language pairs to demonstrate its generalizability.\n2. Include BLEU scores and qualitative examples in future evaluations to strengthen the robustness of the results.\n3. Expand the morphological features considered (e.g., person) and discuss their impact on translation quality.\n4. Address the citation gaps and ensure that related foundational works are appropriately referenced.\n5. Conduct thorough proofreading to improve the writing quality and clarity of the paper.\nFinal Recommendation\nWhile the paper presents a novel and promising approach to handling morphological challenges in MT, its limitations in evaluation, citation oversight, and writing quality make it unsuitable for publication in its current form. I recommend a major revision, with a focus on addressing the weaknesses outlined above."
