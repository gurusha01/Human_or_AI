            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a linguistically regularized LSTM (LR-LSTM) model for sentence-level sentiment classification, which incorporates linguistic knowledge such as sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. The key contributions of this work are as follows:\n1. Linguistic Regularizers: The paper proposes novel regularizers to model the linguistic roles of sentiment, negation, and intensity words. These regularizers enforce constraints on the sentiment distributions of adjacent positions in a sequence, addressing sentiment shifts caused by these linguistic factors.\n2. Efficient Sequence Model: Unlike tree-structured models that rely on parsing trees and expensive phrase-level annotations, the proposed LR-LSTM is a simple sequence model trained with only sentence-level annotations. Despite this simplicity, it achieves competitive performance.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Movie Review (MR) dataset and competitive results on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nStrengths\n1. Integration of Linguistic Knowledge: The paper effectively combines LSTM with linguistic knowledge (sentiment lexicons, negation, and intensity words), which enhances the interpretability and performance of the model. The proposed regularizers are well-motivated and align with linguistic phenomena.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MR dataset and performs competitively on the SST dataset, even without phrase-level annotations. This demonstrates the practicality of the approach for real-world applications.\n3. Ablation Studies and Analysis: The paper provides thorough ablation studies to evaluate the impact of each regularizer. Additionally, detailed analyses of negation and intensity effects offer valuable insights into the linguistic roles of these words.\n4. Efficiency: The proposed model avoids the computational overhead of tree-structured models, making it more efficient while maintaining comparable performance.\nWeaknesses\n1. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper mentions related work (e.g., Teng et al., 2016), the experimental comparison with this baseline is less convincing. A direct performance comparison or detailed analysis of differences would strengthen the claims.\n2. Lack of Phrase-Level Results for SST: The paper avoids phrase-level annotations but does not report results for phrase-level sentiment classification on SST. This omission limits the ability to compare the model's fine-grained sentiment capabilities with other methods.\n3. Clarity of Details: Some technical details, such as the specific definitions of the parameter \\( s_c \\) (sentiment class-specific shifting distribution) and its learned or fixed nature, are unclear. This lack of clarity hinders reproducibility.\n4. Limited Validation of Regularizers: While the paper demonstrates the overall effectiveness of the regularizers, it lacks experiments specifically validating their impact on subsets of SST containing negation and intensity words. Such experiments would provide stronger evidence for the regularizers' utility.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide statistics on the impact of negation and intensity words in the SST dataset? How do these words influence the overall results?\n2. Is the parameter \\( s_c \\) learned or fixed during training? If fixed, what specific value is used, and how is it determined?\n3. In Section 4.5, is the bidirectional LSTM used to predict sentiment labels, or is it solely for encoding context? Please clarify.\n4. Would it be possible to include phrase-level results for SST, even if the stated goal is to avoid phrase-level annotation? This would enable better comparison with other models.\n5. Have you considered conducting experiments on SST subsets containing negation and intensity words to validate the impact of the negation and intensity regularizers?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a novel and effective approach to sentiment classification by integrating linguistic knowledge into LSTM models. Despite some weaknesses, such as limited comparisons with related work and unclear details, the strengths of the paper\"\"particularly its strong empirical results and interpretability\"\"make it a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses."
