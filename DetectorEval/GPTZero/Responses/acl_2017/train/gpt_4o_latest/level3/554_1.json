            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a Bayesian learning framework for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC). The authors propose a computationally efficient algorithm that models weight uncertainty in RNNs, addressing the limitations of traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with dropout. The key contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Novelty in Bayesian Learning for RNNs: The paper extends SG-MCMC to RNNs, a domain where Bayesian methods have been underexplored. This is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing (NLP).\n2. Performance Improvement: The proposed method outperforms SGD with dropout on three tasks: language modeling, image captioning, and sentence classification. The results demonstrate the benefits of incorporating gradient noise and model averaging.\n3. Scalability: The algorithm is computationally efficient, sharing the same order of complexity as SGD, making it practical for large-scale NLP applications.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The application of SG-MCMC to RNNs is a novel and impactful contribution. The paper effectively bridges the gap between Bayesian methods and sequential data modeling, which is a critical area in NLP.\n2. Empirical Results: The results across multiple tasks and datasets are compelling. The method consistently outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.\n3. Scalability: The computational efficiency of the proposed method is a significant strength, as it makes Bayesian learning feasible for large-scale RNNs.\n4. Theoretical Justification: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their approach, including connections to dropout and guarantees of convergence for SG-MCMC.\nWeaknesses\n1. Evaluation Inconsistencies: The comparison of learning algorithms and architectures is inconsistent across tasks. For example, Gal's dropout is only evaluated on sentence classification, limiting the assessment of its utility.\n2. Empirical Justification: The claim that performance gains stem from gradient noise and model averaging is not rigorously justified. Additional ablation studies or analyses are needed to isolate these factors.\n3. Sample Selection and Order: The impact of the order of samples (\\(\\theta1, \\dots, \\thetaK\\)) and random sample selection is unclear. This raises questions about the robustness of the model averaging process.\n4. Training/Evaluation Time: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of training and evaluation times between SG-MCMC and SGD with dropout. This information is crucial for assessing the trade-offs of the proposed method.\n5. Limited Task Scope for Dropout Comparison: The evaluation of Gal's dropout is restricted to sentence classification. Expanding this comparison to other tasks would strengthen the paper's claims.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide empirical evidence to support the claim that performance gains are primarily due to gradient noise and model averaging? For instance, could you include ablation studies that isolate these factors?\n2. How does the computational cost of SG-MCMC compare to SGD with dropout during both training and evaluation? Are there scenarios where one method is significantly more efficient than the other?\n3. Could you clarify the meaning of \\(\\theta_s\\) (L346) and \\(\\theta\\) in the context of dropout/dropconnect (L453-454)?\n4. What is the impact of the order of samples (\\(\\theta1, \\dots, \\thetaK\\)) on model averaging? Have you explored alternative sampling strategies?\nAdditional Comments\n- There are minor typos that need correction: \"output\" (L211) and \"RMSProp\" (L738).\n- The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential directions for future work.\nRecommendation\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian learning for RNNs and demonstrates strong empirical results. However, the evaluation inconsistencies, lack of empirical justification for key claims, and missing computational cost analysis weaken the submission. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided the authors address the identified weaknesses and clarify the open questions."
