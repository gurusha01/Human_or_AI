            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions:\nThis paper addresses the problem of detecting overlapping entities, particularly crossing entities, in the context of Named Entity Recognition (NER). The authors propose a novel multigraph-based model for structured prediction, which assigns explicit semantics to edges in the graph to represent overlapping structures. The paper claims three main contributions: (1) the introduction of a multigraph-based model for overlapping entity recognition, (2) empirical evidence showing modest improvements in F1-scores over prior models, and (3) a theoretical advantage in resolving spurious structures, making the model non-deficient while maintaining linear inference time complexity. The authors also suggest that the multigraph framework could be extended to other tasks involving overlapping structures.\nStrengths:\n1. Relevance of the Problem: The task of detecting overlapping entities, particularly crossing entities, is both challenging and underexplored. The paper's focus on this problem is timely and relevant to advancing NER research.\n2. Novel Approach: The use of multigraphs for structured prediction is a novel contribution, particularly the explicit semantics assigned to edges, which distinguishes this work from prior state-based and edge-based paradigms.\n3. Empirical Results: While the improvements are modest, the model demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets, including ACE and GENIA, with consistent gains over the mention hypergraph baseline.\n4. Efficiency: The proposed model retains the same linear inference complexity as the mention hypergraph model, which is a practical advantage for scalability.\n5. Theoretical Insights: The discussion on spurious structures and the non-deficiency of the proposed model provides a solid theoretical foundation and highlights an important limitation of prior approaches.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Unclear Motivation for Nested Entities: The paper does not adequately justify the importance of detecting nested entities or provide compelling use cases where this capability is critical.\n2. Lack of Methodological Details: Key details, such as the decision criterion for including edges in the multigraph, are missing, making it difficult to fully understand or reproduce the model.\n3. Limited Empirical Gains: The improvements in F1-scores are marginal, raising questions about the practical significance of the proposed approach. The claim of \"outperforming\" prior models is overstated given the modest gains.\n4. Insufficient Baseline Comparisons: The evaluation lacks comparisons with simpler dictionary-based methods or widely-used commercial systems like Google NLP, which could provide a stronger baseline for assessing the model's effectiveness.\n5. Discussion on Crossing Entities: Although crossing entities are highlighted as a compelling subset, the paper does not provide sufficient analysis or examples to demonstrate the model's advantages in handling them.\n6. Missing Error Analysis: The absence of error analysis and detailed comparisons with prior systems weakens the discussion of results and limits insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the decision criterion for including edges in the multigraph? How does this impact the model's performance?\n2. What are the practical use cases or applications where detecting nested entities is essential? Can you elaborate on their significance?\n3. Why were dictionary-based methods and commercial systems excluded from the evaluation? How do you expect your model to perform against these baselines?\n4. Could you provide more detailed examples of crossing entities and analyze how your model performs on these cases compared to prior approaches?\nAdditional Comments:\n1. The concept of a multigraph should be briefly explained in the introduction for readers unfamiliar with the term.\n2. The use of terms like \"outperform\" should be toned down, given the modest improvements in results.\n3. Figures and footnotes need better clarity and placement to enhance readability.\n4. The paper contains minor grammatical and stylistic issues, such as inconsistent phrasing and unclear terms, which require polishing.\n5. Formatting inconsistencies in references and dataset statistics should be addressed to improve the paper's presentation.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper introduces a novel approach and addresses an important problem, the unclear motivation, missing methodological details, and limited empirical gains weaken its overall impact. I recommend a weak reject unless the authors can provide stronger justification for the importance of nested entities, address the methodological gaps, and include a more comprehensive evaluation in the author response."
