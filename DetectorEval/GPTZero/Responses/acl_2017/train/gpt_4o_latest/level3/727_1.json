            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenging task of multi-label frame classification in political tweets, specifically focusing on framing as a nuanced political discourse analysis task. The authors propose a weakly supervised collective classification approach using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) that incorporates both lexical and network-based behavioral features of Twitter. The paper introduces a novel dataset of tweets authored by U.S. Congress members, annotated with 17 frames, including three Twitter-specific frames. The primary contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Dataset Creation: The authors provide a well-annotated dataset of political tweets, which is a valuable resource for the community and can facilitate further research in political discourse analysis.\n2. Weakly Supervised Framework: The paper presents a novel application of PSL to frame classification, leveraging social and behavioral features to improve performance in both supervised and unsupervised settings.\n3. Detailed Analysis: The authors conduct extensive experiments and provide insights into framing patterns across political parties and individual politicians, including the identification of aisle-crossing politicians.\nStrengths\n1. Interesting Task: The paper tackles an important and underexplored problem of framing in political tweets, which has significant implications for understanding political discourse on social media.\n2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the methodology, dataset, and experimental setup, making it accessible to readers.\n3. Dataset Utility: The annotated dataset is a valuable contribution that can serve as a benchmark for future research in this domain.\n4. Comprehensive Analysis: The detailed evaluation of supervised and unsupervised models, along with qualitative insights into framing patterns, demonstrates the robustness and utility of the proposed approach.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Comparisons with Related Work: The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with existing methods for related tasks, such as stance classification or biased language analysis. This omission makes it difficult to contextualize the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n2. Limited Discussion of Task Uniqueness: While the paper highlights the challenges of frame classification, it does not sufficiently discuss how this task differs from related tasks like stance classification or sentiment analysis, nor does it adequately address the limitations of prior research.\n3. Contextual Information Ignored: Equation (1) for similarity calculation ignores contextual information, which could be addressed by exploring alternative methods like skip-thought vectors or contextual embeddings.\n4. Experimental Setup Concerns: The inclusion of annotated data in bi/tri-gram selection may introduce bias, and the authors should clarify its impact on results. Additionally, precision and recall metrics should be added to Table 4 for a more comprehensive evaluation.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method compare quantitatively with existing approaches for related tasks, such as stance classification or biased language analysis?\n2. Could you elaborate on the challenges of adapting frame classification from longer texts (e.g., Congressional speeches) to shorter tweets, and how your approach addresses these challenges?\n3. Why was the term \"weakly supervised\" interchanged with \"unsupervised\" in some parts of the paper? Consistent terminology would improve clarity.\nAdditional Comments\n1. A discussion on how frame classification differs from stance classification would strengthen the paper's positioning and clarify its contributions.\n2. The calculated Kappa statistic reflects annotation difficulty but may not directly indicate the complexity of frame classification for tweets. This distinction should be discussed.\n3. Minor formatting issues, such as footnote placement, should be addressed for consistency.\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes meaningful contributions to the field of political discourse analysis on social media, particularly through its dataset and weakly supervised approach. However, the lack of comparisons with related work and insufficient discussion of task uniqueness limit its impact. With revisions addressing these concerns, the paper has the potential to make a strong contribution to the conference."
