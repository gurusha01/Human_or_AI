            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper addresses the task of event detection (ED) by explicitly leveraging argument information through supervised attention mechanisms. The authors argue that arguments provide significant clues for identifying and categorizing events, particularly for ambiguous trigger words. The proposed approach systematically investigates different supervised attention strategies and demonstrates their effectiveness on the ACE 2005 dataset. The main contributions of the paper are as follows: \n1. A novel framework that explicitly incorporates annotated argument information for ED, addressing limitations in existing joint models that indirectly use arguments. \n2. Introduction of a supervised attention mechanism to enhance ED, with two strategies for constructing gold attention vectors. \n3. Comprehensive experiments on the ACE 2005 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating the utility of argument information for ED. \nStrengths: \n1. Clear and Simple Framework: The proposed model is well-structured and easy to understand, making it accessible for replication and further research. The supervised attention mechanism is effectively integrated into the neural network architecture. \n2. Significant Performance Improvement: The experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in F1 scores, validating the effectiveness of the approach. The use of FrameNet data to augment performance further highlights the robustness of the model. \n3. Novel Use of Argument Information: The explicit modeling of argument information for ED is a key innovation, addressing a gap in prior work. The authors provide convincing evidence that arguments are crucial for disambiguating event triggers. \n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper systematically evaluates different attention strategies and compares the proposed model against strong baselines, including feature-based, representation-based, and joint models. \nWeaknesses: \n1. Simplistic Attention Vector Calculation: The method for calculating attention vectors is relatively basic, relying on straightforward operations between the trigger candidate and its context. This leaves room for more sophisticated attention mechanisms, such as multi-head attention or contextualized embeddings like BERT. \n2. Limited Novelty in Supervised Attention Strategies: While the supervised attention mechanism is effective, the two proposed strategies (S1 and S2) are conceptually straightforward. Future work could explore more advanced strategies, such as dynamic or hierarchical attention mechanisms. \n3. Generalizability to Other Datasets: The experiments are limited to the ACE 2005 dataset, and while the use of FrameNet data is commendable, it remains unclear how well the approach generalizes to other domains or datasets with different event and argument structures. \nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does the model perform on datasets other than ACE 2005? Could you provide insights into its generalizability across domains? \n2. Have you considered incorporating pre-trained contextualized embeddings (e.g., BERT) to enhance the representation of triggers and arguments? \n3. Could the supervised attention mechanism be extended to handle overlapping or nested events? \nConclusion: \nOverall, this paper presents a well-executed study with a clear contribution to the field of event detection. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in the sophistication of the attention mechanism, the proposed framework is effective and achieves state-of-the-art results. The paper is suitable for acceptance at the conference."
