The authors annotate 97 news articles from the Chinese Treebank 8.0 to create the Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB). The paper introduces a model capable of recognizing five discourse relations (joint, elaboration, sequence, background, cause-result) and primary-secondary relationships. Preliminary experiments evaluate the proposed schema and corpus on discourse relation and primary-secondary relation recognition tasks.\nThe primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a macro-micro unified discourse structure representation scheme. The second contribution is the construction of the MCDTB, which provides annotated data for discourse structure analysis. Lastly, the paper attempts to address the underexplored area of macro discourse structure analysis, particularly from a pragmatic function perspective.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Focus on Macro Discourse Structures: The paper addresses an underexplored area by focusing on macro discourse structures and their integration with micro structures. This is a valuable direction for advancing discourse analysis, particularly for tasks requiring global coherence understanding.\n2. Corpus Development: The creation of the MCDTB, with annotations for both micro and macro discourse structures, represents a useful resource for the NLP community, especially for Chinese discourse analysis.\n3. Preliminary Experiments: The experiments demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed schema and corpus, achieving reasonable performance on primary-secondary and discourse relation recognition tasks.\nWeaknesses\n1. Writing Quality: The paper is poorly written, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear explanations. This significantly hinders readability and comprehension. Proofreading by a native English speaker is strongly recommended.\n2. Unclear Definitions: Key terms such as \"logical semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\" are not adequately defined, leading to confusion about the theoretical foundation of the proposed schema.\n3. Inconsistencies in Macro vs. Micro Structures: The paper fails to clearly delineate the advantages of the proposed macro structure over existing micro structures. Definitions and examples of macro and micro structures are inconsistent and lack clarity.\n4. Corpus Construction Issues: The corpus construction section is vague, with insufficient examples and unclear definitions for terms like \"discourse topic\" and \"paragraph topics.\" Additionally, the agreement study focuses only on leaf nodes, which does not adequately reflect the overall annotation quality.\n5. Experimental Weaknesses: The experiments lack strong baselines, and the feature descriptions are insufficiently detailed. Furthermore, the limited set of discourse relations used for evaluation undermines the generalizability of the results.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed macro discourse structure explicitly improve upon existing micro discourse structure approaches? Can you provide concrete examples or comparisons?\n2. Why were sentences 6 and 15 omitted from Figure 5? How does this omission affect the representation of the macro structure?\n3. Can you clarify the annotation guidelines for \"discourse topic\" and \"paragraph topics\"? How were these concepts operationalized during annotation?\nOverall Assessment\nWhile the paper addresses an important and underexplored area in discourse analysis, it requires substantial revisions before being considered for acceptance. The writing quality, unclear definitions, and lack of experimental rigor are major concerns. Additionally, the paper does not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed macro structure or the robustness of the annotated corpus. Major improvements in writing, theoretical clarity, and experimental design are necessary to make this work more impactful and accessible to the research community."
