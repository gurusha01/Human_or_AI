            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper introduces TUPA, a transition-based parser for UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation) graphs, addressing the unique challenges posed by UCCA's formal properties, such as reentrancy, discontinuities, and non-terminal nodes. The parser employs a novel transition set and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier with bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) features, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The authors compare TUPA against existing parsers using converted UCCA data and gold-standard UCCA representations, demonstrating its superiority in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.\nMain Contributions\n1. Development of a Generalized Transition-Based Parser for DAGs: The paper's primary contribution is the design of TUPA, a parser capable of handling UCCA's unique structural properties, including multiple parents, discontinuous units, and non-terminal nodes. This generalization has implications for parsing other semantic DAG structures.\n2. Empirical Evaluation and State-of-the-Art Results: The authors conduct rigorous experiments, comparing TUPA to baseline parsers and demonstrating its superior performance, particularly in handling remote edges and non-terminal nodes.\n3. Novel Features and Training Techniques: The paper introduces a UCCA-specific feature (ratio of terminals to nodes) and employs a dynamic oracle for training, enhancing the parser's accuracy and robustness.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive and Rigorous Evaluation: The paper evaluates TUPA against a wide range of baselines, including bilexical graph parsers and tree parsers, using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate TUPA's advantages.\n2. Technical Sophistication: The use of BiLSTM features and a neural network classifier represents a strong application of state-of-the-art techniques in parsing.\n3. Broader Applicability: The parser's ability to handle general DAG structures makes it relevant for other semantic frameworks, extending its utility beyond UCCA.\n4. Clarity and Depth: The paper is well-written, with a thorough review of related work and a clear explanation of the UCCA scheme and its challenges.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Parsing Approach: While the work is technically solid, the originality lies more in its application to UCCA than in the parser design itself, which builds on existing transition-based parsing techniques.\n2. Ambiguity in UCCA Scheme Description: The explanation of nodes as terminals or sub-units is unclear, particularly regarding whether non-terminal nodes can have a single child. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with UCCA.\n3. Fairness of Comparisons: The authors tune TUPA's hyperparameters while using default settings for baseline parsers, which may bias the results in TUPA's favor.\n4. Graph Conversion Issues: The paper does not sufficiently explain the low upper bound for remote edges in bilexical approximations or the inverted edges in the converted graphs, which could impact reproducibility.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you clarify whether non-terminal nodes in UCCA can have a single child? This point is ambiguous in the current description.\n2. How were the decisions regarding head priority and label handling made during the conversion procedure? An informal description would be helpful.\n3. Could you provide stronger justification for the claim about \"better input encoding\" in TUPABiLSTM compared to other parsers?\nConclusion\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to UCCA parsing and demonstrates strong empirical results. However, the limited novelty in the parsing approach and some ambiguities in the UCCA scheme description slightly detract from its impact. Addressing these concerns could further strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
