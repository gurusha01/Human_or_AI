            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions \nThis paper proposes a novel approach to improve lexical substitution (lexsub) tasks by integrating word sense inventories with vector-based ranking models. The key contributions of the paper are: \n1. A multi-view clustering approach to generate substitutable sense inventories from PPDB paraphrases, which improves coverage and substitutability compared to existing inventories like WordNet and TWSI. \n2. A metric for substitutability, based on the extended B-Cubed F-Score, which evaluates the agreement between sense inventories and human-annotated lexical substitution data. \n3. A sense filtering technique that uses the generated sense clusters to enhance lexsub rankings, demonstrating significant improvements in GAP scores when combined with existing vector-based models. \nStrengths \n1. Complementary Integration of Techniques: The paper effectively combines vector space models with sense inventories, leveraging their complementary strengths. This is particularly valuable for handling polysemy, as demonstrated by the oracle evaluation, which shows substantial improvements in GAP scores. \n2. Novel Metric Development: The introduction of the substitutability metric (B-Cubed F-Score) provides a robust framework for evaluating sense inventories in the context of human judgments, offering a clear and measurable improvement over existing methods. \n3. Empirical Validation: The proposed method is rigorously evaluated on the CoInCo dataset, showing that the multi-view clustering approach outperforms baseline sense inventories in substitutability and lexsub performance. The oracle and best-fit evaluations provide strong evidence of the method's potential. \n4. Scalability and Generalization: By generating sense inventories automatically from PPDB paraphrases, the approach avoids reliance on predefined resources like WordNet, making it scalable and adaptable to other languages and tasks. \nWeaknesses \n1. Effectiveness of Multi-View Clustering: The multi-view clustering approach lacks sufficient analysis of the differences between views. For instance, the paraphrase similarity view consistently outperforms others, raising questions about the necessity and contribution of additional views. \n2. Clarity and Cohesion: The paper is difficult to follow on a first read due to disjoint sections and missing citations, particularly in the multi-view clustering section. This detracts from the overall readability and accessibility of the work. \n3. Noun Performance: The poor performance on nouns, as highlighted by the TWSI baseline outperforming the proposed method, raises concerns about the generalizability of the clustering approach across parts of speech. \n4. Simplistic WSD Technique: The naive WSD method used for sense filtering introduces bias, limiting the practical applicability of the approach. A more sophisticated WSD algorithm could significantly improve results. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. How do the individual views in the multi-view clustering contribute to the final results? Could the method be simplified by focusing on the paraphrase similarity view alone? \n2. Can you provide more details on the differences between the oracle and best-fit GAP scores? What specific biases does the simple WSD method introduce? \n3. Have you considered optimizing the clustering approach separately for different parts of speech, given the weak performance on nouns? \nRecommendation \nThis paper presents a promising approach to improving lexical substitution tasks by integrating sense inventories with vector-based models. While the method shows clear potential, the weaknesses in clustering analysis, clarity, and noun performance need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided the authors clarify the contributions of individual clustering views and improve the paper's cohesion."
