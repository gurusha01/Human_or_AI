            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces \"Tandem Anchors,\" a novel extension to the anchor words algorithm for interactive topic modeling. Unlike traditional anchor methods that rely on single words, the proposed approach allows for the use of multiple anchor words, improving both the interpretability and quality of topics. The primary contributions of this work are:\n1. Introduction of Multiword Anchors: The paper extends the anchor words algorithm by enabling the use of multiple words as anchors, termed \"Tandem Anchors.\" This improves the intuitiveness and usability of the algorithm in interactive settings.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide a robust evaluation of the approach, including synthetic experiments, user studies, and comparisons with baseline methods. They employ diverse metrics such as classification accuracy, clustering metrics, and topic coherence.\n3. Scalability for Interactivity: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in runtime, making it suitable for interactive use on large datasets, unlike existing interactive topic modeling techniques.\nStrengths\n1. Practical and Novel Contribution: The introduction of multiword anchors is an incremental yet practical improvement to interactive topic modeling. It addresses key limitations of single-word anchors, such as ambiguity and lack of intuitiveness, while maintaining the scalability of the anchor words algorithm.\n2. Strong Experimental Design: The paper is well-organized and employs a combination of synthetic experiments and user studies to validate the approach. The use of diverse metrics (e.g., accuracy, adjusted Rand index, topic coherence) strengthens the evaluation.\n3. Scalability: The runtime analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is fast enough for interactive applications, even on large datasets, which is a significant advantage over existing methods like Interactive Topic Models and Utopian.\n4. User-Centric Evaluation: The inclusion of a user study highlights the practical usability of the approach. The findings that users find tandem anchors more intuitive and effective for refining topics are compelling.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Comparative Analysis: The paper does not extensively compare its approach with other interactive topic modeling methods beyond runtime. While the authors justify this by citing scalability issues, a qualitative or partial comparison of topic quality would have strengthened the claims.\n2. Empirical Support for Limitations of Other Methods: The paper makes claims about the limitations of existing methods (e.g., Interactive Topic Models being slow or non-intuitive) without providing direct empirical evidence or benchmarks to substantiate these claims.\n3. Dataset Generalizability: The experiments are conducted solely on the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is widely used but may not fully represent the diversity of real-world datasets. Testing on additional datasets would enhance the generalizability of the findings.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more detailed comparisons of topic quality between Tandem Anchors and other interactive methods (e.g., Interactive Topic Models) beyond runtime?\n2. How would the proposed method perform on datasets with significantly different characteristics (e.g., highly imbalanced or domain-specific corpora)?\n3. Could you elaborate on the choice of the 20 Newsgroups dataset as the sole experimental dataset? Are there plans to test on other datasets in the future?\nRecommendation\nThis is a strong submission with a practical and novel contribution to interactive topic modeling. While the limited comparative analysis and dataset scope are notable weaknesses, the paper's strengths in scalability, usability, and experimental rigor outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the comparative analysis and dataset generalizability."
