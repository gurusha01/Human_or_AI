            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a multitask learning framework for sequence labeling that incorporates a secondary objective of language modeling. The proposed architecture uses a bidirectional LSTM to predict both output labels and surrounding words, enabling the model to learn richer semantic and syntactic features. The authors evaluate their approach on eight datasets across four tasks: grammatical error detection, named entity recognition (NER), chunking, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Novel Multitask Objective: The integration of a language modeling objective alongside sequence labeling tasks is a key innovation, allowing the model to leverage unsupervised learning signals without requiring additional annotated data.\n2. Performance Improvements: The proposed method achieves consistent improvements across all benchmarks, with significant gains in error detection tasks, where the label distribution is sparse.\n3. General Applicability: The framework is adaptable to various sequence labeling tasks and datasets, demonstrating its versatility.\nStrengths\n1. Well-Written and Detailed: The paper is clearly written, with a thorough explanation of the proposed method, including mathematical formulations and architectural details.\n2. Comprehensive Experiments: The authors evaluate their approach on diverse datasets and tasks, providing robust evidence of its effectiveness. The consistent improvements, particularly in error detection, highlight the utility of the auxiliary language modeling objective.\n3. Practical Contributions: The proposed method does not require additional annotated or unannotated data, making it a practical enhancement to existing sequence labeling architectures.\n4. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the FCE and CoNLL-14 error detection datasets, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.\nWeaknesses\n1. Related Work: The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of prior work in multitask learning and sequence labeling. Several relevant studies, such as those on transfer learning and auxiliary objectives, are not adequately cited or compared.\n2. Baseline Comparisons: The baseline results are not rigorously documented, and the claim of achieving state-of-the-art results on some datasets is not convincingly supported. The authors should provide replication details and clarify how their baselines align with prior work.\n3. Multilinguality and Scalability: The paper does not address the scalability of the proposed method to multilingual or low-resource settings, which is a critical aspect of modern sequence labeling tasks.\n4. POS Tagging Analysis: The evaluation of POS tagging is underexplored, and the comparisons to prior multilingual work are unfair. This limits the generalizability of the claims made for this task.\n5. Disconnect Between Sections: There is a noticeable gap between the theoretical and experimental sections. While the initial sections are well-developed, the experimental results lack sufficient analysis and reflection on the broader implications of the findings.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the baseline implementations and how they compare to previous state-of-the-art methods? Were hyperparameters and experimental setups aligned with prior work?\n2. How does the proposed method perform on multilingual or low-resource datasets? Have you considered extending the framework to such settings?\n3. Could you elaborate on why dropout negatively impacted error detection performance in isolation but improved results when combined with the language modeling objective?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents a novel and effective multitask learning approach, it requires significant improvements in its treatment of related work, baseline comparisons, and multilingual scalability before being ready for publication. These revisions would strengthen the paper's contributions and address the current gaps in its analysis."
