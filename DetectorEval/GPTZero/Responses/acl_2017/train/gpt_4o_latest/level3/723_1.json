            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces MORSE, a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that combines orthographic features with semantic information derived from word embeddings. Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on local semantic similarity, MORSE incorporates both local and vocabulary-wide semantic evaluations, making it the first unsupervised system to do so. The authors also critique the widely used Morpho Challenge (MC) datasets for their inadequacies, such as non-compositional segmentations and trivial instances, and propose a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) for English. Experiments demonstrate that MORSE outperforms the baseline Morfessor system in English and Turkish, while underperforming in Finnish due to morphological complexity and data sparsity. The authors suggest using sub-word-aware embeddings to address this limitation. The paper also highlights MORSE's robustness in avoiding over-segmentation errors, which are common in MDL-based systems like Morfessor.\nThe primary contributions of this work are:\n1. Introduction of MORSE: A novel unsupervised morpheme segmentation framework that integrates vocabulary-wide semantic consistency with orthographic features, achieving state-of-the-art results.\n2. Critique and Dataset Creation: A detailed critique of the MC datasets and the introduction of SD17, a semantically motivated dataset for English, which better evaluates compositionality in morpheme segmentation.\n3. Empirical Validation: Comprehensive experiments across three languages (English, Turkish, Finnish) and on the new SD17 dataset, demonstrating MORSE's competitive performance and its ability to handle compositionality.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Methodology: The integration of vocabulary-wide semantic consistency using word embeddings is a significant advancement over existing methods, addressing the limitations of local-only semantic evaluations.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple languages with varying morphological complexity and including a new dataset (SD17) that highlights MORSE's strengths in handling compositionality.\n3. Practical Contributions: The release of the MORSE code and the SD17 dataset enhances the reproducibility and utility of this work for the research community.\n4. Robustness to Over-Segmentation: MORSE demonstrates clear advantages over Morfessor in avoiding over-segmentation errors, particularly for semantically non-compositional words.\n5. Well-Written and Accessible: The paper is clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology, experiments, and results, making it accessible to a broad audience.\nWeaknesses\n1. Performance on Finnish: MORSE underperforms on Finnish due to data sparsity and morphological complexity. While the authors suggest using sub-word-aware embeddings, this limitation is not addressed experimentally, leaving room for improvement.\n2. Greedy Inference: The greedy inference approach may propagate errors, limiting MORSE's performance. A more global optimization strategy could potentially yield better results.\n3. Concatenative Morphology Limitation: MORSE is restricted to concatenative morphology, making it less effective for languages with non-concatenative morphological processes. This limitation is acknowledged but not addressed in the paper.\n4. Dependency on Tuning Data: Although the authors demonstrate that MORSE requires minimal tuning data, its reliance on supervised tuning sets contrasts with fully unsupervised systems like Morfessor, which may limit its applicability in low-resource settings.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide experimental results using sub-word-aware embeddings to address the performance issues in Finnish?\n2. Have you considered alternative inference strategies (e.g., beam search) to mitigate the limitations of the greedy approach?\n3. How does MORSE perform on languages with non-concatenative morphology (e.g., Arabic or Hebrew)? Could the framework be extended to handle such cases?\nRecommendation\nThe paper makes significant contributions to the field of morpheme segmentation, particularly through its novel use of vocabulary-wide semantic consistency and its critique of existing datasets. While there are limitations in handling morphologically complex languages and non-concatenative morphology, these do not detract from the overall impact of the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the questions raised and to explore potential extensions for broader applicability."
