            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a semi-automated framework for constructing evaluation datasets for compositional distributional semantics (CDS) models in languages other than English. The framework is applied to create a Polish dataset, consisting of 10,000 sentence pairs annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment. The dataset is intended to facilitate the evaluation of CDS models for Polish, an under-resourced and linguistically distinct language. The authors adapt the principles of the SICK corpus while introducing language-specific transformations and modifications to account for the unique characteristics of Polish. The paper also reports inter-annotator agreement metrics, demonstrating the dataset's reliability.\nThe primary contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Development of a Polish CDS Evaluation Dataset: The creation of a high-quality, human-annotated dataset for Polish is a significant contribution, addressing the lack of resources for this language and enabling future research in CDS models for Polish.\n2. Adaptation of the SICK Framework: The authors successfully adapt the SICK corpus design to Polish, introducing language-specific transformations and bidirectional entailment annotations, which are necessary for handling the linguistic complexity of Polish.\n3. Semi-Automated Dataset Construction Framework: The proposed framework, while demonstrated on Polish, has potential applicability to other languages, albeit with limitations.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Dataset for Polish: The dataset fills a critical gap for Polish NLP research, providing a resource comparable to the SICK corpus for English. The inter-annotator agreement metrics (Fleiss' Îº = 0.732 for entailment, Krippendorff's Î± = 0.780 for relatedness) indicate high reliability.\n2. Language-Specific Innovations: The authors demonstrate a thoughtful adaptation of the SICK methodology to Polish, including custom linguistic transformation rules and bidirectional entailment annotations, which are well-justified given the language's unique characteristics.\n3. Potential for Broader Application: While the framework is demonstrated on Polish, it could inspire similar efforts for other under-resourced languages, provided dependency parsers and linguistic expertise are available.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalizability: The reliance on dependency parsers and language-specific transformation rules raises questions about the framework's applicability to other languages, particularly those with limited NLP tools or significantly different linguistic structures.\n2. Lack of Transparency in Leader Judges' Edits: The paper does not report the extent or nature of leader judges' edits to the transformed sentences. This omission makes it difficult to assess the efficiency and correctness of the semi-automated framework.\n3. Grammatical Errors in the Paper: The presence of grammatical errors in the text suggests a lack of thorough proofreading, which detracts from the overall presentation and professionalism of the work.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide more details on the types and frequency of edits made by the leader judges? How do these edits impact the efficiency and correctness of the framework?\n2. How feasible is it to adapt this framework to other languages, especially those without robust dependency parsers or linguistic resources? What challenges do you foresee?\n3. Do you plan to release the transformation rules and other components of the framework to facilitate replication for other languages?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a valuable contribution by addressing the lack of evaluation datasets for Polish CDS models and adapting the SICK methodology to a linguistically distinct language. However, concerns about generalizability, transparency in the annotation process, and grammatical errors should be addressed before publication. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
