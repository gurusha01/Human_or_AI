            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel neural model for generating Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) from natural language (NL) descriptions. The approach is guided by Python grammar and employs depth-first generation strategies. The key contributions of the paper are:\n1. Syntax-Driven Code Generation: The model explicitly integrates Python grammar into the generation process, ensuring well-formed code and reducing the reliance on training data to infer syntax.\n2. Innovative Techniques: The paper introduces several novel mechanisms, including parent node feeding in LSTMs, a pointer network for copying terminal tokens, and unary closure to reduce tree size and improve efficiency.\n3. Empirical Results: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets (HEARTHSTONE, DJANGO, and IFTTT), demonstrating its ability to generate longer and more complex programs compared to prior work.\nStrengths\n1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology and thorough experimental analysis. The inclusion of appendix examples enhances understanding.\n2. Novelty: The work extends prior research on grammar-guided parsing and tree-based generation, introducing innovative techniques like parent feeding and unary closure. These contributions are particularly impactful for generating complex and large ASTs.\n3. Performance: The model significantly outperforms prior approaches on multiple datasets, showcasing its robustness and scalability. The use of grammar constraints ensures syntactically valid outputs, addressing a key limitation of existing sequence-to-sequence models.\n4. Grammar Size: The use of a larger grammar compared to previous work strengthens the contribution, as it demonstrates the model's ability to handle more complex syntactic structures.\nWeaknesses\n1. Evaluation Metrics: The reliance on code accuracy and BLEU as evaluation metrics may not fully capture the functional correctness of the generated code. Incorporating functionality-based metrics, such as running test cases, would provide a more robust assessment.\n2. Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not include results for the highest-scoring well-formed code from baseline models, which would allow for a fairer comparison of syntactic correctness.\n3. Parent Feeding Mechanism: While the parent feeding mechanism is novel, the paper does not clarify whether the child index affects parent feeding, as explored in Seq2Tree (Dong and Lapata, 2016). This omission leaves room for ambiguity in understanding the mechanism's full impact.\n4. Token Embedding: The paper does not specify whether possible tokens are embedded or if the token set is predefined. This detail is important for understanding the model's generalization capabilities.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Does the child index influence the parent feeding mechanism, as in Seq2Tree? If not, could this be a potential avenue for improvement?\n2. Are the possible tokens embedded, or is the token set predefined? How does this impact the model's ability to generalize to unseen tokens?\n3. Have you considered evaluating the functional correctness of the generated code using test cases? If so, what were the challenges in implementing this?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes significant contributions to the field of code generation and semantic parsing, particularly in its grammar-guided approach and innovative techniques. While there are some weaknesses in evaluation and baseline comparisons, they do not undermine the overall impact of the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the aforementioned concerns."
