The authors provide a theoretical justification for additive compositionality in SG embeddings, demonstrating that under certain assumptions, vector addition approximates semantic composition. They also establish that SG embeddings can be modified to align with SDR, which optimally preserves mutual information in co-occurrence statistics.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Theoretical Analysis of Compositionality: The paper formalizes compositionality in SG embeddings and identifies conditions under which vector addition holds as a composition operator.\n2. Connection to SDR: It links SG to SDR, showing that SG embeddings can be transformed into SDR embeddings, which are information-theoretically optimal.\n3. Insights into Analogy Tasks: The work explains why SG embeddings perform well in analogy tasks and highlights limitations when assumptions about word distributions are violated.\nStrengths\n1. Theoretical Depth: The paper provides a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding SG's compositionality, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Novel Connection to SDR: The link between SG and SDR is insightful, offering a new perspective on the optimality of SG embeddings and broadening their applicability.\n3. Community Relevance: By addressing the assumptions and limitations of SG, the paper contributes to a deeper understanding of word embeddings, which is valuable for both theoretical and applied research in NLP.\nWeaknesses\n1. Naive Linguistic Treatment of Compositionality: The paper oversimplifies linguistic processes, ignoring word order and context, which are critical for compositionality in natural language.\n2. Disconnected SDR Discussion: The connection to SDR, while interesting, feels tangential to the main focus on SG compositionality. The practical implications of this connection are not fully explored.\n3. Overly Long Abstract: The abstract is verbose and could be condensed to improve readability and focus.\n4. Terminology and Notation Issues: The use of \"synonym\" instead of \"paraphrase\" in certain contexts is misleading, and the notation for \"w\" and \"c\" is reversed, causing unnecessary confusion.\n5. Unaddressed Pragmatic Factors: The paper does not adequately consider how linguistic context and speaker intent influence word distributions, challenging some of its assumptions.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you clarify how the SDR connection could be practically leveraged in NLP applications beyond theoretical insights?\n2. How would incorporating word order or syntactic structures affect your compositionality framework?\n3. Could you provide empirical evidence to support the claim that SG embeddings are information-theoretically optimal in practice?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper makes significant theoretical contributions, its linguistic oversimplifications and disconnected SDR discussion detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on tightening the SDR connection, addressing linguistic nuances, and improving clarity in the abstract and notation."
