            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces MinIE, a system designed to improve the conciseness of Open Information Extraction (OIE) outputs while retaining accuracy through annotated, minimized extractions. The primary contributions of the work are:\n1. Minimization of OIE Extractions: MinIE employs hand-engineered rules to remove overly specific portions of extractions and replaces them with annotations for polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities. This approach improves the interpretability and usability of OIE outputs.\n \n2. Annotated Extractions: MinIE provides additional semantic information (e.g., polarity and modality) that is often overlooked in traditional OIE systems. This is a novel step toward enhancing the utility of extracted triples for downstream tasks.\n3. Evaluation Across Multiple Modes: The system offers various minimization modes (safe, frequency-based, collocation-based, and aggressive), allowing users to trade off between conciseness and precision. The experimental results demonstrate that MinIE achieves competitive or higher precision compared to prior systems while producing shorter extractions.\nStrengths\n1. Well-Motivated Problem: The paper addresses the practical challenge of overly verbose OIE outputs, which is a critical issue for downstream applications like knowledge base construction and question answering. The motivation is clear and compelling.\n \n2. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology. The inclusion of documented code and datasets enhances reproducibility and encourages adoption by the community.\n3. Encouraging Results: The experimental evaluation shows that MinIE achieves competitive precision and recall while significantly reducing extraction length. The annotations (e.g., polarity and modality) are a valuable addition that distinguishes MinIE from prior systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Scalability: The reliance on deterministic, hand-engineered minimization rules limits the scalability of the approach. The absence of a learning-based mechanism to dynamically infer minimization rules is a significant drawback, especially in large-scale or domain-specific applications.\n2. Neglected Literature: The paper overlooks recent advancements in semantically-informed OIE, such as the use of knowledge bases and sense inventories. Incorporating these could enhance the system's ability to handle complex sentences and nested extractions.\n3. Limited Experimental Scope: While the evaluation is sound, it is restricted to ClausIE as the base OIE system. Testing MinIE with other OIE systems (e.g., OLLIE, Stanford OIE) would provide stronger evidence of its generalizability. Additionally, the omission of the Stanovsky and Dagan (2016) OIE benchmark is a missed opportunity for broader comparative insights.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could MinIE be adapted to dynamically learn minimization rules from data rather than relying on hand-engineered rules? If so, what challenges do you foresee in implementing such an approach?\n2. Why was the Stanovsky and Dagan (2016) OIE benchmark not included in the evaluation? How do you expect MinIE to perform on this benchmark compared to other systems?\n3. How does MinIE handle nested extractions or cases where multiple layers of specificity are present? Are there plans to extend the system to address these scenarios?\nConclusion\nOverall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the OIE field by addressing the issue of overly verbose extractions with a novel minimization and annotation framework. However, the reliance on deterministic rules and the limited experimental scope reduce the potential impact of the work. Future iterations of MinIE could benefit from incorporating learning-based approaches and engaging with a broader range of OIE systems and benchmarks. Despite these limitations, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance due to its clear motivation, innovative annotations, and promising results."
