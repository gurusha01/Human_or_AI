            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper investigates how different writing tasks influence writing styles and presents a case study using the story cloze task. The authors demonstrate that stylistic features can distinguish between three types of writing tasks: writing an original story, writing a coherent ending, and writing an incoherent ending. A simple linear classifier achieves high accuracy in these distinctions, and the authors leverage these findings to establish a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze task. The paper claims three main contributions: (1) shedding light on how cognitive load affects writing style, (2) emphasizing the importance of task design in NLP datasets, and (3) achieving improved performance on the story cloze challenge.\nStrengths\nThe paper addresses a compelling topic that bridges writing style, discourse, and pragmatics, making it relevant to participants in these fields. The use of stylistic features to outperform deep learning models on the story cloze task is noteworthy, demonstrating the value of simple, interpretable methods in a domain often dominated by complex models. Additionally, the paper raises important methodological concerns about the design of NLP datasets, particularly the unintended stylistic biases introduced by task framing. These insights could guide better practices in future dataset creation.\nWeaknesses\n1. Insufficient Depth in Theoretical Discussion: While the paper touches on the implications of writing style for discourse and pragmatics, the discussion is underdeveloped. The connection between stylistic choices and cognitive processes remains speculative and lacks empirical grounding.\n2. Unclear Implications of Stylistic Features: The paper identifies stylistic differences (e.g., starting with proper nouns, ending with past tense verbs) but does not convincingly explain their relevance to discourse or pragmatics.\n3. Incomplete Comparisons: The comparison between deceptive language studies and the observed stylistic differences in short/long answers is superficial, leaving readers unclear about the broader implications of these findings.\n4. Vague Terminology: Terms like \"cognitive load\" and \"mental states\" are used without sufficient explanation or operationalization, making it difficult to assess their role in the study.\n5. Shallow Analysis of Coordinators: The discussion on the use of coordinators (e.g., \"and\") is limited and does not explore their functional role in short stories or discourse comprehensively.\n6. Unclear Target Audience: The paper does not specify its intended audience, leaving it unclear whether the findings are meant to inform language teachers, NLP practitioners, or cognitive scientists.\n7. Organizational Issues: The paper suffers from poor organization, with repetitive sections and unclear abbreviations in tables, which detract from readability and coherence.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more concrete evidence or examples linking specific stylistic features (e.g., starting with proper nouns) to cognitive processes or discourse functions?\n2. How do you envision the findings being applied in real-world contexts, such as language teaching or NLP task design?\n3. Could you elaborate on the role of coordinators in short stories and their potential implications for discourse analysis?\nRecommendation\nThe paper addresses an interesting and relevant topic, but it requires significant revisions to strengthen its theoretical contributions and clarify its implications for discourse and pragmatics. The authors should also improve the paper's organization and provide a clearer target audience. While the methodological contributions are promising, the paper's weaknesses currently outweigh its strengths, and I recommend a \"Major Revision\" before acceptance."
