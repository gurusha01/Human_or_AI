            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a joint CTC-attention end-to-end ASR framework that combines the strengths of both CTC and attention-based methods to improve training and decoding for Japanese and Mandarin Chinese speech recognition tasks. The authors apply their method to two benchmarks: the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and Mandarin Chinese telephone speech (MTS). The key contributions of this work are:\n1. The introduction of a hybrid CTC-attention framework that addresses alignment issues in attention-based ASR while leveraging the monotonic alignment properties of CTC.\n2. Application of the framework to ideogram-based languages (Japanese and Mandarin), demonstrating competitive performance without requiring linguistic resources such as pronunciation dictionaries or morphological analyzers.\n3. A simplified ASR model-building process that eliminates the need for complex components like GMM-HMM initialization and lattice generation, making it accessible to non-experts.\nStrengths\n1. Performance on Japanese and Mandarin ASR Tasks: The hybrid CTC-attention framework achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance to conventional systems on CSJ and MTS tasks without relying on linguistic resources. This is particularly noteworthy for languages with complex scripts like Japanese and Mandarin.\n2. Simplified Model Building: The proposed method eliminates the need for traditional ASR components such as pronunciation dictionaries and complex decoding mechanisms, significantly reducing the complexity of the model-building process.\n3. Alignment Improvements: The use of CTC as a regularization mechanism during training and decoding effectively addresses the misalignment issues inherent in attention-based ASR systems, as evidenced by the reduction in insertion and deletion errors.\n4. Scalability: The framework demonstrates scalability to large datasets (581 hours for CSJ) and achieves competitive results with moderate computational resources (single GPU).\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Novelty: The paper builds heavily on Kim et al. (2016), which also proposed a joint CTC-attention framework for English ASR. The authors fail to clearly differentiate their contributions from this prior work, particularly in terms of methodological advancements.\n2. Title and Introduction: The title is too general and does not emphasize the unique contributions of the paper. Similarly, the introduction lacks clarity in positioning the work within the existing literature and does not explicitly highlight the novelty of applying the framework to Japanese and Mandarin.\n3. Limited Discussion of Challenges: While the application to Japanese and Mandarin is interesting, the paper does not sufficiently discuss the specific challenges of these languages (e.g., handling multiple Japanese scripts or tonal variations in Mandarin) or how the proposed method addresses them.\n4. Citation Issue: The authors cite the pre-published arXiv version of Kim et al. (2016) instead of the official IEEE ICASSP version, which is a minor but important oversight.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method specifically address the challenges posed by multiple Japanese scripts or tonal variations in Mandarin? Are there any language-specific adaptations in the framework?\n2. Can you elaborate on the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to Kim et al. (2016)? Are there any optimizations unique to your implementation?\n3. Why was the weight parameter 位 set to 0.1 for CSJ and 0.5 for MTS? Could you provide further insights into the sensitivity of this parameter across different tasks?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper demonstrates strong results and practical applicability, the lack of clear differentiation from prior work and insufficient discussion of language-specific challenges weaken its contribution. A major revision is recommended to address these issues, particularly in clarifying the novelty and positioning of the work."
