            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach to dependency parsing for Singlish, an English-based creole, by leveraging neural stacking and Universal Dependencies (UD). The primary contributions of this work are as follows:\n1. Singlish Dependency Parser: The authors propose a deep-learning-based parser that integrates English syntactic knowledge into a Singlish parser using neural stacking. This approach achieves a significant improvement in labeled attachment score (LAS) of 76.57, outperforming both an English parser applied to Singlish (65.6 LAS) and a parser trained solely on Singlish data (64.01 LAS). This demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-lingual knowledge transfer for low-resource languages.\n2. Annotated Singlish Treebank: The paper introduces a 1,200-sentence Singlish dependency treebank annotated according to UD v1.4 guidelines. The treebank achieves an inter-annotator agreement of 85.3 UAS and 75.7 LAS for 100 double-annotated sentences, providing a valuable resource for future research on Singlish and other creoles.\n3. Error Analysis and Linguistic Insights: The authors conduct a detailed error analysis, highlighting improvements in parsing unique Singlish constructions such as topic-prominence, copula deletion, and discourse particles. They also evaluate the effectiveness of a stacked POS tagging model, which achieves a 31.58% relative error reduction over the baseline.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Performance Gains: The proposed parser achieves substantial improvements in LAS, showcasing the utility of neural stacking for cross-lingual transfer in low-resource settings. The results are robust and well-supported by experimental evidence.\n2. Linguistically Informed Approach: The paper demonstrates a deep understanding of Singlish grammar and its deviations from English. The authors effectively adapt UD guidelines to account for unique Singlish features, such as discourse particles and copula deletion.\n3. Resource Contribution: The creation and release of the Singlish dependency treebank is a significant contribution to the NLP community, addressing the scarcity of annotated resources for creole languages.\n4. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and provides clear explanations of the methodology, experiments, and results. The inclusion of glossed examples for unique Singlish constructions enhances readability.\nWeaknesses\n1. Annotation Quality Concerns: The inter-annotator agreement for the treebank is relatively low (75.7 LAS), raising initial concerns about annotation quality. While the rebuttal addresses this issue, further clarification on the annotation process and quality control measures would strengthen the paper.\n2. Limited Discussion on Discourse Relations: The treatment of discourse particles and their categorization could benefit from more detailed discussion, particularly regarding their impact on downstream tasks.\n3. Related Work: The paper could improve its positioning by referencing additional related work on creole languages and low-resource dependency parsing, particularly recent advancements in multilingual NLP.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you elaborate on the training and expertise of the annotators, as well as the steps taken to ensure annotation consistency?\n2. How do you envision the Singlish treebank being used for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis or information extraction? Are there specific challenges you foresee?\n3. Could you provide more details on the categorization and linguistic treatment of discourse particles in the treebank?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper makes a strong case for the importance of developing NLP tools for creole languages and demonstrates the potential of neural stacking for low-resource parsing. Addressing the concerns about annotation quality and expanding the discussion on discourse relations would further enhance the impact of this work. Overall, this is a valuable contribution to the conference and the broader NLP community."
