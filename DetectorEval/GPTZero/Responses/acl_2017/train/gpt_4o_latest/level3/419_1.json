            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a character-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for morphological paradigm completion in low-resource languages, leveraging transfer learning from high-resource languages. The primary contribution lies in applying a multilingual transfer learning approach\"\"previously explored in syntax and machine translation (MT)\"\"to the domain of morphology. The authors evaluate their method on 21 language pairs across four language families, demonstrating significant improvements over monolingual baselines, particularly in low-resource settings. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of language similarity on transfer effectiveness, highlighting the importance of linguistic relatedness. Notably, the method achieves up to 58% higher accuracy in low-resource settings and shows promise for zero-shot and one-shot learning scenarios.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty in Cross-Lingual Morphological Transfer: The paper effectively adapts multilingual transfer learning techniques to the domain of morphology, a less-explored area compared to syntax and MT. This is a meaningful contribution to low-resource NLP research.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments span 21 language pairs from diverse language families, providing robust evidence for the method's effectiveness. The inclusion of zero-shot and one-shot learning scenarios further demonstrates the model's versatility.\n3. Insightful Analysis of Language Similarity: The paper offers a compelling analysis of how linguistic relatedness impacts transfer learning performance, which is valuable for future research in cross-lingual NLP.\n4. Practical Implications: The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in low-resource NLP by enabling the use of state-of-the-art models for morphological tasks with limited annotated data.\n5. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology, experiments, and results, making it accessible to a broad audience.\nWeaknesses\n1. Choice of Baseline Language: The use of Arabic as a baseline is problematic due to its typological and morphological dissimilarity from the target languages. A more relevant baseline, such as a typologically closer language, would strengthen the evaluation.\n2. Limited Multilingual Scope: The methodology is primarily evaluated in bilingual settings. Extending the approach to multilingual settings (e.g., leveraging multiple source languages within Romance or Slavic families) would enhance its generalizability and practical utility.\n3. Unsubstantiated Claim on POS Tags: The authors claim that POS tags are easy to transfer across languages, which is inaccurate as POS transfer is also a challenging task. This weakens the argument for the universality of morphological transfer.\n4. Omission in Related Work: The paper overlooks prior studies on \"language-universal\" RNN models that share parameters across languages using language tags. Incorporating this literature would provide a more comprehensive context for the proposed approach.\n5. Unnecessary Discussion on Arabic Regularizer: The half-page discussion on Arabic as a regularizer is not particularly insightful and could be replaced with a more effective regularization technique or analysis.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can the proposed method be extended to multilingual transfer settings, where multiple source languages are used simultaneously? If not, what are the technical challenges?\n2. Why was Arabic chosen as a baseline despite its typological dissimilarity? Would a more relevant baseline, such as a language from the same family as the target, yield different insights?\n3. How does the model handle cases where the source and target languages use different scripts, and could this be further optimized?\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to low-resource NLP by introducing a novel and effective method for morphological paradigm completion. While there are some weaknesses, particularly in the choice of baseline and the scope of multilingual evaluation, the strengths outweigh these limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses."
