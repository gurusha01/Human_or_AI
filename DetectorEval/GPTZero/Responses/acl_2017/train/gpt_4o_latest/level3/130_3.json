            "inputText": "Review of the Research Paper\nSummary and Contributions \nThis paper addresses the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in speech narratives using complex network (CN) features enriched with word embeddings. The authors propose a lightweight, language-independent approach that avoids the manual preprocessing required by traditional linguistic methods. The study evaluates the proposed methodology on three datasets (DementiaBank, Cinderella, and Arizona-Battery) and demonstrates that CN features outperform linguistic features in classification tasks. The authors also explore ensemble and multi-view learning to improve classification accuracy, achieving notable improvements in the Cinderella and Arizona datasets. The primary contributions of this paper are: \n1. The novel application of complex network features enriched with word embeddings for MCI detection in speech transcripts. \n2. A comparative evaluation of CN features against linguistic and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features, demonstrating the effectiveness of CN features. \n3. The integration of ensemble and multi-view learning to enhance classification performance. \nStrengths \n1. Novelty in Feature Representation: The use of complex network features enriched with word embeddings is a novel and promising approach for MCI detection. This method circumvents the limitations of traditional linguistic features, such as dependency on grammatical text and manual preprocessing. \n2. Dataset Diversity: The study evaluates the proposed approach on three distinct datasets, including English and Portuguese narratives, demonstrating its potential for cross-linguistic applicability. \n3. Improved Accuracy with Multi-View Learning: The integration of multi-view learning and ensemble methods shows measurable improvements in classification accuracy, particularly in the Cinderella and Arizona datasets. \nWeaknesses \n1. Lack of Explanation for Key Concepts: Critical concepts such as multi-view learning, linguistic features, and dataset specifics are insufficiently explained, making it difficult for readers to fully understand the methodology. \n2. Disfluency Removal Justification: The rationale for removing disfluencies (e.g., pauses, repetitions) is unclear, despite their potential diagnostic importance for MCI. This omission could impact the robustness of the proposed method. \n3. Omission of tf-idf in BoW: The exclusion of the widely used tf-idf weighting scheme for BoW features is not justified, raising concerns about the thoroughness of the feature evaluation. \n4. Statistical Significance: The absence of statistical significance tests undermines the reliability of the reported improvements in classification accuracy. \n5. Readability and Writing Issues: The paper requires significant editing for clarity. The abstract is overly long, and several sentences throughout the paper are convoluted or poorly phrased. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. Why were disfluencies removed from the transcripts, given their potential importance for MCI detection? \n2. Can you provide more details on the multi-view learning scheme and how feature weights were determined? \n3. Why was the tf-idf weighting scheme excluded from the BoW feature evaluation? \nAdditional Comments \nThe related work section lacks depth and fails to provide a comprehensive comparison with other methods. Citations for key datasets, tools, and concepts (e.g., DementiaBank, Picnic picture, WML subtest) are missing, which detracts from the paper's credibility. The linguistic features section needs expansion and clarity, and a citation or link to transcription norms would improve understanding. Supplementary material could be included to clarify certain sections, as per conference guidelines. \nIn summary, while the paper presents a novel approach with promising results, significant revisions are needed to address the methodological gaps, missing details, and readability issues."
