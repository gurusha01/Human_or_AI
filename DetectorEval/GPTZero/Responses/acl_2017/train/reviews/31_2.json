I still do not find this use of a pipeline to be a\nparticularly interesting contribution.\n- You state that \"5. de Marneffe (2012) used additional annotated features in\ntheir system. For fair comparison, we re-implement their system with annotated\ninformation in FactBank.\" But the de Marneffe et al. feature cited in the\npaper, \"Predicate Classes\" requires only a dependency parser and vocabulary\nlists from Roser Saur√É¬≠'s PhD thesis; \"general classes of event\" might be\nreferring to FactML event classes, and while I admit it is not particularly\nclear in their work, I am sure they could clarify.\n- I continue to find the use of \"combined properly\" to be obscure. I agree that\nusing LSTM and CNN where respectively appropriate is valuable, but you seem to\nimply that some prior work has been improper, and that it is their combination\nwhich must be proper.\n- Thank you for reporting on separate LSTMs for each of the paths. I am curious\nas to why this combination may less effective. In any case, experiments with\nthis kind of alternative structure deserve to be reported.\n---\nThis paper introduces deep neural net technologies to the task of factuality\nclassification as defined by FactBank, with performance exceeding alternative\nneural net models and baselines reimplemented from the literature.\n- Strengths:\nThis paper is very clear in its presentation of a sophisticated model for\nfactuality classification and of its evaluation. It shows that the use of\nattentional features and BiLSTM clearly provide benefit over alternative\npooling strategies, and that the model also exceeds the performance of a more\ntraditional feature-based log-linear model. Given the small amount of training\ndata in FactBank, this kind of highly-engineered model seems appropriate. It is\ninteresting to see that the BiLSTM/CNN model is able to provide benefit despite\nlittle training data.\n- Weaknesses:\nMy main concerns with this work regard its (a) apparent departure from the\nevaluation procedure in the prior literature; (b) failure to present prior work\nas a strong baseline; and (c) novelty.\nWhile I feel that the work is original in engineering deep neural nets for the\nfactuality classification task, and that such work is valuable, its approach is\nnot particularly novel, and \"the proposal of a two-step supervised framework\"\n(line 087) is not particularly interesting given that FactBank was always\ndescribed in terms of two facets (assuming I am correct to interpret \"two-step\"\nas referring to these facets, which I may not be).\nThe work cites Saur√É¬≠ and Pustejovsky (2012), but presents their much earlier\n(2008) and weaker system as a baseline; nor does it consider Qian et al.'s\n(IALP 2015) work which compares to the former. Both these works are\ndeveloped\non the TimeBank portion of FactBank and evaluated on a held-out ACQUAINT\nTimeBank section, while the present work does not report results on a held-out\nset.\nde Marneffe et al.'s (2012) system is also chosen as a baseline, but not all\ntheir features are implemented, nor is the present system evaluated on their\nPragBank corpus (or other alternative representations of factuality proposed in\nPrabhakaran et al. (*SEM 2015) and Lee et al. (EMNLP 2015)). The evaluation is\ntherefore somewhat lacking in comparability to prior work.\nThere were also important questions left unanswered in evaluation, such as the\neffect of using gold standard events or SIPs.\nGiven the famed success of BiLSTMs with little feature engineering, it is\nsomewhat disappointing that this work does not attempt to consider a more\nminimal system employing deep neural nets on this task with, for instance, only\nthe dependency path from a candidate event to its SIP plus a bag of modifiers\nto that path. The inclusion of heterogeneous information in one BiLSTM was an\ninteresting feature, which deserved more experimentation: what if the order of\ninputs were permuted? what if delimiters were used in concatenating the\ndependency paths in RS instead of the strange second \"nsubj\" in the RS chain of\nline 456? What if each of SIPpath, RSpath, Cue_path were input to a separate\nLSTM and combined? The attentional features were evaluated together for the CNN\nand BiLSTM components, but it might be worth reporting whether it was\nbeneficial for each of these components. Could you benefit from providing path\ninformation for the aux words? Could you benefit from character-level\nembeddings to account for morphology's impact on factuality via tense/aspect?\nProposed future work is lacking in specificity seeing as there are many\nquestions raised by this model and a number of related tasks to consider\napplying it to.\n- General Discussion:\n194: Into what classes are you classifying events?\n280: Please state which are parameters of the model.\n321: What do you mean by \"properly\"? You use the same term in 092 and it's not\nclear which work you consider improper nor why.\n353: Is \"the chain form\" defined anywhere? Citation? The repetition of nsubj in\nthe example of line 456 seems an unusual feature for the LSTM to learn.\n356: It may be worth footnoting here that each cue is classified separately.\n359: \"distance\" -> \"surface distance\"\n514: How many SIPs? Cues? Perhaps add to Table 3.\nTable 2. Would be good if augmented by the counts for embedded and author\nevents. Percentages can be removed if necessary.\n532: Why 5-fold? Given the small amount of training data, surely 10-fold would\nbe more useful and not substantially increase training costs.\n594: It's not clear that this benefit comes from PSen, nor that the increase is\nsignificant or substantial. Does it affect overall results substantially?\n674: Is this significance across all metrics?\n683: Is the drop of F1 due to precision, recall or both?\n686: Not clear what this sentence is trying to say.\nTable 4: From the corpus sizes, it seems you should only report 2 significant\nfigures for most columns (except CT+, Uu and Micro-A).\n711: It seems unsurprising that RS_path is insufficient given that the task is\nwith respect to a SIP and other inputs do not encode that information. It would\nbe more interesting to see performance of SIP_path alone.\n761: This claim is not precise, to my understanding. de Marneffe et al (2012)\nevaluates on PragBank, not FactBank.\nMinor issues in English usage:\n112: \"non-application\" -> \"not applicable\"\n145: I think you mean \"relevant\" -> \"relative\"\n154: \"can be displayed by a simple source\" is unclear\n166: Not sure what you mean by \"basline\". Do you mean \"pipeline\"?"
