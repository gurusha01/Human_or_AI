This work shows a new scheme for\ncomputational semantics, benefiting from an end-to-end transition-based\nincremental framework, which resolves the parsing with low cost.\n- Weaknesses:\n My major concern is that the paper only gives a very common introduction for\nthe\ndefinition of DMRS and EP, and the example even makes me a little confused\nbecause I cannot see anything special for DMRS. The description can be a little\nmore detailed, I think. However, upon the space limitation, it is\nunderstandable. The same problem exists for the transition system of the\nparsing model. If I do not have any background of MRS and EP, I can hardly\nlearn something from the paper, just seeing that this paper is very good.\n- General Discussion:\n Overall, this paper is very interesting to me. I like the DMRS for semantic\nparsing very much and like the paper very much. Hope that the open-source codes\nand datasets can make this line of research being a hot topic."
