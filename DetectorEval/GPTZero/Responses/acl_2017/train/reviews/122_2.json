If no, the\nterm 'joint' could be misleading that this model is able to handle both tasks.\n- Could you please provide some statistics about how many errors were corrected\nfrom the original DSTC2 dataset?\nIf it is not very huge, the experiment could include the comparisons also with\nother published work including DSTC2 entries using the same dataset.\n- What do you think about using RNNs or LSTMs to learn the sequential aspects\nin learning utterance representations?\nConsidering the recent successes of these recurrent networks in SLU problems,\nit could be effective to DST as well.\n- Some more details about the semantic dictionary used with the baseline would\nhelp to imply the cost for building this kind of resources manually.\n- It would be great if you could give some samples which were not correctly\npredicted by the baseline but solved with your proposed models."
