The\nevaluation section is also extensive and thus, the experiments are convincing.\n- Weaknesses:\n - In Section 3 it is not clear what is exactly the dataset that you used\nfor training the SVM and your own model. Furthermore, you only give the\nstarting date for collecting the testing data, but there is no other\ninformation related to the size of the dataset or the time frame when the data\nwas collected. This might also give some insight for the results and statistics\ngiven in Section 3.2.\n - In Table 3 we can see that the number of reviewers is only slightly\nlower than the number of reviews posted (at least for hotels), which means that\nonly a few reviewers posted more than one review, in the labeled dataset. How\ndoes this compare with the full dataset in Table 2? What is the exact number of\nreviewers in Table 2 (to know what is the percentage of labeled reviewers)? It\nis also interesting to know how many reviews are made by one person on average.\nIf there are only a few reviewers that post more than one review (i.e., not\nthat much info to learn from), the results would benefit from a thorough\ndiscussion. \n- General Discussion:\n This paper focuses on identifying spam reviews under the assumption that\nwe deal with a cold-start problem, i.e., we do not have enough information to\ndraw a conclusion. The paper proposes a neural network model that learns how to\nrepresent new reviews by jointly using embedded textual information and\nbehaviour information. Overall, the paper is very well written and the results\nare compelling.\n- Typos and/or grammar: \n - The new reviewer only provide us \n - Jindal and Liu (2008) make the first step -> the work is quite old, you\ncould use past tense to refer to it\n - Usage of short form \"can't\", \"couldn't\", \"what's\"\ninstead of the prefered long form\n - The following sentence is not clear and should be rephrased: \"The new\nreviewer just posted one review and we have to filter it out immediately, there\nis not any historical reviews provided to us.\""
