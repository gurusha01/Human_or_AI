The authors have\ncreated a large dataset for relation extraction as question answering which\nwould likely be useful to the community.\n- Weaknesses:\nComparison and credit to existing work is severely lacking. Contributions of\nthe paper don't seen particularly novel.\n- General Discussion:\nThe authors perform relation extraction as reading comprehension. In order to\ntrain reading comprehension models to perform relation extraction, they create\na large dataset of 30m \"querified\" (converted to natural language)\nrelations by asking mechanical turk annotators to write natural language\nqueries for relations from a schema. They use the reading comprehension model\nof Seo et al. 2016, adding the ability to return \"no relation,\" as the\noriginal model must always return an answer. The main motivation/result of the\npaper appears to be that the authors can perform zero-shot relation extraction,\nextracting relations only seen at test time.\nThis paper is well-written and the idea is interesting. However, there are\ninsufficient experiments and comparison to previous work to convince me that\nthe paper's contributions are novel and impactful.\nFirst, the authors are missing a great deal of related work: Neelakantan at al.\n2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06662) perform zero-shot relation extraction\nusing RNNs over KB paths. Verga et al. 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05804)\nperform relation extraction on unseen entities. The authors cite Bordes et al.\n(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02075.pdf), who collect a similar dataset and\nperform relation extraction using memory networks (which are commonly used for\nreading comprehension). However, they merely note that their data was annotated\nat the \"relation\" level rather than at the triple (relation, entity pair)\nlevel\"¦ but couldn't Bordes et al. have done the same in their annotation?\nIf there is some significant difference here, it is not made clear in the\npaper. There is also a NAACL 2016 paper\n(https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-2016.pdf) which performs relation\nextraction using a new model based on memory networks\"¦ and I'm sure there\nare more. Your work is so similar to much of this work that you should really\ncite and establish novelty wrt at least some of them as early as the\nintroduction -- that's how early I was wondering how your work differed, and it\nwas not made clear.\nSecond, the authors neither 1) evaluate their model on another dataset or 2)\nevaluate any previously published models on their dataset. This makes their\nempirical results extremely weak. Given that there is a wealth of existing work\nthat performs the same task and the lack of novelty of this work, the authors\nneed to include experiments that demonstrate that their technique outperforms\nothers on this task, or otherwise show that their dataset is superior to others\n(e.g. since it is much larger than previous, does it allow for better\ngeneralization?)"
