Clarity in some sections. \nThe paper presents a neural learning method for entity disambiguation and\nlinking. It introduces a good idea to integrate entity, mention and sense\nmodeling within the smame neural language modeling technique. The simple\ntraining procedure connected with the modeling allows to support a large set of\napplication.\nThe paper is clear formally, but the discussion is not always at the same level\nof the technical ideas.\nThe empirical evaluation is good although not striking improvements of the\nperformance are reported. Although it seems an extension of (Yamada et al.,\nCoNLL 2016), it adds novel ideas and it is of a releant interest.\nThe weaker points of the paper are:\n- The prose is not always clear. I found Section 3 not as clear. Some details\nof Figure 2 are not explained and the terminology is somehow redundant: for\nexample, why do you refer to the dictionary of mentions? or the dictionary of\nentity-mention pairs? are these different from text anchors and types for\nannotated text anchors?\n- Tha paper is quite close in nature to Yamada et al., 2016) and the authors\nshould at least outline the differences.\nOne general observation on the current version is:\nThe paper tests the Multiple Embedding model against entity\nlinking/disambiguation tasks. However, word embeddings are not only used to\nmodel such tasks, but also some processes not directly depending on entities of\nthe KB, e.g. parsing, coreference or semantic role labeling. \nThe authors should show that the word embeddings provided by the proposed MPME\nmethod are not weaker wrt to simpler wordspaces in such other semantic tasks,\ni.e. those involving directly entity mentions.\nI did read the author's response."
