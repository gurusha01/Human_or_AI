Some methods are really old and\nit doesn't seem justified to show them here (e.g., Mpttern).\n- Memb is apparently the previous state-of-the-art, but there is no mention to\nany reference.\n- While it looks like the method outperforms the previous best performing\napproach, the paper is not convincing enough. Especially, on the first dataset,\nthe difference between the new system and the previous state-of-the-art one is\npretty small.\n- The paper seriously lacks proofreading, and could not be published until this\nis fixed \"\" for instance,Â I noted 11 errors in the first column of page 2.\n- The CilinE hierarchy is very shallow (5 levels only). However apparently, it\nhas been used in the past by other authors. I would expect that the deeper the\nmore difficult it is to branch new hyponym-hypernyms. This can explain the very\nhigh results obtained (even by previous studies)...\n- General Discussion:\nThe approach itself is not really original or novel, but it is applied to a\nproblem that has not been addressed with deep learning yet. For this reason, I\nthink this paper is interesting, but there are two main flaws. The first and\neasiest to fix is the presentation. There are many errors/typos that need to be\ncorrected. I started listing them to help, but there are just too many of them.\nThe second issue is the evaluation, in my opinion. Technically, the\nperformances are better, but it does not feel convincing as explained above.\nWhat is Memb, is it the method from Shwartz et al 2016, maybe? If not, what\nperformance did this recent approach have? I think the authors need to\nreorganize the evaluation section, in order to properly list the baseline\nsystems, clearly show the benefit of their approach and where the others fail.\nSignificance tests also seem necessary given the slight improvement on one\ndataset."
