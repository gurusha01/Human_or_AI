It is possible\nto follow most of the explanation, the ideas presented are original and the\nresults obtained are quite interesting.\n- Weaknesses: I have some doubts about the interpretation of the results. In\naddition, I think that some of the claims regarding the capability of the\nmethod proposed to learn morphology are not propperly backed by scientific\nevidence.\n- General Discussion:\nThis paper explores a complex architecture for character-level neural machine\ntranslation (NMT). The proposed architecture extends a classical\nencoder-decoder architecture by adding a new deep word-encoding layer capable\nof encoding the character-level input into sub-word representations of the\nsource-language sentence. In the same way, a deep word-decoding layer is added\nto the output to transform the target-language sub-word representations into a\ncharacter sequence as the final output of the NMT system. The objective of such\narchitecture is to take advantage of the benefits of character-level NMT\n(reduction of the size of the vocabulary and flexibility to deal with unseen\nwords) and, at the same time, improving the performance of the whole system by\nusing an intermediate representation of sub-words to reduce the size of the\ninput sequence of characters. In addition, the authors claim that their deep\nword-encoding model is able to learn morphology better than other\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\nI have some concerns regarding the evaluation. The authors compare their\napproach to other state-of-the-art systems taking into account two parameters:\ntraining time and BLEU score. However, I do not clearly see the advantage of\nthe model proposed (DCNMT) in front of other approaches such as bpe2char. The\ndifference between both approaches as regards BLEU score is very small (0.04 in\nCs-En and 0.1 in En-Cs) and it is hard to say if one of them is outperforming\nthe other one without statistical significance information: has statistical\nsignificance been evaluated? As regards the training time, it is worth\nmentioning that the bpe2char for Cs-En takes 8 days less than DCNMT. For En-Cs\ntraining time is not provided (why not?) and for En-Fr bpe2char is not\nevaluated. I think that a more complete comparison with this system should be\ncarried out to prove the advantages of the model proposed.\nMy second concern is on the 5.2 Section, where authors start claiming that they\ninvestigated about the ability of their system to learn morphology. However,\nthe section only contains a examples and some comments on them. Even though\nthese examples are very well chosen and explained in a very didactic way, it is\nworth noting that no experiments or formal evaluation seem to have been\ncarried out to support the claims of the authors. I would definitely encourage\nauthors to extend this very interesting part of the paper that could even\nbecome a different paper itself. On the other hand, this Section does not seem\nto be a critical point of the paper, so for the current work I may suggest just\nto move this section to an appendix and soften some of the claims done\nregarding the capabilities of the system to learn morphology.\nOther comments, doubts and suggestions:\n - There are many acronyms that are used but are not defined (such as LSTM,\nHGRU, CNN or PCA) or which are defined after starting to use them (such as RNN\nor BPE). Even though some of these acronyms are well known in the field of deep\nlearning, I would encourage the authors to defined them to improve clearness.\n - The concept of energy is mentioned for the first time in Section 3.1. Even\nthough the explanation provided is enough at that point, it would be nice to\nrefresh the idea of energy in Section 5.2 (where it is used several times) and\nproviding some hints about how to interpret it: a high energy on a character\nwould be indicating that the current morpheme should be split at that point? In\naddition, the concept of peak (in Figure 5) is not described.\n - When the acronym BPE is defined, capital letters are used, but then, for the\nrest of mentions it is lower cased; is there a reason for this?\n - I am not sure if it is necessary to say that no monolingual corpus is used\nin Section 4.1.\n - It seems that there is something wrong with Figure 4a since the colours for\nthe energy values are not shown for every character.\n - In Table 1, the results for model (3) (Chung et al. 2016) for Cs-En were not\ntaken from the papers, since they are not reported. If the authors computed\nthese results by themselves (as it seems) they should mention it.\n - I would not say that French is morphologically poor, but rather that it is\nnot that rich as Slavic languages such as Czech.\n - Why a link is provided for WMT'15 training corpora but not for WMT'14?\n - Several references are incomplete\nTypos:\n - \"..is the bilingual, parallel corpora provided...\" -> \"..are the bilingual,\nparallel corpora provided...\"\n - \"Luong and Manning (2016) uses\" -> \"Luong and Manning (2016) use\"\n - \"HGRU (It is\" -> \"HGRU (it is\"\n - \"coveres\" -> \"covers\"\n - \"both consists of two-layer RNN, each has 1024\" -> \"both consist of\ntwo-layer RNN, each have 1024\"\n - \"the only difference between CNMT and DCNMT is CNMT\" -> \"the only\ndifference between CNMT and DCNMT is that CNMT\""
