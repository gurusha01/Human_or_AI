However, I have some high-level\nconcerns, which are not addressed in the paper. Perhaps the authors can\naddress these in their response.\n(1) I was a bit surprised by the constant reference and comparison to Wen 2016,\nwhich is a fairly obscure paper I have not previously heard of. It would be\nbetter if the authors justified their work by comparison to well-known corpora,\nsuch as the ones they list in Section 2. Also, there are many other NLG\nprojects that looked at microplanning issue when verbalising DBPedia, indeed\nthere was a workshop in 2016 with many papers on NLG and DBPedia\n(https://webnlg2016.sciencesconf.org/ and\nhttp://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/3500); see also previous work by Duboue and\nKutlak. I would like to see less of a fixation on Wen (2016), and more\nawareness of other work on NLG and DBPedia.\n(2) Microplanning tends to be very domain/genre dependent. For example,\npronouns are used much more often in novels than in aircraft maintenance\nmanuals. This is why so much work has focused on domain-dependent resources. \n So there are some real questions about whether it is possible even in theory\nto train a \"wide-coverage microplanner\". The authors do not discuss this at\nall; they need to show they are aware of this concern.\n(3) I would be concerned about the quality of the texts obtained from\ncrowdsourcing. A lot of people dont write very well, so it is not at all\nclear\nto me that gathering example texts from random crowdsourcers is going to\nproduce a good corpus for training microplanners. Remember that the ultimate\ngoal of microplanning is to produce texts that are easy to read. Imitating\nhuman writers (which is what this paper does, along with most learning\napproaches to microplanning) makes sense if we are confident that the human\nwriters have produced well-written easy-to-read texts. Which is a\nreasonable\nassumption if the writers are professional journalists (for example), but a\nvery dubious one if the writers are random crowdsourcers.\nFrom a presentational perspective, the authors should ensure that all text in\ntheir paper meets the ACL font size criteria. Some of the text in Fig 1 and\n(especially) Fig 2 is tiny and very difficult to read; this text should be the\nsame font size as the text in the body of the paper.\nI will initially rate this paper as borderline. I look forward to seeing the\nauthor's response, and will adjust my rating accordingly."
