Experiments using meeting corpora show\nthat the proposed model has higher performance than the SVM-based classifier.\n- Strengths:\nThe paper is written to be easy to read. Technical details are described fully,\nand high performance is also shown in experimental evaluation. It also shows\nuseful comparisons with related research in the field of discourse structure\nanalysis and key phrase identification. It is interesting to note that not only\nthe performance evaluation of phrase selection from discourse, discourse\nrelation labeling, and summary generation as their applications, but also\napplication to the prediction of the consistency of understanding by team\nmembers is also verified .\n- Weaknesses:\nJointly Modeling salient phrase extraction and discourse relationship labeling\nbetween speaker turns has been proposed. If intuitive explanation about their\ninteractivity and the usefulness of considering it is fully presented.\n- General Discussion:\nSVM-based classifier is set as a comparative method in the experiment. It would\nbe useful to mention the validity of the setting."
