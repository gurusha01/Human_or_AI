            "inputText": "This paper presents a new dataset with annotations of products coming from\nonline cybercrime forums. The paper is clear and well-written and the\nexperiments are good. Every hypothesis is tested and compared to each other.\nHowever, I do have some concerns about the paper:\n1. The authors took the liberty to change the font size and the line spacing of\nthe abstract, enabling them to have a longer abstract and to fit the content\ninto the 8 pages requirement.\n2. I don't think this paper fits the tagging, chunking, parsing area, as it is\nmore an information extraction problem.\n3. I have difficulties to see why some annotations such as sombody in Fig. 1\nare related to a product.\n4. The basic results are very basic indeed and - with all the tools available\nnowadays in NLP -, I am sure that it would have been possible to have more\nelaborate baselines without too much extra work.\n5. Domain adaptation experiments corroborate what we already know about\nuser-generated data where two forums on video games, e.g., may have different\ntypes of users (age, gender, etc.) leading to very different texts. So this\ndoes not give new highlights on this specific problem."
