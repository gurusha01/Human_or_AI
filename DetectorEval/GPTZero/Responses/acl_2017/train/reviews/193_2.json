The parser is transition based, and uses a new transition set\ndesigned to recover challenging discontinuous structures with reentrancies.\nExperiments demonstrate that the parser works well, and that it is not easy to\nbuild these representation on top of existing parsing approaches. \nThis is a well written and interesting paper on an important problem. The\ntransition system is well motivated and seems to work well for the problem. The\nauthors also did a very thorough experimental evaluation, including both\nvarying the classifier for the base parser (neural, linear model, etc.) and\nalso comparing to the best output you could get from other existing, but less\nexpressive, parsing formulations. This paper sets a strong standard to UCCA\nparsing, and should also be interesting to researchers working with other\nexpressive meaning representations or complex transition systems. \nMy only open question is the extent to which this new parser subsumes all of\nthe other transition based parsers for AMR, SDP, etc. Could the UCCA transition\nscheme be used in these cases (which heuristic alignments if necessary), and\nwould it just learn to not use the extra transitions for non-terminals, etc.\nWould it reduce to an existing algorithm, or perhaps work better? Answering\nthis question isn't crucial, the paper is very strong as is, but it would add\nto the overall understanding and could point to interesting areas for future\nwork.\n----\nI read the author response and agree with everything they say."
