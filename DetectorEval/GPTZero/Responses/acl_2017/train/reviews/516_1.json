The paper is well-organized\nand the combination of synthetic and user experiments make for a strong paper.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper is fairly limited in scope in terms of the interactive topic model\napproaches it compares against. I am willing to accept this, since they do make\nreference to most of them and explain that these other approaches are not\nnecessarily fast enough for interactive experimentation or not conducive to the\ntypes of interaction being considered with an \"anchoring\" interface. Some level\nof empirical support for these claims would have been nice, though.\nIt would also have been nice to see experiments on more than one data set (20\nnewsgroups, which is now sort of beaten-to-death).\n- General Discussion:\nIn general, this is a strong paper that appears to offer an incremental but\nnovel and practical contribution to interactive topic modeling. The authors\nmade the effort to vet several variants of the approach in simulated\nexperiments, and to conduct fairly exhaustive quantitative analyses of both\nsimulated and user experiments using a variety of metrics that measure\ndifferent facets of topic quality."
