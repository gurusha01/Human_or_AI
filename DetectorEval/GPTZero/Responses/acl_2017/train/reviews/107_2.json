            "inputText": "This paper describes a model for cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER).\nThe authors employ conditional random fields, maximum entropy Markov, and\nneural network-based NER methods. In addition, authors propose two methods to\ncombine the output of those methods (probability-based and ranking-based), and\na method to select the best training instances from cross-lingual comparable\ncorpora. The cross-lingual projection is done using a variant of Mikolov's\nproposal. In general, the paper is easy to follow, well-structured, and the\nEnglish quality is also correct. The results of the combined annotations are\ninteresting.\nDetailed comments:\nI was wondering which is the motivation behind proposing a Continuous\nBag-of-word (CBOW) model variation. You don't give much details about this\n(or the parameters employed). Was the original model (or the Continuous\nSkip-gram model) offering low results? I suggest to include also the results\nwith the CBOW model, so readers can analyse the improvements of your approach.\nSince you use a decay factor for the surrounding embeddings, I suggest to take\na look to the exponential decay used in [1].\nSimilarly to the previous comment, I would like to look at the differences\nbetween the original Mikolov's cross-lingual projections and your frequency\nweighted projections. These contributions are more valuable if readers can see\nthat your method is really superior.\n\"the proposed data selection scheme is very effective in selecting\ngood-quality projection-labeled data and the improvement is significant\" Ã¢ÂÂ\nHave you conducted a test of statistical significance? I would like to know if\nthe differences between result in this work are significant. \nI suggest to integrate the text of Section 4.4 at the beginning of Section 4.2.\nIt would look cleaner. I also recommend to move the evaluation of Table 2 to\nthe evaluation section.\nI miss a related work section. Your introduction includes part of that\ninformation. I suggest to divide the introduction in two sections.\nThe evaluation is quite short (1.5 pages with conclusion section there). You\nobtain state-of-the-art results, and I would appreciate more discussion and\nanalysis of the results.\nSuggested references:\n[1] Iacobacci, I., Pilehvar, M. T., & Navigli, R. (2016).
