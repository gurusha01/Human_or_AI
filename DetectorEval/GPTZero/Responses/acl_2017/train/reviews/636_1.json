It also introduces some novel ideas\n(sharing the dilated convolution block, predicting the tags at each convolution\nlevel), which I think will prove useful to the community. The paper performs\nextensive ablation experiments to show the effectiveness of their approach.\nI found the writing to be very clear, and the experiments were exceptionally\nthorough.\nStrengths: \n- Extensive experiments against various architectures (LSTM, LSTM + CRF) \n- Novel architectural/training ideas (sharing blocks) \nWeaknesses: \n- Only applied to English NER--this is a big concern since the title of the\npaper seems to reference sequence-tagging directly. \n- Section 4.1 could be clearer. For example, I presume there is padding to make\nsure the output resolution after each block is the same as the input\nresolution. Might be good to mention this. \n- I think an ablation study of number of layers vs perf might be interesting.\nRESPONSE TO AUTHOR REBUTTAL:\nThank you very much for a thoughtful response. Given that the authors have\nagreed to make the content be more specific to NER as opposed to\nsequence-tagging, I have revised my score upward."
