            "inputText": "This paper proposes an approach for classifying literal and metaphoric\nadjective-noun pairs. The authors create a word-context matrix for adjectives\nand nouns where each element of the matrix is the PMI score. They then use\ndifferent methods for selecting dimensions of this matrix to represent each\nnoun/adjective as a vector. The geometric properties of average, nouns, and\nadjective vectors and their normalized versions are used as features in\ntraining a regression model for classifying the pairs to literal or metaphor\nexpressions. Their approach performs similarly to previous work that learns a\nvector representation for each adjective.\nSupervision and zero-shot learning. The authors argue that their approach\nrequires less supervision (compared to previous work) and can do zero-shot\nlearning. I don't think this is quite right and given that it seems to be one\nof the main points of the paper, I think it is worth clarifying. The approach\nproposed in the paper is a supervised classification task: The authors form\nvector representations from co-occurrence statistics, and then use the\nproperties of these representations and the gold-standard labels of each pair\nto train a classifier. The model (similarly to any other supervised classifier)\ncan be tested on words that did not occur in the training data; but, the model\ndoes not learn from such examples. Moreover, those words are not really\n\"unseen\" because the model needs to have a vector representation of those\nwords.\nInterpretation of the results. The authors provide a good overview of the\nprevious related work on metaphors. However, I am not sure what the intuition\nabout their approach is (that is, using the geometric properties such as vector\nlength in identifying metaphors). For example, why are the normalized vectors\nconsidered? It seems that they don't contribute to a better performance.\nMoreover, the most predictive feature is the noun vector; the authors explain\nthat this is a side effect of the data which is collected such that each\nadjective occurs in both metaphoric and literal expressions. (As a result, the\nadjective vector is less predictive.) It seems that the proposed approach might\nbe only suitable for the given data. This shortcoming is two-fold: (a) From the\ntheoretical perspective (and especially since the paper is submitted to the\ncognitive track), it is not clear what we learn about theories of metaphor\nprocessing. (b) From the NLP applications standpoint, I am not sure how\ngeneralizable this approach is compared to the compositional models.\nNovelty. The proposed approach for representing noun/adjective vectors is very\nsimilar to that of Agres et al. It seems that the main contribution of the\npaper is that they use the geometric properties to classify the vectors."
