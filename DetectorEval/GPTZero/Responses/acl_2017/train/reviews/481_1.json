            "inputText": "In this work, the authors extend MS-COCO by adding an incorrect\ncaption to each existing caption, with only one word of difference.\nThe authors demonstrate that two state-of-the-art methods (one for VQA\nand one for captioning) perform extremely poorly at a) determining if\na caption is fake, b) determining which word in a fake caption is\nwrong, and c) selecting a replacement word for a given fake word.\nThis work builds upon a wealth of literature regarding the\nunderperformance of vision/language models relative to their apparent\ncapacities. I think this work makes concrete some of the big,\nfundamental questions in this area: are vision/language models doing\n\"interesting\" things, or not? The authors consider a nice mix of tasks\nand models to shed light on the \"broken-ness\" of these settings, and\nperform some insightful analyses of factors associated with model\nfailure (e.g., Figure 3).\nMy biggest concerns with the paper are similarity to Ding et al. That\nbeing said, I do think the authors make some really good points; Ding\net al. generate similar captions, but the ones here differ by only one\nword and still break the models -- I think that's a justifiably\nfundamental difference. That observation demonstrates that Ding et\nal.'s engineering is not a requirement, as this simple approach still\nbreaks things catastrophically.\nAnother concern is the use of NeuralTalk to select the \"hardest\"\nfoils. While a clever idea, I am worried that the use of this model\ncreates a risk of self-reinforcement bias, i.e., NeuralTalk's biases\nare now fundamentally \"baked-in\" to FOIL-COCO. \nI think the results section could be a bit longer, relative to the\nrest of the paper (e.g. I would've liked more than one paragraph -- I\nliked this part!)\nOverall, I do like this paper, as it nicely builds upon some results\nthat highlight defficiencies in vision/language integration. In the\nend, the Ding et al. similarity is not a \"game-breaker,\" I think -- if\nanything, this work shows that vision/language models are so easy to\nfool, Ding et al.'s method is not even required.\nSmall things:\nI would've liked to have seen another baseline that simply\nconcatenates BoW + extracted CNN features and trains a softmax\nclassifier over them. The \"blind\" model is a nice touch, but what\nabout a \"dumb\" vision+langauge baseline? I bet that would do close to\nas well as the LSTM/Co-attention. That could've made the point of the\npaper even stronger.\n330: What is a supercategory? Is this from WordNet? Is this from COCO?\nI understand the idea, but not the specifics.\n397: has been -> were\n494: that -> than\n693: artefact -> undesirable artifacts (?)\n701: I would have included a chance model in T1's table -- is 19.53%\n[Line 592] a constant-prediction baseline? Is it 50% (if so, can't we\nflip all of the \"blind\" predictions to get a better baseline?) I am\nnot entirely clear, and I think a \"chance\" line here would fix a lot\nof this confusion.\n719: ariplane\n~~\nAfter reading the author response...\nI think this author response is spot-on. Both my concerns of NeuralTalk biases\nand additional baselines were addressed, and I am confident that these can be\naddressed in the final version, so I will keep my score as-is."
