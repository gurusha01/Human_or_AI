            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis paper proposes an evaluation metric for automatically evaluating the\nquality of dialogue responses in non-task-oriented dialogue. The metric\noperates on continuous vector space representations obtained by using RNNs and\nit comprises two components: one that compares the context and the given\nresponse and the other that compares a reference response and the given\nresponse. The comparisons are conducted by means of dot product after\nprojecting the response into corresponding context and reference response\nspaces. These projection matrices are learned by minimizing the squared error\nbetween the model predictions and human annotations.\nI think this work gives a remarkable step forward towards the evaluation of\nnon-task-oriented dialogue systems. Different from previous works in this area,\nwhere pure semantic similarity was pursued, the authors are going beyond pure\nsemantic similarity in a very elegant manner by learning projection matrices\nthat transform the response vector into both context and reference space\nrepresentations. I am very curious on how your projection matrices M and N\ndiffer from the original identity initialization after training the models. I\nthink the paper will be more valuable if further discussion on this is\nintroduced, rather than focusing so much on resulting correlations. \n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper also leaves lots questions related to the implementation. For\ninstance, it is not clear whether the human scores used to train and evaluate\nthe system were single AMT annotations or the resulting average of few\nannotations. Also, it is not clear how the dataset was split into\ntrain/dev/test and whether n-fold cross validation was conducted or not. Also,\nit would be nice to better explain why in table 2 correlation for ADEM related\nscores are presented for the validation and test sets, while for the other\nscores they are presented for the full dataset and test set. The section on\npre-training with VHRED is also very clumsy and confusing, probably it is\nbetter to give less technical details but a better high level explanation of\nthe pre-training strategy and its advantages.\n- General Discussion:\n\"There are many obvious cases where these metrics fail, as they are often\nincapable of considering the semantic similarity between responses (see Figure\n1).\" Be careful with statements like this one. This is not a problem of\nsemantic similarity! Opposite to it, the problem is that completely different\nsemantic cues might constitute pragmatically valid responses. Then, semantic\nsimilarity itself is not enough to evaluate a dialogue system response.\nDialogue system response evaluation must go beyond semantics (This is actually\nwhat your M and N matrices are helping to do!!!) \n\"an accurate model that can evaluate dialogue response quality automatically\n\"\" what could be considered an automatic Turing test \"\"\" The original\nintention of Turing test was to be a proxy to identify/define intelligent\nbehaviour. It actually proposes a test on intelligence based on an\n\"intelligent\" machine capability to imitate human behaviour in such a way\nthat it would be difficult for a common human to distinguish between such a\nmachine responses and actual human responses. It is of course related to\ndialogue system performance, but I think it is not correct to say that\nautomatically evaluating dialogue response quality is an automatic Turing test.\nActually, the title itself \"Towards an Automatic Turing Test\" is somehow\nmisleading!\n\"the simplifying assumption that a 'good' chatbot is one whose responses\nare scored highly on appropriateness by human evaluators.\" This is certainly\nthe correct angle to introduce the problem of non-task-oriented dialogue\nsystems, rather than \"Turing Test\". Regarding this, there has been related\nwork you might like to take a look at, as well as to make reference to, in the\nWOCHAT workshop series (see the shared task description and corresponding\nannotation guidelines).\nIn the discussion session: \"and has has been used\" -> \"and it has been\nused\""
