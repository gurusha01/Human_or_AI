            "inputText": "The paper describes a method for improving two-step translation using deep\nlearning. Results are presented for Chinese->Spanish translation, but the\napproach seems to be largely language-independent.\nThe setting is fairly typical for two-step MT. The first step translates into a\nmorphologically underspecified version of the target language. The second step\nthen uses machine learning to fill in the missing morphological categories and\nproduces the final system output by inflecting the underspecified forms (using\na morphological generator). The main novelty of this work is the choice of deep\nNNs as classifiers in the second step. The authors also propose a rescoring\nstep which uses a LM to select the best variant.\nOverall, this is solid work with good empirical results: the classifier models\nreach a high accuracy (clearly outperforming baselines such as SVMs) and the\nimprovement is apparent even in the final translation quality.\nMy main problem with the paper is the lack of a comparison with some\nstraightforward deep-learning baselines. Specifically, you have a structured\nprediction problem and you address it with independent local decisions followed\nby a rescoring step. (Unless I misunderstood the approach.) But this is a\nsequence labeling task which RNNs are well suited for. How would e.g. a\nbidirectional LSTM network do when trained and used in the standard sequence\nlabeling setting? After reading the author response, I still think that\nbaselines (including the standard LSTM) are run in the same framework, i.e.\nindependently for each local label. If that's not the case, it should have been\nclarified better in the response. This is a problem because you're not using\nthe RNNs in the standard way and yet you don't justify why your way is better\nor compare the two approaches.\nThe final re-scoring step is not entirely clear to me. Do you rescore n-best\nsentences? What features do you use? Or are you searching a weighted graph for\nthe single optimal path? This needs to be explained more clearly in the paper.\n(My current impression is that you produce a graph, then look for K best paths\nin it, generate the inflected sentences from these K paths and then use a LM\n-- and nothing else -- to select the best variant. But I'm not sure from\nreading the paper.) This was not addressed in the response.\nYou report that larger word embeddings lead to a longer training time. Do they\nalso influence the final results?\nCan you attempt to explain why adding information from the source sentence\nhurts? This seems a bit counter-intuitive -- does e.g. the number information\nnot get entirely lost sometimes because of this? I would appreciate a more\nthorough discussion on this in the final version, perhaps with a couple of\nconvincing examples.\nThe paper contains a number of typos and the general level of English may not\nbe sufficient for presentation at ACL.\nMinor corrections:\ncontext of the application of MT -> context of application for MT\nIn this cases, MT is faced in two-steps -> In this case, MT is divided into two\nsteps\nmarkov -> Markov\nCFR -> CRF\ntask was based on a direct translation -> task was based on direct translation\ntask provided corpus -> task provided corpora\nthe phrase-based system has dramatically -> the phrase-based approach...\ninvestigated different set of features -> ...sets of features\nwords as source of information -> words as the source...\ncorrespondant -> corresponding\nClasses for gender classifier -> Classes for the...\nfor number classifier -> for the...\nThis layer's input consists in -> ...consists of\nto extract most relevant -> ...the most...\nSigmoid does not output results in [-1, 1] but rather (0, 1).
