The conclusion is biased by the selected languages. \nii. The experiments do not cover the claim of this paper completely.\n- General Discussion:\nThis paper issues a simple but fundamental question about word representation:\nwhat subunit of a word is suitable to represent morphologies and how to compose\nthe units. To answer this question, this paper applied word representations\nwith various subunits (characters, character-trigram, and morphs) and\ncomposition functions (LSTM, CNN, and a simple addition) to the language\nmodeling task to find the best combination. In addition, this paper evaluated\nthe task for more than 10 languages. This is because languages are\ntypologically diverse and the results can be different according to the word\nrepresentation and composition function. From their experimental results, this\npaper concluded that character-level representations are more effective, but\nthey are still imperfective in comparing them with a model with explicit\nknowledge of morphology. Another conclusion is that character-trigrams show\nreliable perplexity in the majority of the languages. \nHowever, this paper leaves some issues behind.\n- First of all, there could be some selection bias of the experimental\nlanguages. This paper chose ten languages in four categories (up to three\nlanguages per a category). But, one basic question with the languages is \"how\ncan it be claimed that the languages are representatives of each category?\"\nAll the languages in the same category have the same tendency of word\nrepresentation and composition function? How can it be proved? For instance,\neven in this paper, two languages belonging to the same typology\n(agglutinative) show different results. Therefore, at least to me, it seems to\nbe better to focus on the languages tested in this paper instead of drawing a\ngeneral conclusions about all languages. \n- There is some gap between the claim and the experiments. Is the\nlanguage modeling the best task to prove the claim of this paper? Isn't there\nany chance that the claim of this paper breaks in other tasks? Further\nexplanation on this issue is needed.\n- In Section 5.2, this paper evaluated the proposed method only for\nArabic. Is there any reason why the experiment is performed only for Arabic?\nThere are plenty of languages with automatic morphological analyzers such as\nJapanese and Turkish.\n- This paper considers only character-trigram among various n-grams. Is\nthere any good reason to choose only character-trigram? Is it always better\nthan character-bigram or character-fourgram? In general, language modeling with\nn-grams is affected by corpus size and some other factors. \nMinor typos: \n- There is a missing reference in Introduction.
