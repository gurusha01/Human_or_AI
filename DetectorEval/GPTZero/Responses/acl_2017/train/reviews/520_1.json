Whenever the\nexperimental performance results are not satisfying, these cases seem like\nbasic over/underfitting issues that may easily be tackled by\nrestricting/extending the capacity of the networks or using more data. It is\nhard for me to spot any other qualitative insight.\n - In the introduction it is stated that the \"goal is not too achieve optimal\nperformance\" but to find out whether \"architectures are able to successfully\ndemonstrate the desired understanding\" - there is a fundamental contradiction\nhere, in that the proposed task on the one side is meant to provide a measure\nas to whether architectures demontrate \"understanding\", on the other hand the\nscore is not supposed to be taken as meaningful/seriously.\nGeneral comments:\nThe general approach should be made more tangible earlier (i.e. in the\nintroction rather than in section 3)"
