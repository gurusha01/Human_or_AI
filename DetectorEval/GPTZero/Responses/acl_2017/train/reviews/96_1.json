            "inputText": "- Summary: \nThe paper introduces a new dataset for a sarcasm interpretation task\nand a system (called Sarcasm SIGN) based on machine translation framework\nMoses. The new dataset was collected from 3000 sarcastic tweets (with hashtag\n`sarcasm) and 5 interpretations for each from humans. The Sarcasm SIGN is\nbuilt\nbased on Moses by replacing sentimental words by their corresponding clusters\non the source side (sarcasm) and then de-cluster their translations on the\ntarget side (non-sarcasm). Sarcasm SIGN performs on par with Moses on the MT\nevaluation metrics, but outperforms Moses in terms of fluency and adequacy. \n- Strengths:\nthe paper is well written\nthe dataset is collected in a proper manner\nthe experiments are carefully done and the analysis is sound.\n- Weaknesses:\nlack statistics of the datsets (e.g. average length, vocabulary size)\nthe baseline (Moses) is not proper because of the small size of the dataset\nthe assumption \"sarcastic tweets often differ from their non sarcastic\ninterpretations in as little as one sentiment word\" is not supported by the\ndata. \n- General Discussion: This discussion gives more details about the weaknesses\nof the paper. \nHalf of the paper is about the new dataset for sarcasm interpretation.\nHowever, the paper doesn't show important information about the dataset such as\naverage length, vocabulary size. More importantly, the paper doesn't show any\nstatistical evidence to support their method of focusing on sentimental words. \nBecause the dataset is small (only 3000 tweets), I guess that many words are\nrare. Therefore, Moses alone is not a proper baseline. A proper baseline should\nbe a MT system that can handle rare words very well. In fact, using\nclustering and declustering (as in Sarcasm SIGN) is a way to handle rare words.\nSarcasm SIGN is built based on the assumption that \"sarcastic tweets often\ndiffer from their non sarcastic interpretations in as little as one sentiment\nword\". Table 1 however strongly disagrees with this assumption: the human\ninterpretations are often different from the tweets at not only sentimental\nwords. I thus strongly suggest the authors to give statistical evidence from\nthe dataset that supports their assumption. Otherwise, the whole idea of\nSarcasm SIGN is just a hack.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nI have read the authors' response. I don't change my decision because of the\nfollowing reasons: \n- the authors wrote that \"the Fiverr workers might not take this strategy\": to\nme it is not the spirit of corpus-based NLP. A model must be built to fit given\ndata, not that the data must follow some assumption that the model is built on.\n- the authors wrote that \"the BLEU scores of Moses and SIGN are above 60, which\nis generally considered decent in the MT literature\": to me the number 60\ndoesn't \nshow anything at all because the sentences in the dataset are very short. And\nthat,\nif we look at table 6, %changed of Moses is only 42%, meaning that even more\nthan half of the time translation is simply copying, the BLUE score is more\nthan 60.\n- \"While higher scores might be achieved with MT systems that explicitly\naddress rare words, these systems don't focus on sentiment words\": it's true,\nbut I was wondering whether sentiment words are rare in the corpus. If they\nare, those MT systems should obviously handle them (in addition to other rare\nwords)."
