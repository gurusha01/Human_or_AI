The only true one is the absence of a\ndefinition of style, which is a key concept in the paper\n- General Discussion:\nThis paper describes two experiments that explore the relationship between\nwriting task and writing style. In particular, controlling for vocabulary and\ntopic, the authors show that features used in authorship attribution/style\nanalysis can go a long way towards distinguishing between 1) a natural ending\nof a story 2) an ending added by a different author and 3) a purposefully\nincoherent ending added by a different author.\nThis is a great and fun paper to read and it definitely merits being accepted.\nThe paper is lucidly written and clearly explains what was done and why. The\nauthors use well-known simple features and a simple classifier to prove a\nnon-obvious hypothesis. Intuitively, it is obvious that a writing task greatly\nconstraints style. However, proven in such a clear manner, in such a controlled\nsetting, the findings are impressive.\nI particularly like Section 8 and the discussion about the implications on\ndesign of NLP tasks. I think this will be an influential and very well cited\npaper. Great work. \nThe paper is a very good one as is. One minor suggestion I have is defining\nwhat the authors mean by \"style\" early on. The authors seem to mean \"a\nset of low-level easily computable lexical and syntactic features\". As is,\nthe usage is somewhat misleading for anyone outside of computational\nstylometrics. \nThe set of chosen stylistic features makes sense. However, were there no other\noptions? Were other features tried and they did not work? I think a short\ndiscussion of the choice of features would be informative."
