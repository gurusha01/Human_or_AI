I liked this paper a lot. I believe there is a lot of\nvalue simply in the introduction of UCCA (not new, but I believe relatively new\nto this community), which has the potential to spark new thinking about\nsemantic representations of text. I also think the model was well thought out.\nWhile the model itself was fairly derivative of existing transition-based\nschemes, the extensions the authors introduced to make the model applicable in\nthis domain were reasonable and well-explained, at what I believe to be an\nappropriate level of detail.\nThe empirical evaluation was pretty convincing -- the results were good, as\ncompared to several credible baselines, and the authors demonstrated this\nperformance in multiple domains. My biggest complaint about this paper is the\nlack of multilingual evaluation, especially given\nthat the formalism being experimented with is exactly one that is supposed to\nbe fairly universal. I'm reasonably sure multilingual UCCA corpora exist (in\nfact, I think the \"20k leagues\" corpus used in this paper is one such), so it\nwould be good to see results in a language other than English.\nOne minor point: in section 6, the authors refer to their model as\n\"grammarless\", which strikes me as not quite correct. It's true that the UCCA\nrepresentation isn't derived from linguistic notions of syntax, but it still\ndefines a way to construct a compositional abstract symbolic representation of\ntext, which to me, is precisely a grammar. (This is clearly a quibble, and I\ndon't know why it irked me enough that I feel compelled to address it, but it\ndid.)\nEdited to add: Thanks to the authors for their response."
