            "inputText": "This paper proposes a framework for evaluation of word embeddings based on data\nefficiency and simple supervised tasks. The main motivation is that word\nembeddings are generally used in a transfer learning setting, where evaluation\nis done based on how faster is to train a target model. The approach uses a set\nof simple tasks evaluated in a supervised fashion, including common benchmarks\nsuch as word similarity and word analogy. Experiments on a broad set of\nembeddings show that ranks tend to be task-specific and change according to the\namount of training data used.\nStrengths\n- The transfer learning / data efficiency motivation is an interesting one, as\nit directly relates to the idea of using embeddings as a simple\n\"semi-supervised\" approach.\nWeaknesses\n- A good evaluation approach would be one that propagates to end tasks.\nSpecifically, if the approach gives some rank R for a set of embeddings, I\nwould like it to follow the same rank for an end task like text classification,\nparsing or machine translation. However, the approach is not assessed in this\nway so it is difficult to trust the technique is actually more useful than what\nis traditionally done.\n- The discussion about injective embeddings seems completely out-of-topic and\ndoes not seem to add to the paper's understanding.\n- The experimental section is very confusing. Section 3.7 points out that the\nanalysis results in answers to questions as \"is it worth fitting syntax\nspecific embeddings even when supervised datset is large?\" but I fail to\nunderstand where in the evaluation the conclusion was made.\n- Still in Section 3.7, the manuscript says \"This hints, that purely\nunsupervised large scale pretraining might not be suitable for NLP\napplications\". This is a very bold assumption and I again fail to understand\nhow this can be concluded from the proposed evaluation approach.\n- All embeddings were obtained as off-the-shelf pretrained ones so there is no\ncontrol over which corpora they were trained on. This limits the validity of\nthe evaluation shown in the paper.\n- The manuscript needs proofreading, especially in terms of citing figures in\nthe right places (why Figure 1, which is on page 3, is only cited in page 6?).\nGeneral Discussion\nI think the paper starts with a very interesting motivation but it does not\nproperly evaluate if their approach is good or not. As mentioned above, for any\nintrinsic evaluation approach I expect to see some study if the conclusions\npropagate to end tasks and this is not done in the paper. The lack of clarity\nand proofreading in the manuscript also hinders the understanding. In the\nfuture, I think the paper would vastly benefit from some extrinsic studies and\na more controlled experimental setting (using the same corpora to train all\nembeddings, for instance). But in the current state I do not think it is a good\naddition to the conference."
