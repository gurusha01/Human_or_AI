            "inputText": "This paper presents a dialogue agent where the belief tracker and the dialogue\nmanager are jointly optimised using the reinforce algorithm. It learns from\ninteraction with a user simulator. There are two training phases. The first is\nan imitation learning phase where the system is initialised using supervising\nlearning from a rule-based model. Then there is a reinforcement learning phase\nwhere the system has jointly been optimised using the RL objective.\n- Strengths: This paper presents a framework where a differentiable access to\nthe KB is integrated in the joint optimisation. This is the biggest\ncontribution of the paper. \n- Weaknesses: Firstly, this is not a truly end-to-end system considering the\nresponse generation was handcrafted rather than learnt. Also, their E2E model\nactually overfits to the simulator and performs poorly in human evaluation.\nThis begs the question whether the authors are actually selling the idea of E2E\nlearning or the soft-KB access. The soft-KB access actually brings consistent\nimprovement, however the idea of end-to-end learning not so much. The authors\ntried to explain the merits of E2E in Figure 5 but I also fail to see the\ndifference. In addition, the authors didn't motivate the reason for using the\nreinforce algorithm which is known to suffer from high variance problem. They\ndidn't attempt to improve it by using a baseline or perhaps considering the\nnatural actor-critic algorithm which is known to perform better.\n- General Discussion: Apart from the mentioned weaknesses, I think the\nexperiments are solid and this is generally an acceptable paper. However, if\nthey crystallised the paper around the idea which actually improves the\nperformance (the soft KB access) but not the idea of E2E learning the paper\nwould be better."
