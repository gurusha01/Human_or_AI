The\noverall approach is not new and the individual methods proposed are\nimprovements of existing methods. For an ACL paper I would have expected more\nnovel approaches.\nOne of the contributions of the paper is the data selection scheme. The formula\nused to calculate the quality score is quite straightforward and this is not a\nbad thing. However, it is unclear how the thresholds were calculated for Table\n2. The paper says only that different thresholds were tried. Was this done on a\ndevelopment set? There is no mention of this in the paper. The evaluation\nresults show clearly that data selection is very important, but one may not\nknow how to tune the parameters for a new data set or a new language pair. \nAnother contribution of the paper is the combination of the outputs of the two\nsystems developed in the paper. I tried hard to understand how it works, but\nthe description provided is not clear. \nThe paper presents a number of variants for each of the methods proposed. Does\nit make sense to combine more than two weakly supervised systems? Did the\nauthors try anything in this direction.\nIt would be good to know a bit more about the types of texts that are in the\n\"in-house\" dataset."
