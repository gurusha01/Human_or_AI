(2016). The proposed improvements\ninclude performing decomposable attention on the output of a BiLSTM and feeding\nthe attention output to another BiLSTM, and augmenting this network with a\nparallel tree variant.\n- Strengths:\nThis approach outperforms several strong models previously proposed for the\ntask. The authors have tried a large number of experiments, and clearly report\nthe ones that did not work, and the hyperparameter settings of the ones that\ndid. This paper serves as a useful empirical study for a popular problem.\n- Weaknesses:\nUnfortunately, there are not many new ideas in this work that seem useful\nbeyond the scope the particular dataset used. While the authors claim that the\nproposed network architecture is simpler than many previous models, it is worth\nnoting that the model complexity (in terms of the number of parameters) is\nfairly high. Due to this reason, it would help to see if the empirical gains\nextend to other datasets as well. In terms of ablation studies, it would help\nto see 1) how well the tree-variant of the model does on its own and 2) the\neffect of removing inference composition from the model.\nOther minor issues:\n1) The method used to enhance local inference (equations 14 and 15) seem very\nsimilar to the heuristic matching function used by Mou et al., 2015 (Natural\nLanguage Inference by Tree-Based Convolution and Heuristic Matching). You may\nwant to cite them.\n2) The first sentence in section 3.2 is an unsupported claim. This either needs\na citation, or needs to be stated as a hypothesis.\nWhile the work is not very novel, the the empirical study is rigorous for the\nmost part, and could be useful for researchers working on similar problems.\nGiven these strengths, I am changing my recommendation score to 3. I have read\nthe authors' responses."
