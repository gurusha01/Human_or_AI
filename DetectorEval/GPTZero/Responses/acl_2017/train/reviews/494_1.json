The framework is based on the idea of \"attract\" and \"repel\"\nconstraints, where attract constraints are used to pull morphological\nvariations close together (e.g. look/looking) and repel constraints are used to\npush derivational antonyms apart (e.g. responsible/irresponsible). They test\ntheir algorithm on multiple different vector spaces and several language, and\nshow consistent improvements on intrinsic evaluation (SimLex-999, and\nSimVerb-3500). They also test on the extrinsic task of dialogue state tracking,\nand again demonstrate measurable improvements over using\nmorphologically-unaware word embeddings.\nI think this is a very nice paper. It is a simple and clean way to incorporate\nlinguistic knowledge into distributional models of semantics, and the empirical\nresults are very convincing. I have some questions/comments below, but nothing\nthat I feel should prevent it from being published.\n- Comments for Authors\n1) I don't really understand the need for the morph-simlex evaluation set. It\nseems a bit suspect to create a dataset using the same algorithm that you\nultimately aim to evaluate. It seems to me a no-brainer that your model will do\nwell on a dataset that was constructed by making the same assumptions the model\nmakes. I don't think you need to include this dataset at all, since it is a\npotentially erroneous evaluation that can cause confusion, and your results are\nconvincing enough on the standard datasets.\n2) I really liked the morph-fix baseline, thank you for including that. I would\nhave liked to see a baseline based on character embeddings, since this seems to\nbe the most fashionable way, currently, to side-step dealing with morphological\nvariation. You mentioned it in the related work, but it would be better to\nactually compare against it empirically.\n3) Ideally, we would have a vector space where morphological variants are just\nclose together, but where we can assign specific semantics to the different\ninflections. Do you have any evidence that the geometry of the space you end\nwith is meaningful. E.g. does \"looking\" - \"look\" + \"walk\" = \"walking\"? It would\nbe nice to have some analysis that suggests the morphfitting results in a more\nmeaningful space, not just better embeddings."
