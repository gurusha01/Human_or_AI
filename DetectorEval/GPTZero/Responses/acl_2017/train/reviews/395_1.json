            "inputText": "This paper outlines a method to learn sense embeddings from unannotated corpora\nusing a modular sense selection and representation process. The learning is\nachieved by a message passing scheme between the two modules that is cast as a\nreinforcement learning problem by the authors.\n- Strengths:\nThe paper is generally well written, presents most of its ideas clearly and\nmakes apt comparisons to related work where required. The experiments are well\nstructured and the results are overall good, though not outstanding. However,\nthere are several problems with the paper that prevent me from endorsing it\ncompletely.\n- Weaknesses:\nMy main concern with the paper is the magnification of its central claims,\nbeyond their actual worth.\n1) The authors use the term \"deep\" in their title and then several times in the\npaper. But they use a skip-gram architecture (which is not deep). This is\nmisrepresentation.\n2) Also reinforcement learning is one of the central claims of this paper.\nHowever, to the best of my understanding, the motivation and implementation\nlacks clarity. Section 3.2 tries to cast the task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem but goes on to say that there are 2 major drawbacks, due to which a\nQ-learning algorithm is used. This algorithm does not relate to the originally\nclaimed policy.\nFurthermore, it remains unclear how novel their modular approach is. Their work\nseems to be very similar to EM learning approaches, where an optimal sense is\nselected in the E step and an objective is optimized in the M step to yield\nbetter sense representations. The authors do not properly distinguish their\napproach, nor motivative why RL should be preferred over EM in the first place.\n3) The authors make use of the term pure-sense representations multiple times,\nand claim this as a central contribution of their paper. I am not sure what\nthis means, or why it is beneficial.\n4) They claim linear-time sense selection in their model. Again, it is not\nclear to me how this is the case. A highlighting of this fact in the relevant\npart of the paper would be helpful. \n5) Finally, the authors claim state-of-the-art results. However, this is only\non a single MaxSimC metric. Other work has achieved overall better results\nusing the AvgSimC metric. So, while state-of-the-art isn't everything about a\npaper, the claim that this paper achieves it - in the abstract and intro - is\nat least a little misleading."
