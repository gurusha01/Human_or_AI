This algorithm is shown to be\neffective for interactive translation and domain adaptation.\nAlthough the proposed extension is very simple, I think the paper makes a\nuseful contribution by formalizing it. It is also interesting to know that NMT\ncopes well with a set of unordered constraints having no associated alignment\ninformation. There seem to be potential applications for this technique beyond\nthe ones investigated here, for example improving NMT's ability to handle\nnon-compositional constructions, which is one of the few areas where it still\nmight lag traditional SMT.\nThe main weakness of the paper is that the experiments are somewhat limited.\nThe interactive MT simulation shows that the method basically works, but it is\ndifficult to get a sense of how well - for instance, in how many cases the\nconstraint was incorporated in an acceptable manner (the large BLEU score\nincreases are only indirect evidence). Similarly, adaptation should have been \ncompared to the standard \"fine-tuning\" baseline, which would be relatively\ninexpensive to run on the 100K Autodesk corpus.\nDespite this weakness, I think this is a decent contribution that deserves to\nbe published.\nFurther details:\n422 Given its common usage in PBMT, \"coverage vector\" is a potentially\nmisleading term. The appropriate data structure seems more likely to be a\ncoverage set.\nTable 2 should also give some indication of the number of constraints per\nsource sentence in the test corpora, to allow for calibration of the BLEU\ngains."
