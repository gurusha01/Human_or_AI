The original methods, such as skip-gram with negative\nsampling, Glove, or other PMI based approaches currently use word cooccurrence\nstatistics, but all of those approaches could be extended to n-gram based\nstatistics. N-gram based statistics would increase the complexity of every\nalgorithm because both the vocabulary of the embeddings and the context space\nwould be many times larger. This paper presents a method to learn embeddings\nfor ngrams with ngram context, and efficiently computes these embeddings. On\nsimilarity and analogy tasks, they present strong results.\n- Weaknesses:\nI would have loved to see some experiments on real tasks where these embeddings\nare used as input beyond the experiments presented in the paper. That would\nhave made the paper far stronger.\n- General Discussion:\nEven with the aforementioned weakness, I think this is a nice paper to have at\nACL.\nI have read the author response."
