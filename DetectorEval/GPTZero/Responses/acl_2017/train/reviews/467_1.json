Compared to\nstate-of-the-art using larger bilingual dictionaries or parallel/comparable\ncorpora, the results obtained with the presented method that relies on very\nlittle or no manually prepared input are exciting and impressive.\n- Weaknesses:\nI would have liked to see a discussion on the errors of the method, and\npossibly a discussion on how the method could be adjusted to deal with them.\n- General Discussion:\nDoes the frequency of the seeds in the monolingual corpora matter?\nIt would be interesting to see the partial (in the sense of after n number of\niterations) evolution of the mapping between words in the two languages for a\nfew words. \nWhat happens with different translations of the same word (like different\nsenses)?\nOne big difference between German and English is the prevalence of compounds in\nGerman. What happens to these compounds? What are they mapped onto? Would a\npreprocessing step of splitting the compounds help? (using maybe only\ncorpus-internal unigram information)\nWhat would be the upper bound for such an approach? An analysis of errors --\ne.g. words very far from their counterpart in the other language -- would be\nvery interesting. It would also be interesting to see a discussion of where\nthese errors come from, and if they could be addressed with the presented\napproach."
