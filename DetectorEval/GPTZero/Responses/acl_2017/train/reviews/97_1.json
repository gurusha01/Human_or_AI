It consist of an application of an\nexisting technology to a known problem.\nThe approach described in the paper is not autonomous -- it still needs a human\nto do the actual scoring. The paper lacks any quantitative or qualitative\nevaluation of how useful such system is. That is, is it making the job of the\nscorer easier? Is the scorer more effective as compared to not having automatic\nscore?\nThe system contains multiple components and it is unclear how the quality of\neach one of them contributes to the overall experience.\nThe paper needs more work with the writing. Language and style is rough in\nseveral places.\nThe paper also contains several detailed examples, which don't necessarily add\na lot of value to the discussion.\n For the evaluation of classification, what is the baseline of predicting the\nmost frequent class?\n- General Discussion:\nI find this paper not very inspiring. I don't see the message in the paper\napart from announcing having build such a system"
