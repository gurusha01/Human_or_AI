            "inputText": "This paper proposed a macro discourse structure scheme. The authors carried out\na pilot study annotating a corpus consisting of 97 news articles from Chinese\ntreebank 8.0. They then built a model to recognize the primary-secondary\nrelations and 5 discourse relations (joint, elaboration, sequence, background,\ncause-result) in this corpus.\nThe paper is poorly written and I have difficulties to follow it. I strongly\nsuggest that the authors should find a native English speaker to carefully\nproofread the paper. Regarding the content, I have several concerns: \n1 The logic of the paper is not clear and justifiable: \n1) what are \"logical semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\"(line 115-116)? I'd\nprefer the authors to define them properly.\n2) macro discourse structure: there are some conflicts of the definition\nbetween macro structure and micro structure. Figure 4 demonstrates the\ncombination of macro discourse structure and micro discourse structure. There,\nthe micro discourse structure is presented within paragraphs. However, in the\nspecific example of micro discourse structure shown in Figure 6, the\nmicro-level discourse structure is beyond the paragraph boundary and captures\nthe discourse relations across paragraphs. This kind of micro-level discourse\nstructure is indeed similar to the macro structure proposed by the authors in\nFigure 5, and it's also genre independent. So, why can't we just use the\nstructure in Figure 6? What's the advantage of macro discourse structure\nproposed in Figure 5? For me, it's genre dependent and doesn't provide richer\ninformation compared to Figure 6.\nBy the way, why sentence 6 and sentence 15 are missing in Figure 5? Is it\nbecause they are subtitles? But sentence 12 which is a subtitle is present\nthere.\n2 Corpus construction (section 4) is not informative enough: without a\ndetailed example, it's hard to know the meaning of \"discourse topic, lead,\nabstract, paragraph topics (line 627-629)\". And you were saying you \"explore\nthe relationships between micro-structure and macro-structure\", but I can't\nfind the correspondent part.\nTable 4 is about agreement study The authors claimed \"Its very difficult to\nachieve high consistence because the judgments of relation and structure are\nvery subjective. Our measurement data is only taken on the layer of leaf\nnodes.\"--------> First, what are the leaf nodes? In the macro-level, they are\nparagraphs; in the micro-level, they are EDUs. Should we report the agreement\nstudy for macro-level and micro-level separately? Second, it seems for me that\nthe authors only take a subset of data to measure the agreement. This doesn't\nreflect the overall quality of the whole corpus, i.e., high agreement on the\nleaf nodes annotation doesn't ensure that we will get high agreement on the\nnon-leaf nodes annotation.\nSome other unclear parts in section 4:\nTable 4: \"discourse structure, discourse relation\" are not clear, what is\ndiscourse structure and what is discourse relation? \nTable 5: \"amount of macro discourse relations\", still not clear to me, you mean\nthe discourse relations between paragraphs? But in Figure 6, these relations\ncan exist both between sentences and between paragraphs.\n3 Experiments: since the main purpose of the paper is to provide richer\ndiscourse structure (both on macro and micro level), I would expect to see some\ninitial results in this direction. The current experiment is not very\nconvincing: a) no strong baselines; b) features are not clearly described and\nmotivated; c) I don't understand why only a sub set of discourse relations from\nTable 6 is chosen to perform the experiment of discourse relation recognition.\nIn general, I think the paper needs major improvement and currently it is not\nready for acceptance."
