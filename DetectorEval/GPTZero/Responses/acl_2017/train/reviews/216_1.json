This prior knowledge is worth incorporated in the LDA-based\nframework.\n2. Whereas we do not have full knowledge on recent LDA literature, we find the\npart of related work quite convincing.\n3. The method proposed for segment sampling with O(M) complexity is impressive.\nIt is crucial for efficient computation. \n- Weaknesses:\n1. Compared to Balikas COLING16's work, the paper has a weaker visualization\n(Fig 5), which makes us doubt about the actual segmenting and assigning results\nof document. It could be more convincing to give a longer exemplar and make\ncolor assignment consistent with topics listed in Figure 4.\n2. Since the model is more flexible than that of Balikas COLING16, it may be\nunderfitting, could you please explain this more?\n- General Discussion:\nThe paper is well written and structured. The intuition introduced in the\nAbstract and again exemplified in the Introduction is quite convincing. The\nexperiments are of a full range, solid, and achieves better quantitative\nresults against previous works. If the visualization part is stronger, or\nexplained why less powerful visualization, it will be more confident. Another\nconcern is about computation efficiency, since the seminal LDA work proposed to\nuse Variational Inference which is faster during training compared to MCMC, we\nwish to see the author's future development."
