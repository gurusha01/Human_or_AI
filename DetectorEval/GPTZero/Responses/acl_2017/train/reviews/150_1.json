            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThe authors present a novel adaptation of encoder-decoder neural MT using an\napproach that starts and ends with characters, but in between works with\nrepresentations of morphemes and characters. \nThe authors release both their code as well as their final learned models for\nfr-en, cs-en, and en-cs. This is helpful in validating their work, as well as\nfor others looking to replicate and extends this work.\nThe system reported appears to produce translation results of reasonable\nquality even after the first training epoch, with continued progress in future\nepochs.\nThe system appears to learn reasonable morphological tokenizations, and appears\nable to handle previously unseen words (even nonce words) by implicitly backing\noff to morphemes.\n- Weaknesses:\nIn the paper, the authors do not explicitly state which WMT test and dev sets\ntheir results are reported on. This is problematic for readers wishing to\ncompare the reported results to existing work (for example, the results at\nmatrix.statmt.org). The only way this reviewer found to get this information\nwas to look in the README of the code supplement, which indicates that the test\nset was newstest2015 and the dev test was newstest2013. This should have been\nexplicitly described in the paper.\nThe instructions given in the software README are OK, but not great. The\ntraining and testing sections each could be enhanced with explicit examples of\nhow to run the respective commands. The software itself should respond to a\n--help flag, which it currently does not.\nThe paper describes a 6-level architecture, but the diagram in Figure 2 appears\nto show fewer than 6 layers. What's going on? The caption should be more\nexplicit, and if this figure is not showing all of the layers, then there\nshould be a figure somewhere (even if it's in an appendix) showing all of the\nlayers.\nThe results show comparison to other character-based neural systems, but do not\nshow state-of-the-art results for other types of MT system. WMT (and\nmatrix.statmt.org) has reported results for other systems on these datasets,\nand it appears that the state-of-the-art is much higher than any of the results\nreported in this paper. That should be acknowledged, and ideally should be\ndiscussed.\nThere are a handful of minor English disfluencies, misspellings, and minor\nLaTeX issues, such as reverse quotation marks. These should be corrected.\n- General Discussion:\nPaper is a nice contribution to the existing literature on character-based\nneural MT."
