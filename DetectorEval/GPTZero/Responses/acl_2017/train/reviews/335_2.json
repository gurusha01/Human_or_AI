There are three key components in the solution: \n(a) The paper introduces the gated attention-based recurrent network to obtain\nthe question-aware representation for the passage. Here, the paper adds an\nadditional gate to attention-based recurrent networks to determine the\nimportance of passage parts and attend to the ones relevant to the question.\nHere they use word as well as character embeddings to handle OOV words.\nOverall, this component is inspired from Wang and Jiang 2016.\n(b) Then the paper proposes a self-matching attention mechanism to improve the\nrepresentation for the question and passage by looking at wider passage context\nnecessary to infer the answer. This component is completely novel in the paper.\n(c) At the output layer, the paper uses pointer networks to locate answer\nboundaries. This is also inspired from Wang and Jiang 2016\nOverall, I like the paper and think that it makes a nice contribution.\n- Strengths:\nThe paper clearly breaks the network into three component for descriptive\npurposes, relates each of them to prior work and mentions its novelties with\nrespect to them. It does a sound empirical analysis by describing the impact of\neach component by doing an ablation study. This is appreciated.\nThe results are impressive!\n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper describes the results on a single model and an ensemble model. I\ncould not find any details of the ensemble and how was it created. I believe it\nmight be the ensemble of the character based and word based model. Can the\nauthors please describe this in the rebuttal and the paper.\n- General Discussion:\nAlong with the ablation study, it would be nice if we can have a\nqualitative analysis describing some example cases where the components of\ngating, character embedding, self embedding, etc. become crucial ... where a\nsimple model doesn't get the question right but adding one or more of these\ncomponents helps. This can go in some form of appendix or supplementary."
