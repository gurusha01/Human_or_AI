            "inputText": "The paper presents a neural model for predicting SQL queries directly from\nnatural language utterances, without going through an intermediate formalism.\nIn addition, an interactive online feedback loop is proposed and tested on a\nsmall scale.\n- Strengths:\n1\\ The paper is very clearly written, properly positioned, and I enjoyed\nreading it.\n2\\ The proposed model is tested and shown to perform well on 3 different\ndomains (academic, geographic queries, and flight booking)\n3\\ The online feedback loop is interesting and seems promising, despite of the\nsmall scale of the experiment.\n4\\ A new semantic corpus is published as part of this work, and additionally\ntwo\nexisting corpora are converted to SQL format, which I believe would be\nbeneficial for future work in this area.\n- Weaknesses / clarifications:\n1\\ Section 4.2 (Entity anonymization) - I am not sure I understand the choice\nof the length of span for querying the search engine. Why and how is it\nprogressively reduced? (line 333).\n2\\ Section 5 (Benchmark experiments) - If I understand correctly, the feedback\nloop (algorithm 1) is not used for these experiments. If this is indeed the\ncase, I'm not sure when does data augmentation occur. Is all the annotated\ntraining data augmented with paraphrases? When is the \"initial data\" from\ntemplates added? Is it also added to the gold training set? If so, I think it's\nnot surprising that it doesn't help much, as the gold queries may be more\ndiverse. In any case, I think this should be stated more clearly. In addition,\nI think it's interesting to see what's the performance of the \"vanilla\" model,\nwithout any augmentation, I think that this is not reported in the paper.\n3\\ Tables 2 and 3: I find the evaluation metric used here somewhat unclear. \nDoes the accuracy measure the correctness of the execution of the query (i.e.,\nthe retrieved answer) as the text seem to indicate? (Line 471 mentions\nexecuting the query). Alternatively, are the queries themselves compared? (as\nseems to be the case for Dong and Lapata in Table 2). If this is done\ndifferently for different systems (I.e., Dong and Lapata), how are these\nnumbers comparable? In addition, the text mentions the SQL model has \"slightly\nlower accuracy than the best non-SQL results\" (Line 515), yet in table 2 the\ndifference is almost 9 points in accuracy. What is the observation based upon?\nWas some significance test performed? If not, I think the results are still\nimpressive for direct to SQL parsing, but that the wording should be changed,\nas the difference in performance does seem significant.\n4\\ Line 519 - Regarding the data recombination technique used in Jia and Liang\n(2016): Since this technique is applicable in this scenario, why not try it as\nwell? Currently it's an open question whether this will actually improve\nperformance. Is this left as future work, or is there something prohibiting the\nuse of this technique?\n5\\ Section 6.2 (Three-stage online experiment) - several details are missing /\nunclear:\n* What was the technical background of the recruited users?\n* Who were the crowd workers, how were they recruited and trained?\n* The text says \"we recruited 10 new users and asked them to issue at least 10\nutterances\". Does this mean 10 queries each (e.g., 100 overall), or 10 in\ntotal (1 for each).\n* What was the size of the initial (synthesized) training set? \n* Report statistics of the queries - some measure of their lexical variability\n/ length / complexity of the generated SQL? This seems especially important for\nthe first phase, which is doing surprisingly well. Furthermore, since SCHOLAR\nuses SQL and NL, it would have been nice if it were attached to this\nsubmission, to allow its review during this period.\n6\\ Section 6.3 (SCHOLAR dataset)\n* The dataset seems pretty small in modern standards (816 utterances in total),\nwhile one of the main advantages of this process is its scalability. What\nhindered the creation of a much larger dataset?\n* Comparing performance - is it possible to run another baseline on this newly\ncreated dataset to compare against the reported 67% accuracy obtained in this\npaper (line 730).\n7\\ Evaluation of interactive learning experiments (Section 6): I find the\nexperiments to be somewhat hard to replicate as they involve manual queries of\nspecific annotators. For example, who's to say if the annotators in the last\nphase just asked simpler questions? I realise that this is always problematic\nfor online learning scenarios, but I think that an effort should be made\ntowards an objective comparison. For starters, the statistics of the queries\n(as I mentioned earlier) is a readily available means to assess whether this\nhappens. Second, maybe there can be some objective held out test set? This is\nproblematic as the model relies on the seen queries, but scaling up the\nexperiment (as I suggested above) might mitigate this risk. Third, is it\npossible to assess a different baseline using this online technique? I'm not\nsure whether this is applicable given that previous methods were not devised as\nonline learning methods.\n- Minor comments:\n1\\ Line 48 - \"requires\" -> \"require\"\n2\\ Footnote 1 seems too long to me. Consider moving some of its content to the\nbody of the text.\n3\\ Algorithm 1: I'm not sure what \"new utterances\" refers to (I guess it's new\nqueries from users?). I think that an accompanying caption to the algorithm\nwould make the reading easier.\n4\\ Line 218 - \"Is is\" -> \"It is\"\n5\\ Line 278 mentions an \"anonymized\" utterance. This confused me at the first\nreading, and if I understand correctly it refers to the anonymization described\nlater in 4.2. I think it would be better to forward reference this. \n- General Discussion:\nOverall, I like the paper, and given answers to the questions I raised above,\nwould like to see it appear in the conference.\n- Author Response:\nI appreciate the detailed response made by the authors, please include these\ndetails in a final version of the paper."
