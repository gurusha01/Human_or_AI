The\ndifferences don't seem that much for some metrics.\n- Considering the importance of dialog act in kgCVAE model, the DA tagging\nperformances should affect the quality of the final results. Would it be there\nany possibility to achieve further improvement by using better DA tagger?\nRecently, deep learning models have achieved better performances than SVM also\nin DA tagging.\n- What do you think about doing human evaluation as a part of qualitative\nanalysis? It could be costly, but worth a try to analyze the results in more\npragmatic perspective.\n- As a future direction, it could be also interesting if kgCVAE model is\napplied to more task-oriented human-machine conversations which usually have\nmuch richer linguistic features available than open conversation.\n- In Table 1, 'BLUE-1 recall' needs to be corrected to 'BLEU-1 recall'."
