Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other\nbaselines if supervised data is available.\n- Strengths:\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow (the intuition of the proposed\nmethod is clear). It includes enough details to replicate experiments. Although\nthe application of an encoder-decoder (+ copy mechanism) is straightforward,\nexperimental results are reasonable and support the claim (generation of absent\nkeyphrases) presented in this paper.\n- Weaknesses:\nAs said above, there is little surprise in the proposed approach. Also, as\ndescribed in Section 5.3, the trained model does not transfer well to new\ndomain (it goes below unsupervised models). One of the contribution of this\npaper is to maintain training corpora in good quantity and quality, but it is\nnot (explicitly) stated.\n- General Discussion:\nI like to read the paper and would be pleased to see it accepted. I would like\nto know how the training corpus (size and variation) affects the performance of\nthe proposed method. Also, it would be beneficial to see the actual values of\npg and pc (along with examples in Figure 1) in the CopyRNN model. From my\nexperience in running the CopyNet, the copying mechanism sometimes works\nunexpectedly (not sure why this happens)."
