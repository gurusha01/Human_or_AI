            "inputText": "This paper describes interesting and ambitious work: the automated conversion\nof Universal Dependency grammar structures into [what the paper calls] semantic\nlogical form representations. In essence, each UD construct is assigned a\ntarget construction in logical form, and a procedure is defined to effect the\nconversion, working 'inside-out' using an intermediate form to ensure\nproper nesting of substructures into encapsulating ones. Two evaluations are\ncarried out: comparing the results to gold-standard lambda structures and\nmeasuring the effectiveness of the resulting lambda expressions in actually\ndelivering the answers to questions from two QA sets. \nIt is impossible to describe all this adequately in the space provided. The\nauthors have taken some care to cover all principal parts, but there are still\nmany missing details. I would love to see a longer version of the paper! \nParticularly the QA results are short-changed; it would have been nice to learn\nwhich types of question are not handled, and which are not answered correctly,\nand why not. This information would have been useful to gaining better insight\ninto the limitations of the logical form representations. \nThat leads to my main concern/objection. This logical form representation is\nnot in fact a 'real' semantic one. It is, essentially, a\nrather\nclose\nrewrite of the dependency structure of the input, with some (good) steps toward\n'semanticization', including the insertion of lambda operators, the\nexplicit inclusion of dropped arguments (via the enhancement operation), and\nthe introduction of appropriate types/units for such constructions as eventive\nadjectives and nouns like \"running horse\" and \"president in 2009\". But\nmany (even simple) aspects of semantic are either not present (at least, not in\nthe paper) and/or simply wrong. Missing: quantification (as in \"every\" or\n\"all\"); numbers (as in \"20\" or \"just over 1000\"); various forms of\nreference (as in \"he\", \"that man\", \"what I said before\"); negation\nand modals, which change the semantics in interesting ways; inter-event\nrelationships (as in the subevent relationship between the events in \"the\nvacation was nice, but traveling was a pain\"; etc. etc. To add them one can\neasily cheat, by treating these items as if they were just unusual words and\ndefining obvious and simple lambda formulas for them. But they in fact require\nspecific treatment; for example, a number requires the creation of a separate\nset object in the representation, with its own canonical variable (allowing\nlater text to refer to \"one of them\" and bind the variable properly). For\nanother example, Person A's model of an event may differ from Person B's,\nso one needs two representation symbols for the event, plus a coupling and\nmapping between them. For another example, one has to be able to handle time,\neven if simply by temporally indexing events and states. None of this is here,\nand it is not immediately obvious how this would be added. In some cases, as\nDRT shows, quantifier and referential scoping is not trivial. \nIt is easy to point to missing things, and unfair to the paper in some sense;\nyou can't be expected to do it all. But you cannot be allowed to make\nobvious errors. Very disturbing is the assignment of event relations strictly\nin parallel with the verb's (or noun's) syntactic roles. No-one can claim\nseriously that \"he broke the window\" and \"the window broke\" has\n\"he\" and \"the window\" filling the same semantic role for \"break\". \nThat's simply not correct, and one cannot dismiss the problem, as the paper\ndoes, to some nebulous subsequent semantic processing. This\nreally\nneeds\nadequate treatment, even in this paper. This is to my mind the principal\nshortcoming of this work; for me this is the make-or-break point as to whether\nI would fight to have the paper accepted in the conference. (I would have been\nfar happier if the authors had simply acknowledged that this aspect is wrong\nand will be worked on in future, with a sketch saying how: perhaps by reference\nto FrameNet and semantic filler requirements.) \nIndependent of the representation, the notation conversion procedure is\nreasonably clear. I like the facts that it is rather cleaner and simpler than\nits predecessor (based on Stanford dependencies), and also that the authors\nhave the courage of submitting non-neural work to the ACL in these days of\nunbridled and giddy enthusiasm for anything neural."
