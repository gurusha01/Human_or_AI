The\nintroduction presents the key claims of the paper: Previous CNN\napproaches are bad when no phrase-level supervision is present.\nPhrase-level annotation is expensive. The contribution of this paper is\ninstead a \"simple model\" using other linguistic resources.\nThe related work section provides a good review of sentiment\nliterature. However, there is no mention of previous attempts at\nlinguistic regularization (e.g., [YOG14]).\nThe explanation of the regularizers in section 4 is rather lengthy and\nrepetitive. The listing on p. 3 could very well be merged with the\nrespective subsection 4.1-4.4. Notation in this section is inconsistent\nand generally hard to follow. Most notably, p is sometimes used with a\nsubscript and sometimes with a superscript. The parameter \\beta is\nnever explicitly mentioned in the text. It is not entirely clear to me\nwhat constitutes a \"position\" t in the terminology of the paper. t is a\nparameter to the LSTM output, so it seems to be the index of a\nsentence. Thus, t-1 is the preceding sentence, and p_t is the prediction\nfor this sentence. However, the description of the regularizers talks\nabout preceding words, not sentences, but still uses. My assumption here\nis that p_t is actually overloaded and may either mean the sentiment of\na sentence or a word. However, this should be made clearer in the text.\nOne dangerous issue in this paper is that the authors tread a fine line\nbetween regularization and distant supervision in their work. The\nproblem here is that there are many other ways to integrate lexical\ninformation from about polarity, negation information, etc. into a model\n(e.g., by putting the information into the features). The authors\ncompare against a re-run or re-implementation of Teng et al.'s NSCL\nmodel. Here, it would be important to know whether the authors used the\nsame lexicons as in their own work. If this is not the case, the\ncomparison is not fair. Also, I do not understand why the authors cannot\nrun NSCL on the MR dataset when they have access to an implementation of\nthe model. Would this not just be a matter of swapping the datasets? The\nremaining baselines do not appear to be using lexical information, which\nmakes them rather poor. I would very much like to see a vanilla LSTM run\nwhere lexical information is simply appended to the word vectors.\nThe authors end the paper with some helpful analysis of the\nmodels. These experiments show that the model indeed learns\nintensification and negation to some extent. In these experiments, it\nwould be interesting to know how the model behaves with\nout-of-vocabulary words (with respect to the lexicons). Does the model\nlearn beyond memorization, and does generalization happen for words that\nthe model has not seen in training? Minor remark here: the figures and\ntables are too small to be read in print.\nThe paper is mostly well-written apart from the points noted above. It\ncould benefit from some proofreading as there are some grammatical\nerrors and typos left. In particular, the beginning of the abstract is\nhard to read.\nOverall, the paper pursues a reasonable line of research. The largest\npotential issue I see is a somewhat shaky comparison to related\nwork. This could be fixed by including some stronger baselines in the\nfinal model. For me, it would be crucial to establish whether\ncomparability is given in the experiments, and I hope that the authors\ncan shed some light on this in their response.\n[YOG14] http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1074\n--------------\nUpdate after author response\nThank you for clarifying the concerns about the experimental setup. \nNSCL: I do now believe that the comparison is with Teng et al. is fair.\nLSTM: Good to know that you did this. However, this is a crucial part of the\npaper. As it stands, the baselines are weak. Marginal improvement is still too\nvague, better would be an open comparison including a significance test.\nOOV: I understand how the model is defined, but what is the effect on OOV\nwords? This would make for a much more interesting additional experiment than\nthe current regularization experiments."
