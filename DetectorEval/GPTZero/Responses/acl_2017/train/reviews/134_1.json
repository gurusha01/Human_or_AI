            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThe paper is well-written and easy to understand. The methods and results are\ninteresting.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe evaluation and the obtained results might be problematic (see my comments\nbelow).\n- General Discussion:\nThis paper proposes a system for end-to-end argumentation mining using neural\nnetworks. The authors model the problem using two approaches: (1) sequence\nlabeling (2) dependency parsing. The paper also includes the results of\nexperimenting with a multitask learning setting for the sequence labeling\napproach. The paper clearly explains the motivation behind the proposed model.\nExisting methods are based on ILP, manual feature engineering and manual design\nof ILP constraints. However, the proposed model avoids such manual effort.\nMoreover, the model jointly learns the subtasks in argumentation mining and\ntherefore, avoids the error back propagation problem in pipeline methods.\nExcept a few missing details (mentioned below), the methods are explained\nclearly.\nThe experiments are substantial, the comparisons are performed properly, and\nthe results are interesting. My main concern about this paper is the small size\nof the dataset and the large capacity of the used (Bi)LSTM-based recurrent\nneural networks (BLC and BLCC). The dataset includes only around 320 essays for\ntraining and 80 essays for testing. The size of the development set, however,\nis not mentioned in the paper (and also the supplementary materials). This is\nworrying because very few number of essays are left for training, which is a\ncrucial problem. The total number of tags in the training data is probably only\na few thousand. Compare it to the standard sequence labeling tasks, where\nhundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of tags are available. For this\nreason, I am not sure if the model parameters are trained properly. The paper\nalso does not analyze the overfitting problem. It would be interesting to see\nthe training and development \"loss\" values during training (after each\nparameter update or after each epoch). The authors have also provided some\ninformation that can be seen as the evidence for overfitting: Line 622 \"Our\nexplanation is that taggers are simpler local models, and thus need less\ntraining data and are less prone to overfitting\".\nFor the same reason, I am not sure if the models are stable enough. Mean and\nstandard deviation of multiple runs (different initializations of parameters)\nneed to be included. Statistical significance tests would also provide more\ninformation about the stability of the models and the reliability of results.\nWithout these tests, it is hard to say if the better results are because of the\nsuperiority of the proposed method or chance.\nI understand that the neural networks used for modeling the tasks use their\nregularization techniques. However, since the size of the dataset is too small,\nthe authors need to pay more attention to the regularization methods. The paper\ndoes not mention regularization at all and the supplementary material only\nmentions briefly about the regularization in LSTM-ER. This problem needs to be\naddressed properly in the paper.\nInstead of the current hyper-parameter optimization method (described in\nsupplementary materials) consider using Bayesian optimization methods.\nAlso move the information about pre-trained word embeddings and the error\nanalysis from the supplementary material to the paper. The extra one page\nshould be enough for this.\nPlease include some inter-annotator agreement scores. The paper describing the\ndataset has some relevant information. This information would provide some\ninsight about the performance of the systems and the available room for\nimprovement.\nPlease consider illustrating figure 1 with different colors to make the quality\nbetter for black and white prints.\nEdit:\nThanks for answering my questions. I have increased the recommendation score to\n4. Please do include the F1-score ranges in your paper and also report mean and\nvariance of different settings. I am still concerned about the model stability.\nFor example, the large variance of Kiperwasser setting needs to be analyzed\nproperly. Even the F1 changes in the range [0.56, 0.61] is relatively large.\nIncluding these score ranges in your paper helps replicating your work."
