            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis paper proposes to apply NLP to speech transcripts (narratives and\ndescriptions) in order to identify patients with MCI (mild cognitive\nimpairment, ICD-10 code F06.7). The authors claim that they were able to\ndistinguish between healthy control participants and patients with MCI (lines\n141-144). However in the conclusion, lines 781-785, they say that \"…\naccuracy ranging from 60% to 85% …. means that it is not easy to distinguish\nbetween healthy subjects and those with cognitive impairments\". So the paper\nbeginning is more optimistic than the conclusion but anyway the message is\nencouraging and the reader becomes curious to see more details about what has\nbeen actually done.\nThe corpus submitted in the dataset is constructed for 20 healthy patients and\n20 control participants only (20+20), and it is non-understandable for people\nwho do not speak Portuguese. It would be good to incorporate more technological\ndetails in the article and probably to include at least one example of a short\ntranscript that is translated to English, and eventually a (part of a) sample\nnetwork with embeddings for this transcript.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper starts with a detailed introduction and review of relevant work. Some\nof the cited references are more or less NLP background so they can be omitted\ne.g. (Salton 1989) in section 4.2.3. Other references are not directly related\nto the topic e.g. \"sentiment classification\" and \"pedestrian detection in\nimages\", lines 652-654, and they can be omitted too. In general lines\n608-621, section 4.2.3 can be shortened as well etc. etc. The suggestion is to\ncompress the first 5 pages, focusing the review strictly on the paper topic,\nand consider the technological innovation in more detail, incl. samples of\nEnglish translations of the ABCD and/or Cindarela narratives.\nThe relatively short narratives in Portuguese esp. in ABCD dataset open the\nquestion how the similarities between words have been found, in order to\nconstruct word embeddings. In lines 272-289 the authors explain that they\ngenerate word-level networks from continuous word representations. What is the\nsource for learning the continuous word representations; are these the datasets\nABCD+Cinderella only, or external corpora were used? In lines 513-525 it is\nwritten that sub-word level (n-grams) networks were used to generate word\nembeddings. Again, what is the source for the training? Are we sure that the\ntwo kinds of networks together provide better accuracy? And what are the\n\"out-of-vocabulary words\" (line 516), from where they come?\n- General Discussion:\nIt is important to study how NLP can help to discover cognitive impairments;\nfrom this perspective the paper is interesting. Another interesting aspect is\nthat it deals with NLP for Portuguese, and it is important to explain how one\ncomputes embeddings for a language with relatively fewer resources (compared to\nEnglish). \nThe text needs revision: shortening sections 1-3, compressing 4.1 and adding\nmore explanations about the experiments. Some clarification about the NURC/SP\nN. 338 EF and 331 D2 transcription norms can be given.\nTechnical comments:\nLine 029: '… as it a lightweight …' -> shouldn't this be '… as in\na lightweight …'\nLine 188: PLN -> NLP\nLine 264: 'out of cookie out of the cookie' – some words are repeated\ntwice \nTable 3, row 2, column 3: 72,0 -> 72.0\nLines 995-996: the DOI number is the same as the one at lines 1001-1002; the\nlink behind the title at lines 992-993 points to the next paper in the list"
