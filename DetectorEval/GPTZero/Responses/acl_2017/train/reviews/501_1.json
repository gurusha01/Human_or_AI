            "inputText": "The paper proposes a task of selecting the most appropriate textual description\nfor a given scene/image from a list of similar options. It also proposes couple\nof baseline models, an evaluation metrics and human evaluation score. \n- Strengths:\nThe paper is well-written and well-structured. \nIt is clear with its contributions and well supports them by empirical\nevidence. So the paper is very easy to read. \nThe paper is well motivated. A method of selecting the most appropriate caption\ngiven a list of misleading candidates will benefit other\nimage-caption/understanding models, by acting as a post-generation re-ranking\nmethod. \n- Weaknesses:\nI am not sure if the proposed algorithm for decoys generation is effective,\nwhich as a consequence puts the paper on questions.\nFor each target caption, the algorithm basically picks out those with similar\nrepresentation and surface form but do not belong to the same image. But a\nfundamentally issue with this approach is: not belonging to the image-A does\nnot mean not appropriate to describe image-A, especially when the\nrepresentation and surface form are close. So the ground-truth labels might not\nbe valid. As we can see in Figure-1, the generated decoys are either too far\nfrom the target to be a good decoy (giraffe vs elephant), or fair\nsubstitutes for the target (small boy playing kites vs boy flies a kite).\nThus, I am afraid that the dataset generated with this algorithm can not train\na model to really go beyond key word recognition, which was claimed as\ncontribution in this paper. As shown in Figure-1, most\ndecoys can be filtered by key word mismatch---giraffe vs elephant, *pan vs\nbread, frisbee vs kite, etc. And when they can not be separated by key word\nmatch*, they look very tempting to be a correct option.\nFurthermore, it is interesting that humans only do correctly on 82.8% on a\nsampled test set. Does it mean that those examples are really too hard even for\nhuman to correctly classify? Or are some of the decoys in fact good enough to\nbe the target's substitute (or even better) so that human choose them over\nground-truth targets?\n- General Discussion:\nI think this is a well-written paper with clear motivation and substantial\nexperiments. \nThe major issue is that the data-generating algorithm and the generated dataset\ndo not seem helpful for the motivation. This in turn makes the experimental\nconclusions less convincing. So I tend to reject this paper unless my concerns\ncan be fully addressed in rebuttal."
