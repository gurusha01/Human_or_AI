The paper is \nclearly written and organized, and the authors provided a lot of useful detail\nand informative example and plots. Most of the results are convincing, and the\nauthors did a good job comparing their approach and results with previous work.\n- Weaknesses:\n1. Just from the reading abstract, I expected that the authors' approach would\nsignificantly outperform previous methods, and that using both the eye-gaze and\ntextual features consistently yields the best results. Upon reading the actual\nresults section, however, it seems like the findings were more mixed. I think\nit would be helpful to update the abstract and introduction to reflect this. \n2. When evaluating the model on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, were the\nsarcastic utterances included? Did the model do better on classifying the\nnon-sarcastic utterances than the sarcastic ones?\n3. I understand why the eye-movement data would be useful for sarcasm\ndetection, but it wasn't as obvious to me why it would be helpful for\n(non-sarcastic) sentiment classification beyond the textual features. \n- General Discussion:\nThis paper contains a lot of interesting content, and the approach seems solid\nand novel to me. The results were a little weaker than I had anticipated from\nthe abstract, but I believe would still be interesting to the larger community\nand merits publication."
