A graph based method leveraging co-occurrence information between\nwords found in transcripts is described. Features are encoded using different\ncharacteristics of the graph lexical, syntactic properties, and many others. \nResults are reported using 5 fold cross validation using a number of\nclassifiers. Different models exhibit different performance across the three\ndatasets. This work targets a well defined problem and uses appropriate\ndatasets. \n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper suffers from several drawbacks\n1. The paper is hard to read due to incorrect usage of English. The current\nmanuscript would benefit a lot from a review grammar and spellings. \n2. The main machine learning problem being addressed is poorly described. What\nwas a single instance of classification? It seems every transcripts was\nclassified as MCI or No MCI. If this is the case, the dataset descriptions\nshould describe the numbers at a transcript level. Tables 1,2, and 3 should\ndescribe the data not the study that produced the transcripts. The age of the\npatients is irrelevant for the classification task. A lot of text (2 pages) is\nconsumed in simply describing the datasets with details that do not affect the\nend classification task. Also, I was unsure why numbers did not add up. For\ne.g.: in section 4.1.1 the text says 326 people were involved. But the total\nnumber of males and females in Table 1 are less than 100?\n3. What is the motivation behind enriching the graph? Why not represent each\nword by a node in the graph and connect them by the similarity between their\nvectors, irrespective of co-occurrence?\n4. The datsets are from a biomedical domain. No domain specific tools have been\nleveraged.\n5. Since dataset class distribution is unclear, it is unclear to determine if\naccuracy is a good measure for evaluation. In either case, since it is a binary\nclassification task, F1 would have been a desirable metric. \n6. Results are reported unto 4 decimal places on very small datasets (43\ntranscripts) without statistical tests over increments. Therefore, it is\nunclear if the gains are significant."
