As such, I imagine that the dataset will be a\nvaluable resource for further research in this field. Clearly a lot of effort\nhas gone into this work.\nWeaknesses:\nOverall I felt this paper a bit overstated in placed. As an example, the\nauthors claim a new crowdsourcing scheme as one of their contributions. This\nclaims is quite strong though and it reads more like the authors are applying\nbest practice in crowdsourcing to their work. This isn't a novel methods\nthen, it's rather a well thought and sound application of existing knowledge.\nSimilarly, the authors claim that they develop and present a new corpus. This\nseems true and I can see how a lot of effort was invested in its preparation,\nbut then Section 4.1 reveals that actually this is based on an existing\ndataset. \nThis is more a criticism of the presentation than the work though.\nGeneral discussion:\nWhere do the summary sentences come from for the crowdsource task? Aren't\nthey still quite subjective?\nWhere do the clusters come from? Are they part of the TAC2008b dataset? \nIn 4.6 expert annotators are used to create the gold standard concept maps.\nMore information is needed in this section I would say as it seems to be quite\ncrucial. How were they trained, what made them experts?"
