The proposed model is effective if the amount of training data is small\n(such as CELEX). It is also effective if the alignment is mostly monotonic and\nless context sensitive (such as Russian, German and Spanish).\n- General Discussion:\nThe authors proposed a novel neural model for morphological inflection\ngeneration which uses \"hard attention\", character alignments separately\nobtained by using a Bayesian method for transliteration. It is substantially\ndifferent from the previous state of the art neural model for the task which\nuses \"soft attention\", where character alignment and conversion are solved\njointly in the probabilistic model.\nThe idea is novel and sound. The paper is clearly written. The experiment is\ncomprehensive. The only concern is that the proposed method is not necessarily\nthe state of the art in all conditions. It is suitable for the task with mostly\nmonotonic alignment and with less context sensitive phenomena. The paper would\nbe more convincing if it describe the practical merits of the proposed method,\nsuch as the ease of implementation and computational cost."
