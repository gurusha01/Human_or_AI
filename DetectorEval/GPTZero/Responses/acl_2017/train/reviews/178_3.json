            "inputText": "The authors presents a method to jointly embed words, phrases and concepts,\nbased on plain text corpora and a manually-constructed ontology, in which\nconcepts are represented by one or more phrases. They apply their method in the\nmedical domain using the UMLS ontology, and in the general domain using the\nYAGO ontology. To evaluate their approach, the authors compare it to simpler\nbaselines and prior work, mostly on intrinsic similarity and relatedness\nbenchmarks. They use existing benchmarks in the medical domain, and use\nmechanical turkers to generate a new general-domain concept similarity and\nrelatedness dataset, which they also intend to release. They report results\nthat are comparable to prior work.\nStrengths:\n- The proposed joint embedding model is straightforward and makes reasonable\nsense to me. Its main value in my mind is in reaching a (configurable) middle\nground between treating phrases as atomic units on one hand to considering\ntheir\ncompositionallity on the other. The same approach is applied to concepts being\n'composed' of several representative phrases.\n- The paper describes a decent volume of work, including model development,\nan additional contribution in the form of a new evaluation dataset, and several\nevaluations and analyses performed.\nWeaknesses:\n- The evaluation reported in this paper includes only intrinsic tasks, mainly\non similarity/relatedness datasets. As the authors note, such evaluations are\nknown to have very limited power in predicting the utility of embeddings in\nextrinsic tasks. Accordingly, it has become recently much more common to\ninclude at least one or two extrinsic tasks as part of the evaluation of\nembedding models.\n- The similarity/relatedness evaluation datasets used in the paper are\npresented as datasets recording human judgements of similarity between\nconcepts. However, if I understand correctly, the actual judgements were made\nbased on presenting phrases to the human annotators, and therefore they should\nbe considered as phrase similarity datasets, and analyzed as such.\n- The medical concept evaluation dataset, 'mini MayoSRS' is extremely small\n(29 pairs), and its larger superset 'MayoSRS' is only a little larger (101\npairs) and was reported to have a relatively low human annotator agreement. The\nother medical concept evaluation dataset, 'UMNSRS', is more reasonable in\nsize, but is based only on concepts that can be represented as single words,\nand were represented as such to the human annotators. This should be mentioned\nin the paper and makes the relevance of this dataset questionable with respect\nto representations of phrases and general concepts. \n- As the authors themselves note, they (quite extensively) fine tune their\nhyperparameters on the very same datasets for which they report their results\nand compare them with prior work. This makes all the reported results and\nanalyses questionable.\n- The authors suggest that their method is superb to prior work, as it achieved\ncomparable results while prior work required much more manual annotation. I\ndon't think this argument is very strong because the authors also use large\nmanually-constructed ontologies, and also because the manually annotated\ndataset used in prior work comes from existing clinical records that did not\nrequire dedicated annotations.\n- In general, I was missing more useful insights into what is going on behind\nthe reported numbers. The authors try to treat the relation between a phrase\nand its component words on one hand, and a concept and its alternative phrases\non the other, as similar types of a compositional relation. However, they\nare different in nature and in my mind each deserves a dedicated analysis. For\nexample, around line 588, I would expect an NLP analysis specific to the\nrelation between phrases and their component words. Perhaps the reason for the\nreported behavior is dominant phrase headwords, etc. Another aspect that was\nabsent but could strengthen the work, is an investigation of the effect of the\nhyperparameters that control the tradeoff between the atomic and compositional\nviews of phrases and concepts.\nGeneral Discussion:\nDue to the above mentioned weaknesses, I recommend to reject this submission. I\nencourage the authors to consider improving their evaluation datasets and\nmethodology before re-submitting this paper.\nMinor comments:\n- Line 069: contexts -> concepts\n- Line 202: how are phrase overlaps handled?\n- Line 220: I believe the dimensions should be \"W\" x d. Also, the terminology\n'negative sampling matrix' is confusing as the model uses these embeddings\nto represent contexts in positive instances as well.\n- Line 250: regarding 'the observed phrase just completed', it not clear to\nme how words are trained in the joint model. The text may imply that only the\nlast words of a phrase are considered as target words, but that doesn't make\nsense. \n- Notation in Equation 1 is confusing (using c instead of o)\n- Line 361: Pedersen et al 2007 is missing in the reference section.\n- Line 388: I find it odd to use such a fine-grained similarity scale (1-100) \nfor human annotations.\n- Line 430: The newly introduced term 'strings' here is confusing. I\nsuggest to keep using 'phrases' instead.\n- Line 496: Which task exactly was used for the hyper-parameter tuning?\nThat's important. I couldn't find that even in the appendix.\n- Table 3: It's hard to see trends here, for instance PM+CL behaves rather\ndifferently than either PM or CL alone. It would be interesting to see\ndevelopment set trends with respect to these hyper-parameters.\n- Line 535: missing reference to Table 5."
