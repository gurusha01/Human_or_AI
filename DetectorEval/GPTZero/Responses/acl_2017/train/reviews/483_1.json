The proposed method used a Pointer Network (PN) model with\nmulti-task learning and outperformed previous methods in the\nexperiments on two datasets.\n- Weaknesses:\nThis is basically an application of PN to argumentation\nmining. Although the combination of PN and multi-task learning for\nthis task is novel, its novelty is not enough for ACL long\npublication. The lack of qualitative analysis and error analysis is\nalso a major concern.\n- General Discussion:\nBesides the weaknesses mentioned above, the use of PN is not\nwell-motivated. Although three characteristics of PN were described in\nl.138-143, these are not a strong motivation against the use of\nbi-directional LSTMs and the attention mechanism. The authors should\ndescribe what problems are solved by PN and discuss in the experiments\nhow much these problems are solved.\nFigures 2 and 3 are difficult to understand. What are the self link to\nD1 and the links from D2 to E1 and D3/D4 to E2? These are just the\noutputs from the decoder and not links. The decoder LSTM does not have\nan input from e_j in these figures, but it does in Equation (3). Also,\nin Figure 3, the abbreviation \"FC\" is not defined.\nEquation (8) is strange. To calculate the probability of each\ncomponent type, the probability of E_i is calculated.\nIn the experiments, I did not understand why only \"PN\", which is not a\njoint model, was performed for the microtext corpus.\nIt is not clear whether the BLSTM model is trained with the joint-task\nobjective.\nThere are some studies on discourse parsing using the attention\nmechanism. The authors should describe the differences from these studies.\nMinor issues:\nl.128: should related -> should be related\nl.215: (2015) is floating\nl.706: it able -> it is able\nI raised my recommendation score after reading the convincing author responses.\nI strongly recommend that the authors should discuss improved examples by PN as\nwell as the details of feature ablation."
