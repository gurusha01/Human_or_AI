The method is\nsimple yet effective. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Movie\nReview dataset and is competitive against the best models on SST dataset. \n- Weaknesses:\nSimilar idea has also been used in (Teng et al., 2016). Though this work is \nmore elegant in the framework design and mathematical representation, the\nexperimental comparison with (Teng et al., 2016) is not as convincing as the\ncomparisons with the rest methods. The authors only reported the\nre-implementation results on the sentence level experiment of SST and did not\nreport their own phrase-level results.\nSome details are not well explained, see discussions below.\n- General Discussion:\nThe reviewer has the following questions/suggestions about this work,\n1. Since the SST dataset has phrase-level annotations, it is better to show the\nstatistics of the times that negation or intensity words actually take effect.\nFor example, how many times the word \"nothing\" appears and how many times it\nchanges the polarity of the context.\n2. In section 4.5, the bi-LSTM is used for the regularizers. Is bi-LSTM used to\npredict the sentiment label?\n3. The authors claimed that \"we only use the sentence-level annotation since\none of\nour goals is to avoid expensive phrase-level annotation\". However, the reviewer\nstill suggest to add the results. Please report them in the rebuttal phase if\npossible.\n4. \"s_c is a parameter to be optimized but could also be set fixed with prior\nknowledge.\" The reviewer didn't find the specific definition of s_c in the\nexperiment section, is it learned or set fixed? What is the learned or fixed\nvalue?\n5. In section 5.4 and 5.5, it is suggested to conduct an additional experiment\nwith part of the SST dataset where only phrases with negation/intensity words\nare included. Report the results on this sub-dataset with and without the\ncorresponding regularizer can be more convincing."
