Is this a sign of topic\nshift? What is the implication of ending a story coherently with a past tense\nverb, etc. \n(2) It is not clear to me why studies on deceptive language are similar to\nshort or long answers in the current study. I would have liked to see a more\ncomplete comparison here.\n(3) The use of terms such as \"cognitive load\" (l. 134) and \"mental states\" (l.\n671) appears somewhat vague. \n(4) There is insufficient discussion on the use of coordinators (line 275\nonwards); the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of this issue\n(e.g. what is the role of coordinators in these short stories and in discourse\nin general? Does the use of coordinators differ in terms of the genre of the\nstory? How about the use of \"no\" coordinators?) \n(5) The authors do not seem to make it sufficiently clear who the target\nreaders of this research would be (e.g. language teachers? Crowd-sourcing\nexperiment designers? etc.) \nThe paper needs revision in terms of organization\n(there are repetitions throughout the text). Also, the abbreviations in Table\n5 and 6 are not clear to me. \n- General Discussion:\nAll in all, the paper would have to be revised particularly in terms of its\ntheoretical standpoint and implications to discourse and pragmatics.\n=====\nIn their response to the reviewers' comments, the authors indicate their\nwillingness to update the paper and clarify the issues related to what they\nhave experimented with. However, I would have liked to see a stronger\ncommitment to incorporating the implications of this study to the Discourse and\nPragmatics area."
