This method employs a\nself-matching attention technique to counterbalance the limited context\nknowledge of gated attention-based recurrent neural networks when processing\npassages. Finally, authors use pointer networks with signals from the question\nattention-based vector to predict the beginning and ending of the answer.\nExperimental results with the SQuAD dataset offer state-of-the-art performance\ncompared with several recent approaches. \nThe paper is well-written, structured and explained. As far as I know, the\nmathematics look also good. In my opinion, this is a very interesting work\nwhich may be useful for the question answering community.\nI was wondering if the authors have plans to release the code of this approach.\nFrom that perspective, I miss a bit of information about the technology used\nfor the implementation (theano, CUDA, CuDNN...), which may be useful for\nreaders.\nI would appreciate if authors could perform a test of statistical significance\nof the results. That would highlight even more the quality of your results.\nFinally, I know that the space may be a constraint, but an evaluation including\nsome additional dataset would validate more your work."
