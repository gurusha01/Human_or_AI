It is\nunited around an overarching view of formal languages in which a language\nbeing \"probabilistic\" or not is treated as a formal property of the same \nvariety as being closed under intersection or not. In my opinion, what it \nmeans for a formal language to be probabilistic in this view has not been \nconsidered with sufficient rigor for this viewpoint to be compelling.\nI should note, by the way, that the value of the formal results provided\nmostly does not depend on the flimsiness of the overarching story. So\nwhat we have here is not bad research, but a badly written paper. This needs \nmore work.\nI find it particulary puzzling that the organization of the paper\nleaves so little space for elucidating the parsing result that\nsoundness and completeness are relegated to a continuation of the\npaper in the form of supplementary notes. I also find the mention of\nprobabilistic languages in the title of the paper to be very\ndisingenuous --- there is in fact no probabilistic reasoning in this\nsubmission.\nThe sigificance of the intersection-closure result of section 3 is\nalso being somewhat overstated, I think. Unless there is something\nI'm not understanding about the restrictions on the right-hand sides\nof rules (in which case, please elaborate), this is merely a matter of\nfolding a finite intersection into the set of non-terminal labels."
