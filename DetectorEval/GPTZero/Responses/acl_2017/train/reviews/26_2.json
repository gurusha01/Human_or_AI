            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis paper contributes to the field of knowledge base-based question answering\n(KB-QA), which is to tackle the problem of retrieving results from a structured\nKB based on a natural language question. KB-QA is an important and challenging\ntask.\nThe authors clearly identify the contributions and the novelty of their work,\nprovide a good overview of the previous work and performance comparison of\ntheir approach to the related methods.\nPrevious approaches to NN-based KB-QA represent questions and answers as fixed\nlength vectors, merely as a bag of words, which limits the expressiveness of\nthe models. And previous work also don't leverage unsupervised training over\nKG, which potentially can help a trained model to generalize.\nThis paper makes two major innovative points on the Question Answering problem.\n1) The backbone of the architecture of the proposed approach is a\ncross-attention based neural network, where attention is used for capture\ndifferent parts of questions and answer aspects. The cross-attention model\ncontains two parts, benefiting each other. The A-Q attention part tries to\ndynamically capture different aspects of the question, thus leading to\ndifferent embedding representations of the question. And the Q-A attention part\nalso offer different attention weight of the question towards the answer\naspects when computing their Q-A similarity score. \n2) Answer embeddings are not only learnt on the QA task but also modeled using\nTransE which allows to integrate more prior knowledge on the KB side. \nExperimental results are obtained on Web questions and the proposed approach\nexhibits better behavior than state-of-the-art end-to-end methods. The two\ncontributions were made particularly clear by ablation experiment. Both the\ncross-attention mechanism and global information improve QA performance by\nlarge margins.\nThe paper contains a lot of contents. The proposed framework is quite\nimpressive and novel compared with the previous works.\n- Weaknesses:\nThe paper is well-structured, the language is clear and correct. Some minor\ntypos are provided below.\n1. Page 5, column 1, line 421: re-read \n \nïƒ \nreread\n2. Page 5, column 2, line 454: pairs be ïƒ pairs to be\n- General Discussion:\nIn Equation 2: the four aspects of candidate answer aspects share the same W\nand b. How about using separate W and b for each aspect? \nI would suggest considering giving a name to your approach instead of \"our\napproach\", something like ANN or CA-LSTM\"¦(yet something different from Table\n2). \nIn general, I think it is a good idea to capture the different aspects for\nquestion answer similarity, and cross-attention based NN model is a novel\nsolution for the above task. The experimental results also demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the authors' approach. Although the overall performance is\nweaker than SP-based methods or some other integrated systems, I think this\npaper is a good attempt in end-to-end KB-QA area and should be encouraged."
