It appears\nthat the main novelty of this paper is the additional analysis, which is\nhowever rather superficial.\nIt is good that the authors report a comparison of how an NNLG baseline fares\non this corpus in comparison to that of Wen et al. (2016). However, the\nBLEU scores in Wen et al.'s paper appear to be much much higher, suggesting\nthat this NNLG baseline is not sufficient for an informative comparison.\n- General Discussion:\nThe authors need to more clearly articulate why this paper should count as a\nsubstantial advance over what has been published already by Perez-Beltrachini\net al, and why the NNLG baseline should be taken seriously. In contrast to\nLREC, it is not so common for ACL to publish a main session paper on a corpus\ndevelopment methodology in the absence of some new results of a system making\nuse of the corpus.\nThe paper would also be stronger if it included an analysis of the syntactic\nconstructions in the two corpora, thereby more directly bolstering the case\nthat the new corpus is more complex. The exact details of how the number of\ndifferent path shapes are determined should also be included, and ideally\nassociated with the syntactic constructions.\nFinally, the authors should note the limitation that their method does nothing\nto include richer discourse relations such as Contrast, Consequence,\nBackground, etc., which have long been central to NLG. In this respect, the\ncorpora described by Walker et al. JAIR-2007 and Isard LREC-2016 are more\ninteresting and should be discussed in comparison to the method here.\nReferences\nMarilyn Walker, Amanda Stent, FranÃ§ois Mairesse, and\nRashmi Prasad. 2007.

As the response offers crucial\nclarifications, I have raised my overall rating. Re the comparison to\nPerez-Beltrachini et al.: While this is perhaps more important to the PC than\nto the eventual readers of the paper, it still seems to this reviewer that the\nadvance over this paper could've been made much clearer. While it is true that\nPerez-Beltrachini et al. \"just\" cover content selection, this is the key to how\nthis dataset differs from that of Wen et al. There doesn't really seem to be\nmuch to the \"complete methodology\" of constructing the data-to-text dataset\nbeyond obvious crowd-sourcing steps; to the extent these steps are innovative\nor especially crucial, this should be highlighted. Here it is interesting that\n8.7% of the crowd-sourced texts were rejected during the verification step;\nrelated to Reviewer 1's concerns, it would be interesting to see some examples\nof what was rejected, and to what extent this indicates higher-quality texts\nthan those in Wen et al.'s dataset. Beyond that, the main point is really that\ncollecting the crowd-sourced texts makes it possible to make the comparisons\nwith the Wen et al. corpus at both the data and text levels (which this\nreviewer can see is crucial to the whole picture).\nRe the NNLG baseline, the issue is that the relative difference between the\nperformance of this baseline on the two corpora could disappear if Wen et al.'s\nsubstantially higher-scoring method were employed. The assumption that this\nrelative difference would remain even with fancier methods should be made\nexplicit, e.g. by acknowledging the issue in a footnote. Even with this\nlimitation, the comparison does still strike this reviewer as a useful\ncomponent of the overall comparison between the datasets.\nRe whether a paper about dataset creation should be able to get into ACL\nwithout system results: though this indeed not unprecedented, the key issue is\nperhaps how novel and important the dataset is likely to be, and here this\nreviewer acknowledges the importance of the dataset in comparison to existing\nones (even if the key advance is in the already published content selection\nwork).\nFinally, this reviewer concurs with Reviewer 1 about the need to clarify the\nrole of domain dependence and what it means to be \"wide coverage\" in the final\nversion of the paper, if accepted."
