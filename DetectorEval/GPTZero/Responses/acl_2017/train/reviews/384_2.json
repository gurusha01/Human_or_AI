            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis paper presents an approach for fine-grained IsA extraction by learning\nmodifier interpretations. The motivation of the paper is easy to understand and\nthis is an interesting task. In addition, the approach seems solid in general\nand the experimental results show that the approach increases in the number of\nfine-grained classes that can be populated.\n- Weaknesses:\nSome parts of the paper are hard to follow. It is unclear to me why D((e, p,\no)) is multiplied by w in Eq (7) and why the weight for e in Eq. (8) is\nexplained as the product of how often e has been observed with some property\nand the weight of that property for the class MH. In addition, it also seems\nunclear how effective introducing compositional models itself is in increasing\nthe coverage. I think one of the major factors of the increase of the coverage\nis the modifier expansion, which seems to also be applicable to the baseline\n'Hearst'. It would be interesting to see the scores 'Hearst' with modifier\nexpansion.\n- General Discussion:\nOverall, the task is interesting and the approach is generally solid. However,\nsince this paper has weaknesses described above, I'm ambivalent about this\npaper.\n- Minor comment:\nI'm confused with some notations. For example, it is unclear for me what 'H'\nstands for. It seems that 'H' sometimes represents a class such as in (e, H)\n(- O, but sometimes represents a noun phrase such as in (H, p, N, w) (- D. Is\nmy\nunderstanding correct?\nIn Paragraph \"Precision-Recall Analysis\", why the authors use area under the\nROC curve instead of area under the Precision-Recall curve, despite the\nparagraph title \"Precision-Recall Analysis\"?\n- After reading the response:\nThank you for the response. I'm not fully satisfied with the response as to the\nmodifier expansion. I do not think the modifier expansion can be applied to\nHearst as to the proposed method. However, I'm wondering whether there is no\nway to take into account the similar modifiers to improve the coverage of\nHearst. I'm actually between 3 and 4, but since it seems still unclear how\neffective introducing compositional models itself is, I keep my recommendation\nas it is."
