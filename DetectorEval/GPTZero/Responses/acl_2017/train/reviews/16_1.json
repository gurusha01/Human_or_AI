            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThis paper tries to use the information from arguments, which is usually\nignored yet actually quite important, to improve the performance of event\ndetection. The framework is clear and simple. With the help of the supervised\nattention mechanism, an important method that has been used in many tasks such\nas machine translation, the performance of their system outperforms the\nbaseline significantly.\n- Weaknesses:\n The attention vector is simply the summation of two attention vectors of each\npart. Maybe the attention vector could be calculated in a more appropriate\napproach. For the supervised attention mechanism, two strategies are proposed.\nBoth of them are quite straightforward. Some more complicated strategies can\nwork better and can be tried.\n- General Discussion:\n Although there are some places that can be improved, this paper proposed a\nquite effective framework, and the performance is good. The experiment is\nsolid. It can be considered to be accepted."
