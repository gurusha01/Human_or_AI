I am very interested in how much data-driven techniques\ncan be used for dialogue management. However, I am concerned that the approach\nthat this paper proposes, is actually not specific to symmetric collaborative\ntasks, but to tasks that can be represented as graph operations, such as\nfinding an intersection between objects that the two people know about.\nIn Section 2.1, the authors introduce symmetric collaborative dialogue setting.\n However, such dialogs have been studied before, such as Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs\nexplored (Cognition '86), and Walker's furniture layout task (Journal of\nArtificial Research '00).\nOn line 229, the authors say that this domain is too rich for slot-value\nsemantics. However, their domain is based on attribute value pairs, so their\ndomain could use a semantics represenation based on attribute value-pairs, such\nas first order logic.\nSection 3.2 is hard to follow. The authors often refer to Figure 2, but I\ndidn't find this example that helpful. For example, for section 3.1, at what\npoint of the dialogue does this represent? Is this the same after `anyone went\nto columbia?'"
