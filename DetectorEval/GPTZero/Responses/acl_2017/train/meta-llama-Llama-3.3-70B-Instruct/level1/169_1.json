Limited evaluation of the classifier: The evaluation of the classifier is limited to a small-scale manual evaluation, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n2. Lack of comparison to existing metrics: The paper does not provide a comparison of the proposed approach to existing metrics for error type evaluation.\n3. Limited analysis of results: The paper presents a large amount of data, but the analysis of the results is limited, and some of the findings are not fully explored.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do you plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the classifier in a larger-scale setting?\n2. Can you provide a comparison of the proposed approach to existing metrics for error type evaluation?\n3. How do you plan to address the limitations of the current evaluation, such as the limited analysis of results?"
