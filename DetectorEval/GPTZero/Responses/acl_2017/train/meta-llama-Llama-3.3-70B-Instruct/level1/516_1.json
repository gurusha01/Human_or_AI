The introduction of tandem anchors, which allows multiple words to be combined into anchor facets, making the anchor words algorithm more intuitive and effective.\n2. The development of several combination functions for combining anchor facets, including vector average, or-operator, element-wise min, and harmonic mean.\n3. The evaluation of the tandem anchors approach on a user study, which shows that it produces higher quality topic models and is more intuitive to use than single word anchors.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed approach is novel and addresses the limitations of existing interactive topic modeling techniques.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the approach, including a user study and comparisons with other methods.\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed approach and its advantages.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The authors assume that the user has some knowledge of the topic modeling algorithm and its parameters, which may not be the case for non-expert users.\n2. The user study is limited to a small number of participants and may not be representative of the larger population.\n3. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which may be important for large-scale datasets.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of user expertise and knowledge of topic modeling algorithms and parameters?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to large-scale datasets?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other types of data, such as images or videos?"
