Well-written and clear presentation: The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. Limited interpretability: The authors do not provide much insight into how the model is making its jumping decisions, which could be an important area for future work.\n2. Dependence on hyperparameters: The model's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of jumps allowed and the maximum size of jumping.\n3. Comparison to other models: The authors primarily compare their model to a traditional sequential RNN, but it would be interesting to see comparisons to other models that also aim to improve efficiency, such as those using attention mechanisms.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more insight into how the model is making its jumping decisions, and what features of the text are most important for determining when to jump?\n2. How do you plan to extend this work to more complex tasks, such as those requiring multiple passes over the text or more sophisticated reasoning?\n3. Have you considered using other reinforcement learning algorithms or techniques, such as actor-critic methods or curriculum learning, to improve the model's performance?"
