The authors argue that the meaning of a character can be derived from the sum of its parts, and propose a method to learn visual embeddings for characters using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs are trained to extract features from images of characters, which are then used as inputs to a recurrent neural network (RNN) for text classification tasks. The authors demonstrate that their proposed Visual model outperforms a baseline Lookup model, particularly for low-frequency characters, and show that the learned embeddings capture both visual and semantic information.\nMain Contributions\n1. Visual embeddings for characters: The authors propose a method to learn visual embeddings for characters using CNNs, which can capture both visual and semantic information.\n2. Compositionality of characters: The authors demonstrate that the proposed Visual model can learn compositional representations of characters, where the meaning of a character is derived from the sum of its parts.\n3. Improved performance on low-frequency characters: The authors show that the proposed Visual model outperforms the baseline Lookup model, particularly for low-frequency characters.\nStrengths\n1. Novel approach to character modeling: The authors propose a novel approach to modeling the compositionality of characters, which can capture both visual and semantic information.\n2. Improved performance on low-frequency characters: The proposed Visual model demonstrates improved performance on low-frequency characters, which is a significant challenge in natural language processing.\n3. Flexibility and generalizability: The proposed method can be applied to any language for which text can be rendered, making it a flexible and generalizable approach.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their proposed method on a text classification task, and do not demonstrate its effectiveness on other tasks, such as machine translation or pronunciation estimation.\n2. Dependence on image quality: The proposed method relies on high-quality images of characters, which may not always be available, particularly for historical texts or low-resolution images.\n3. Computational complexity: The proposed method requires significant computational resources, particularly for training the CNNs, which may be a challenge for large-scale applications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their proposed method to other tasks, such as machine translation or pronunciation estimation?\n2. How do the authors plan to address the issue of image quality, particularly for historical texts or low-resolution images?\n3. What are the computational requirements for training the proposed Visual model, and how can it be optimized for large-scale applications?"
