Limited extrinsic evaluation: The authors acknowledge that extrinsic evaluation is necessary to fully assess the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, but this is not conducted in the paper.\n2. Computational efficiency: Some of the proposed techniques, such as the PCFG-based systems, may have high computational costs, which could limit their applicability in practice.\n3. Lack of parse ranking model adaptation: The authors note that the parse ranking model is not adapted to the novel situations in which it is used, which could impact the accuracy of the proposed techniques.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of limited extrinsic evaluation in future work?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed techniques and potential optimizations to improve their performance?\n3. How do the authors intend to adapt the parse ranking model to improve the accuracy of the proposed techniques in future work?"
