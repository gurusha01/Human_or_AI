Significant improvement over previous work: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on AMR realization and competitive results on AMR parsing, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.\n2. Thorough evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments, including ablation studies and error analysis, to demonstrate the contributions of each component of their approach.\n3. Well-written and clear presentation: The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Dependence on external resources: The authors rely on external resources, such as the Gigaword corpus, to train their models, which may limit the applicability of their approach to other domains or languages.\n2. Limited analysis of error types: While the authors provide some error analysis, they could further investigate the types of errors made by their models to identify areas for improvement.\n3. No comparison to other seq2seq models: The authors do not compare their approach to other seq2seq models, such as those using different attention mechanisms or encoder-decoder architectures, which could provide further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the dependence on external resources, such as the Gigaword corpus, to make their approach more widely applicable?\n2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the error types made by their models, including examples of common errors and potential strategies for improvement?\n3. How do the authors think their approach could be extended to other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation or question answering, and what challenges might they face in doing so?"
