Introduction of n-grams into word representation methods: The authors extend the information source from word co-occurrence statistics to n-gram co-occurrence statistics, which leads to improved word representations.\n2. Novel approach to building co-occurrence matrix: The authors propose a novel method to build n-gram co-occurrence matrix, which reduces the disk I/O and alleviates the hardware burden brought by n-grams.\n3. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations: The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on word analogy and similarity tasks, and evaluate the trained n-gram representations qualitatively.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Improved word representations: The introduction of n-grams leads to significant improvements in word analogy and similarity tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n2. Efficient co-occurrence matrix construction: The novel approach to building co-occurrence matrix enables the n-gram-based models to run on cheap hardware, making it more accessible to researchers and practitioners.\n3. High-quality n-gram embeddings: The trained n-gram embeddings reflect semantic meanings and syntactic patterns, making them useful for various NLP tasks.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited exploration of hyperparameters: The authors follow the default hyperparameter setting of the baseline models, which may not be optimal for the n-gram-based models.\n2. Lack of comparison with other n-gram-based methods: The authors do not compare their approach with other n-gram-based methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n3. Limited evaluation of n-gram embeddings: The authors only evaluate the n-gram embeddings qualitatively, and do not provide a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness in various NLP tasks.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to explore the relationships between n-grams and various hyperparameters to improve the performance of the n-gram-based models?\n2. Can the authors provide a comparison with other n-gram-based methods to evaluate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach?\n3. How do the authors plan to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the n-gram embeddings in various NLP tasks?"
