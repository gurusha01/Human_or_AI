The use of a simple scoring function for the joint learning algorithm may not be optimal, and more sophisticated scoring functions may be needed to further improve the performance of the model.\n3. The model is evaluated on a limited set of datasets, and its performance on other datasets and in different scenarios may vary.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of feature engineering, and what methods can be used to automatically extract relevant features from the data?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the scoring function used in the joint learning algorithm, and how it was chosen?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the model to handle more complex scenarios, such as multi-party meetings or meetings with multiple topics?"
