The main contributions of this work are:\n1. Introduction of the NBT framework: The authors propose a new framework that couples Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Dialogue State Tracking (DST) without relying on hand-crafted semantic lexicons.\n2. Use of pre-trained word vectors: The NBT models utilize pre-trained word vectors to learn semantic relations and handle variation in user language.\n3. Evaluation on two datasets: The authors evaluate the NBT models on two datasets, DSTC2 and WOZ 2.0, and demonstrate their effectiveness in matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that rely on hand-crafted semantic lexicons.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel approach: The NBT framework offers a new perspective on belief tracking, which has the potential to improve the performance of spoken dialogue systems.\n2. Effective use of pre-trained word vectors: The authors demonstrate the importance of using high-quality pre-trained word vectors in improving the performance of the NBT models.\n3. Strong evaluation: The paper presents a thorough evaluation of the NBT models on two datasets, which provides a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited analysis of errors: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by the NBT models, which could help identify areas for improvement.\n2. Dependence on pre-trained word vectors: The performance of the NBT models relies heavily on the quality of the pre-trained word vectors, which may not always be available or effective for all languages and domains.\n3. Lack of comparison to other neural models: The paper does not compare the NBT models to other neural models for belief tracking, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the NBT models handle out-of-vocabulary words or unseen user language?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the NBT models?\n3. How do the NBT models perform in multi-domain dialogue systems or languages other than English?"
