Effective regularization: The proposed approach provides a principled way to regularize RNNs, by adding gradient noise during training and using model averaging when testing.\n3. State-of-the-art performance: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, image captioning, and sentence classification.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Theoretical foundations: The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical foundations of SG-MCMC and its application to RNNs.\n2. Extensive experiments: The authors conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.\n3. Comparison to state-of-the-art methods: The authors compare their approach to several state-of-the-art methods, including stochastic optimization and dropout.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1.

Limited analysis of uncertainty: While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in modeling weight uncertainty, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the uncertainty estimates.\n3. Lack of comparison to other Bayesian methods: The authors do not compare their approach to other Bayesian methods, such as variational inference or Monte Carlo dropout.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the computational overhead of their approach in testing?\n2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the uncertainty estimates obtained by their approach?\n3. How does the proposed approach compare to other Bayesian methods, such as variational inference or Monte Carlo dropout?"
