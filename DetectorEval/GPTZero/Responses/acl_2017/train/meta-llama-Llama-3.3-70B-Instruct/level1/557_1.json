            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel neural network model for end-to-end relation extraction, which achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. The main contributions of this work are:\n1. Globally optimized neural model: The authors propose a globally optimized neural model for end-to-end relation extraction, which maximizes the cumulative score of the gold-standard label sequence for one sentence as a unit. This approach has been shown to be effective in several NLP tasks, but has not been applied to relation extraction before.\n2. Novel LSTM features: The authors introduce novel LSTM features, including segmental features and syntactic features, which are used to represent the input sentence and improve the performance of the model.\n3. Integration of syntactic information: The authors propose a simple method to integrate syntactic information into the model without the need of parser outputs, which has been shown to be effective in improving the performance of the model.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. State-of-the-art results: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\n2. Novel contributions: The paper proposes several novel contributions, including the globally optimized neural model, novel LSTM features, and the integration of syntactic information, which are likely to be of interest to the NLP community.\n3. Well-written and clear: The paper is well-written and clear, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Complexity of the model: The proposed model is complex and requires a significant amount of computational resources to train and test, which may limit its applicability to larger datasets.\n2. Lack of analysis: While the paper provides some analysis of the results, it would be beneficial to include more detailed analysis and discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\n3. Comparison to other models: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other state-of-the-art models for relation extraction, to provide a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How does the proposed model handle out-of-vocabulary words and entities that are not seen during training?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and test the proposed model?\n3. How does the proposed model perform on datasets with different characteristics, such as datasets with a large number of entities or relations?"
