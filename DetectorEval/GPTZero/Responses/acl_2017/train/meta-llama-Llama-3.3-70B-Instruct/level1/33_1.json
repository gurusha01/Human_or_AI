            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to sentence-level sentiment classification by incorporating linguistic knowledge into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The main contributions of this work are:\n1. Linguistically Regularized LSTMs: The authors propose a simple yet effective way to model the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words in sentence-level sentiment classification. They introduce four regularizers: Non-Sentiment Regularizer (NSR), Sentiment Regularizer (SR), Negation Regularizer (NR), and Intensity Regularizer (IR).\n2. Efficient and Simple Models: Unlike previous models that rely on parsing trees and expensive phrase-level annotation, the proposed models are sequence LSTMs that do not require phrase-level annotation, making them more efficient and simpler.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The authors demonstrate that their models achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, Movie Review (MR) and Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), outperforming several baseline models, including Tree-LSTM, CNN, and DAN.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Effective Use of Linguistic Knowledge: The authors successfully incorporate linguistic knowledge into their models, which leads to improved performance on sentiment classification tasks.\n2. Simple and Efficient Models: The proposed models are simpler and more efficient than previous models, making them more suitable for real-world applications.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their models by achieving state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited Analysis of Negation and Intensity Words: While the authors propose regularizers for negation and intensity words, they do not provide an in-depth analysis of the linguistic role of these words in sentiment expression.\n2. No Explicit Modeling of Modification Scope: The authors do not explicitly model the modification scope of negation and intensity words, which can lead to errors in sentiment classification.\n3. Limited Evaluation on Other Datasets: The authors only evaluate their models on two datasets, which may not be representative of other datasets or domains.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their models to explicitly model the modification scope of negation and intensity words?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the linguistic role of negation and intensity words in sentiment expression, and how their regularizers capture these effects?\n3. How do the authors plan to evaluate their models on other datasets and domains to demonstrate their generalizability?"
