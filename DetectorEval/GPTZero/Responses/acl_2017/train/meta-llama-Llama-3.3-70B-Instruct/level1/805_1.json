Comparison to state-of-the-art measures: The authors compare TextFlow to other state-of-the-art similarity measures, showing its superiority in many cases.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Computational complexity: The authors mention that the computation of TextFlow has a time complexity of O(nm), which may be a limitation for very large datasets.\n2. Parameter tuning: The authors introduce several parameters (α, β, and γ) that need to be tuned for optimal performance, which may require additional computational resources and expertise.\n3. Lack of interpretability: The TextFlow measure is not easily interpretable, making it challenging to understand why certain text pairs are considered similar or dissimilar.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the computational complexity of TextFlow for very large datasets?\n2. Can the authors provide more insight into the tuning of the parameters (α, β, and γ) and their impact on the performance of TextFlow?\n3. How do the authors plan to improve the interpretability of TextFlow, making it easier to understand the results and decisions made by the measure?"
