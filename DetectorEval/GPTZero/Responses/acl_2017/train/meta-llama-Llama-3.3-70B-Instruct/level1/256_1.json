Introduction of a latent variable to capture discourse-level diversity: The authors propose a CVAE-based model that introduces a latent variable to capture the variability in responses at the discourse level, allowing for more diverse and context-dependent responses.\n2. Knowledge-Guided CVAE (kgCVAE) for incorporating linguistic prior knowledge: The authors extend the basic CVAE model to incorporate linguistic prior knowledge, such as dialog acts, to improve the model's performance and interpretability.\n3. Bag-of-word loss for mitigating the vanishing latent variable problem: The authors propose a novel training technique, bag-of-word loss, to address the vanishing latent variable problem, which is a common issue in training VAE-based models with RNN decoders.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Effective generation of diverse responses: The proposed models, CVAE and kgCVAE, demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and appropriate responses at the discourse level, outperforming a strong baseline model.\n2. Incorporation of linguistic prior knowledge: The kgCVAE model effectively incorporates linguistic prior knowledge, such as dialog acts, to improve the model's performance and interpretability.\n3. Novel training technique: The bag-of-word loss technique is a novel and effective solution to the vanishing latent variable problem, which is a common issue in training VAE-based models with RNN decoders.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Complexity of the model: The proposed models, CVAE and kgCVAE, are complex and require careful tuning of hyperparameters, which can be challenging.\n2. Limited evaluation metrics: The paper primarily evaluates the models using automated metrics, such as BLEU and cosine distance, which may not fully capture the nuances of human evaluation.\n3. Need for more extensive experimentation: The paper could benefit from more extensive experimentation, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models and evaluation on different datasets.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the kgCVAE model to capture other linguistic phenomena, such as sentiment and named entities?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the recognition network and how it is used to discover useful high-level intents?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the model and make it more accessible to practitioners?"
