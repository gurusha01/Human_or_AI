Limited interpretability: The authors do not provide a clear interpretation of the learned sense representations, which may limit the understanding of the model's behavior.\n3. Dependence on hyperparameters: The model's performance may depend on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the embedding dimension and the number of senses per word.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed model to handle out-of-vocabulary words and rare senses?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned sense representations and their relationship to the input data?\n3. How do the authors plan to apply the proposed model to downstream NLP tasks, such as text classification and machine translation?"
