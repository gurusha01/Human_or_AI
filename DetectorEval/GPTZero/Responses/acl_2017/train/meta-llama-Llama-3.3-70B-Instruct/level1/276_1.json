Lack of comparison to other multitask learning approaches: The authors do not compare their proposed framework to other multitask learning approaches, making it difficult to assess its relative strengths and weaknesses.\n3. Limited discussion of potential applications: The authors do not discuss potential applications of the proposed framework beyond sequence labeling tasks, limiting its potential impact.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the language modeling objective and its impact on the model's performance?\n2. How does the proposed framework compare to other multitask learning approaches, and what are its relative strengths and weaknesses?\n3. What potential applications of the proposed framework do you envision beyond sequence labeling tasks, and how can it be extended to other areas of natural language processing?"
