The authors apply this approach to a dataset of essays from a psychological educational intervention, exploring the justifications provided by male and female students for their value selections. The results suggest that the LSTM model has learned to recognize gender-specific characteristics of text, with female students more likely to use other-focused justifications and male students more likely to use self-focused justifications.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel approach to interpreting LSTMs: The authors propose a new method for understanding LSTM predictions by treating the model as an input-output device and crafting stimuli that systematically vary along a dimension of interest.\n2. Application to a psychological educational intervention: The authors apply this approach to a dataset of essays from a values affirmation intervention, exploring the justifications provided by male and female students for their value selections.\n3. Insights into gender-specific characteristics of text: The results provide evidence for gender differences in the justifications used by male and female students, consistent with theories of gendered self-construal.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative approach to interpreting LSTMs: The authors' approach offers a new perspective on understanding LSTM predictions, which can be applied to a wide range of domains.\n2. Well-motivated application to a psychological educational intervention: The authors' application of this approach to a values affirmation intervention provides valuable insights into the justifications used by male and female students.\n3. Strong empirical results: The results provide evidence for gender differences in the justifications used by male and female students, consistent with theories of gendered self-construal.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited generalizability: The authors' approach may not be directly applicable to other domains or tasks, and may require significant modifications to be effective.\n2. Dependence on high-quality data: The authors' approach relies on high-quality data, which may not always be available or easily obtainable.\n3. Interpretation of results: The authors' results may be subject to alternative interpretations, and may require additional analysis or experimentation to fully understand.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend this approach to other domains or tasks, and what modifications may be necessary to make it effective?\n2. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of this approach, such as limited generalizability or dependence on high-quality data?\n3. What additional analysis or experimentation is needed to fully understand the results and their implications for theories of gendered self-construal?"
