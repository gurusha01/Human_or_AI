Annotation of extractions: MinIE provides annotations for polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities, which helps retain the original meaning of the extraction.\n3.

Room for improvement in basic minimizations: MinIE's basic minimization techniques, such as negation detection, may not cover all cases and could be improved.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do you plan to address the error propagation issue, and what techniques can be used to improve the robustness of MinIE?\n2. Can you provide more details on how the dictionary for handling collocations is constructed, and how it can be extended to cover more cases?\n3. What are the potential applications of MinIE's annotated extractions, and how can they be used in downstream tasks such as question answering or text summarization?"
