ITransF uses a sparse attention mechanism to compose shared concept matrices into relation-specific projection matrices, leading to better generalization and interpretability. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, WN18 and FB15k, and achieves state-of-the-art performance without using external information.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel Knowledge Embedding Model: ITransF proposes a new knowledge embedding model that enables knowledge transfer between relations by learning shared concepts.\n2. Sparse Attention Mechanism: The model uses a sparse attention mechanism to compose shared concept matrices into relation-specific projection matrices, leading to better generalization and interpretability.\n3. State-of-the-Art Performance: ITransF achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, WN18 and FB15k, without using external information.\nStrengths\n1. Improved Performance: ITransF outperforms previous models on both WN18 and FB15k datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n2. Interpretability: The sparse attention mechanism provides interpretability into how knowledge is shared between relations, allowing for a deeper understanding of the model's behavior.\n3. Efficient Optimization: The block iterative optimization algorithm used in ITransF is efficient and effective, allowing for the model to be trained on large datasets.\nWeaknesses\n1. Computational Complexity: The sparse attention mechanism and block iterative optimization algorithm may increase the computational complexity of the model, potentially making it less efficient than other models.\n2. Hyperparameter Tuning: The model has several hyperparameters that need to be tuned, which can be time-consuming and may require significant computational resources.\n3. Limited Scalability: The model may not be scalable to very large datasets or complex knowledge graphs, due to the computational complexity of the sparse attention mechanism and block iterative optimization algorithm.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the sparse attention mechanism affect the model's performance on rare relations, and are there any potential drawbacks to using this mechanism?\n2. Can the block iterative optimization algorithm be improved or modified to reduce the computational complexity of the model?\n3. How does the model's performance compare to other state-of-the-art models on larger and more complex knowledge graphs?"
