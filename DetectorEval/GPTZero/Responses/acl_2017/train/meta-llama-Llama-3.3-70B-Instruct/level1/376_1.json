            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThis paper presents a system for extracting and aggregating alliance and opposition relations between countries from a large corpus of news titles. The system uses a combination of neural network techniques, information aggregation, and visualization methods to identify event-based relations with a good tolerance to noise. The authors propose a recursive neural network approach for relation extraction, which is then aggregated and visualized using a search engine-based system.\nMain Contributions\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. Relation Extraction: The authors propose an event-based, recursive neural network approach for identifying alliance and opposition relations between countries, which adapts to the eventive nature of extracted relations and uses a precision-oriented cost function for better later aggregation.\n2. Relation Aggregation: The authors aggregate the sentence-level relations in a multi-document environment to obtain a picture of the geopolitical situation and evolution on a specific subject defined by a user query.\n3. Visualization: The authors propose a visualization system that uses a time-series plot and a force-directed graph to represent the aggregated relations between countries.\nStrengths\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel Approach: The authors propose a novel approach to relation extraction and aggregation, which combines neural network techniques with information aggregation and visualization methods.\n2. Large-Scale Corpus: The authors use a large-scale corpus of news titles, which provides a comprehensive dataset for training and testing their system.\n3. Evaluation: The authors evaluate their system using a rigorous protocol, which includes a comparison with a rule-based system (TABARI) and a human evaluation of the accuracy of the extracted relations.\n4. Visualization: The authors propose a visualization system that provides an intuitive and interactive way to represent the aggregated relations between countries.\n5. Potential Applications: The authors highlight the potential applications of their system in various fields, including international relations, political science, and journalism.\nWeaknesses\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited Domain: The authors focus on a specific domain (international relations), which may limit the applicability of their system to other domains.\n2. Supervision: The authors require a significant amount of supervision for training their system, which may be time-consuming and expensive.\n3. Noise and Errors: The authors acknowledge the presence of noise and errors in their system, which may affect the accuracy of the extracted relations.\n4. Comparison with Other Systems: The authors compare their system with only one rule-based system (TABARI), which may not be representative of other state-of-the-art systems.\n5. Lack of Multilingual Support: The authors do not provide multilingual support, which may limit the applicability of their system to non-English languages.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to reduce the necessary amount of supervision for training their system?\n2. How do the authors plan to extend their system to other domains and languages?\n3. How do the authors plan to improve the accuracy of their system, particularly in the presence of noise and errors?\n4. How do the authors plan to compare their system with other state-of-the-art systems in the field?\n5. How do the authors plan to make their system more accessible and user-friendly for non-experts in international relations and natural language processing?"
