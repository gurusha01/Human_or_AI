Novel approach: The Soft-KB lookup method is a new and innovative approach to querying KBs, which allows for end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents.\n2. Effective evaluation: The authors evaluate their approach using a user simulator and real users, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance.\n3. Comparison to existing methods: The authors compare their approach to existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach and highlighting its advantages.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Complexity: The proposed approach requires a significant amount of computational resources and may be challenging to implement in practice.\n2. Overfitting: The authors mention that the E2E agent suffers from overfitting, which may limit its generalizability to new users and scenarios.\n3. Limited scalability: The approach may not be scalable to larger KBs or more complex dialogue scenarios, which could limit its applicability.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do you plan to address the overfitting issue in the E2E agent?\n2. Can you provide more details on the computational resources required to implement the proposed approach?\n3. How do you envision the proposed approach being applied to larger KBs or more complex dialogue scenarios?"
