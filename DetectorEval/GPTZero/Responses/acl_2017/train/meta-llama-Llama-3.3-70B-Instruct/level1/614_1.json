            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel method for improving the lexical substitution rankings of existing models by integrating word sense inventories. The authors introduce a multi-view clustering algorithm that incorporates different views of paraphrase similarity to generate sense clusters that are more substitutable and have wider coverage than existing sense inventories.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. A novel method for clustering paraphrases by word sense that unites various paraphrase representations in a multi-view approach.\n2. The introduction of a substitutability metric, the extended B-Cubed F-Score, to measure the quality of sense inventories.\n3. The demonstration that word senses can be used as a filter over automatically-generated lexsub rankings to improve their agreement with human-annotated substitutes.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed method outperforms existing sense inventories in terms of substitutability and coverage.\n2. The use of a multi-view clustering approach allows for the incorporation of different types of information about paraphrases, making the method more robust and flexible.\n3. The evaluation of the method on a large dataset (CoInCo) and the comparison with state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The method relies on the quality of the input paraphrases and the accuracy of the word sense disambiguation.\n2. The use of a simple word sense disambiguation method may introduce bias and limit the performance of the approach.\n3. The method may not perform well for nouns, as shown in the experiments, and may require part-of-speech specific optimization.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the method for nouns and improve its performance for this part of speech?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the multi-view clustering algorithm and the choice of parameters?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the method to other languages and domains, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of such an extension?"
