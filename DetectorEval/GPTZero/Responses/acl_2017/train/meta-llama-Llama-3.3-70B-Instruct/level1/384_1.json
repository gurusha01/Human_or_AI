A compositional method for IsA extraction, which applies noun-phrase paraphrasing methods to semantic taxonomy induction.\n2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics: assigning intrinsic meaning to a phrase and reasoning about that phrase in a truth-theoretic context.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The proposed method can handle fine-grained classes that are not explicitly mentioned in the text, by combining evidence from multiple sentences.\n2. The method achieves a >10 point increase in AUC over a strong baseline relying on widely-used Hearst patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in populating fine-grained classes with instances.\n3.

The method relies on a large repository of facts extracted from text, which may not always be available or accurate.\n2. The authors assume that modifiers are subsective, which may not always be the case, and this assumption may limit the applicability of the method.\n3. The method may not perform well on classes with very few instances or with instances that are not well-represented in the text.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of modifiers that are not subsective, and how will this affect the performance of the method?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the manual re-annotation process, and how it was used to estimate true precision?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend this work to handle more complex class labels, such as those with multiple heads or modifiers?"
