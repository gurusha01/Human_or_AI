            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam for the cold-start problem, where a new reviewer posts just one review and the available information is very poor. The model jointly encodes the textual and behavioral information into review embeddings, which can capture complex global semantic information and record the reviewers' latent characteristic information.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a neural network model to jointly encode textual and behavioral information for detecting review spam in the cold-start task.\n2. The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn to represent the existing reviews, which can capture complex global semantic information.\n3. The encoding of global behavioral information into the model using a TransE-like embedding learning model, which can record the reviewers' latent characteristic information.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed model achieves an effective performance in detecting review spam for the cold-start task, with improvements in both F1-score and accuracy compared to traditional linguistic and behavioral features.\n2. The model possesses preferable domain-adaptability, with good performance in both hotel and restaurant domains.\n3. The use of a CNN to learn to represent the existing reviews is effective in capturing complex global semantic information.\n4. The encoding of global behavioral information into the model is effective in recording the reviewers' latent characteristic information.\n5. The proposed model is applicable to a large scale dataset in an unsupervised way.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The proposed model relies on the quality of the training data, and may not perform well if the training data is noisy or biased.\n2. The model requires a large amount of computational resources to train, which may be a limitation for some applications.\n3. The proposed model may not be able to detect review spam that is highly sophisticated or uses advanced techniques to evade detection.\n4. The evaluation metrics used in the paper may not be comprehensive, and additional metrics such as precision and recall may be useful to evaluate the performance of the model.\n5. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the model and potential avenues for future work.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How does the proposed model handle cases where the new reviewer has no similar reviewers in the training data?\n2. Can the proposed model be used for other types of spam detection, such as comment spam or fake news detection?\n3. How does the proposed model handle cases where the review spam is highly sophisticated or uses advanced techniques to evade detection?\n4. Can the proposed model be used in real-time applications, such as detecting review spam as soon as it is posted?\n5. How does the proposed model handle cases where the training data is noisy or biased?"
