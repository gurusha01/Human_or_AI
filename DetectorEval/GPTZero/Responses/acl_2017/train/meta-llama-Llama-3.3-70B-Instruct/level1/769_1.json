            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThis paper introduces a symmetric collaborative dialogue setting where two agents, each with private knowledge, must communicate to achieve a common goal. The authors propose a neural model, DynoNet, which integrates structured knowledge and unstructured language to represent open-ended dialogue states. The model uses a dynamic knowledge graph with evolving node embeddings to capture the dialogue context. The authors also collect a large dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. The results show that DynoNet outperforms baseline models in both automatic and human evaluations.\nMain Contributions\n1. Symmetric Collaborative Dialogue Setting: The authors introduce a new dialogue setting that bridges the gap between task-oriented and open-domain chat systems.\n2. DynoNet Model: The proposed model effectively integrates structured knowledge and unstructured language to represent open-ended dialogue states.\n3. Large Dataset: The authors collect a large dataset of human-human dialogues, which provides a valuable resource for future research in dialogue systems.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Dialogue Setting: The symmetric collaborative dialogue setting is a unique and challenging problem that requires the development of new models and techniques.\n2. Effective Model: DynoNet demonstrates strong performance in both automatic and human evaluations, outperforming baseline models.\n3. Large Dataset: The collected dataset provides a valuable resource for future research in dialogue systems, enabling the development of more advanced models.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of their model, including automatic and human evaluations, as well as ablation studies.\n5. Insights into Human Dialogue: The dataset and model provide insights into human dialogue strategies and pragmatics, which can inform the development of more effective dialogue systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Scalability: The model's performance may degrade with larger knowledge bases or more complex dialogue scenarios.\n2. Dependence on Entity Abstraction: The model's performance relies heavily on the entity abstraction mechanism, which may not generalize well to other domains.\n3. Lack of Interpretability: The model's decision-making process is not transparent, making it difficult to understand why certain utterances are generated.\n4. Limited Handling of Ambiguity: The model may struggle with ambiguous or unclear utterances, which can lead to errors or misunderstandings.\n5. Need for Further Evaluation: While the authors conduct a thorough evaluation, further studies are needed to fully assess the model's performance and generalizability.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the scalability limitations of the model, particularly with larger knowledge bases or more complex dialogue scenarios?\n2. Can you provide more insights into the entity abstraction mechanism and how it contributes to the model's performance?\n3. How do you plan to improve the model's interpretability and transparency, particularly in terms of understanding the decision-making process?\n4. Can you discuss the potential applications of the symmetric collaborative dialogue setting and the DynoNet model in real-world scenarios?\n5. How do you plan to extend the model to handle more complex dialogue scenarios, such as multi-party conversations or negotiations?"
