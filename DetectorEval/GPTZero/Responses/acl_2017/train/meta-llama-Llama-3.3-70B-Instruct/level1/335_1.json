Self-matching attention mechanism: The authors introduce a self-matching attention mechanism to refine the passage representation by matching the passage against itself, effectively encoding information from the whole passage.\n3. State-of-the-art results: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the SQuAD dataset, outperforming several strong competing systems.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Effective use of attention mechanisms: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in reading comprehension, particularly in modeling the importance of passage parts to the question.\n2. Innovative self-matching attention mechanism: The self-matching attention mechanism is a novel contribution that allows the model to dynamically refine the passage representation and aggregate evidence from the whole passage.\n3. Strong empirical results: The paper presents strong empirical results, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SQuAD dataset and outperforming several competing systems.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Complexity of the model: The proposed model is complex, with multiple components and mechanisms, which may make it difficult to interpret and analyze.\n2. Limited analysis of the self-matching attention mechanism: While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the self-matching attention mechanism, they provide limited analysis of how it works and why it is effective.\n3. Lack of comparison to other attention mechanisms: The authors do not compare their self-matching attention mechanism to other attention mechanisms, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more analysis of the self-matching attention mechanism, including visualizations of the attention weights and examples of how it refines the passage representation?\n2. How does the gated attention-based recurrent network compare to other attention mechanisms, such as hierarchical attention or multi-perspective attention?\n3. Can you provide more details on the training process, including the hyperparameter settings and the optimization algorithm used?"
