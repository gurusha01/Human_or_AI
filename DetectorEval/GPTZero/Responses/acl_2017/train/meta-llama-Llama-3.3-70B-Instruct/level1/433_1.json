            "inputText": "This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing (NLP) by investigating dependency parsing for Singlish, a creole language based on English. The authors construct a Singlish dependency treebank and train a neural network model that leverages English syntactic knowledge to improve parsing accuracy.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. Construction of a Singlish dependency treebank: The authors create a treebank with 1,200 sentences, which is a valuable resource for future research on Singlish NLP.\n2. Development of a neural network model for Singlish dependency parsing: The authors propose a model that integrates English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser, achieving a significant improvement in parsing accuracy.\n3. Demonstration of the effectiveness of neural stacking for feature transfer: The authors show that neural stacking can effectively transfer knowledge from a larger English treebank to improve Singlish parsing performance.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. Novelty of the research: The paper addresses a previously under-studied language, Singlish, and contributes to the development of NLP tools for low-resource languages.\n2. High-quality treebank construction: The authors provide a detailed description of the treebank construction process, ensuring the quality and reliability of the resource.\n3. State-of-the-art results: The proposed model achieves impressive results, outperforming baseline models and demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. Limited size of the treebank: Although the treebank is a valuable resource, its size is relatively small compared to other languages, which may limit the model's performance and generalizability.\n2. Dependence on English resources: The model's performance relies heavily on the availability of English resources, which may not be feasible for other low-resource languages.\n3. Lack of comparison to other transfer learning methods: The authors could have compared their approach to other transfer learning methods to demonstrate its superiority.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to expand the treebank to improve the model's performance and generalizability?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the neural stacking architecture and its hyperparameters?\n3. How do the authors envision applying this approach to other low-resource languages, and what challenges do they anticipate?"
