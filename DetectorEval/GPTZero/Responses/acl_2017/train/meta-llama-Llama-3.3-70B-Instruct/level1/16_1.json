The proposal of a supervised attention-based ED model that leverages argument information to improve ED performance.\n2. The investigation of two strategies to construct gold attentions using annotated arguments.\n3. The achievement of state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 dataset.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of existing joint methods and propose a novel approach to address these limitations.\n2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.\n3. The use of events from FrameNet as extra training data further enhances the performance of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. The proposed approach relies heavily on the quality of the annotated arguments, which may not always be accurate.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other attention-based methods, which makes it difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed approach.\n3. The experimental results are limited to the ACE 2005 dataset, and it is unclear whether the proposed approach generalizes to other datasets.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of noisy annotated arguments, which may negatively impact the performance of the proposed approach?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the hyper-parameter tuning process, particularly for the trade-off parameter 位 in the joint loss function?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other event extraction tasks, such as event argument extraction and event coreference resolution?"
