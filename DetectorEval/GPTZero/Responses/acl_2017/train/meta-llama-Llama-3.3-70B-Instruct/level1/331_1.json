            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel task of concept-map-based multi-document summarization (MDS) and presents a newly created corpus of concept maps that summarize heterogeneous collections of web documents on educational topics. The authors introduce a crowdsourcing approach, low-context importance annotation, to efficiently determine important elements in large document collections. The corpus creation process combines automatic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing, and high-quality expert annotations.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. Proposal of a novel summarization task: Concept-map-based MDS, which extends traditional summarization tasks by representing summaries as concept maps.\n2. Creation of a new benchmark corpus: A large-scale corpus of concept maps summarizing heterogeneous web documents, which provides a necessary benchmark to evaluate the proposed task.\n3. Introduction of a novel crowdsourcing scheme: Low-context importance annotation, which allows for efficient and reliable annotation of importance scores for propositions.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel task proposal: The authors propose a new and interesting task that extends traditional summarization tasks, which can lead to more informative and useful summaries.\n2. Large-scale corpus creation: The creation of a large-scale corpus with heterogeneous web documents provides a challenging and realistic benchmark for evaluating concept-map-based MDS systems.\n3. Effective crowdsourcing scheme: The low-context importance annotation scheme is shown to be effective in collecting reliable importance scores for propositions, which is essential for creating high-quality concept maps.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited evaluation: The evaluation of the proposed task and corpus is limited to a simple baseline method, which may not fully demonstrate the potential of concept-map-based MDS.\n2. Lack of comparison to traditional summarization: The paper does not provide a direct comparison to traditional summarization tasks, which makes it difficult to assess the benefits of concept-map-based MDS.\n3. High complexity of the task: The proposed task involves multiple subtasks, such as proposition extraction, importance annotation, and concept map construction, which can be challenging to optimize and evaluate.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the proposed task and optimize the performance of concept-map-based MDS systems?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the characteristics of the created corpus and how it differs from existing summarization corpora?\n3. How do the authors envision the application of concept-map-based MDS in real-world scenarios, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of using this approach?"
