The authors design high-quality linguistic patterns to extract users' preferences on various topics from a large collection of tweets. They then formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as a matrix factorization problem, which maps both users and topics into a latent feature space that abstracts users' preferences. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach can predict missing topic preferences of users accurately (80-94%) and that the latent vector representations of topics encode inter-topic preferences.\nMain Contributions\n1. Modeling inter-topic preferences: The authors propose a novel approach to modeling inter-topic preferences, which is a crucial aspect of understanding public opinions and ideologies on social media.\n2. Matrix factorization for preference prediction: The authors apply matrix factorization to predict missing topic preferences of users, which is a significant contribution to the field of social media analytics.\n3. Latent vector representations of topics: The authors demonstrate that the latent vector representations of topics encode inter-topic preferences, which can be useful for various applications, including public opinion survey, election prediction, and online debate.\nStrengths\n1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to modeling inter-topic preferences, which is a significant contribution to the field of social media analytics.\n2. Large-scale dataset: The authors use a large collection of tweets (35,328,745,115) to extract users' preferences, which provides a comprehensive understanding of inter-topic preferences.\n3. Accurate prediction: The authors demonstrate that their approach can predict missing topic preferences of users accurately (80-94%), which is a significant achievement in the field of social media analytics.\n4. Inter-topic preferences: The authors demonstrate that the latent vector representations of topics encode inter-topic preferences, which can be useful for various applications.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited to Twitter data: The authors only use Twitter data, which may not be representative of other social media platforms or offline opinions.\n2. Linguistic patterns: The authors rely on linguistic patterns to extract users' preferences, which may not be effective for all languages or cultures.\n3. Matrix factorization limitations: The authors use matrix factorization, which may have limitations in terms of scalability and interpretability.\n4. Evaluation metrics: The authors use limited evaluation metrics, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the approach's performance.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other social media platforms or offline opinions?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the linguistic patterns used to extract users' preferences, and how they can be adapted to other languages or cultures?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of matrix factorization, such as scalability and interpretability?\n4. Can the authors provide more evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach?"
