The authors propose a modular segmentation model that can be pretrained using these external sources, and demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy on six benchmarks.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. Effective use of external resources: The authors show that pretraining the character window network using external resources such as punctuation, automatically segmented text, and POS information can significantly improve segmentation accuracy.\n2. Modular model architecture: The proposed model architecture is modular and allows for easy incorporation of external resources, making it a flexible and adaptable approach to neural word segmentation.\n3. State-of-the-art results: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks, including the CTB6 dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving cross-domain robustness.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to neural word segmentation that leverages rich external resources, which is a significant departure from existing methods.\n2. Thorough experimentation: The authors conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, including ablation studies and comparisons with existing methods.\n3. State-of-the-art results: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Complexity: The proposed model architecture is complex and may require significant computational resources to train and deploy.\n2. Overfitting: The authors use a large number of hyperparameters, which may lead to overfitting and require careful tuning.\n3. Lack of interpretability: The authors do not provide a clear interpretation of the learned representations and how they contribute to improved segmentation accuracy.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the proposed model architecture and make it more efficient for deployment?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representations and how they contribute to improved segmentation accuracy?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other languages and datasets, and what challenges do they anticipate?"
