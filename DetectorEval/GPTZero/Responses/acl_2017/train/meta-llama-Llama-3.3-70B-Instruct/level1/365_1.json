State-of-the-art results: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Anselm dataset, outperforming several baseline models.\n2. Novel application of multi-task learning: The use of multi-task learning with grapheme-to-phoneme mapping as an auxiliary task is a novel application of this technique to historical text normalization.\n3. In-depth analysis of attention mechanisms: The authors provide a detailed analysis of how multi-task learning affects the attention mechanisms in the encoder-decoder model, which is an important contribution to the understanding of these mechanisms.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited dataset: The authors only evaluate their approach on a single dataset, the Anselm dataset, which may not be representative of all historical text normalization tasks.\n2. Lack of comparison to other neural network architectures: The authors only compare their approach to a few baseline models, and do not evaluate other neural network architectures that may be suitable for historical text normalization.\n3. Need for more analysis of the effects of hyperparameter tuning: The authors only tune the hyperparameters on a single manuscript, which may not be sufficient to ensure that the results are generalizable to other datasets.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other historical text normalization datasets?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, and how they ensured that the results are generalizable to other datasets?\n3. How do the authors think their approach can be applied to other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation or text classification?"
