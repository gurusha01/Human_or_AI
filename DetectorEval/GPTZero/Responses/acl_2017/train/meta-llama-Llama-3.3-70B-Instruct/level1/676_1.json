Increased complexity of the model: The proposed method introduces additional complexity, such as the need to design and train the binary code prediction model and the error-correcting codes.\n2. Limited evaluation: The paper only evaluates the proposed method on two translation tasks, and it would be beneficial to evaluate it on more tasks and datasets to demonstrate its generalizability.\n3. Lack of comparison to other methods: The paper does not compare the proposed method to other methods that reduce computation time and memory requirements, such as hierarchical softmax or differentiated softmax.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How did you determine the optimal size of the softmax layer in the hybrid model?\n2. Can you provide more details on the design and training of the error-correcting codes?\n3. How do you plan to extend this work to other natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling or text classification?"
