Introduction of a macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema: The authors propose a novel representation schema that combines the micro and macro discourse structures, providing a more comprehensive understanding of discourse analysis.\n2. Development of a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB): The authors annotate 97 news wire articles with both micro semantics and macro pragmatics, creating a valuable resource for discourse structure analysis.\n3. Preliminary experimentation on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of their corpus resource and representation schema on two tasks, demonstrating promising results.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel representation schema: The proposed macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a more comprehensive understanding of discourse analysis.\n2. Valuable corpus resource: The creation of the MCDTB is a valuable contribution to the field, as it provides a large-scale annotated corpus for discourse structure analysis.\n3. Promising experimental results: The preliminary experimentation on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed representation schema and corpus resource.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1.
