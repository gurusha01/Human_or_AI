Limited interpretability: The model's use of multigraphs and entity separators may make it more challenging to interpret the results and understand why certain entities are recognized or not.\n3. Dependence on features: The model's performance may depend on the quality and relevance of the features used, which may require careful selection and engineering.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the model and make it more accessible to practitioners?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the model and how to understand the results?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the model to other NLP tasks and applications?"
