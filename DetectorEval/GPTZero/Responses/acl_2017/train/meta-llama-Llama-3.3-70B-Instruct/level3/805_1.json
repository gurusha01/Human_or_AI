            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors introduce a framework that automatically extracts cognitive features from gaze data and combines them with textual features to improve classification performance.\nThe strengths of the paper include the originality of the proposed approach, the good accuracy of the similarity measure, and the large number and diversity of datasets used for evaluation. The use of CNNs to learn features from both gaze and text data is a significant contribution, as it allows for the automatic extraction of cognitive features without manual feature engineering.\nHowever, there are several weaknesses and imprecisions in the paper. The authors do not provide sufficient detail on the computation of features and their impact on similarity accuracy evaluation. Additionally, the code and training and evaluation sets are not made available, making it difficult to replicate the experiments. The paper also contains several typos and formatting errors, such as incorrect figure and table references and grammatical mistakes.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection using cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data.\n2. The use of CNNs to learn features from both gaze and text data, allowing for automatic extraction of cognitive features.\n3. The evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple published datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing systems.\nThe strengths of the paper are:\n1. The originality of the proposed approach and the use of CNNs to learn features from gaze data.\n2. The good accuracy of the similarity measure and the large number and diversity of datasets used for evaluation.\n3. The potential of the proposed approach to improve sentiment and sarcasm detection performance in various applications.\nThe weaknesses of the paper are:\n1.
