            "inputText": "This research paper proposes a novel application of existing representations, features, and methods to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in speech narratives. The study is found to be interesting and informative, as it explores the use of speech narratives to identify individuals with MCI. \nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. The proposal of a self-learning framework to learn bilingual word embedding mappings, which can be combined with any embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique.\n2. The demonstration that the proposed method can learn high-quality bilingual embeddings from as little bilingual evidence as a 25-word dictionary or an automatically generated list of numerals.\n3. The achievement of competitive results with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources like larger dictionaries or parallel corpora.\nThe strengths of this submission are: \n1. The simplicity and efficiency of the proposed self-learning framework, which can be easily integrated with existing embedding mapping and dictionary induction techniques.\n2. The robustness of the method, which can learn good bilingual mappings from very little bilingual evidence, even for distant language pairs.\n3. The potential of the method to be used in a completely unsupervised manner, without any bilingual evidence at all.\nThe weaknesses of this submission are: \n1. The lack of detail in some key concepts, such as multi-view learning, linguistic features, and dataset usage, which hinders readability and understanding.\n2. The removal of disfluencies from the dataset, which may be important features in the context of MCI.\n3. The absence of tests for significance to substantiate the conclusions from the experiments, and the superficial description of related work.\n4. The need for shortening the abstract and rephrasing several lines throughout the paper for clarity and grammar.\n5. The lack of citations and links to supporting materials, such as the Dementia Bank and Picnic picture of the Western Aphasia Battery.\nQuestions to authors: \n1. Can you provide more details on the multi-view learning approach used in the study, and how it contributes to the detection of MCI?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of disfluencies in the dataset, and what impact do you think it may have on the results?\n3. Can you provide more information on the linguistic features used in the study, and how they are related to MCI?\n4. How do you plan to extend the study to other languages and datasets, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?"
