Comprehensive overview of related work: The paper provides a thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the contributions and limitations of previous approaches.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited insights regarding the SRL task itself: The paper focuses primarily on the technical aspects of the NSM and its training procedure, without providing much insight into the semantic role labeling task itself.\n2. Overfitting: The paper notes that overfitting is a major problem for the NSM, and that various techniques are used to mitigate this issue.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting in future work?\n2. Can the NSM be applied to other tasks beyond semantic role labeling, such as question answering or text generation?\n3. How does the NSM compare to other approaches that combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning, such as Neural Programmer or Dynamic Neural Module Network?"
