A simple and effective method for morphological paradigm completion in low-resource settings.\n2. The ability to enable transfer learning across languages when the two languages share common characters and common paradigms.\n3. A thorough analysis of the impact of language similarities on the quality of results.\nThe strengths of this submission are:\n1. The proposed method is simple and effective, making it a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing.\n2. The ability to enable transfer learning across languages is a significant advantage, especially for low-resource languages.\n3. The thorough analysis of the impact of language similarities on the quality of results provides valuable insights for future research.\nThe weaknesses of this submission are:\n1. The proposed multi-lingual solution is not novel, and its application to morphology is not entirely new.\n2. The use of Arabic as a baseline is not a fair comparison due to its different script and morphology.\n3. The reviewer questions why the proposed methodology was limited to pairs of languages, rather than sets of similar languages, and suggests exploring multilingual settings.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. Can you elaborate on why you chose to limit the proposed methodology to pairs of languages, rather than sets of similar languages?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of using Arabic as a baseline, and what alternative baselines do you propose?\n3. Can you provide more details on how you plan to explore multilingual settings in future work?"
