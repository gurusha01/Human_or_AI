The ID-CNN model is shown to be faster and more accurate than various recurrent models, including Bi-LSTMs and Bi-LSTM-CRFs.\n2. The experimental setting is well-designed, using several datasets and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.\n3. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the ID-CNN model and its training procedure.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The lack of comparison with novel segmentation methods, which would be necessary to validate the proposed method's effectiveness.\n2. The limited evaluation of the ID-CNN model on only two datasets, which may not be representative of all sequence labeling tasks.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How does the ID-CNN model handle out-of-vocabulary words and rare entities?\n2. Can the ID-CNN model be applied to other NLP tasks, such as parsing and machine translation?\n3. How does the ID-CNN model compare to other convolutional neural network architectures, such as those using attention mechanisms or graph convolutional networks?"
