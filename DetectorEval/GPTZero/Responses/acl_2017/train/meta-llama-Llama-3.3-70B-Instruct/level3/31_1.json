The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which allows users to interactively naturalize a core programming language by defining alternative syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. The system learns from user definitions and induces new grammar rules to parse new utterances.\nMain Contributions\n1. Interactive Language Learning: The paper presents a new interactive language learning process, which enables users to naturalize a core programming language by providing definitions and inducing new grammar rules.\n2. Grammar Induction: The authors propose a grammar induction algorithm that optimizes a global objective and uses the learned semantic parsing model to choose substitutions, resulting in high-precision rules.\n3. Voxelurn System: The paper describes the implementation of the Voxelurn system, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a voxel world setting.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Approach: The paper presents a novel approach to creating a natural language interface, which has the potential to bridge the gap between the power of programming languages and the naturalness of human language.\n2. Effective Grammar Induction: The proposed grammar induction algorithm is able to induce high-precision rules, which is essential for creating a usable language interface.\n3. Interactive Learning: The system's ability to learn from user interactions and adapt to their language usage is a significant strength.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Evaluation: The paper's evaluation is limited to a voxel world setting, and it is unclear how the approach would perform in more complex and realistic scenarios.\n2. Lack of Comparison: The paper does not provide a comparison with existing approaches to natural language interfaces, making it difficult to assess the significance of the proposed approach.\n3. Optimization of Hyperparameters: The paper does not address the optimization of the model's numerous hyperparameters, which is crucial for achieving good performance.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to extend the approach to more complex and realistic scenarios, such as natural language interfaces for databases or robots?\n2. Can you provide a comparison with existing approaches to natural language interfaces, such as semantic parsing or machine translation?\n3. How do you optimize the model's hyperparameters, and what is the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the system's performance?"
