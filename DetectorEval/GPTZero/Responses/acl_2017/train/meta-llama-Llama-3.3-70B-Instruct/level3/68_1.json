            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to answering cloze-style questions over documents, introducing the Gated-Attention (GA) reader. The GA reader combines a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, allowing the query to directly interact with each dimension of the token embeddings at the semantic level. This enables the model to learn conditional token representations with respect to the given question, leading to accurate answer selections.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The introduction of the Gated-Attention mechanism, which provides a significant improvement over previous models.\n2. The achievement of state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale benchmark datasets, with improvements of over 4% compared to competitive baselines.\n3. An ablation study demonstrating the effectiveness of the Gated-Attention mechanism and the importance of multi-hop architecture.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The novelty and effectiveness of the Gated-Attention mechanism, which provides a significant improvement over previous models.\n2. The thorough evaluation of the model on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.\n3. The provision of an ablation study, which helps to understand the contributions of different components of the model.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. The limited interest and impact of readability scores in the field of computational linguistics, despite being useful in educational and public communication fields.\n2. Minor weaknesses in writing, including numerous grammatical errors, and a lack of clarity in comparing the performance of previous readability measures.\n3. The potential for further improvement by releasing the corpus and labels developed, enabling wider use and investigation of more powerful feature-selection methods.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limited interest and impact of readability scores in the field of computational linguistics?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the ablation study, including the specific components that were removed and the resulting performance?\n3. Are there any plans to release the corpus and labels developed, and if so, how will this be done?"
