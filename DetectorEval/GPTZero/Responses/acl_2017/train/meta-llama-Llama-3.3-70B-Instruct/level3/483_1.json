The evaluation metrics used in the paper may not fully capture the quality of the generated keyphrases, and additional metrics or human evaluation may be necessary to fully assess the model's performance.\nSome questions to the authors include:\n1. How does the model handle keyphrases with multiple words, and are there any plans to extend the model to handle more complex keyphrases?\n2. Can the model be applied to other domains or applications, such as news articles or social media posts, and if so, what modifications would be necessary?\n3. Are there any plans to release the code or data used in the paper, which would allow other researchers to build on this work and explore its potential applications?"
