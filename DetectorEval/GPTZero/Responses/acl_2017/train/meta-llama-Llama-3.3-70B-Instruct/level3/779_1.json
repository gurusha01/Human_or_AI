            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection using a multimodal ensemble of features learned from text and readers' eye-movement data through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The key contribution of this work is the automatic extraction of cognitive features from gaze data, which are then combined with textual features to improve the performance of sentiment and sarcasm classifiers.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear motivation for using eye-movement data in text classification tasks. The proposed CNN architecture is described in detail, and the experiments are thoroughly conducted on two publicly available datasets. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features, as well as CNN-based systems that rely on text input alone.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. Novel approach: The use of eye-movement data in text classification tasks is a relatively new and innovative approach.\n2. Automatic feature extraction: The proposed CNN architecture automatically extracts features from gaze data, which reduces the need for manual feature engineering.\n3. Improved performance: The results show that the proposed approach improves the performance of sentiment and sarcasm classifiers.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n1. Limited datasets: The experiments are conducted on only two datasets, which may not be representative of all types of text classification tasks.\n2. Overfitting: The authors mention that the model may be overfitting to the training data, which could be addressed through regularization techniques or data augmentation.\n3. Interpretability: The features learned by the CNN architecture are not easily interpretable, which makes it difficult to understand why the model is making certain predictions.\nTo further improve this work, the authors could consider:\n1. Exploring other architectures: Other deep learning architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, could be explored for sentiment and sarcasm detection.\n2. Using larger datasets: Larger datasets could be used to train and evaluate the model, which could improve its performance and robustness.\n3. Analyzing the learned features: Techniques such as feature visualization or saliency maps could be used to analyze the features learned by the CNN architecture and gain insights into why the model is making certain predictions.\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and innovative approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection, and the results show promising improvements in performance. With further refinement and exploration, this approach could lead to significant advances in text classification tasks. \nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do you plan to address the overfitting issue in your model?\n2. Can you provide more insights into the features learned by the CNN architecture?\n3. Have you considered exploring other deep learning architectures for sentiment and sarcasm detection?"
