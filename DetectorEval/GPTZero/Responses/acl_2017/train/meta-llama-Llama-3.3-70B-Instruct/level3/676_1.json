The attention-based neural network model is well-designed and can effectively capture the context information for zero pronoun resolution.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. The proposed approach relies heavily on the quality of the pseudo training data, and the performance may degrade if the pseudo training data is not well-generated.\n2. The model may not perform well when there are lots of unknown words in the context, especially when the unknown words appear near the zero pronoun.\n3. The model may make incorrect decisions when the correct antecedents of zero pronouns are in long distance, and more advanced methods for handling long-distance dependencies may be needed.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do you plan to improve the handling of unknown words in the context, especially when the unknown words appear near the zero pronoun?\n2. Can you provide more details on how to adapt the proposed two-step training approach to other tasks, and what kind of tasks can benefit from this approach?\n3. How do you plan to address the issue of long-distance dependencies in zero pronoun resolution, and what kind of methods can be used to improve the performance in this aspect?"
