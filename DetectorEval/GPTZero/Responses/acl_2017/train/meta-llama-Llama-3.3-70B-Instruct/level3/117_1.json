            "inputText": "This paper explores the impact of different writing tasks on an author's writing style, using the story cloze task as a case study. The authors propose a simple linear classifier that can distinguish between different types of story endings, achieving state-of-the-art results on the task.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. Demonstrating the effect of writing tasks on writing style: The authors show that different writing tasks, such as writing a coherent or incoherent story ending, can lead to measurable differences in writing style.\n2. Proposing a simple yet effective classifier: The authors propose a linear classifier that can distinguish between different types of story endings, achieving state-of-the-art results on the task.\n3. Highlighting the importance of considering writing tasks in NLP dataset design: The authors emphasize the need to consider the impact of writing tasks on writing style when designing NLP datasets, to avoid confounding classification problems.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. Novelty of the approach: The authors propose a new perspective on the story cloze task, focusing on the impact of writing tasks on writing style.\n2. Simple yet effective methodology: The authors use a simple linear classifier to achieve state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.\n3. Important implications for NLP dataset design: The authors highlight the need to consider the impact of writing tasks on writing style when designing NLP datasets, which has important implications for the field.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. Limited dataset: The authors only use the story cloze task dataset, which may not be representative of other NLP tasks or datasets.\n2. Lack of deeper analysis: The authors do not provide a deeper analysis of the cognitive implications of their findings, which could be an interesting direction for future research.\n3. Limited comparison to other methods: The authors do not compare their approach to other methods, such as deep learning models, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of their approach.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do you plan to extend this work to other NLP tasks or datasets?\n2. Can you provide a deeper analysis of the cognitive implications of your findings?\n3. How do you think your approach could be used to improve NLP dataset design, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?"
