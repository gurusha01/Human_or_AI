            "inputText": "This paper proposes an innovative approach to sequence tagging tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER), by utilizing iterated dilated convolutional neural networks (ID-CNNs). The key contributions of this work include the application of dilated convolutions for sequence labeling, the introduction of a novel training objective that predicts tags at each convolution level, and the demonstration of significant speed gains over traditional recurrent models while maintaining comparable accuracy.\nThe main strengths of this paper are its extensive experiments against various architectures, novel architectural and training ideas, and clear writing. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on two benchmark English NER datasets, CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes 5.0, and demonstrate the effectiveness of ID-CNNs in both sentence-level and document-level prediction tasks.\nOne of the primary contributions of this work is the use of dilated convolutions, which allows for the efficient aggregation of broad context without losing resolution. The authors show that ID-CNNs can outperform traditional recurrent models, such as Bi-LSTMs, in terms of speed while achieving comparable accuracy. Additionally, the introduction of a novel training objective that predicts tags at each convolution level helps to refine the final sequence prediction and improves the overall performance of the model.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include its limited application to English NER and the lack of clarity in certain sections, such as Section 4.1, which requires more details on padding and output resolution. Furthermore, the authors could benefit from conducting an ablation study on the number of layers versus performance to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, and its innovative approach to sequence tagging tasks has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The authors' agreement to make the content more specific to NER and provide more details on certain aspects of the model is appreciated, and it is expected that the revised version of the paper will address the mentioned weaknesses and provide an even more comprehensive and clear presentation of the work.\nThe primary contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n1. The introduction of ID-CNNs for sequence labeling tasks, which provides a fast and efficient approach to aggregating broad context without losing resolution.\n2. The demonstration of significant speed gains over traditional recurrent models while maintaining comparable accuracy.\n3. The introduction of a novel training objective that predicts tags at each convolution level, which helps to refine the final sequence prediction and improve the overall performance of the model.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. Extensive experiments against various architectures, which provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach.\n2. Novel architectural and training ideas, which demonstrate the authors' expertise and creativity in the field.\n3. Clear writing, which makes the paper easy to follow and understand.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. Limited application to English NER, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other languages and tasks.\n2. Lack of clarity in certain sections, such as Section 4.1, which requires more details on padding and output resolution.\n3. The need for an ablation study on the number of layers versus performance, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the padding and output resolution in Section 4.1?\n2. How do you plan to extend this work to other languages and tasks?\n3. Can you provide an ablation study on the number of layers versus performance to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior?"
