            "inputText": "This paper presents a study on how different writing tasks affect an author's writing style, using the story cloze task as a case study. The authors demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can distinguish between different types of story endings, such as original, right, and wrong endings, based on stylistic features. The results show that authors adopt different writing styles when writing coherent vs. incoherent story endings, and when writing the entire story vs. writing only the final sentence for a given story context.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. The finding that different writing tasks lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be detected using simple stylistic features.\n2. The demonstration that a linear classifier can achieve state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task by leveraging these stylistic differences.\n3. The provision of insights into the design of NLP tasks, highlighting the importance of considering the instructions given to authors and the potential biases introduced by different writing tasks.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The use of a simple yet effective approach to detect stylistic differences, which allows for easy interpretation of the results.\n2. The achievement of state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task, demonstrating the practical impact of the proposed approach.\n3. The provision of insights into the cognitive implications of writing tasks on an author's mental state and writing style.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. The lack of novelty in the proposed approach, as the use of stylistic features and linear classifiers is well-established in the literature.\n2. The limited scope of the study, as it focuses on a specific task (story cloze) and may not generalize to other NLP tasks.\n3. The need for further clarification on the experimental setup and results, particularly in tables 4 and 5, to facilitate a deeper understanding of the findings.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the feature extraction process and the specific features used in the linear classifier?\n2. How do you plan to extend this study to other NLP tasks and datasets, and what potential challenges do you anticipate?\n3. Can you elaborate on the cognitive implications of the findings and how they relate to the author's mental state and writing style?"
