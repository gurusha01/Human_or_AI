The approach, called \"naturalization,\" involves seeding a system with a core programming language and allowing users to incrementally define alternative syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. The system, called Voxelurn, is a command interface for a voxel world that allows users to build complex structures using a combination of natural language and programming language.\nMain Contributions\n1. Naturalization Process: The paper introduces a new interactive language learning process that allows users to naturalize a core programming language, making it more accessible and usable.\n2. Voxelurn System: The paper presents a system that implements the naturalization process, allowing users to build complex structures in a voxel world using a combination of natural language and programming language.\n3. Grammar Induction Algorithm: The paper proposes a grammar induction algorithm that can learn new grammar rules from user definitions, enabling the system to understand and generate more complex language constructs.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to creating a language interface that combines the strengths of natural language and programming language.\n2. Effective Naturalization Process: The experimental results show that the naturalization process is effective in allowing users to build complex structures and define new language constructs.\n3. Scalability: The system can handle a large number of users and definitions, making it a scalable solution for creating a language interface.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Complexity: The paper notes that the maximally achievable complexity of the system is limited, which may restrict its applicability to more complex tasks.\n2. Over/Underfitting Issues: The experimental results show that the system suffers from basic over/underfitting issues, which could be addressed by adjusting network capacity or using more data.\n3. Lack of Qualitative Complexity: The paper notes that the system lacks qualitative complexity, only allowing for quantitative increases in difficulty through unnatural means.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the limited complexity of the system, and what are the potential solutions to increase its applicability to more complex tasks?\n2. Can you provide more details on the grammar induction algorithm and how it handles the trade-off between precision and recall?\n3. How do you plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the naturalization process in real-world scenarios, and what are the potential applications of the system?"
