            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which uses both orthographic features and semantic information to segment words into morphemes. The framework is evaluated on three languages (English, Turkish, and Finnish) and outperforms the widely used Morfessor approach. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to address the weaknesses of existing benchmarking datasets.\nMain Contributions\n1. MORSE framework: The paper proposes a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that combines orthographic features with semantic information, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.\n2. SD17 dataset: The authors introduce a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to address the weaknesses of existing benchmarking datasets and provides a more accurate evaluation of morpheme segmentation approaches.\n3. Evaluation on multiple languages: The paper evaluates MORSE on three languages, demonstrating its language-agnostic capabilities and highlighting the importance of semantic cues in morpheme segmentation.\nStrengths\n1. State-of-the-art performance: MORSE outperforms existing approaches, including Morfessor, on multiple languages and datasets.\n2. Novel framework: The paper proposes a novel framework that combines orthographic features with semantic information, providing a new perspective on morpheme segmentation.\n3. New dataset: The introduction of SD17 provides a more accurate evaluation of morpheme segmentation approaches and highlights the weaknesses of existing datasets.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited vocabulary size: MORSE is limited to a vocabulary size of 1M, which may impact its performance on languages with productive morphology.\n2. Greedy inference approach: The paper notes that the greedy inference approach may limit MORSE's performance, as wrong segmentations can propagate and result in consequent wrong segmentations.\n3. Concatenative morphology: MORSE is limited to concatenative morphology, which may decrease its efficacy on languages that include non-concatenative morphology.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of MORSE, including minimal supervision, greedy inference, and concatenative orthographic model?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage to facilitate wider adoption by the community?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology and improve its performance on languages with productive morphology?"
