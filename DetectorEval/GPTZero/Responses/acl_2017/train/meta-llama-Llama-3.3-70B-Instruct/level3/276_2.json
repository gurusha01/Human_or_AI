            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel method called morph-fitting, which injects morphological knowledge into word vector spaces to improve their quality. The method uses linguistic constraints derived from simple language-specific rules to fine-tune the vector space, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart.\nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. The introduction of morph-fitting as a post-processing technique to improve word vector spaces, \n2. The use of linguistic constraints derived from language-specific rules to guide the fine-tuning process, and \n3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of morph-fitting in improving word similarity tasks and downstream language understanding models.\nThe strengths of this paper include: \n1. The clear explanation of the morph-fitting method and its underlying principles, \n2. The thorough evaluation of the method on multiple languages and tasks, and \n3. The comparison with other baseline methods, such as morph-fixing.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include: \n1. The limited novelty of the method, as it builds upon existing work on semantic specialization and retrofitting, \n2. The reliance on simple language-specific rules, which may not capture the full complexity of morphological processes, and \n3. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for word vector space fine-tuning.\nOverall, this paper presents a well-written and clearly explained method for improving word vector spaces using morphological knowledge. While the method may not be particularly novel, the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving word similarity tasks and downstream language understanding models, especially for morphologically rich languages. \nQuestions to authors: \n1. How do the authors plan to extend the morph-fitting method to other languages and tasks? \n2. Can the authors provide more details on the language-specific rules used to derive the linguistic constraints? \n3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the morph-fitting method, such as its reliance on simple language-specific rules?"
