            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel multigraph-based model for recognizing overlapping entities in text, which is a useful problem in the field of natural language processing. The model is a variant of the mention hypergraph (MH) model and is capable of assigning explicit semantics to different edges connecting the same pair of nodes, allowing it to represent overlapping structures.\nThe paper's main contributions are:\n1. A novel multigraph-based model for predicting overlapping entities, which improves upon the previous state-of-the-art MH model.\n2. Empirical results showing that the proposed model achieves higher F1-scores compared to previous models on multiple datasets.\n3. Theoretical analysis showing that the proposed model resolves the spurious structures issue associated with the MH model, while maintaining the same inference time complexity.\nThe strengths of the paper are:\n1. The proposed model is well-motivated and tackles a useful problem in NLP.\n2. The empirical results are strong, showing significant improvements over previous models.\n3. The theoretical analysis provides a clear understanding of the model's advantages over previous models.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses:\n1. The paper lacks clarification in several places, including sections 3, 4, and 5, where issues with the previous model MH and the introduction of new concepts are not clearly explained.\n2. The discussion of the model's superiority over the previous model MH is unclear, particularly in sections 5.1 and 5.2, where abstract explanations and lack of examples make it difficult to understand the new model's advantages.\n3. The reasons behind the improved performance of the proposed model are not clearly explained, making it difficult to understand the contributions of the model.\nTo improve the paper, the authors should provide more clarification on the technical details of the model and its advantages over previous models. Additionally, more examples and illustrations would help to make the paper more accessible to readers.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more clarification on the technical details of the multigraph-based model, particularly in sections 3, 4, and 5?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of spurious structures in the MH model, and what are the implications of this issue for the proposed model?\n3. Can you provide more examples and illustrations to help readers understand the advantages of the proposed model over previous models?"
