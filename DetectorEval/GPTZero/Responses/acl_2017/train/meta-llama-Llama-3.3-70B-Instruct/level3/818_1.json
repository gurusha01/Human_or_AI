            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel multigraph-based model for recognizing overlapping entities in text, which is a significant improvement over previous models. The approach is creative and worthwhile, as it aims to extract common knowledge from text and overcome reporting bias. However, the paper requires substantial work before publication.\nThe main strengths of the paper are its innovative approach to modeling overlapping entities and its ability to achieve higher F1-scores compared to previous models on multiple datasets. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the model and its comparison to previous works.\nHowever, there are several weaknesses in the paper. The approach needs to be clarified, particularly how it makes knowledge about objects interact with knowledge about verbs to overcome reporting bias. The experiments and discussion are incomplete, with missing results and analysis. For example, the paper could benefit from more experiments, such as testing Variant B of the authors' model on the second task.\nAdditionally, the paper lacks explicit links to relevant literature, such as formal semantics and multimodal distributional semantics. The contribution of the paper is not clearly stated, and the authors should clarify what is new and significant about their approach. The paper also raises several technical questions, such as the suitability of the EMB-MAXENT classifier as a baseline, and the authors should provide more details about its training and implementation.\nTo improve the paper, the authors should revise the presentation, clarify technical details, and address the reviewer's concerns. They should also provide more examples, revise figures and tables for clarity and readability, and discuss the results for the task of inferring knowledge on objects, including results for model (B) to provide a more complete evaluation of the approach.\nIn terms of contributions, the paper makes the following significant contributions:\n1. A novel multigraph-based model for predicting overlapping entities, which is the first structured prediction model utilizing multigraphs to predict overlapping structures.\n2. Empirical results showing that the proposed model achieves higher F1-scores compared to previous models on multiple datasets.\n3. A thorough analysis of the model and its comparison to previous works, including a discussion of the edge-based paradigm and the issue of spurious structures.\nHowever, the paper also has several weaknesses, including:\n1. The need for clarification on the approach and its technical details.\n2. Incomplete experiments and discussion, with missing results and analysis.\n3. Lack of explicit links to relevant literature and unclear contribution of the paper.\nOverall, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, but it requires substantial revisions to address the reviewer's concerns and improve its clarity and completeness. \nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on how the multigraph-based model makes knowledge about objects interact with knowledge about verbs to overcome reporting bias?\n2. Can you provide more experiments, such as testing Variant B of your model on the second task, to further evaluate the approach?\n3. Can you clarify the contribution of the paper and provide more explicit links to relevant literature, such as formal semantics and multimodal distributional semantics?\n4. Can you provide more details on the training and implementation of the EMB-MAXENT classifier as a baseline?\n5. Can you discuss the results for the task of inferring knowledge on objects, including results for model (B), to provide a more complete evaluation of the approach?"
