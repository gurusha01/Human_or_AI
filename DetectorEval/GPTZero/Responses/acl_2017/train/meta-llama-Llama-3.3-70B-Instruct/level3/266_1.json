            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to improving word vector representations by incorporating morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints. The authors propose a method called morph-fitting, which injects morphological constraints into pre-trained word vectors to improve their semantic quality. The method is language-agnostic and can be applied to any language with a set of language-specific rules.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The introduction of morph-fitting as a post-processing technique to improve word vector representations.\n2. The demonstration of the effectiveness of morph-fitting in improving word similarity tasks across four languages (English, German, Italian, and Russian).\n3. The application of morph-fitting to a downstream task, dialogue state tracking, and the achievement of state-of-the-art results for German and Italian.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The paper addresses an important aspect of sentiment analysis and word representation learning, which is the incorporation of morphological knowledge.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method on multiple languages and tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.\n3. The paper is well-structured and well-written, making it easy to follow and understand.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses:\n1. The paper's outcome is somewhat predictable, as the authors are building on existing work on semantic specialization and word vector representations.\n2. The methods used are relatively simple and ad-hoc, and the main idea of morph-fitting has already been published in previous work.\n3. The experiments are inconclusive due to the lack of statistical significance testing, making it difficult to determine the meaningfulness of differences between classifier configurations.\n4. The improvement from focusing on subjective subsets may not be helpful in real-life situations with sparse resources, and the pre-selection method used may not be applicable to languages other than English.\n5. The paper has minor issues, such as confusing discussions, unmotivated variations, and unclear definitions, which need to be addressed for clarity and accuracy.\nOverall, this paper presents a solid contribution to the field of natural language processing, but could benefit from more rigorous evaluation and clearer presentation of the results. \nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of scalability and applicability of morph-fitting to low-resource languages?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the language-specific rules used to extract morphological constraints, and how these rules were selected?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the morph-fitting framework to incorporate other sources of morphological knowledge, such as WordNet or other semantic databases?"
