            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection in text using a multimodal ensemble of features learned from both text and readers' eye-movement data. The authors propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that automatically extracts features from both text and gaze inputs, outperforming existing systems that rely on handcrafted features or text input alone.\nThe paper has several strengths, including an interesting task, clear writing, a useful created dataset, and a detailed analysis of the model's performance. The experimental setup is well-designed, and the results show significant improvements over baseline systems. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the results, highlighting the effectiveness of the CNN-learned features in capturing linguistic subtleties.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. One major limitation is the lack of comparison with related work, particularly in the area of multimodal sentiment analysis. The authors could have discussed how their approach differs from existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods and provided a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art systems. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the uniqueness of the task and the limitations of previous research in this area.\nThe paper presents supervised and weakly supervised models for frame classification in tweets, classifying 17 political frames in a multi-label classification task. However, the terms \"weakly supervised\" and \"unsupervised\" are used interchangeably, which could lead to confusion. The authors should use \"weakly supervised\" consistently throughout the paper.\nThe calculated Kappa may not accurately reflect the difficulty of frame classification for tweets, and the reviewer suggests that 73.4% Cohen's Kappa is strong enough to rely on the annotated labels. Furthermore, the equation used to calculate similarity between a frame and a tweet may ignore contextual information, and the reviewer suggests considering models that can determine similarity with larger text units.\nThe experimental setup could be improved by excluding annotated data from calculating statistics used to select top bi/tri-grams. The reviewer also recommends adding precision and recall results in Table 4 and double-checking rules for footnote placements.\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and interesting approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection, with a well-designed experimental setup and significant improvements over baseline systems. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with related work, a clearer discussion of the task's uniqueness and limitations, and some improvements to the experimental setup and result presentation.\nMain contributions of this work are:\n1. A novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection using a multimodal ensemble of features learned from both text and readers' eye-movement data.\n2. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that automatically extracts features from both text and gaze inputs.\n3. Significant improvements over baseline systems that rely on handcrafted features or text input alone.\nStrengths of this paper are:\n1. Interesting task: The paper presents a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection, which is an important task in natural language processing.\n2. Clear writing: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach and results.\n3. Useful created dataset: The authors create a dataset that combines text and gaze inputs, which is a valuable resource for future research.\n4. Detailed analysis of the model's performance: The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, highlighting the effectiveness of the CNN-learned features in capturing linguistic subtleties.\nWeaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Lack of comparison with related work: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art systems in multimodal sentiment analysis.\n2. Insufficient discussion on the uniqueness of the task and limitations of previous research: The authors could have discussed how their approach differs from existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods and provided a more detailed discussion on the limitations of previous research in this area.\n3.
