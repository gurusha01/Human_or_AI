            "inputText": "This paper presents a solid piece of work that builds on previous studies and is well-written and clear. The authors propose a general framework for performing cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the analysis of similarities and differences in term meaning and representation with respect to different contexts. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various tasks, including semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.\nThe main contributions of this paper are: \n1. A general framework for cross-context lexical analysis that can accommodate any notion of context, any similarity function, and any type of word annotation.\n2. The application of the framework to three distinct tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.\n3. The demonstration of the framework's flexibility and effectiveness in various experiments, including the analysis of semantic change, comparative analysis of meaning over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The framework's flexibility and ability to accommodate various contexts, similarity functions, and word annotations, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.\n2. The thorough evaluation of the framework through various experiments, which demonstrates its effectiveness and potential for future studies.\n3. The clear and well-organized presentation of the paper, which makes it easy to follow and understand.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to the paper, including:\n1. Some \"empty\" statements that do not add much value to the content, such as the brief discussion of framing bias on political viewpoints.\n2. Minor errors, including missing words or punctuation, and unclear references to certain terms or methods.\n3. The lack of a more detailed analysis of the results, particularly in the word embedding stability evaluation task.\nOverall, the work and results described in the paper are useful to others working in the area and worthy of presentation at ACL. The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing and has the potential to inspire future research in cross-context lexical analysis. \nSome questions to the authors include:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of disjoint vocabulary when comparing term contexts between different corpora?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the experiments and results, particularly in the word embedding stability evaluation task?\n3. How do the authors envision the application of the framework in real-world scenarios, such as sentiment analysis or event detection?"
