            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper introduces a novel approach to multi-document summarization, where the goal is to generate a concept map that represents the most important content of a set of documents. The authors propose a new crowdsourcing scheme, called low-context importance annotation, to create a gold-standard corpus for this task. The corpus consists of 30 topics, each with around 40 documents and a summarizing concept map. The authors also provide a baseline system and evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel Summarization Task: The authors propose a new summarization task, concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which aims to generate a concept map that represents the most important content of a set of documents.\n2. Low-Context Importance Annotation: The authors introduce a novel crowdsourcing scheme to determine the importance of propositions in a document cluster, which is used to create the gold-standard corpus.\n3. Gold-Standard Corpus: The authors create a new corpus for concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which consists of 30 topics, each with around 40 documents and a summarizing concept map.\n4. Baseline System and Evaluation Protocol: The authors provide a baseline system and evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Approach: The paper introduces a novel approach to multi-document summarization, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in this field.\n2. Large-Scale Corpus: The authors create a large-scale corpus for concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which can be used to train and evaluate systems for this task.\n3. Extensive Evaluation: The authors provide an extensive evaluation of their approach, including a baseline system and evaluation protocol, which can be used to compare the performance of different systems.\n4. Potential Applications: The concept-map-based approach to multi-document summarization has potential applications in various fields, such as education, research, and decision-making.\nWeaknesses\n1. Complexity of the Task: The concept-map-based multi-document summarization task is complex and requires a deep understanding of the documents and their relationships.\n2. Quality of the Corpus: The quality of the corpus depends on the quality of the crowdsourcing scheme and the expertise of the annotators.\n3. Limited Evaluation: The evaluation of the approach is limited to a specific dataset and may not generalize to other datasets or domains.\n4. Computational Resources: The approach requires significant computational resources to process the large-scale corpus and generate the concept maps.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the task and ensure that the generated concept maps are accurate and informative?\n2. How do the authors plan to evaluate the quality of the corpus and ensure that it is representative of the target domain?\n3. Can the authors provide more details on the baseline system and evaluation protocol, and how they can be used to compare the performance of different systems?\n4. How do the authors plan to extend the approach to other domains and datasets, and what are the potential applications of the concept-map-based approach to multi-document summarization?"
