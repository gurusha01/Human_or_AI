The authors introduce a new crowdsourcing scheme, called low-context importance annotation, to determine the importance of propositions in a document cluster. They use this scheme to create a new benchmark corpus for concept-map-based MDS, which consists of 30 topics with around 40 documents each. The corpus is larger and more heterogeneous than traditional summarization corpora, making it a challenging task for summarization systems.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel task definition: The authors propose a new task of concept-map-based MDS, which extends traditional summarization tasks by representing summaries as concept maps.\n2. Low-context importance annotation: The authors introduce a new crowdsourcing scheme to determine the importance of propositions in a document cluster, which is more efficient and effective than traditional crowdsourcing approaches.\n3. Benchmark corpus creation: The authors create a new benchmark corpus for concept-map-based MDS, which is larger and more heterogeneous than traditional summarization corpora.\nStrengths\n1. Novel task definition: The proposed task of concept-map-based MDS is a significant extension of traditional summarization tasks, and it has the potential to improve the effectiveness of summarization systems.\n2. Efficient crowdsourcing scheme: The low-context importance annotation scheme is more efficient and effective than traditional crowdsourcing approaches, making it possible to create large-scale benchmark corpora.\n3. High-quality benchmark corpus: The created benchmark corpus is larger and more heterogeneous than traditional summarization corpora, making it a challenging task for summarization systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their baseline system on the created benchmark corpus, and they do not compare it with other state-of-the-art summarization systems.\n2. Lack of analysis: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the created benchmark corpus, such as the distribution of concepts and relations, and the characteristics of the documents.\n3. Limited applicability: The proposed task of concept-map-based MDS may not be applicable to all domains or genres of text, and the authors do not discuss the potential limitations of their approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed task of concept-map-based MDS in different domains or genres of text?\n2. Can the authors provide more details about the characteristics of the created benchmark corpus, such as the distribution of concepts and relations, and the characteristics of the documents?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the limited applicability to certain domains or genres of text?"
