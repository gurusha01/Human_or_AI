The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which allows users to interactively naturalize a core programming language by defining new constructions and concepts. The system learns from user definitions and adapts to the user's language, enabling the creation of more complex and expressive structures.\nMain Contributions\n1. Interactive Language Learning: The paper presents a new approach to interactive language learning, where users can define new constructions and concepts, and the system learns from these definitions to improve its understanding of the user's language.\n2. Grammar Induction: The authors propose a grammar induction algorithm that can learn new grammar rules from user definitions, allowing the system to generalize and adapt to new language patterns.\n3. Naturalization of Core Language: The paper demonstrates how the system can naturalize a core programming language, making it more accessible and usable for non-programmers.\nStrengths\n1. Clear Presentation: The paper presents a clear and well-structured overview of the system and its components, making it easy to understand the authors' approach.\n2. Evaluation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the system, including statistics on user interactions, definitions, and grammar rules, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.\n3. Potential Applications: The paper highlights the potential applications of the approach to other domains, such as answering questions about semi-structured data, parsing to regular expressions, and following robot instructions.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Novelty: The paper's approach to interactive language learning and grammar induction may not be entirely new, and the authors could have provided more context and comparison to existing work.\n2. Limited Evaluation: While the authors provide some evaluation metrics, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive evaluation, including comparisons to other systems and more detailed analysis of user interactions.\n3. Scalability: The paper does not address the scalability of the approach, and it is unclear how the system would perform with a larger user base or more complex language patterns.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the scalability of the approach, and what mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the system can handle a larger user base and more complex language patterns?\n2. Can the authors provide more context and comparison to existing work on interactive language learning and grammar induction, and how does their approach differ from or build upon existing research?\n3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in more comprehensive and detailed ways, including comparisons to other systems and more detailed analysis of user interactions?"
