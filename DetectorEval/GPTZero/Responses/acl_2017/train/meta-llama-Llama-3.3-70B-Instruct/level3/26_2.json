            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to knowledge base-based question answering (KB-QA) by proposing a cross-attention based neural network architecture. The authors clearly identify the contributions and novelty of their work, providing a good overview of previous work and performance comparison to related methods. The proposed approach uses TransE to model answer embeddings, integrating prior knowledge on the KB side and improving QA performance.\nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. A cross-attention based neural network architecture that captures different parts of questions and answer aspects, improving the expressiveness of the models.\n2. The use of TransE to model answer embeddings, which integrates prior knowledge on the KB side and improves QA performance.\n3. Experimental results showing that the proposed approach exhibits better behavior than state-of-the-art end-to-end methods, with significant improvements due to the cross-attention mechanism and global information.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in KB-QA tasks.\n2. The use of cross-attention and TransE provides a novel and innovative solution to the problem of retrieving results from a structured KB based on a natural language question.\n3. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, providing a clear comparison with previous work and related methods.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The paper has some minor typos and formatting issues, which can be distracting and affect the overall readability of the paper.\n2. The authors could provide more detailed explanations of the cross-attention mechanism and how it improves the expressiveness of the models.\n3. The paper could benefit from more analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in terms of the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on how the cross-attention mechanism is implemented and how it improves the expressiveness of the models?\n2. How do you plan to address the minor typos and formatting issues in the paper?\n3. Can you provide more analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in terms of the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach?"
