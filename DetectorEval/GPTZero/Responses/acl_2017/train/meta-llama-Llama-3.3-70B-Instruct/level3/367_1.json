The ID-CNN architecture is designed to efficiently aggregate broad context without losing resolution, making it particularly suitable for tasks that require processing entire documents at a time. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ID-CNNs on two benchmark English NER datasets, CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes 5.0, and show that they outperform traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in terms of both accuracy and speed.\nMain Contributions\n1. ID-CNN Architecture: The paper introduces a new architecture for sequence labeling tasks, which uses iterated dilated convolutions to efficiently aggregate broad context without losing resolution.\n2. Speed Improvements: The authors demonstrate that ID-CNNs can achieve significant speed improvements over traditional RNN and CNN architectures, particularly when processing entire documents at a time.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The paper reports state-of-the-art results on two benchmark English NER datasets, CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes 5.0, using ID-CNNs.\nStrengths\n1. Efficient Context Aggregation: The ID-CNN architecture is designed to efficiently aggregate broad context without losing resolution, making it particularly suitable for tasks that require processing entire documents at a time.\n2. Speed Improvements: The authors demonstrate that ID-CNNs can achieve significant speed improvements over traditional RNN and CNN architectures, which is important for many NLP applications.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The paper reports state-of-the-art results on two benchmark English NER datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ID-CNNs for sequence labeling tasks.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Analysis of Linguistic Issues: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of linguistic issues in generation, method of generation, and differences in output from various systems and human-generated references.\n2. Unclear Effectiveness of Crowd-Sourced References: The paper does not clarify the effectiveness of crowd-sourced generated references in language generation applications.\n3. Lack of Linguistic Examples: The paper could benefit from including linguistic examples and descriptions of different systems to provide readers with better intuition and understanding.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the ID-CNN architecture to other NLP tasks with richer structured output, such as parsing?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the linguistic issues in generation and the differences in output from various systems and human-generated references?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the unclear effectiveness of crowd-sourced generated references in language generation applications?"
