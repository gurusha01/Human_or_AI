The clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, which makes it easy to follow and understand.\n2. The comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model, which includes a comparison with six baseline models and an analysis of the results on different datasets.\n3. The novelty of the proposed approach, which combines the strengths of the encoder-decoder model and the copy mechanism to handle keyphrase prediction.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1.
