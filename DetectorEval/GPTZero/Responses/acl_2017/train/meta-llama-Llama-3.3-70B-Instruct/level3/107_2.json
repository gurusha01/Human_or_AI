The authors introduce a variant of Mikolov's proposal for cross-lingual projection, which is used to learn semantic hierarchies via word embeddings. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on a manually labeled test dataset, with an F1-score of 74.20% and a precision-value of 91.60%.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. A novel fusion learning architecture that combines discriminative and generative models for learning semantic hierarchies.\n2. A variant of Mikolov's proposal for cross-lingual projection, which is used to learn semantic hierarchies via word embeddings.\n3. State-of-the-art results on a manually labeled test dataset, with an F1-score of 74.20% and a precision-value of 91.60%.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed fusion learning architecture is able to learn semantic hierarchies more accurately than previous methods, with a significant improvement in precision-value.\n2. The use of word embeddings allows the model to capture semantic relationships between words, which is essential for learning semantic hierarchies.\n3. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method, including a comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods and an analysis of the results.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The authors do not provide enough details about the motivation and parameters employed in their variant of Mikolov's proposal, which makes it difficult to understand the rationale behind their approach.\n2. The evaluation section is too short and does not provide enough discussion and analysis of the results, particularly given the state-of-the-art results obtained.\n3. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how their method can be applied to other languages, which is an important aspect of cross-lingual NER.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more details about the motivation and parameters employed in your variant of Mikolov's proposal?\n2. How do you plan to extend your method to other languages, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of doing so?\n3. Can you provide more discussion and analysis of the results, particularly in terms of the precision-value and recall-value of your method?"
