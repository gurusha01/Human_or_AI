The key contributions of this work include the development of a neural end-to-end solution for computational argumentation mining, outperforming state-of-the-art joint ILP models, and demonstrating the effectiveness of a standard neural sequence tagging model in different environments.\nThe strengths of this submission lie in its thorough related work and evaluation sections, which make the hypothesis stronger. The authors have conducted extensive experiments, and the results are convincing, showing that their approach outperforms existing methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of considering long-range dependencies in argumentation mining, which is a crucial aspect of the problem.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in the submission. The dataset used for training and testing is not clearly described, lacking information on size, time frame, and other relevant details. Furthermore, the paper's results may be impacted by the limited number of reviewers who posted multiple reviews, and a more thorough discussion is needed to address this issue. The writing could also be improved, as there are several typos, grammatical errors, and unclear sentences that need to be revised.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1.
