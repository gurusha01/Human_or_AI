            "inputText": "This paper proposes a neural network approach to tackle the cold-start problem in review spam detection, where traditional features fail due to the lack of prior data from new users. The authors investigate the cold-start problem qualitatively and quantitatively and observe that relying on existing reviewer's textual and behavioral information can help identify review spam. \nThe main contributions of this paper are: \n1. The proposal of a neural end-to-end solution to computational argumentation mining, \n2. The demonstration that several neural approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art joint ILP model, \n3. The finding that a framing of argumentation mining as a token-based dependency parsing problem is ineffective.\nThe strengths of this paper include: \n1. The well-organized and clearly written presentation of an interesting idea of jointly encoding texts and behaviors to tackle the urgent cold-start problem, \n2. The effectiveness of the proposed model as shown in the experiments, \n3. The potential of the proposed approach to contribute to the field of review spam detection.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include: \n1. The lack of comparison with different window widths in the CNN module, \n2. The lack of detailed description of previous work, \n3. The presence of several typos that need to be corrected to improve clarity and readability.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, considering it a good contribution to the field of review spam detection. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above to further improve the paper. \nQuestions to Authors: \n1. Can you provide more details on how you plan to address the cold-start problem in review spam detection using the proposed neural network approach?\n2. How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to handle more complex review spam detection scenarios?\n3. Can you provide more insights on the experimental results, particularly on the comparison with the state-of-the-art joint ILP model?"
