            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to end-to-end neural relation extraction, leveraging global optimization and parser representation techniques. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACE05 and CONLL04 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. The authors provide several analyses to support their claims and offer insights into the system's performance.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACE05 and CONLL04 datasets, outperforming existing methods.\n2. The use of global optimization and parser representation techniques enables the system to effectively extract relations from text.\n3. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the system's performance, including ablation studies and error analysis.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The system's state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets demonstrates its effectiveness and competitiveness with existing methods.\n2. The use of global optimization and parser representation techniques is a novel and interesting approach to relation extraction.\n3. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the system's performance, which helps to understand its strengths and weaknesses.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The approach is incremental and combines existing methods, which may not be entirely novel or innovative.\n2. The improvements in performance are relatively small, with a 1.2 percent point increase on the dev set, and lack significance test results to confirm their validity.\n3. The impact of the recent parser and GloVe word embeddings on relation extraction performance is unclear and requires further explanation.\n4. The authors' approach to handling illegal predictions in the prediction stage is not clearly explained and needs clarification.\n5. The explanation of local optimization in the introduction is misleading and requires correction.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the significance test results to confirm the validity of the improvements in performance?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting, particularly in the E2E agent?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the impact of the recent parser and GloVe word embeddings on relation extraction performance?\n4. How do you handle cases where the user's input is ambiguous or unclear, and how do you plan to improve the system's robustness to such cases?"
