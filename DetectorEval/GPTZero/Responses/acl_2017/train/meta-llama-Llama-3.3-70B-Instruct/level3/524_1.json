            "inputText": "This paper presents an empirical evaluation of several techniques for robust HPSG parsing, with a focus on enhancing coverage when parsing with HPSG grammars. The main contribution of the paper is a thorough comparison of various techniques, including baseline, bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches. The evaluation is based on four datasets, including alchemy45, ws13r, semcor, and wsj00ab, and uses metrics such as coverage, EDM F1 score, and parsing speed.\nThe paper's strengths include its elaborate evaluation data creation and evaluation scheme, as well as its comparison of a range of techniques. The authors have made a significant effort to create datasets that are representative of real-world parsing challenges, and their evaluation methodology is sound. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each technique.\nOne of the primary contributions of the paper is the evaluation of the PCFG-based systems, which are shown to be capable of greatly enhancing the coverage of the ERG while producing analyses of high quality. The hybrid-tb system is also shown to be a promising approach, offering a good balance between coverage and accuracy.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. One of the main limitations is the lack of in-depth analysis beyond overall evaluation results, which limits the understanding of the techniques' performance. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the errors made by each technique, as well as a discussion of the implications of these errors for downstream applications.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest adding more detailed analysis, including representative example sentences and sketches of analyses, to provide clearer insights into the results. Additionally, the authors could consider adding EDM precision and recall figures to Table 2 to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results, particularly in relation to overall and partial coverage.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of HPSG parsing, and the results have important implications for the development of robust parsing systems. With some revisions to address the limitations, the paper has the potential to be even stronger.\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n1. A thorough evaluation of several techniques for robust HPSG parsing, including baseline, bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches.\n2. The creation of four datasets, including alchemy45, ws13r, semcor, and wsj00ab, which are representative of real-world parsing challenges.\n3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of PCFG-based systems in enhancing the coverage of the ERG while producing analyses of high quality.\nThe strengths of the paper are:\n1. Elaborate evaluation data creation and evaluation scheme.\n2. Comparison of a range of techniques, including baseline, bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches.\n3. Detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each technique.\nThe weaknesses of the paper are:\n1. Lack of in-depth analysis beyond overall evaluation results.\n2. Limited discussion of the implications of the errors made by each technique for downstream applications.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more detailed analysis of the errors made by each technique, including representative example sentences and sketches of analyses?\n2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the current evaluation methodology, particularly with regards to the lack of extrinsic evaluation?\n3. Can you discuss the implications of the results for the development of robust parsing systems, and how the techniques evaluated in the paper can be used in practice?"
