The authors use the story cloze task as a case study, where they examine the differences in writing style between original story endings, coherent endings, and incoherent endings. The main contributions of this paper are:\n1. The finding that different writing tasks lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be detected using simple linear classifiers.\n2. The introduction of a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze task, achieving 75.2% accuracy by combining stylistic features with a neural language model.\n3. The provision of insights into the design of NLP tasks, highlighting the importance of careful attention to instructions given to authors and the potential biases inherent in writing tasks.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The innovative approach to analyzing writing style, which sheds light on the cognitive processes involved in writing and the impact of writing tasks on mental state.\n2. The thorough experimentation and evaluation of the proposed approach, including the use of multiple features and models.\n3. The significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art result on the story cloze task, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses:\n1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the features used and their relationship to writing style, as well as a more thorough discussion of the implications of the findings for NLP task design.\n2. The use of a simple linear classifier may not be sufficient to capture the complexities of writing style, and more advanced models may be necessary to fully explore the relationships between writing tasks and style.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to related work in the area of writing style analysis and machine reading comprehension.\nSome questions to the authors include:\n* How do the findings of this paper relate to other work on writing style analysis, and what implications do they have for the design of NLP tasks?\n* Can the proposed approach be extended to other writing tasks and genres, and what are the potential limitations and challenges of doing so?\n* How do the features used in this paper relate to other linguistic and cognitive factors, such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, and what role do these factors play in shaping writing style?"
