            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to translating from morphologically impoverished languages to morphologically rich ones. The authors suggest a two-step process, involving translation into a simplified version of the target language and then inflecting the words based on chosen morphological features. \nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. A uniform fusion architecture for learning semantic hierarchies via word embeddings without any background knowledge.\n2. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset, especially with a good enough precision-value for application.\n3. The fusion learning architecture is language-independent, which can be easily expanded to be suitable for other languages.\nThe strengths of this submission are:\n1. The proposed method achieves a high F1-score of 74.20% on a manually labeled test dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.\n2. The method has a high precision-value of 91.60%, making it suitable for practical applications.\n3. The fusion learning architecture is language-independent, allowing it to be easily expanded to other languages.\nThe weaknesses of this submission are:\n1. The authors only present results for one language pair, which may not be representative of the method's performance on other language pairs.\n2. The authors only report METEOR results and do not provide BLEU or qualitative improvements, which may not provide a complete picture of the method's performance.\n3. The authors overlook person as a linguistic feature, focusing only on gender and number, which may limit the method's applicability to certain languages or domains.\n4. The paper has numerous spelling, grammar, word choice, and style errors that need to be corrected before publication.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide results for more than one language pair to demonstrate the method's applicability to different languages?\n2. Can you provide additional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU or qualitative improvements, to provide a more complete picture of the method's performance?\n3. Can you discuss why person is not considered as a linguistic feature and how this may impact the method's applicability to certain languages or domains?\n4. Can you provide more examples to illustrate the approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in different scenarios?"
