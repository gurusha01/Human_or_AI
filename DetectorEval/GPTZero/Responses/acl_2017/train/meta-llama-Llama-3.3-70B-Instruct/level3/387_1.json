            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection by combining cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns with traditional textual features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. The authors propose a multimodal ensemble of features, automatically learned from text and readers' eye-movement data, to tackle the challenges of semantic and pragmatic subtleties in text.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The introduction provides a good background on the importance of sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, and the challenges associated with these tasks. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work in the field.\nThe proposed CNN architecture is described in detail, and the experiments are well-designed. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features, as well as CNN-based systems that rely on text input alone.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. A novel approach to combining cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns with traditional textual features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.\n2. A CNN framework that automatically learns features from both gaze and textual data.\n3. An evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple published datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing systems.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.\n2. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are convincing.\n3. The paper provides a thorough review of related work in the field.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The results on dataset 2 are not as strong as expected, and the authors acknowledge the possibility of overfitting.\n2. The model's performance on sarcastic utterances in dataset 1 for sentiment analysis is unclear and requires clarification.\n3. The usefulness of eye-movement data for non-sarcastic sentiment classification beyond textual features is not obvious and needs further explanation.\nOverall, this paper presents a solid and novel approach to sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, and the results are promising. Despite some weaknesses, the paper merits publication, and the authors are encouraged to address the raised concerns and further improve their approach.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the model's performance on sarcastic utterances in dataset 1 for sentiment analysis?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting on dataset 2?\n3. Can you provide more insights on the usefulness of eye-movement data for non-sarcastic sentiment classification beyond textual features?"
