            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to creating a natural language interface for performing complex actions, such as analyzing data, manipulating text, and querying databases. The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which allows users to interactively naturalize a core programming language by defining alternative syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones.\nThe paper effectively introduces the task with illustrative examples and highlights its contributions, making it easy to understand the context and purpose of the work. The Related Works section provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art, discussing similarities and differences between related works and the proposed method.\nThe method presentation is clear and well-structured, separating the tagging scheme and the end-to-end model for better understanding. The use of baselines to compare the proposed method with classical triplet extraction methods is a strong point, allowing for a thorough evaluation of the approach. The presentation of examples from the dataset helps to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the methods, complementing the explanation of tagging and evaluation of triplets.\nHowever, the paper's new tagging scheme may not be entirely novel, as similar schemes such as IO, BIO, and BILOU are already in use for NER and RE tasks. Additionally, the dataset description lacks important details, such as the number and type of named entities, which could impact the reproducibility and evaluation of the method. The evaluation criteria for triplets may be incomplete, as they only consider the head of the entity, and it is unclear if the relation role is considered in the evaluation.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a novel interactive language learning process, which allows users to naturalize a core programming language by defining alternative syntax and increasingly complex concepts.\n2. The development of a system called Voxelurn, which implements this process and allows users to interactively build complex structures in a voxel world.\n3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of this approach in creating a natural language interface that strikes a balance between precision and naturalness.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The clear and well-structured presentation of the method and the system.\n2. The use of baselines to compare the proposed method with classical triplet extraction methods.\n3. The presentation of examples from the dataset to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the methods.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The lack of novelty in the tagging scheme, as similar schemes are already in use for NER and RE tasks.\n2. The lack of important details in the dataset description, which could impact the reproducibility and evaluation of the method.\n3. The potential incompleteness of the evaluation criteria for triplets, which may not consider the relation role.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do you plan to address the potential lack of novelty in the tagging scheme, and what are the implications of this for the overall contribution of the paper?\n2. Can you provide more details about the dataset, such as the number and type of named entities, and how this may impact the reproducibility and evaluation of the method?\n3. How do you plan to extend the evaluation criteria for triplets to consider the relation role, and what are the implications of this for the overall effectiveness of the approach?"
