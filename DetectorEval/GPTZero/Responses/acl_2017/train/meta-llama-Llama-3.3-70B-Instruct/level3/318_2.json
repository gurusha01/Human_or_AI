            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to word representation learning (WRL) by incorporating sememe information from HowNet, a linguistic common-sense knowledge base. The key idea is to utilize word sememes to accurately capture the exact meanings of a word within specific contexts. The authors propose three sememe-encoded models, including Simple Sememe Aggregation Model (SSA), Sememe Attention over Context Model (SAC), and Sememe Attention over Target Model (SAT), which learn representations of sememes, senses, and words simultaneously.\nSummary of the paper:\nThe paper introduces the concept of sememes, which are minimum semantic units of word meanings, and explains how they can be used to improve WRL. The authors describe the structure of HowNet, which annotates each concept in Chinese with one or more relevant sememes. They then propose their SE-WRL models, which utilize sememe information to represent various senses of each word and propose Sememe Attention to automatically select appropriate senses in contexts. The authors evaluate their models on word similarity and word analogy tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nMain contributions:\n1. The paper proposes a novel approach to WRL by incorporating sememe information from HowNet.\n2. The authors propose three sememe-encoded models, including SSA, SAC, and SAT, which learn representations of sememes, senses, and words simultaneously.\n3. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed models on word similarity and word analogy tasks and demonstrates the advantages of the Sememe-Encoded WRL models.\nStrengths:\n1. The paper proposes a novel and interesting idea of utilizing sememe information to improve WRL.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their models on two tasks, including word similarity and word analogy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\n3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results and discusses the implications of the findings.\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper's contribution may not be significant enough to warrant a long paper, as the idea of utilizing sememe information is not entirely new.\n2. The comparison with other works is potentially unfair, as it does not consider systems that utilize manually developed resources.\n3. The paper's English needs improvement to enhance understandability, as there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of sememe information being language-specific, and can their approach be applied to other languages?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the hierarchical structure and relations of sememe information in HowNet and how they plan to utilize these annotations for better WRL?\n3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach on other NLP tasks, such as language modeling and neural machine translation?"
