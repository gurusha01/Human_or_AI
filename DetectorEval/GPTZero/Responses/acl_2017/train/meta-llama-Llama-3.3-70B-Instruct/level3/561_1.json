The model may not perform well when there are lots of unknown words in the context of zero pronouns, especially when the unknown words appear near the zero pronoun.\n3. The model may make incorrect decisions when the correct antecedents of zero pronouns are in long distance.\nTo improve this work, the authors could consider the following questions: \n1. How to improve the quality of the pseudo training data to ensure that it is representative of the task-specific data?\n2. How to develop more effective methods to handle unknown words in the context of zero pronouns?\n3. How to modify the model to capture long-distance dependencies and improve its performance on resolving zero pronouns with distant antecedents?"
