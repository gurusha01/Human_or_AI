            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to fine-grained IsA extraction by learning modifier interpretations, which is a crucial task in natural language processing. The authors propose a compositional method that involves interpreting each modifier relative to the head and using these interpretations to identify instances of the class from text. The approach is based on a formal semantics framework that models modification as function application, allowing for the assignment of intrinsic meaning to modifiers and reasoning about them in a truth-theoretic context.\nThe paper's main contributions are the introduction of a compositional method for IsA extraction and the operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on the task of reconstructing Wikipedia category pages, demonstrating a significant increase in coverage and precision compared to baseline methods.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its clear motivation and well-structured presentation. The authors provide a thorough overview of the limitations of existing approaches and clearly explain the benefits of their compositional method. The experimental results are also well-presented, with a detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed method on different evaluation sets.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One of the main concerns is the unclear explanation of certain equations and notation, which makes it difficult to follow in some parts. Additionally, the effectiveness of introducing compositional models in increasing coverage is unclear, and it is suspected that modifier expansion is a major factor in the increase of coverage.\nDespite these weaknesses, the paper presents a solid approach to fine-grained IsA extraction, and the experimental results are promising. The use of a formal semantics framework to model modification is a significant contribution, and the authors' approach to learning modifier interpretations is novel and well-motivated.\nIn terms of contributions, the paper provides the following:\n1. A compositional method for IsA extraction that involves interpreting each modifier relative to the head and using these interpretations to identify instances of the class from text.\n2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP.\n3. A thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on the task of reconstructing Wikipedia category pages, demonstrating a significant increase in coverage and precision compared to baseline methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n1. Clear motivation and well-structured presentation.\n2. Novel approach to fine-grained IsA extraction using a compositional method.\n3. Significant increase in coverage and precision compared to baseline methods.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n1. Unclear explanation of certain equations and notation.\n2. Unclear effectiveness of introducing compositional models in increasing coverage.\n3. Suspected major factor of modifier expansion in the increase of coverage.\nOverall, the paper presents a solid approach to fine-grained IsA extraction, and the experimental results are promising. However, the authors need to address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the clarity and effectiveness of their approach. \nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more clarification on the equations and notation used in the paper?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of unclear effectiveness of introducing compositional models in increasing coverage?\n3. Can you provide more analysis on the role of modifier expansion in the increase of coverage? \nMinor comments:\n1. There is confusion with some notations used in the paper.\n2. The use of area under the ROC curve instead of area under the Precision-Recall curve in the Precision-Recall Analysis paragraph is unclear."
