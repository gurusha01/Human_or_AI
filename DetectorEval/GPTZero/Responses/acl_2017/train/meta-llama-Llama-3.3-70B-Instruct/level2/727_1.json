            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to predicting frames used in political discourse on Twitter, leveraging collective classification and weakly supervised models. The main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors propose a weakly supervised collective classification approach to predict frames used in political discourse on Twitter, (2) they demonstrate that incorporating Twitter behaviors such as similar activity times and similar networks improves F1 score prediction, and (3) they provide a real-world analysis of framing patterns over time.\nThe support for these claims is strong, with the authors providing a thorough evaluation of their approach in both supervised and unsupervised settings. The results show that their approach outperforms a traditional bag-of-words baseline, with an increase in F1 score of 21.52 points in the unsupervised setting. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the framing patterns over time, including an examination of the frames used by aisle-crossing politicians.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they have the potential to be applied to a wide range of domains, including politics in other countries. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in analyzing framing patterns over time, which could be useful in understanding the dynamics of political discourse on social media.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with the authors citing relevant works on framing, collective classification, and weakly supervised learning. The authors also demonstrate a good understanding of the challenges of analyzing political discourse on Twitter, including the need to account for the dynamic nature of the language used.\nThe novelty of the work is significant, as the authors propose a new approach to predicting frames used in political discourse on Twitter. The use of collective classification and weakly supervised models is a unique contribution, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving F1 score prediction.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, with the authors providing a thorough evaluation of their approach and a detailed analysis of the results. The paper could be improved with additional discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.\nStrengths of the paper include:\n1. The authors propose a novel approach to predicting frames used in political discourse on Twitter, leveraging collective classification and weakly supervised models.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach in both supervised and unsupervised settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in improving F1 score prediction.\n3. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the framing patterns over time, including an examination of the frames used by aisle-crossing politicians.\nWeaknesses of the paper include:\n1. The authors could provide more discussion of the limitations of their approach, including the potential for bias in the Twitter data and the challenges of annotating tweets with frames.\n2. The authors could provide more detail on the annotation process, including the guidelines used to annotate the tweets and the inter-annotator agreement.\n3. The authors could provide more discussion of potential avenues for future work, including the application of their approach to other domains and the use of additional features, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more detail on the annotation process, including the guidelines used to annotate the tweets and the inter-annotator agreement?\n2. How do you plan to address the potential for bias in the Twitter data, including the potential for politicians to use Twitter in ways that are not representative of their actual views?\n3. Can you provide more discussion of potential avenues for future work, including the application of your approach to other domains and the use of additional features, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling?"
