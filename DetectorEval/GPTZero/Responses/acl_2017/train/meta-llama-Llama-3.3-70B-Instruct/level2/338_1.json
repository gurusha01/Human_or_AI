            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam in the cold-start problem, where a new reviewer posts only one review and the available information is very poor. The model jointly encodes the textual and behavioral information into review embeddings, which can be used to detect review spam. The authors argue that the textual and behavioral information of a reviewer are correlated with each other and can be used to augment the behavioral information of new reviewers. The model is trained on a large-scale unlabeled review dataset and can learn to represent new reviews with similar textual information and correlated behavioral information.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam in the cold-start problem.\n2. The model jointly encodes the textual and behavioral information into review embeddings, which can be used to detect review spam.\n3. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on two domains (hotel and restaurant) and show that it outperforms traditional linguistic and behavioral features.\nStrengths\n1. The paper addresses a significant problem in review spam detection, which is the cold-start problem.\n2. The proposed model is novel and jointly encodes textual and behavioral information, which is a significant improvement over traditional methods.\n3. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed model on two domains and demonstrate its effectiveness.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper assumes that the textual and behavioral information of a reviewer are correlated with each other, which may not always be the case.\n2. The model requires a large-scale unlabeled review dataset to train, which may not be available in all cases.\n3. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed model, which may be a concern for large-scale datasets.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to handle cases where the textual and behavioral information of a reviewer are not correlated with each other?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed model and how it can be optimized for large-scale datasets?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed model to handle other types of spam detection tasks, such as spam comment detection?"
