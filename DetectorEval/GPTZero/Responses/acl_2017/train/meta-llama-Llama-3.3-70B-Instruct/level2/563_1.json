The authors propose a new relational similarity measure based on the combination of word2vec's CBOW input and output vectors, which outperforms concurrent vector representations when used for unsupervised clustering on SemEval 2010 Relation Classification data.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper introduces a new relational similarity measure, IN-OUT similarities, which combines first-order and second-order similarities between entity pairs.\n2. The authors evaluate the performance of different vector combination methods, including pairwise similarities, analogies, and difference, on a large-scale relation classification task.\n3. The paper provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various vector combination methods, highlighting the importance of considering second-order similarities in capturing relational information.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a thorough evaluation of different vector combination methods, providing a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\n2. The introduction of the IN-OUT similarities measure is a significant contribution, as it outperforms other methods in capturing relational information.\n3. The paper highlights the importance of considering second-order similarities in capturing relational information, which is a valuable insight for future research.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper's focus on unsupervised relation classification may limit the applicability of the results to supervised settings.\n2. The authors acknowledge that the baseline method performs well, but it is not clear how the proposed method would perform in a supervised setting.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the implications of the findings for natural language processing applications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the unsupervised approach, particularly in terms of handling contextual relation instances?\n2. Can the authors provide more insight into the performance of the IN-OUT similarities measure in supervised settings?\n3. How do the authors envision the proposed method being used in real-world natural language processing applications, such as relation extraction or question answering?"
