The authors construct a Singlish dependency treebank with 1,200 sentences and train a parser by integrating English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser. The results show that English knowledge can lead to a 36% relative error reduction, resulting in a parser with around 85% accuracy.\nMain Contributions\n1. Construction of a Singlish dependency treebank: The authors create a treebank with 1,200 sentences, which is a significant resource for the low-resource language of Singlish.\n2. Development of a Singlish parser with neural stacking: The authors propose a neural stacking model that integrates English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser, achieving a significant improvement in parsing accuracy.\n3. Investigation of distributed lexical characteristics: The authors compare the performance of the Singlish parser using different pre-trained word embeddings, demonstrating the distributional differences between Singlish and English tokens.\nStrengths\n1. Novel approach to parsing Singlish: The authors propose a novel approach to parsing Singlish by leveraging English syntactic knowledge, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. High-quality treebank construction: The authors construct a high-quality treebank with careful annotation, which is a valuable resource for future research.\n3. Significant improvement in parsing accuracy: The authors achieve a significant improvement in parsing accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited size of the treebank: The treebank is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the results.\n2. Dependence on English syntactic knowledge: The parser relies heavily on English syntactic knowledge, which may not be optimal for parsing Singlish sentences with unique grammatical structures.\n3. Lack of comparison with other parsing models: The authors do not compare their model with other parsing models, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to expand the treebank to improve the generalizability of the results?\n2. Can you provide more details on the neural stacking model and how it integrates English syntactic knowledge?\n3. How do you plan to address the limitations of relying on English syntactic knowledge for parsing Singlish sentences?"
