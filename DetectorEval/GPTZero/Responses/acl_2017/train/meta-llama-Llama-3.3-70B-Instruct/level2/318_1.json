Sememes are minimum semantic units of word meanings, and the authors argue that they can provide essential semantic regularization for WRL. The paper presents three sememe-encoded models, including Simple Sememe Aggregation Model (SSA), Sememe Attention over Context Model (SAC), and Sememe Attention over Target Model (SAT), which utilize sememe information to learn representations of sememes, senses, and words. The authors evaluate their models on two tasks, word similarity and word analogy, and demonstrate that their models outperform baseline models.\nMain Contributions\n1. Incorporation of sememe information into WRL: The paper proposes a novel approach to WRL by incorporating sememe information from the HowNet knowledge base, which provides essential semantic regularization for WRL.\n2. Sememe-encoded models: The paper presents three sememe-encoded models, including SSA, SAC, and SAT, which utilize sememe information to learn representations of sememes, senses, and words.\n3. Attention-based models for WSD: The paper proposes attention-based models for word sense disambiguation (WSD), which can automatically select appropriate senses for context words according to the target word.\nStrengths\n1. Improved performance on word similarity and word analogy tasks: The paper demonstrates that the proposed models outperform baseline models on word similarity and word analogy tasks.\n2. Effective utilization of sememe information: The paper shows that sememe information can provide essential semantic regularization for WRL and improve the performance of WRL models.\n3. Attention-based models for WSD: The paper proposes attention-based models for WSD, which can automatically select appropriate senses for context words according to the target word.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited evaluation tasks: The paper only evaluates the proposed models on two tasks, word similarity and word analogy, and does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models on other NLP tasks.\n2. Dependence on HowNet knowledge base: The paper relies heavily on the HowNet knowledge base, which may not be available for other languages or domains.\n3. Complexity of the models: The paper proposes complex models, which may be difficult to implement and train, especially for large-scale datasets.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other languages or domains where the HowNet knowledge base is not available?\n2. Can the authors provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed models on other NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or machine translation?\n3. How do the authors plan to simplify the proposed models and reduce their computational complexity, especially for large-scale datasets?"
