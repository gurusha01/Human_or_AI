The authors propose a compositional method for IsA extraction, which involves interpreting each modifier in a class label relative to the head, and using these interpretations to identify instances of the class from text. The method is based on a formal semantics framework, which models modifiers as functions that map between sets of entities. The authors evaluate their approach on the task of reconstructing Wikipedia category pages and demonstrate a significant improvement over a strong baseline relying on widely-used Hearst patterns.\nMain Contributions\n1. A compositional method for IsA extraction, which involves interpreting each modifier in a class label relative to the head.\n2. A formal semantics framework, which models modifiers as functions that map between sets of entities.\n3. An evaluation on the task of reconstructing Wikipedia category pages, demonstrating a significant improvement over a strong baseline.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to IsA extraction, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in handling fine-grained classes.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including a comparison with a strong baseline and an analysis of the results.\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its underlying assumptions.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper assumes that the meaning of a modifier can be captured by a distribution over properties, which may not always be the case.\n2. The authors rely on a large repository of facts extracted from Web documents, which may contain noise and errors.\n3. The evaluation is limited to a single task, and it is unclear how the proposed method would perform on other tasks or datasets.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of noise and errors in the repository of facts extracted from Web documents?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the modifier chunking heuristic used to group together multiword modifiers?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle more complex class labels, such as those with multiple heads or nested modifiers?"
