The proposed model leverages the interaction between content and discourse to yield better prediction performance on both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction. The authors evaluate their model on two meeting corpora, AMI and ICSI, and demonstrate that it outperforms SVM-based classifiers trained with the same feature sets. Additionally, they show that their model can be used to predict the consistency among team members' understanding of their group decisions.\nMain Contributions\n1. Joint Modeling Approach: The paper proposes a joint modeling approach to perform phrase-level content selection and discourse relation prediction in spoken meetings.\n2. Improved Performance: The authors demonstrate that their model outperforms SVM-based classifiers trained with the same feature sets on both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction tasks.\n3. Predicting Consistency of Understanding: The paper shows that classifiers trained with features constructed from the proposed model's predictions can predict the consistency among team members' understanding of their group decisions.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Approach: The joint modeling approach is a novel contribution to the field of spoken meeting analysis.\n2. Improved Performance: The authors demonstrate significant improvements in performance over SVM-based classifiers.\n3. Practical Applications: The proposed model has practical applications in meeting summarization, decision-making, and team collaboration.\nWeaknesses\n1. Complexity: The proposed model is complex and requires significant computational resources.\n2. Limited Data: The authors rely on a limited amount of annotated data, which may not be representative of all spoken meetings.\n3. Error Analysis: The paper could benefit from a more detailed error analysis to identify areas for improvement.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the proposed model and make it more efficient for real-world applications?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the annotation process and the quality of the annotated data?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed model to handle multi-party meetings and more complex discourse structures?"
