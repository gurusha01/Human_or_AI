            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper presents the first parser for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA), a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation. The parser, called TUPA, is a transition-based parser that uses a novel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs to handle the unique properties of UCCA, including reentrancy, discontinuous structures, and non-terminal nodes. The paper evaluates TUPA on the English UCCA corpora and shows that it outperforms a variety of strong baselines, including bilexical graph parsers and tree parsers.\nMain Contributions\n1. TUPA Parser: The paper presents the first parser for UCCA, which is a significant contribution to the field of semantic parsing.\n2. Novel Transition Set: The paper introduces a novel transition set that supports the conjunction of reentrancy, discontinuity, and non-terminal nodes, which is not supported by any existing parser.\n3. Bidirectional LSTM Feature Extractor: The paper uses a bidirectional LSTM feature extractor to represent the input tokens, which is shown to be effective in capturing the semantic relationships between tokens.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Parser: TUPA is shown to be an effective parser for UCCA, outperforming strong baselines in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.\n2. Generalizability: The paper demonstrates the generalizability of TUPA to other semantic parsing tasks, including abstract meaning representation (AMR) parsing.\n3. Robustness: TUPA is shown to be robust to different types of noise and errors in the input data.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Evaluation: The paper only evaluates TUPA on the English UCCA corpora, and it would be beneficial to evaluate it on other languages and datasets.\n2. Complexity: The paper notes that TUPA has a high computational complexity, which may limit its applicability to large-scale datasets.\n3. Lack of Theoretical Analysis: The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of the parser's performance, which would be beneficial in understanding its strengths and limitations.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the limited evaluation of TUPA, and what datasets do you plan to use for future evaluations?\n2. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of TUPA, and how it can be optimized for large-scale datasets?\n3. Do you plan to provide a theoretical analysis of TUPA's performance, and what insights do you expect to gain from such an analysis?"
