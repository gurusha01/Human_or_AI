The model uses a globally optimized beam-search framework and a modular architecture, allowing for pretraining of a key submodule using external data. The authors investigate the effectiveness of various external training sources, including punctuation, automatically segmented text, heterogeneous segmentation data, and POS information. The results show that pretraining the character window network using these sources leads to significant improvements in segmentation accuracy.\nMain Contributions\n1. Modular Neural Word Segmentation Model: The authors propose a modular neural word segmentation model that allows for pretraining of a key submodule using external data.\n2. Rich External Resources for Pretraining: The authors investigate the effectiveness of various external training sources, including punctuation, automatically segmented text, heterogeneous segmentation data, and POS information.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on six different benchmarks, including CTB6, SIGHAN 2005 bakeoff, and Weibo datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Use of External Resources: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of using rich external resources to improve the performance of a neural word segmentation model.\n2. Modular Architecture: The modular architecture of the model allows for easy incorporation of external resources and pretraining of key submodules.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its competitiveness with other state-of-the-art models.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Analysis of External Resources: While the authors investigate the effectiveness of various external training sources, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the contributions of each source to the overall performance of the model.\n2. Lack of Comparison to Other Neural Models: The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of their model to other neural word segmentation models, making it difficult to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the contributions of each external training source to the overall performance of the model?\n2. How does your model compare to other neural word segmentation models in terms of performance and efficiency?\n3. Can you provide more information on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings?"
