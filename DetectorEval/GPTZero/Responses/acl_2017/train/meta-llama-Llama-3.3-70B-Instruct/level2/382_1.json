            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper presents a novel framework for semi-automatically creating linguistically challenging Natural Language Generation (NLG) corpora from existing Knowledge Bases (KBs). The authors apply their framework to DBpedia data and compare the resulting dataset with an existing dataset (Wen et al., 2016). The results show that while the existing dataset is larger, the new dataset is more diverse in terms of input and text, making it a more challenging and useful resource for training NLG models.\nMain Contributions\n1. A novel framework for creating NLG corpora from KBs, which can be used to train KB verbalisers.\n2. A dataset created using this framework, which is more semantically and linguistically diverse than existing datasets.\n3. An evaluation of the dataset using various metrics, including data and text comparison, and neural generation experiments.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a well-motivated and clearly explained framework for creating NLG corpora from KBs.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their dataset, including comparisons with an existing dataset and neural generation experiments.\n3. The results show that the new dataset is more diverse and challenging than existing datasets, making it a valuable resource for the NLG community.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the framework and the dataset.\n2. The neural generation experiments are limited to a single model and dataset, and more experiments would be needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the dataset.\n3. The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in NLG and KBs, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the dataset to include more categories and increase its size?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the crowdsourcing process and the quality control measures used to ensure the accuracy of the dataset?\n3. How do the authors plan to make the dataset available to the research community, and what kind of support will be provided for users?"
