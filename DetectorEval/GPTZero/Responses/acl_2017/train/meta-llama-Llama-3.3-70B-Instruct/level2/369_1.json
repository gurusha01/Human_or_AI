The authors investigate morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between expected gain and generation complexity, and design a new classification architecture based on deep learning techniques. The proposed architecture consists of several layers, including embedding, convolutional, recurrent neural network, sigmoid, and softmax layers. The authors evaluate their approach on a Chinese-Spanish task and achieve significant improvements in translation quality, with an overall translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR.\nMain Contributions\n1. Decoupling machine translation from morphology generation: The authors propose a novel approach to machine translation by decoupling the translation and morphology generation tasks, which allows for better handling of morphology-rich languages like Spanish.\n2. New classification architecture: The authors design a new classification architecture based on deep learning techniques, which achieves state-of-the-art results in morphology generation.\n3. Significant improvements in translation quality: The authors evaluate their approach on a Chinese-Spanish task and achieve significant improvements in translation quality, with an overall translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR.\nStrengths\n1. Effective decoupling of translation and morphology generation: The authors' approach allows for better handling of morphology-rich languages like Spanish, which is a significant challenge in machine translation.\n2. State-of-the-art results in morphology generation: The authors' classification architecture achieves state-of-the-art results in morphology generation, which is a critical component of machine translation.\n3. Significant improvements in translation quality: The authors' approach achieves significant improvements in translation quality, which is a key metric in evaluating machine translation systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited evaluation on a single language pair: The authors' approach is evaluated only on a Chinese-Spanish task, which may not be representative of other language pairs.\n2. Lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art systems: The authors do not compare their approach to other state-of-the-art machine translation systems, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of their results.\n3. Limited analysis of the classification architecture: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the classification architecture, which makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive its performance.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other language pairs, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?\n2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the classification architecture, including the role of each layer and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on performance?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of evaluating their approach on a single language pair, and what other language pairs do they plan to evaluate their approach on in the future?"
