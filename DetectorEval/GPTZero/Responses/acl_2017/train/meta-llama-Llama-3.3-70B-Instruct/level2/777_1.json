The authors design high-quality linguistic patterns to extract users' preferences to various topics from a large collection of tweets. They then formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as a matrix factorization that maps both users and topics into a latent feature space that abstracts users' preferences. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach can predict missing topic preferences of users accurately (80-94%) and that the latent vector representations of topics encode inter-topic preferences.\nMain Contributions\n1. Modeling inter-topic preferences: The paper presents a novel approach for modeling inter-topic preferences of Twitter users, which can be useful for stance detection, public opinion survey, election prediction, and online debate.\n2. Matrix factorization: The authors formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as a matrix factorization, which maps both users and topics into a latent feature space that abstracts users' preferences.\n3. Experimental results: The experimental results demonstrate that the approach can predict missing topic preferences of users accurately (80-94%) and that the latent vector representations of topics encode inter-topic preferences.\nStrengths\n1. Novel approach: The paper presents a novel approach for modeling inter-topic preferences, which can be useful for various applications.\n2. High accuracy: The experimental results demonstrate that the approach can predict missing topic preferences of users accurately (80-94%).\n3. Inter-topic preferences: The latent vector representations of topics encode inter-topic preferences, which can be useful for understanding the relationships between topics.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited dataset: The paper uses a Japanese Twitter corpus, which may not be representative of other languages or cultures.\n2. Linguistic patterns: The design of linguistic patterns may not be optimal, and the authors may need to refine them to improve the accuracy of the approach.\n3. Scalability: The approach may not be scalable to larger datasets or more complex topics, and the authors may need to develop more efficient algorithms to handle these cases.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to extend the approach to other languages or cultures?\n2. Can you provide more details on the design of linguistic patterns and how they can be refined to improve the accuracy of the approach?\n3. How do you plan to address the scalability issue and make the approach more efficient for larger datasets or more complex topics?"
