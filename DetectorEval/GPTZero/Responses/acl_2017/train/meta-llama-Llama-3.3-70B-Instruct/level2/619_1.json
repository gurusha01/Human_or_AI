The corpus consists of three drafts of essays written by college students, with manually aligned sentences and annotated revision purposes. The paper demonstrates the potential applications of the corpus through two studies: one on student revision behavior analysis and another on automatic revision intention prediction.\nMain Contributions\n1. Development of a new corpus: The paper introduces a new corpus of annotated revisions of argumentative essays, which fills a gap in existing corpora for writing comparison research.\n2. Revision analysis framework: The paper proposes a revision analysis framework that categorizes revisions into surface and content-based changes, with finer categories based on argumentative and discourse writing literature.\n3. Applications of the corpus: The paper demonstrates the potential applications of the corpus through two studies, showcasing its usefulness for research in writing comparison and revision analysis.\nStrengths\n1. Novel corpus development: The paper presents a new corpus that addresses a significant gap in existing corpora for writing comparison research.\n2. Comprehensive annotation scheme: The paper proposes a comprehensive annotation scheme that captures various aspects of revisions, including surface and content-based changes.\n3. Demonstrated applications: The paper demonstrates the potential applications of the corpus through two studies, showcasing its usefulness for research in writing comparison and revision analysis.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited scope: The corpus is limited to argumentative essays written by college students, which may not be representative of other types of writing or populations.\n2. Annotation quality: The paper relies on manual annotation, which may be subject to errors or inconsistencies.\n3. Limited evaluation: The paper presents limited evaluation of the corpus and its applications, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the limited scope of the corpus, and what steps will you take to expand it to other types of writing or populations?\n2. What measures will you take to ensure the quality and consistency of the annotations, and how will you evaluate the reliability of the annotations?\n3. How do you plan to further evaluate the effectiveness of the corpus and its applications, and what metrics will you use to measure its impact on writing comparison research?"
