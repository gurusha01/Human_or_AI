The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which allows users to interactively naturalize a core programming language by defining alternative syntax and complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. The system learns from user definitions and induces new grammar rules, enabling the community to evolve the language over time.\nMain Contributions\n1. Naturalization Process: The paper presents a new interactive language learning process, where users can define new constructions and teach the system to understand the language they want to use.\n2. Grammar Induction Algorithm: The authors propose a grammar induction algorithm tailored for the definitions setting, which optimizes a global objective and uses the learned semantic parsing model to choose substitutions.\n3. Voxelurn System: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the naturalization process and grammar induction algorithm in the Voxelurn system, which allows users to build complex voxel structures using a naturalized language.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Naturalization: The paper shows that the naturalization process is effective in creating a more natural and efficient language interface, with 74.7% of the last 10,000 accepted utterances using the naturalized language.\n2. Improved Expressiveness: The system enables users to build higher-level concepts and more complex structures, as demonstrated by the increase in program length relative to utterances over time.\n3. Scalability: The paper demonstrates the scalability of the approach, with 70 workers participating in the final free-building experiment and building 230 structures using 64,075 utterances.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Domain: The paper focuses on a specific domain (voxel world) and may not be directly applicable to other domains.\n2. Dependence on User Definitions: The system relies heavily on user definitions, which may not always be accurate or consistent.\n3. Potential for Overfitting: The grammar induction algorithm may overfit to the user definitions, leading to poor generalization performance.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to extend the naturalization process to other domains, such as natural language processing or robotics?\n2. Can you provide more details on the grammar induction algorithm and how it handles conflicting user definitions?\n3. How do you plan to address the potential issue of overfitting and ensure that the system generalizes well to new, unseen data?"
