The authors introduce three shared-private models to exploit the shared information across different criteria and utilize adversarial training to ensure the shared layer extracts criterion-invariant features.\nMain Contributions:\n1. The paper proposes a novel approach to CWS by exploiting multiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria, which can improve the performance of each criterion.\n2. The authors design three shared-private models to integrate shared knowledge from multiple criteria, including parallel, stacked, and skip-layer architectures.\n3. The paper introduces adversarial training to prevent criterion-specific features from creeping into the shared space, ensuring the shared layer extracts criterion-invariant features.\nStrengths:\n1. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements over single-criterion methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting shared knowledge across multiple criteria.\n2. The authors conduct extensive experiments on eight CWS datasets with heterogeneous segmentation criteria, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.\n3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results, including error analysis and comparison with baseline models, which helps to understand the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper assumes that the shared layer can extract criterion-invariant features, which may not always be the case, especially when the criteria are highly diverse.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which may be important for large-scale applications.\n3. The paper does not explore the potential applications of the proposed approach to other NLP tasks, which may limit its impact and generality.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned shared features and how they relate to the specific criteria?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting in the shared layer, especially when the number of criteria is large?"
