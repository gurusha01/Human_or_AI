            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to relation detection in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems. The authors introduce a hierarchical recurrent neural network enhanced by residual learning, which detects KB relations given an input question. The model uses deep residual bidirectional LSTMs to compare questions and relation names via different hierarchies of abstraction. The authors also propose a simple KBQA system that integrates entity linking and the proposed relation detector to enable one to enhance the other. Experimental results show that the approach achieves outstanding relation detection performance and helps the KBQA system achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on both single-relation and multi-relation QA benchmarks.\nMain Contributions\n1. Improved Relation Detection Model: The authors propose a hierarchical residual BiLSTM (HR-BiLSTM) model for relation detection, which outperforms previous methods on KB relation detection tasks.\n2. Simple KBQA System: The authors propose a simple KBQA system that integrates entity linking and the proposed relation detector, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-relation and multi-relation QA benchmarks.\n3. Hierarchical Matching Approach: The authors introduce a hierarchical matching approach for KB relation detection, which matches the input question to both word-level and relation-level representations to get the final ranking score.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Relation Detection: The proposed HR-BiLSTM model achieves outstanding relation detection performance, outperforming previous methods on KB relation detection tasks.\n2. Improved KBQA System: The proposed KBQA system achieves state-of-the-art results on both single-relation and multi-relation QA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed relation detector.\n3. Simple and Efficient: The proposed KBQA system is simple and efficient, making it easy to build and deploy.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Analysis: The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the proposed model and its components, including the impact of residual learning and hierarchical matching on relation detection performance.\n2. Limited Comparison: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art KBQA systems and relation detection models.\n3. Lack of Error Analysis: The paper could benefit from a more detailed error analysis to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model and KBQA system.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the impact of residual learning on the proposed HR-BiLSTM model, including how it affects the training process and relation detection performance?\n2. How do you plan to extend the proposed KBQA system to handle more complex questions and relation detection tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning and entity disambiguation?\n3. Can you provide more details on the entity linking and constraint detection components of the proposed KBQA system, including how they are implemented and how they affect the overall performance of the system?"
