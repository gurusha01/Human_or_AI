The authors implement both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct a sentiment dimension from a high-dimensional vector space of words. They evaluate their approach on two movie review datasets, comparing the results with a previous unsupervised approach (PMI-IR). The main contributions of this paper are: \n1. Novel approach to sentiment analysis: The authors propose a new method for sentiment analysis using vector space models, which outperforms the existing PMI-IR approach.\n2. Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods: The authors implement both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct a sentiment dimension, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in different settings.\n3. Evaluation on multiple datasets: The authors evaluate their approach on two movie review datasets, providing a comprehensive assessment of their method's performance.\nStrengths\n1. Effective use of vector space models: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of using vector space models for sentiment analysis, particularly in overcoming the problem of data sparsity.\n2. Comparison with existing approach: The authors provide a thorough comparison with the PMI-IR approach, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of their method.\n3. Robustness to data sparsity: The authors show that their approach is robust to data sparsity, a common issue in sentiment analysis.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited improvement over supervised approaches: The authors acknowledge that their approach does not meet the high standards of supervised approaches, leaving room for improvement.\n2. Suboptimal reference vector construction: The authors note that their method for constructing reference vectors may not be optimal, suggesting areas for future improvement.\n3. Dependence on word embedding models: The authors rely on pre-trained word embedding models, which may not always be available or suitable for specific tasks.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the issue of suboptimal reference vector construction in future work?\n2. Can you provide more details on the potential applications of your approach in real-world sentiment analysis tasks?\n3. How do you think your approach can be extended to handle more complex sentiment analysis tasks, such as aspect-based sentiment analysis?"
