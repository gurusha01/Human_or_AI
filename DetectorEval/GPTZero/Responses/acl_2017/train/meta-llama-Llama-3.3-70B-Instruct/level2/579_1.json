            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper presents MinIE, a system for open information extraction (OIE) that minimizes and annotates extractions. The goal of MinIE is to reduce overly-specific extractions while producing informative and accurate results. The system rewrites OIE extractions by identifying and removing parts that are considered overly specific and representing information about polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities with suitable annotations.\nMain Contributions\n1. Minimization of OIE extractions: MinIE proposes a novel approach to minimize OIE extractions by removing overly specific information and annotating the remaining information with polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities.\n2. Annotation of extractions: MinIE introduces a new annotation scheme that provides additional information about the extraction, such as factuality, modality, and attribution.\n3. Experimental evaluation: The paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation of MinIE on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing minimized and annotated extractions with high precision and recall.\nStrengths\n1. Effective minimization: MinIE's minimization approach is effective in reducing overly specific extractions while preserving informative and accurate results.\n2. Improved annotation: MinIE's annotation scheme provides valuable additional information about the extraction, which can be useful for downstream applications.\n3. Competitive performance: MinIE's performance is competitive with state-of-the-art OIE systems, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited handling of nested extractions: MinIE does not handle nested extractions, which can limit its applicability to certain domains.\n2. Error propagation: Errors in dependency parsing and named-entity recognition can propagate to MinIE's output, affecting its accuracy.\n3. Limited evaluation: While the paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation, the evaluation is limited to a few datasets and may not generalize to other domains or applications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to extend MinIE to handle nested extractions, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of doing so?\n2. Can you provide more details on the error analysis and how you plan to address the error propagation issue in future work?\n3. How do you envision MinIE being used in practical applications, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of deploying MinIE in real-world scenarios?"
