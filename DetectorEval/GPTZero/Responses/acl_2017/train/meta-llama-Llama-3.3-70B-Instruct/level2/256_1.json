The model introduces a latent variable to capture discourse-level variations and generates responses using a greedy decoder. The authors also propose a knowledge-guided CVAE (kgCVAE) that incorporates linguistic features to improve performance and interpretability. The models are evaluated on human-human conversation data and show promising results in generating diverse and appropriate responses.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper proposes a novel CVAE-based framework for generating diverse responses in open-domain conversations.\n2. The authors introduce a kgCVAE model that incorporates linguistic features to improve performance and interpretability.\n3. The paper proposes a bag-of-word loss to address the vanishing latent variable problem in training CVAE with RNN decoders.\nStrengths\n1. The paper addresses a significant problem in open-domain conversation models, which is generating dull and generic responses.\n2. The proposed CVAE-based framework is novel and shows promising results in generating diverse responses.\n3. The kgCVAE model provides a way to incorporate linguistic features and improve interpretability.\n4. The bag-of-word loss is a simple yet effective technique to address the vanishing latent variable problem.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper assumes that the dialog context is sufficient to generate diverse responses, which may not always be the case.\n2. The evaluation metrics used in the paper, such as BLEU and cosine distance, may not fully capture the diversity and appropriateness of the generated responses.\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the learned latent space and its relationship to the dialog acts and response lengths.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the kgCVAE model to capture other linguistic phenomena, such as sentiment and named entities?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned latent space and its relationship to the dialog acts and response lengths?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of assuming that the dialog context is sufficient to generate diverse responses?"
