The framework aims to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an English Knowledge Base (KB) if it is linkable. The authors achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods, including generating \"silver-standard\" annotations, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links.\nMain Contributions\n1. Cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework: The authors propose a framework that can extract names from 282 languages and link them to an English KB, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches that focus on a limited number of languages.\n2. Automatic annotation generation: The authors develop a method to generate \"silver-standard\" annotations from Wikipedia markups, which eliminates the need for manual annotations.\n3. Morphology analysis: The authors propose a new method to derive generalizable affixes for morphologically rich languages based on Wikipedia markups, which improves the performance of name tagging and linking.\nStrengths\n1. Large-scale evaluation: The authors evaluate their framework on both Wikipedia articles and external formal and informal texts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach.\n2. State-of-the-art performance: The authors' approach outperforms previous methods on the same data sets for many languages, which shows the superiority of their framework.\n3. Release of resources: The authors release resources for each of the 282 languages, including \"silver-standard\" name tagging and linking annotations, morphology analyzers, and end-to-end name tagging and linking systems, which can benefit the research community.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited evaluation on non-Wikipedia data: Although the authors evaluate their framework on non-Wikipedia data, the number of languages and data sets is limited, which may not fully demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\n2. Dependence on Wikipedia markups: The authors' framework relies heavily on Wikipedia markups, which may not be available or reliable for all languages.\n3. Lack of cross-lingual knowledge transfer: The authors treat all languages independently when training their corresponding name taggers, which may not fully exploit the similarities and relationships between languages.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of relying on Wikipedia markups, which may not be available or reliable for all languages?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on how they plan to exploit cross-lingual knowledge transfer to enhance the quality of extraction and linking in future work?\n3. How do the authors evaluate the quality of the \"silver-standard\" annotations generated from Wikipedia markups, and what are the potential limitations of using these annotations as training data?"
