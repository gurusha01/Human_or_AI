The authors propose a neural sequence-to-sequence model that maps utterances directly to SQL queries, bypassing intermediate meaning representations. The model is deployed online to solicit feedback from real users, and crowd workers are used to provide annotations for incorrect predictions. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on benchmark datasets (GEO880 and ATIS) and a live online experiment for an academic domain.\nMain Contributions\n1. Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Model: The authors propose a novel neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly maps utterances to SQL queries, eliminating the need for intermediate meaning representations.\n2. Data Augmentation Techniques: The paper introduces two data augmentation techniques: schema templates and paraphrasing, which improve the model's performance and reduce annotation effort.\n3. Interactive Learning Approach: The authors demonstrate an interactive learning approach that deploys the model online, solicits user feedback, and uses crowd workers to annotate incorrect predictions, leading to improved parser accuracy over time.\nStrengths\n1. State-of-the-Art Performance: The paper achieves comparable performance to previous state-of-the-art systems on benchmark datasets (GEO880 and ATIS).\n2. Efficient Annotation: The interactive learning approach reduces annotation effort by leveraging user feedback and crowd workers.\n3. Flexibility: The proposed approach can be easily ported to other query languages, such as SPARQL or ElasticSearch.\nWeaknesses\n1. Error Propagation: The paper notes that erroneous user feedback can lead to redundant annotation of correct examples, which may deteriorate model accuracy over time.\n2. Limited Contextual Understanding: The model may struggle with complex queries that require deeper contextual understanding.\n3. Dependence on Crowd Workers: The approach relies on crowd workers for annotation, which may introduce variability in annotation quality.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the issue of erroneous user feedback and its potential impact on model accuracy?\n2. Can you provide more details on the crowdsourcing process and the quality control measures in place to ensure accurate annotations?\n3. How do you envision extending this approach to more complex domains or query languages, and what challenges do you anticipate?"
