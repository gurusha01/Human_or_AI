The authors introduce a framework that automatically extracts cognitive features from gaze data and combines them with textual features to improve classification performance. The proposed CNN architecture consists of two components: a text component and a gaze component, which learn features from text and gaze data, respectively. The authors evaluate their approach on two publicly available datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing systems that rely on handcrafted features or text-only CNNs.\nMain Contributions\n1. Automatic feature extraction: The paper proposes a novel approach to automatically extract cognitive features from gaze data using CNNs, which eliminates the need for manual feature engineering.\n2. Multimodal ensemble: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of combining automatically learned features from text and gaze data to improve sentiment and sarcasm classification performance.\n3. State-of-the-art results: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two publicly available datasets, outperforming existing systems that rely on handcrafted features or text-only CNNs.\nStrengths\n1. Innovative approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection that leverages cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data.\n2. Effective feature extraction: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed CNN architecture in automatically extracting relevant features from gaze data.\n3. Improved performance: The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvements over existing systems, demonstrating the potential of multimodal ensemble methods.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited datasets: The paper evaluates the proposed approach on only two publicly available datasets, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.\n2. Overfitting: The authors mention that the model may be prone to overfitting, particularly on the second dataset, which may require additional regularization techniques.\n3. Limited analysis: The paper provides limited analysis of the learned features and their relationship to linguistic subtleties, which may be an interesting area for future research.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting, particularly on the second dataset?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned features and their relationship to linguistic subtleties?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other NLP tasks, such as emotion analysis or text summarization?"
