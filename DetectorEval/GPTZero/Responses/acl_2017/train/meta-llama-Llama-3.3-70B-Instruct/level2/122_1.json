The NBT model couples Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Dialogue State Tracking (DST) without relying on hand-crafted semantic lexicons, making it more scalable to larger and more complex dialogue domains. The paper evaluates the NBT model on two datasets, DSTC2 and WOZ 2.0, and shows that it matches the performance of state-of-the-art models that use hand-crafted semantic lexicons and outperforms them when such lexicons are not available.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel NBT Framework: The paper proposes a new NBT framework that uses pre-trained word vectors to handle lexical and morphological variation, making it more scalable to larger and more complex dialogue domains.\n2. Coupling SLU and DST: The NBT model couples SLU and DST, which has been shown to improve belief tracking performance, without relying on hand-crafted semantic lexicons.\n3. Evaluation on Two Datasets: The paper evaluates the NBT model on two datasets, DSTC2 and WOZ 2.0, and shows that it matches the performance of state-of-the-art models that use hand-crafted semantic lexicons and outperforms them when such lexicons are not available.\nStrengths\n1. Improved Performance: The NBT model shows improved performance on both datasets, especially on WOZ 2.0, which contains longer sentences and richer vocabulary.\n2. Scalability: The NBT model is more scalable to larger and more complex dialogue domains, as it does not rely on hand-crafted semantic lexicons.\n3. Flexibility: The NBT model can be used with different word vector collections, and the paper shows that semantically specialized word vectors lead to considerable performance gains.\nWeaknesses\n1. Dependence on Word Vectors: The NBT model relies on pre-trained word vectors, which may not always be available or of high quality.\n2. Limited Evaluation: The paper only evaluates the NBT model on two datasets, and more evaluation on other datasets and in different languages is needed to fully assess its performance.\n3. Lack of Comparison to Other Models: The paper only compares the NBT model to a few baseline models, and more comparison to other state-of-the-art models is needed to fully assess its performance.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the dependence on pre-trained word vectors, especially in languages where such resources are limited?\n2. Can the authors provide more evaluation on other datasets and in different languages to fully assess the performance of the NBT model?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the NBT model to multi-domain dialogue systems, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of such an extension?"
