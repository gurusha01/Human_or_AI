            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to sentence-level sentiment classification using linguistically regularized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The authors argue that previous models either rely on expensive phrase-level annotation or fail to fully utilize linguistic resources such as sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. The proposed model addresses these limitations by incorporating linguistic regularizers into a simple sequence LSTM model, which does not require phrase-level annotation.\nMain Contributions\nThe paper claims two main contributions:\n1. The authors propose a linguistically regularized LSTM model that captures the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words in sentence-level sentiment classification.\n2. The model is simple and efficient, yet achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that rely on parsing trees and expensive phrase-level annotation.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a novel approach to incorporating linguistic knowledge into a deep learning model for sentiment classification.\n2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of their model, including ablation studies and visualizations of the sentiment shifting effects of negation and intensity words.\n3. The model achieves competitive performance on two benchmark datasets, Movie Review (MR) and Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST).\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper assumes that the modification scope of negation and intensity words can be ignored, which may not always be the case.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art models that incorporate linguistic knowledge into their architectures.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed model and potential avenues for future research.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the modification scope issue in future work, and what potential solutions do they propose?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the sentiment lexicon used in their experiments, including its size and coverage of sentiment words?\n3. How do the authors think their model could be extended to other languages or domains, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?"
