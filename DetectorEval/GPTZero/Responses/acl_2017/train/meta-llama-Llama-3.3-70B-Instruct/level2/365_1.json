The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed encoder-decoder architecture outperforms existing baselines, (2) multi-task learning with grapheme-to-phoneme mapping as an auxiliary task improves performance, and (3) the multi-task learning architecture learns to focus attention during decoding, similar to attention mechanisms.\nThe support for these claims is strong, with extensive experiments on 44 texts from the Anselm corpus of Early New High German. The results show that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an absolute 2% increase in word accuracy. The use of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms further improves performance, with the best model achieving an average word accuracy of 82.72%.\nThe usefulness of the proposed approach is clear, as it can be applied to a wide range of historical texts and languages. The paper also demonstrates a good understanding of the field, with references to relevant literature and a thorough analysis of the results.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in the application of multi-task learning to historical text normalization and the analysis of the learned attention mechanisms. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, including an analysis of the learned vector representations and the effects of multi-task learning on the model's performance.\nThe strengths of the paper are:\n1. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a challenging task.\n2. The use of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms provides a significant improvement in performance.\n3. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the results, including an analysis of the learned vector representations and the effects of multi-task learning.\nThe weaknesses of the paper are:\n1. The paper assumes that the input texts are tokenized, which may not always be the case for historical texts.\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by the model, which could provide insights into areas for improvement.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches to historical text normalization.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of tokenization in historical texts?\n2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other languages and historical texts?"
