            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to synset induction, a crucial task in natural language processing, using a graph-based method called WATSET. The main claim of the paper is that WATSET outperforms five state-of-the-art graph clustering methods in terms of F-score on four different gold standard datasets for English and Russian.\nThe paper's contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. Novel approach to synset induction: WATSET uses a meta-clustering algorithm that combines word sense induction and graph clustering to induce synsets from an ambiguous graph of synonyms.\n2. Disambiguation of input graph: WATSET's approach to disambiguate the input graph by splitting nodes belonging to several local communities into several nodes, facilitating clustering.\n3. State-of-the-art results: WATSET achieves the best results on two datasets for English and competitive results on two datasets for Russian, outperforming five other graph clustering methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n1. Clear and well-structured presentation: The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the methodology and experiments.\n2. Comprehensive evaluation: The authors evaluate WATSET on multiple datasets and compare it to several state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n3. Novelty and significance: The paper presents a new approach to synset induction, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n1. Dependence on input dictionary: The authors acknowledge that the quality of the results depends on the completeness of the input dictionary of synonyms, which may be a limitation.\n2. Limited analysis of results: While the authors provide some analysis of the results, they could have delved deeper into the reasons behind WATSET's performance and the differences between the datasets.\n3. Lack of discussion on potential applications: The paper could have benefited from a discussion on the potential applications of WATSET and its implications for natural language processing tasks.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of dependence on the input dictionary, and what potential solutions can be explored to enhance the connectivity of the graph?\n2. Can the authors provide more insight into the differences between the datasets and how WATSET's performance varies across them?\n3. What are the potential applications of WATSET, and how can it be integrated into larger natural language processing systems?"
