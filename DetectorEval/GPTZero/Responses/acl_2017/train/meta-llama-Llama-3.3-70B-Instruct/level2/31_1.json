The framework consists of two steps: extracting essential information from raw texts and identifying the factuality of events using a deep neural network. The neural network combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn effective features from syntactic paths and words.\nMain Contributions\n1. The proposal of a two-step supervised framework for identifying event factuality in raw texts.\n2. The utilization of an attention-based CNN to detect source introducing predicates (SIPs), which are crucial for identifying event factuality.\n3. The proposal of an attention-based deep neural network model combining BiLSTM and CNN to identify the factuality of events.\nStrengths\n1. The paper proposes a novel framework that combines BiLSTM and CNN to learn effective features from syntactic paths and words, which improves the performance of event factuality identification.\n2. The attention-based CNN is used to detect SIPs, which is a key factor in identifying event factuality.\n3. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the FactBank dataset.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper relies heavily on the quality of the extracted features, such as SIPs, relevant sources, and cues, which may not always be accurate.\n2. The model may not perform well on datasets with different characteristics or distributions.\n3. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the attention mechanism and its impact on the performance of the model.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to improve the accuracy of the extracted features, such as SIPs, relevant sources, and cues?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the attention mechanism and its impact on the performance of the model?\n3. How do the authors plan to adapt the model to datasets with different characteristics or distributions?"
