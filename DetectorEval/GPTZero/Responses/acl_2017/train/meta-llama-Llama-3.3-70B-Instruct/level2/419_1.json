The authors use a neural encoder-decoder model, which is the state of the art for monolingual paradigm completion, and train it jointly with limited data from a low-resource language and a larger amount of data from a high-resource language. The goal is to leverage the knowledge from the high-resource language to improve performance on the low-resource language.\nMain Contributions\n1. Cross-lingual transfer learning for paradigm completion: The authors propose a method for transferring morphological knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource language, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and edit distance.\n2. Language relatedness and transferability: The authors demonstrate that the degree of language relatedness strongly influences the ability to transfer morphological knowledge, with more closely related languages achieving better results.\n3. Zero-shot and one-shot learning: The authors show that their method enables zero-shot and one-shot learning, where the model can generate inflected forms for a target language with little or no training data.\nStrengths\n1. Effective transfer learning: The authors demonstrate that their method can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource language, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and edit distance.\n2. Robustness to limited training data: The authors show that their method can achieve good results even with limited training data, making it suitable for low-resource languages.\n3. Flexibility: The authors demonstrate that their method can be applied to different language families and scripts, making it a versatile approach for paradigm completion.\nWeaknesses\n1. Dependence on language relatedness: The authors note that the effectiveness of their method depends on the degree of language relatedness, which may limit its applicability to languages with limited relatedness.\n2. Regularization effects: The authors observe that the use of a high-resource language as a regularizer can improve performance, but this effect may not be due to true transfer of morphological knowledge.\n3. Limited analysis of errors: The authors provide some analysis of errors, but a more detailed analysis of the types of errors and their causes could provide further insights into the strengths and limitations of their method.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of language relatedness, and what strategies can be used to improve transferability between languages with limited relatedness?\n2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the errors and their causes, and how do they plan to improve the robustness of their method to different types of errors?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their method to other NLP tasks, and what potential applications do they see for their approach in low-resource languages?"
