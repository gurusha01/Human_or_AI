The authors argue that the current evaluation methods, such as word similarity and analogy tasks, are not sufficient to capture the performance of word embeddings in downstream tasks. They propose to evaluate word embeddings by measuring their performance on simple supervised tasks, such as classification and regression, with varying dataset sizes. The authors also suggest including nonlinear models in the evaluation, as they can capture more complex relationships between words.\nMain Contributions\n1. Data Efficiency: The paper proposes to evaluate word embeddings based on their data efficiency, which is the ability to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of training data.\n2. Simple Supervised Tasks: The authors suggest using simple supervised tasks, such as classification and regression, to evaluate word embeddings, rather than relying solely on intrinsic tasks like word similarity and analogy.\n3. Nonlinear Models: The paper highlights the importance of including nonlinear models in the evaluation, as they can capture more complex relationships between words.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of various word embeddings, including GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText, using the proposed methodology.\n2. New Insights: The authors provide new insights into the performance of word embeddings, such as the importance of data efficiency and the benefits of using nonlinear models.\n3. Practical Implications: The paper has practical implications for NLP practitioners, as it provides a new evaluation methodology that can help them choose the best word embeddings for their specific tasks.\nWeaknesses\n1. Computational Cost: The proposed evaluation methodology can be computationally expensive, especially when using nonlinear models.\n2. Limited Scope: The paper focuses primarily on word embeddings, and does not explore the evaluation of other types of embeddings, such as sentence or document embeddings.\n3. Lack of Theoretical Analysis: While the paper provides some theoretical analysis, it would be beneficial to have a more in-depth analysis of the proposed evaluation methodology.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the computational cost of the proposed evaluation methodology?\n2. Can you provide more details on the theoretical analysis of the proposed methodology?\n3. How do you think the proposed evaluation methodology can be extended to other types of embeddings, such as sentence or document embeddings?"
