            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to building a multi-turn dialogue agent, called KB-InfoBot, which helps users search Knowledge Bases (KBs) without composing complicated queries. The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed Soft-KB lookup method allows the agent to discover better dialogue policies by providing it more information from the language understanding unit, and (2) it enables end-to-end training of both dialogue policy and language understanding in an online setting.\nThe contributions of this work are:\n1. Soft-KB lookup method: The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for querying a KB given the agent's beliefs over its fields, which allows for differentiable and end-to-end trainable dialogue agents.\n2. End-to-end trainable KB-InfoBot: The paper presents an end-to-end trainable KB-InfoBot, which demonstrates a strong learning capacity in simulations but suffers from overfitting when tested on real users.\n3. Evaluation and comparison: The paper evaluates and compares different versions of the KB-InfoBot, including rule-based and reinforcement learning-based agents, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Soft-KB lookup method.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to building a multi-turn dialogue agent, which addresses the limitations of previous systems.\n2. Theoretical foundations: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed Soft-KB lookup method, which is based on probabilistic reasoning and reinforcement learning.\n3. Experimental evaluation: The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, including simulations and human evaluations.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Overfitting: The end-to-end trainable KB-InfoBot suffers from overfitting when tested on real users, which limits its practical applicability.\n2. Limited generalizability: The paper focuses on a specific task (movie search) and a specific type of KB (entity-centric), which may limit the generalizability of the proposed approach to other tasks and KB types.\n3. Lack of comparison to state-of-the-art: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison to state-of-the-art dialogue systems, which makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do you plan to address the overfitting issue in the end-to-end trainable KB-InfoBot?\n2. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the evaluation metrics used in the paper?\n3. How do you envision the proposed approach being applied to other tasks and KB types, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?"
