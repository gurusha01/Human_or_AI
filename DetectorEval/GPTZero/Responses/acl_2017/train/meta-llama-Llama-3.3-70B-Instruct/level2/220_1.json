The authors introduce a new dataset, ReLocaR, for location metonymy resolution and achieve state-of-the-art results on the SemEval 2007 MR task. The paper also discusses the importance of handling metonymy in Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Geographical Parsing (GP) tasks.\nMain Contributions\n1. The introduction of the PreWin method, which extracts a small window of context around the target entity using dependency parsing.\n2. The creation of the ReLocaR dataset, which provides a more balanced distribution of literal and metonymic examples.\n3. The achievement of state-of-the-art results on the SemEval 2007 MR task using a minimalist neural network and the PreWin method.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a novel and effective approach to MR, which achieves state-of-the-art results without relying on extensive external resources or handcrafted features.\n2. The introduction of the ReLocaR dataset provides a valuable resource for the research community and helps to address the issue of data scarcity in MR.\n3. The paper highlights the importance of handling metonymy in NER and GP tasks, which has significant implications for downstream NLP applications.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper's evaluation is limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to see the results on other datasets to confirm the generalizability of the approach.\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by the PreWin method, which could help to identify areas for improvement.\n3. The paper's discussion of the related work is limited, and it would be beneficial to see a more comprehensive review of the existing literature on MR.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of data scarcity in MR, and what steps can be taken to create larger and more diverse datasets?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the errors made by the PreWin method, and how do they plan to improve the approach to address these errors?\n3. How do the authors see the PreWin method being integrated into larger NLP systems, and what are the potential applications of the approach in real-world scenarios?"
