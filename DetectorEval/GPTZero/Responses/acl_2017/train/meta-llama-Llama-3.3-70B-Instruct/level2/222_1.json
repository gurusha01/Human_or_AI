The scheme converts the joint extraction task into a tagging problem, allowing for the use of end-to-end models to extract entities and relations directly. The authors investigate different end-to-end models based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and propose a biased objective function to enhance the association between related entities. The experimental results on a public dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing pipelined and joint learning methods.\nMain Contributions\n1. A novel tagging scheme is proposed to jointly extract entities and relations, which can easily transform the extraction problem into a tagging task.\n2. The authors study different kinds of end-to-end models to settle the problem, including LSTM-CRF, LSTM-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM-Bias.\n3. The proposed method, LSTM-LSTM-Bias, achieves the best results on the public dataset, with a 3% improvement in F1 score over the best existing method.\nStrengths\n1. The proposed tagging scheme is effective in transforming the joint extraction task into a tagging problem, allowing for the use of end-to-end models.\n2. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in jointly extracting entities and relations.\n3. The use of a biased objective function enhances the association between related entities, improving the performance of the model.\nWeaknesses\n1. The method assumes that each entity belongs to only one triplet, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios.\n2. The model may struggle with identifying overlapping relations, which is a limitation of the current approach.\n3. The proposed method requires a large amount of labeled training data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the issue of overlapping relations in future work?\n2. Can you provide more details on the biased objective function and how it enhances the association between related entities?\n3. How do you think the proposed method can be applied to other NLP tasks, such as question answering or text classification?"
