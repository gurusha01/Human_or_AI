The model aims to capture the deep semantic meaning of the text and generate keyphrases that are not present in the text. The authors evaluate their model on six datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting both present and absent keyphrases.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper proposes a novel approach to keyphrase prediction using an encoder-decoder framework with a copy mechanism.\n2. The model is able to generate keyphrases that are not present in the text, which is a challenging task.\n3. The authors evaluate their model on six datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting both present and absent keyphrases.\nStrengths\n1. The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to keyphrase prediction.\n2. The model is able to generate keyphrases that are not present in the text, which is a challenging task.\n3. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their model on six datasets.\n4. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper assumes that the input text is well-formed and does not contain any errors.\n2. The model may not perform well on texts with complex syntax or semantics.\n3. The authors do not provide any analysis of the computational complexity of their model.\n4. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the model and potential future work.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model handle texts with complex syntax or semantics?\n2. Can the model be applied to other types of text, such as books or online reviews?\n3. How does the model compare to other keyphrase prediction models in terms of computational complexity?\n4. What are the potential applications of the model in real-world scenarios?"
