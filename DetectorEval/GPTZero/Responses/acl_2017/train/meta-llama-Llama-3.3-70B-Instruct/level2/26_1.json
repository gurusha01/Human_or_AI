The model dynamically represents questions according to different answer aspects, such as answer entity, answer relation, answer type, and answer context, using a cross-attention mechanism. The model also leverages global knowledge information from the knowledge base to enhance the representation of answers and alleviate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem.\nMain Contributions:\n1. A novel cross-attention based neural network model for KB-QA tasks, which dynamically represents questions according to different answer aspects.\n2. The use of global knowledge information from the knowledge base to enhance the representation of answers and alleviate the OOV problem.\n3. Experimental results on the WebQuestions dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end methods.\nStrengths:\n1. The proposed cross-attention model is able to capture the dynamic representation of questions according to different answer aspects, which is more precise and flexible than traditional fixed representation methods.\n2. The use of global knowledge information from the knowledge base enhances the representation of answers and alleviates the OOV problem, which is a common challenge in KB-QA tasks.\n3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end methods on the WebQuestions dataset.\nWeaknesses:\n1. The proposed model requires a large amount of training data to learn the cross-attention mechanism and the global knowledge information, which may not be available for all KB-QA tasks.\n2. The model may not perform well on complex questions that require multiple hops or reasoning, as it relies on a simple cross-attention mechanism.\n3. The use of global knowledge information may introduce noise or irrelevant information, which may negatively impact the performance of the model.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How does the proposed model handle complex questions that require multiple hops or reasoning?\n2. Can the proposed model be applied to other KB-QA tasks or datasets, such as SimpleQuestions or FreebaseQA?\n3. How does the proposed model compare to other attention-based models or methods that use global knowledge information in KB-QA tasks?"
