The paper is well-written, and the methods are clearly described. The proposed approach is evaluated on standard benchmarks, and comparisons to other state-of-the-art tools are provided, including significance scores.\nWeaknesses:\nSome implementation details and comparisons to other systems require further clarification.\nGeneral Discussion:\n* Major Review:\n - The summaries generated using the proposed method appear to be extractive rather than abstractive, as suggested by the example in Figure 4. A better example should be chosen, and statistics on the number of words in the output sentences not present in the input sentences should be provided for all test sets.\n - The mathematical difference between vectors hi and s is unclear, and it is uncertain whether both are necessary. The authors should consider using only one of them.\n - The neural network library used for implementation is not specified, and there is a lack of implementation details.\n - The training data used for each compared system is not specified, and it is unclear whether the authors trained any of the systems themselves.\n* Minor Review:\n - The difference between abstractive and extractive summarization could be moved to the introduction section for clarity.\n - A reference is needed for the passage describing the success of sequence-to-sequence models in tasks like neural machine translation.\n - The contribution of the work could be emphasized, and the related work section could be moved before the methods section.\n - Figure 1 and Table 1 are redundant, and one of them could be removed.\n - References are needed for passages describing the sequence-to-sequence machine translation model and previous works applying this framework to summarization generation tasks.\n - The term \"MLP\" is not defined in the paper.\n - The sigmoid function and element-wise multiplication are not defined in the formulas in section 3.1.\n - Many elements of the formulas are not defined, including b, W, U, and V.\n - The readout state rt is not depicted in Figure 2.\n - The meaning of \"(ref)\" in Table 2 is unclear.\n - The values of model parameters, such as word embedding size and GRU hidden states, should be explained.\n - A reference is needed for beam search.\n - There are typos, including \"supper script\" instead of \"superscript\" and a potential typo in the true sentence in Figure 4."
