            "inputText": "The paper examines the final sentences of stories in the corpus developed for the story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al. 2016) and proposes a character and word n-gram-based model to classify story endings, demonstrating improved performance on the story cloze task compared to prior work.\nAlthough the analysis of style is an intriguing area and the paper presents better results than previous studies on the story cloze task, several issues need to be addressed. Firstly, the definition of \"style\" is unclear. Additionally, the paper requires restructuring, such as reorganizing the \"Results\" section, which currently combines results and new experiments, and clarification to facilitate reader understanding. The current structure makes it challenging to discern which data is used for each experiment and what data the discussion refers to.\nSeveral key points require further clarification:\n(1) More detailed information about the data used is necessary to support the claim that the writing task imposes different styles on authors (lines 729-732). Specifically, the number of stories, the number of authors, and the distribution of stories per author need to be specified. The post-analysis of coherence only considers pairs of stories written by the same author, where one is judged as \"coherent\" and the other as \"neutral.\" Confirmation of this selection process is needed, as it may justify the claim for \"Experiment 1\" but not for \"Experiment 2,\" where \"original\" vs. \"right\" or \"original\" vs. \"wrong\" comparisons are made without the same authors.\n(2) The paper lacks justification for several statements. For instance, the selection of the \"five frequent\" POS and words is unclear. Are these the most frequent words/POS? The tables provided are puzzling, with two bars in the legend for each category. The choice of character 4-grams is also unexplained. Was this choice tuned on the development set? If these features were not the most frequent but were chosen among frequent POS and words, their selection needs to be justified, especially in relation to \"style.\" It is essential to explain how these features reflect \"style.\"\n(3) The connection between the \"Design of NLP tasks\" section and the rest of the paper, including the results, is unclear. This confusion may stem from the unclear references to \"training\" and \"test\" sets in this context.\n(4) The differentiation between the proposed model and previous work is not well explained. There seems to be a contradiction between the suggestion that real understanding of text is required to solve the task (lines 217-219) and the approach presented.\n(5) The terminology of \"right\" and \"wrong\" endings, adopted from Mostafazadeh et al., is misleading. The meaning of \"right\" or \"wrong\" endings needs clarification, as it could refer to coherence or moral goodness. The exact prompts given to the Turkers should be provided to clarify this point, as the current explanation in the \"Story cloze task\" section (lines 159-177) is unclear.\nAdditional questions and comments include:\n- Table 1: The difference between the \"original\" story and the coherent and incoherent ones is unclear. The process of how Turkers were asked to write endings and the criteria for judging coherence or incoherence need to be detailed. The variability in judgements and whether one Turker judged both \"right\" and \"wrong\" endings, making it a relative judgement, should be explained.\n- Lines 380-383: The meaning of \"We randomly sample 5 original sets\" is unclear.\n- Line 398: The claim of \"Virtually all sentences\" needs quantification.\n- Table 5: The weights of the features should be provided for clarity.\n- Line 614: The phrase \"compared to ending an existing task\" is misleading, as Turkers are not ending a \"task.\"\n- Lines 684-686: The statement about ensuring each pair of endings was written by the same author is accurate for \"right\"/\"wrong\" pairs but not for \"original\"-\"new\" pairs, according to the description provided.\n- Line 694: The reference to \"shorter text spans\" is unclear and needs specification regarding the text in question.\n- Lines 873-875: The publication source of the mentioned information should be provided."
