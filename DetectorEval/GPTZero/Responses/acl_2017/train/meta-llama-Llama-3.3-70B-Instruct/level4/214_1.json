            "inputText": "This paper presents a proposed macro discourse structure scheme, which was tested through a pilot study involving the annotation of a corpus comprising 97 news articles from Chinese treebank 8.0. The authors then developed a model to identify primary-secondary relations and five specific discourse relations (joint, elaboration, sequence, background, cause-result) within this corpus.\nHowever, the paper's writing quality is subpar, making it challenging to follow. I strongly recommend that the authors collaborate with a native English speaker to thoroughly proofread the manuscript. Regarding the content, several concerns arise:\n1. The paper's logic and justifiability are unclear:\n a) The terms \"logical semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\" (lines 115-116) require proper definition for clarity.\n b) The distinction between macro and micro discourse structures is confusing. Figure 4 illustrates the combination of both, but the micro discourse structure in Figure 6 extends beyond paragraph boundaries, capturing discourse relations across paragraphs. This micro-level structure resembles the proposed macro structure in Figure 5 and is genre-independent. It is unclear why the macro discourse structure in Figure 5 is necessary, as it appears to be genre-dependent and does not provide richer information than Figure 6. Furthermore, the absence of sentences 6 and 15 in Figure 5 is puzzling, particularly since sentence 12, also a subtitle, is included.\n2. The corpus construction (section 4) lacks sufficient detail:\n a) Without a detailed example, the meanings of \"discourse topic, lead, abstract, paragraph topics\" (lines 627-629) are unclear.\n b) The authors mention exploring the relationships between micro-structure and macro-structure, but the corresponding section is missing.\n c) Table 4 discusses an agreement study, where the authors claim that achieving high consistency is difficult due to subjective judgments. However, it is unclear what \"leaf nodes\" refer to, whether at the macro-level (paragraphs) or micro-level (EDUs). It would be beneficial to report agreement studies for both levels separately. Moreover, the measurement data seems to be taken from a subset of the data, which may not accurately reflect the overall quality of the corpus.\nOther unclear aspects in section 4 include:\n a) Table 4: The terms \"discourse structure\" and \"discourse relation\" are ambiguous and require clarification.\n b) Table 5: The \"amount of macro discourse relations\" is unclear, particularly since these relations can exist between both sentences and paragraphs, as shown in Figure 6.\n3. The experiments are unconvincing:\n a) The absence of strong baselines undermines the results.\n b) The features used are not clearly described or motivated.\n c) The selection of only a subset of discourse relations from Table 6 for the experiment on discourse relation recognition is unclear.\nIn conclusion, the paper requires significant improvement and is currently not suitable for acceptance."
