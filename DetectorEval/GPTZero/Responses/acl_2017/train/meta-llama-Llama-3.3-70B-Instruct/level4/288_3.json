            "inputText": "Strengths:\n* The manuscript is exceptionally well-crafted, making it a pleasure to read\n* The authors demonstrate the potential of stylometric analysis in enhancing reasoning-like text classification\n* The findings have significant implications for the design of NLP datasets, contributing meaningfully to the field\n* The results are likely to have far-reaching implications for various text classification tasks, underscoring their importance\nWeaknesses:\n* One notable limitation of the paper is the lack of a clear definition of \"style\", a concept central to the authors' argument\n* This omission is the primary weakness in an otherwise robust manuscript\nGeneral Discussion:\nThis paper presents two experiments that investigate the interplay between writing tasks and writing styles, with a particular focus on controlling for vocabulary and topic. The authors leverage features commonly used in authorship attribution and style analysis to differentiate between three types of story endings: a natural conclusion, an ending added by a different author, and a deliberately incoherent ending added by another author.\nThe paper is not only engaging but also merits acceptance due to its clarity and the authors' effective use of simple, well-established features and a straightforward classifier to prove a counterintuitive hypothesis. The intuitive notion that writing tasks significantly influence style is convincingly demonstrated in a controlled setting, yielding impressive findings.\nSection 8 and the accompanying discussion on the implications for NLP task design are particularly noteworthy, suggesting that this paper will be highly influential and widely cited. The authors have done outstanding work.\nOne minor recommendation is to provide an early definition of \"style\" to avoid potential confusion, especially for readers outside the computational stylometrics community. The authors appear to refer to \"style\" as a set of low-level, easily computable lexical and syntactic features. \nThe selection of stylistic features is reasonable, but it would be beneficial to know if other options were considered and why they were not included. A brief discussion on the choice of features would enhance the manuscript's clarity and informative value."
