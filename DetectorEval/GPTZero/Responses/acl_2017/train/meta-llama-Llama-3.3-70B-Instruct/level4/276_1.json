For a contribution claiming novelty and advancement, it is crucial to properly document these improvements by reporting relevant scores alongside novel ones and, ideally, through replication. Given the availability of datasets and previous results, as well as the public accessibility of previous systems, the omission of a thorough comparison is notable.\nThe claim of achieving \"new state-of-the-art results for error detection on both FCE and CoNLL-14 datasets\" requires more substantial evidence, particularly in light of existing reports and studies such as Rei and Yannakoudakis' (2016) work. The assertion that \"The baseline results are comparable to the previous best results on each of these benchmarks\" may misleadingly suggest that the baseline system encompasses all previous contributions, which is not accurate.\n- General Discussion:\nThe treatment of POS tagging seems cursory, and the comparison with Plank et al. (2016) is somewhat unfair given their work's broader scope across multiple languages and its relevance to performance across language families. The paper does not adequately address how the proposed system would perform with multiple languages or in low-resource settings, leaving significant questions unanswered.\nThe concept of integrating language modeling as an auxiliary task is intriguing, and the architecture and initial sections of the paper are commendable. However, there is a noticeable disconnect between these aspects and the experimental sections, suggesting a need for further development.\nTo enhance the paper, it is recommended that the authors provide a more comprehensive and fair treatment of related work, consider replication, and reflect on the system's multilinguality. Given the maturity of the field, as evidenced by the availability of data and systems, the paper should strive to reflect this maturity. With the potential for these improvements to be implemented, the current assessment is borderline."
