            "inputText": "Strengths: The paper presents a valuable modeling contribution and potentially useful annotated data for a crucial problem: event extraction for relationships between countries as expressed in news text.\nWeaknesses: A significant drawback of the paper is that many points are not adequately explained, which hinders a thorough understanding of the work.\nGeneral Discussion:\nThis research addresses an important and intriguing event extraction problem: identifying positive and negative interactions between pairs of countries (or actors affiliated with countries) in news text. The primary contribution lies in the application of supervised, structured neural network models for sentence-level event/relation extraction. Although previous work has explored tasks in this area, the authors' annotation of sentence-level data, included with the submission, is a notable contribution. If released, this data could be beneficial for future researchers in this area.\nThe proposed models, which appear to be an application of various tree-structured recursive neural network models, demonstrate a significant performance increase compared to a broad set of baselines. However, the trustworthiness of these baselines is uncertain due to the lack of detailed explanations. The paper also presents a manual evaluation of the inferred time series from a news corpus, which is a welcome addition.\nThe problem tackled in this paper is excellent, and the application of recursive models seems like a valuable contribution. Unfortunately, many aspects of the models, experimentation, and evaluation are not well-explained, which detracts from the overall quality of the paper. A more carefully written paper could have made this work truly outstanding.\nSome notes:\n- The baselines require more explanation, such as the sentiment lexicon used for the SVM and the specifics of the LSTM classifier. The lack of detail makes it impossible to replicate the results.\n- The supplied code only includes the recursive NN models, not the baselines, which is a limitation.\n- The training process for the recursive NN models is not clearly described.\n- The visualization section is a minor contribution and lacks innovation or significant findings.\n- Several lines in the paper are unclear or require more explanation, such as the definition of non-state verbs, the mapping of CAMEO/TABARI categories to positive and negative entries, and the calculation of precision and recall values.\nLine-by-line comments:\nL97-99: The sentence is unclear and somewhat ungrammatical. It would be helpful to rephrase it to better explain why the problem is difficult.\nL231: The binarization process for the trees is not described.\nFootnote 2: A citation is needed to explain the reference to \"the tensor version.\"\nL314: The definition of non-state verbs and \"event words\" requires more explanation and potentially a reference to previous work.\nFootnote 4: The comment about the collapsed form not working is unclear and requires more context.\nL414: The mapping of CAMEO/TABARI categories to positive and negative entries is not well-explained, and it is unclear whether performance is sensitive to this mapping.\nL400-401: The sentiment lexicon used is not clearly described, and its appropriateness for the task is uncertain.\nL439-440: The statement about failing to find an alpha meeting the requirements for the FT model is unclear and requires more explanation.\nL447, L470: The calculation of precision and recall values is ambiguous and requires clarification.\n5.1 aggregations: The temporal smoothing function used seems ad-hoc and lacks justification. A simpler approach, such as a fixed window average, could have been used.\n5.2 visualizations: The choices made in this section seem arbitrary and lack justification. Related work in 2D spatial visualization of country-country relationships should be discussed.\n5.3: The concept of \"unions of countries\" is not well-defined, and the selection of strong and weak peaks is unclear.\nL680-683: The explanation of judging the polarity of a peak is insufficient and requires more examples or clarification.\nL738-740: The statement about Gerrish and O'Connor et al. having a different purpose and output than the authors' work is incorrect. Both works aim to extract time series and topical keywords, although the authors' work focuses more on the former.\nThe evaluation approach used in this work differs from that of Gerrish and O'Connor et al., who used an external database of country relations (MID). The authors should discuss or justify their evaluation approach, considering the weaknesses of the MID data."
