To train reading comprehension models for relation extraction, they developed a large dataset consisting of 30 million \"querified\" relations by leveraging mechanical turk annotators to convert relations from a schema into natural language queries. They utilized the reading comprehension model proposed by Seo et al. in 2016, with an additional capability to return \"no relation,\" unlike the original model which always returns an answer.

For instance, Neelakantan et al. in 2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06662) performed zero-shot relation extraction using RNNs over knowledge base paths, while Verga et al. in 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05804) conducted relation extraction on unseen entities.

However, they merely note that their data was annotated at the \"relation\" level rather than the triple (relation, entity pair) level, but it is unclear why Bordes et al. could not have done the same.

Given the similarity of the work to existing research, it is essential to cite and establish novelty with respect to at least some of these studies early on, ideally in the introduction, to clarify the differences.\nSecondly, the authors fail to 1) evaluate their model on another dataset or 2) assess any previously published models on their dataset. This significantly weakens their empirical results. Considering the wealth of existing work on the same task and the lack of novelty in this work, the authors need to include experiments that demonstrate their technique outperforms others on this task or show that their dataset is superior to others (e.g., due to its larger size, does it allow for better generalization?)."
