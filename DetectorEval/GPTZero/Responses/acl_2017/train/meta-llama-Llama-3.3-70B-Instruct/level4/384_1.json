OntoLearn Reloaded: A graph-based algorithm for taxonomy induction.\n- The experimental section is underwhelming, as it only compares against \"Hearst patterns\" without considering the aforementioned works.\n- The lack of comprehensive comparisons undermines the paper's ability to demonstrate the practical validity of its theoretical foundations.\nGeneral Discussion:\nThe paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with useful supplementary material. However, it lacks essential references to the is-a relation extraction and taxonomization literature, which is also reflected in the limited scope of the experiments. The comparisons presented are insufficient, neglecting the existence of more recent and relevant systems beyond \"Hearst patterns.\" Although the authors' responses have been considered, and discussions with other reviewers have been taken into account, the paper's experimental poverty and failure to contextualize itself within the broader literature on is-a relation extraction and taxonomy building remain significant concerns. While it is acknowledged that the works cited for comparison primarily focus on taxonomy construction, a more nuanced evaluation considering the edges of a taxonomy could have been undertaken. Given the detailed author response and the discussion with other reviewers, the score can be adjusted to 3, albeit with the caveat that the paper's experimental shortcomings and lack of proper framing within the relevant literature are still notable deficiencies."
