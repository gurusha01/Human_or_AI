The proposed MinOIE approach aims to minimize extractions by removing overly specific portions and turning them into structured annotations. The authors integrate MinOIE with a state-of-the-art OIE system, ClausIE, and evaluate it on two publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing more concise extractions while retaining accuracy.\nHowever, the entirely static and deterministic structure of MinOIE raises concerns about its scalability and novelty. The use of manually engineered rules, although precise, may not be the best strategy for large-scale applications. The paper could benefit from exploring alternative approaches, such as learning minimization rules instead of hard-coding them.\nFurthermore, the authors overlook relevant research on semantically-informed OIE, which augments traditional extractions with links to underlying knowledge bases and sense inventories. This omission is significant, as incorporating entity linking and sense inventories could reduce the need for ad-hoc minimization rules. The experimental evaluation could also be improved by including additional datasets, such as the OIE benchmark by Stanovsky and Dagan (2016), and comparing MinOIE with other OIE systems to assess its flexibility as a post-processing tool.\nOverall, while the paper presents an interesting and well-motivated approach to minimizing extractions in OIE systems, it falls short in terms of novelty and substance due to its reliance on deterministic rules and neglect of relevant literature. With further improvements to the approach and experimental evaluation, this work has the potential to make a more significant contribution to the field of OIE."
