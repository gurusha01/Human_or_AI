            "inputText": "This paper proposes a two-step approach to translating morphologically impoverished languages, such as Chinese, into morphologically rich languages, such as Spanish. The process involves first translating into a simplified version of the target language, followed by the selection of morphological features for each generated target word and subsequent inflection based on those features.\nAlthough the authors' work is limited to a single language pair, the problem they address is a significant and underexplored issue in current machine translation systems. Their approach differs from many modern methods that rely on byte pair encoding and character-level models, instead drawing inspiration from earlier work such as \"Factored Translation Models\" and \"Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages with Synthetic Phrases\", which are unfortunately not cited.\nHowever, the presentation of only METEOR results, without accompanying BLEU scores or qualitative improvements, raises concerns. If BLEU scores do not demonstrate an increase, the authors should provide a justification for the effectiveness of their approach, supported by METEOR results and example sentences.\nFurthermore, the authors focus on handling gender and number, but overlook person, which merits at least a brief discussion. Additionally, the impact of rescoring on gender accuracy is unclear, and it is unclear why the reranker does not simply retain the 1-best result if accuracy is high.\nThe paper also requires significant proofreading, with numerous errors in spelling, grammar, word choice, and style that render it unfit for publication in its current form. A list of identified errors is provided below.\nIn summary, while the content of the paper is promising, it requires revision to address the aforementioned concerns, including the evaluation of multiple language pairs, the presentation of additional evaluation metrics, and thorough proofreading. It is hoped that this work will be revisited in a future conference, with the necessary improvements and expansions.\nError dump:\nLine 062: \"Zhand\" should be \"Zhang\"\nLine 122: \"CFR\" should be \"CRF\"\nThe related work section consistently uses \\cite instead of \\newcite\nThe text contains excessive filler phrases, such as \"it is important to mention that\" and \"it is worth mentioning that\"\nLine 182 and 184: \"The popular phrase-based MT system\" is unclear, referring to either Moses or phrase-based MT systems in general\nLine 191: \"a software\" is an incorrect phrase\nLine 196: \"academic and commercial level\" should be pluralized, and the term \"level\" is unclear\nLine 210: \"a morphology-based simplified target\" is misleading, and \"a morphologically simplified target\" is preferred\nLine 217: \"decide on the morphological simplifications\" is unclear\nTable 1: contains extra spaces and lacks highlighting of differences between lines\nThe simplification process is unclear, and it is unknown whether the simplifier is hand-written or uses an existing tool\nLine 290: \"i.e.\" should be \"e.g.\"\nLine 294: \"train on\" or \"train for\" is preferred\nLine 320: \"our architecture is inspired by\" or \"Collobert's proposal inspires our architecture\" is clearer\nLine 324: a comma is unnecessary\nLine 338: the equation implies that all words share the same word vector W\nLine 422: the system's choice between singular and plural forms is unclear, and the source-side conditioning should be reminded\nLine 445: the graph is a lattice or a \"sausage lattice\"\nLine 499: \"e.g.\" or a similar phrase is necessary\nLine 500: \"syllable\" is misspelled\nLines 500 and 503: examples or further clarification on \"palabras llanas\" and \"palabras estrÃºjulas\" are needed\nLine 570: \"and sentences longer than 50 words\" is unclear\nLine 571: \"by means of zh-seg\" or \"by means of the zh-seg tool\" is preferred\nLine 574: \"and\" may be incorrect, and \"or\" may be more suitable\nLine 596: \"trained for\" is preferred instead of \"trained on\"\nLine 597: \"corpus\" should be \"copora\"\nLine 604: \"size is\" should be \"sizes are\"\nLine 613: the impact of larger embedding sizes on performance is unclear\nLine 615: \"seven and five being the best values\" is unclear\nLine 617: the reason for increasing to 70 is unknown\nTable 3: the parameters listed are hyperparameters, not ordinary model parameters\nLine 650: \"coverage exceeds 99%\" is unclear\nLine 653: \"descending\" is unclear\nLine 666: \"quadratic\" is unclear\nLine 668: a space is needed before \\cites\nLine 676: \"by far\" or \"by a large margin\" is preferred instead of \"by large\"\nLine 716: \"below\" is unclear\nLine 729: \"The standard phrase-based ...\" is unclear\nThe zh-seg citation lists the year as 2016, but the tool was released in 2009."
