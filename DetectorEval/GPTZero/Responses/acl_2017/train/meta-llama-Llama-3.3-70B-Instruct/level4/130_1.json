The authors assert their ability to differentiate between healthy control participants and MCI patients, as stated in lines 141-144, although the conclusion (lines 781-785) tempers this optimism by noting an accuracy range of 60% to 85%, indicating challenges in distinguishing between healthy subjects and those with cognitive impairments. This discrepancy between the introduction and conclusion sparks curiosity, encouraging a deeper examination of the methodology and findings.\nThe dataset comprises 20 healthy patients and 20 control participants, totaling 40 subjects, but is limited by its construction in Portuguese, rendering it inaccessible to non-Portuguese speakers. Enhancing the article with more technological details, such as including an example of a short transcript translated into English and possibly a sample network with embeddings, would significantly improve clarity and accessibility.\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper commences with a detailed introduction and review of relevant literature. However, some references, particularly those providing general NLP background (e.g., Salton 1989 in section 4.2.3) or unrelated topics like sentiment classification and pedestrian detection in images (lines 652-654), could be omitted to focus the review more strictly on the paper's topic. The suggestion is to condense the first five pages, emphasizing technological innovation and including samples of English translations of the narratives, such as those from the ABCD and/or Cinderella datasets.\nThe use of relatively short narratives in Portuguese, especially in the ABCD dataset, raises questions about how word similarities were determined to construct word embeddings. The authors explain generating word-level networks from continuous word representations (lines 272-289) but do not specify the source for learning these representations. Similarly, the use of sub-word level (n-grams) networks to generate word embeddings (lines 513-525) lacks clarity on the training source. It is also unclear whether combining these two network types improves accuracy and what \"out-of-vocabulary words\" (line 516) refer to.\nGeneral Discussion:\nThe study of NLP in discovering cognitive impairments is crucial, making this paper interesting from that perspective. Additionally, its focus on NLP for Portuguese addresses an important gap, given the relatively fewer resources available for this language compared to English. The computation of embeddings for such languages is a noteworthy aspect that deserves more explanation.\nThe text requires revision, including shortening sections 1-3, compressing section 4.1, and adding more experimental details. Clarification on the NURC/SP N. 338 EF and 331 D2 transcription norms would also be beneficial.\nTechnical Comments:\n- Line 029 should read \"\"¦as in a lightweight\"¦\" instead of \"\"¦as it a lightweight\"¦\".\n- Line 188 should be corrected to \"NLP\" from \"PLN\".\n- Line 264 contains repeated words (\"out of cookie out of the cookie\") that need correction.\n- In Table 3, row 2, column 3, \"72,0\" should be formatted as \"72.0\" for consistency.\n- The DOI numbers in lines 995-996 and 1001-1002 are identical, and the link behind the title in lines 992-993 incorrectly points to the next paper in the list."
