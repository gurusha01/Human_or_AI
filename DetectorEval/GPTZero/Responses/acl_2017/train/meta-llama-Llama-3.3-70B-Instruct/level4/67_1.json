            "inputText": "Strengths:\n- The paper addresses a crucial issue in the field of ontology and thesaurus construction.\n- The methodology employed appears to be well-suited and logical.\n- The methods and experimental setups are thoroughly described.\n- The results suggest that the authors' approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art, although some concerns are raised.\nWeaknesses:\nThe primary weaknesses of this paper lie in its evaluation and overall presentation.\n- The baseline methods listed are difficult to comprehend, with some being outdated and lacking justification for their inclusion (e.g., Mpttern).\n- Memb, allegedly the previous state-of-the-art, is mentioned without reference, making it unclear what specific approach is being compared.\n- Although the authors' method seems to outperform the previous best approach, the paper fails to convincingly demonstrate this, particularly on the first dataset where the difference is minimal.\n- The manuscript requires thorough proofreading, as numerous errors were found (e.g., 11 errors in the first column of page 2), and publication cannot proceed until this is addressed.\n- The CilinE hierarchy is relatively shallow, with only 5 levels, which may contribute to the high results obtained, including those from previous studies.\nGeneral Discussion:\nWhile the approach itself may not be highly original, its application to a problem not previously addressed with deep learning makes the paper interesting. However, two significant issues need to be addressed. Firstly, the presentation is marred by numerous errors and typos that must be corrected. Secondly, the evaluation raises concerns, as the technical improvements, although present, are not convincingly demonstrated. Clarification on what Memb refers to (e.g., whether it is the method from Shwartz et al., 2016) and its performance is necessary. The authors should reorganize the evaluation section to clearly list baseline systems, demonstrate the benefits of their approach, and highlight where other methods fail. Additionally, significance tests seem necessary given the slight improvement observed on one dataset."
