            "inputText": "This manuscript presents a novel approach to the lexical substitution task by incorporating word sense inventories into existing methods, utilizing these inventories to filter candidate substitutions. The authors introduce a metric to assess the mutual substitutability of sense inventories, leveraging human judgments for the lexsub task, and empirically evaluate the substitutability of inventories from sources such as WordNet and PPDB. Furthermore, they propose a multi-view clustering approach to automatically generate a sense inventory from PPDB paraphrases, which is then used with a simple WSD technique to filter substitution candidates.\nThe primary strengths of this work include:\n* The innovative idea of combining vector space models and sense inventories for the lexsub task, as these techniques provide complementary information, particularly since vector space models often overlook sense and polysemy.\n* The oracle evaluation provides valuable insights into the potential gain of the proposed approach, demonstrating a significant difference between the unfiltered GAP and the oracle GAP, despite the remaining gap between the oracle and actual scores.\nHowever, several weaknesses are noted:\n* The effectiveness of the multi-view clustering approach is unclear, as the paraphrase similarity view consistently outperforms other views and their combinations, raising questions about the usefulness of the other views. A more detailed analysis of the differences and similarities between these views is necessary to draw solid conclusions.\n* The manuscript lacks clarity, with sections appearing disjointed and lacking clear connections. For instance, the relationship between sections 2.1 and 4.3 is unclear, and the multi-view clustering section requires editing, with subsections appearing out of order and missing citations.\n* The relatively poor performance on nouns is concerning, particularly given the claim that the clustering approach is generalizable to all parts of speech, which is not supported by the results.\nIn general, the manuscript is straightforward in terms of techniques and experiments, and the authors demonstrate clear gains on the lexsub task using their two-pronged approach. However, several questions remain, including:\n* The rationale behind adding hypernyms/hyponyms (lines 221-222).\n* The necessity of symmetry in X^{P} (lines 367-368).\n* The weighting scheme used, which appears arbitrary (lines 387-389).\n* The impact of tuning the number of clusters based on the SubstClus^{P} view on the results and conclusions.\n* The potential generalizability of this approach to other related tasks beyond lexsub."
