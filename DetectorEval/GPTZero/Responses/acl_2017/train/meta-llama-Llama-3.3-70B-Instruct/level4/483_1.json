            "inputText": "Strengths:\nThis research presents a pioneering neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, leveraging a Pointer Network (PN) model with multi-task learning to achieve superior performance compared to previous methods on two datasets.\nWeaknesses:\nThe proposed method essentially applies PN to argumentation mining, with the combination of PN and multi-task learning being the primary novelty. However, this innovation may not be sufficient to warrant a long publication in ACL. Furthermore, the absence of qualitative analysis and error analysis is a significant concern.\nGeneral Discussion:\nIn addition to the aforementioned weaknesses, the motivation for using PN is not adequately justified. Although the authors highlight three characteristics of PN (lines 138-143), these do not provide a compelling reason to prefer PN over bi-directional LSTMs and attention mechanisms. The authors should elaborate on the specific problems addressed by PN and demonstrate how these issues are resolved in the experiments.\nThe visualizations in Figures 2 and 3 are unclear, particularly with regards to the self-link to D1 and the links from D2 to E1 and D3/D4 to E2, which appear to be decoder outputs rather than actual links. Moreover, the decoder LSTM in these figures lacks input from e_j, contrary to Equation (3). In Figure 3, the abbreviation \"FC\" is not defined.\nEquation (8) is unusual, as it calculates the probability of each component type based on the probability of E_i.\nThe experimental design is questionable, as only the \"PN\" model, which is not a joint model, was evaluated on the microtext corpus. It is also unclear whether the BLSTM model was trained with a joint-task objective.\nThe authors should discuss the differences between their work and existing studies on discourse parsing that utilize attention mechanisms.\nMinor issues:\n* Line 128: \"should related\" should be revised to \"should be related\"\n* Line 215: The citation \"(2015)\" is not properly formatted\n* Line 706: \"it able\" should be corrected to \"it is able\"\nAfter considering the authors' responses, I increased my recommendation score. I strongly suggest that the authors provide improved examples demonstrating the benefits of PN, as well as detailed feature ablation analysis."
