The additional analysis presented appears superficial, and the main contribution seems to be the comparison of an Neural NLG (NNLG) baseline's performance on this corpus with that of Wen et al. (2016). However, the significantly higher BLEU scores reported in Wen et al.'s paper raise concerns about the sufficiency of the NNLG baseline for a meaningful comparison.\nGeneral Discussion:\nThe authors should clearly articulate the significance of this paper as a substantial advance over existing work, particularly Perez-Beltrachini et al., and justify the use of the NNLG baseline. Unlike LREC, ACL typically requires new results from a system utilizing the corpus for a main session paper on corpus development methodology. \nTo strengthen the paper, an analysis of syntactic constructions in both corpora would be beneficial, providing a more direct comparison of complexity. The methodology for determining the number of different path shapes should be detailed, ideally in relation to syntactic constructions. \nFurthermore, the authors should acknowledge the limitation of their method in incorporating richer discourse relations, such as Contrast, Consequence, and Background, which are essential in NLG. A comparison with more comprehensive corpora, like those described by Walker et al. (JAIR-2007) and Isard (LREC-2016), would be informative.\nReferences:\nMarilyn Walker, Amanda Stent, FranÃ§ois Mairesse, and Rashmi Prasad. 2007.

However, the advance over Perez-Beltrachini et al. could be more clearly highlighted. The key difference between this dataset and Wen et al.'s lies in content selection, which is crucial. The methodology for constructing the data-to-text dataset seems to involve straightforward crowd-sourcing steps, and any innovative aspects should be emphasized. \nThe rejection of 8.7% of crowd-sourced texts during verification is notable, and examples of rejected texts could provide insight into the quality of the dataset. The main contribution lies in enabling comparisons between the two corpora at both data and text levels. \nRegarding the NNLG baseline, the relative performance difference between the two corpora might disappear with more advanced methods, such as Wen et al.'s. This assumption should be acknowledged, and the comparison remains a useful component of the dataset evaluation. \nThe importance of the dataset, rather than the presence of system results, is the key factor in considering publication in ACL. Finally, the role of domain dependence and the meaning of \"wide coverage\" should be clarified in the final version of the paper, if accepted."
