Your commitment to making the code publicly available is also commendable, as it will significantly benefit the research community.\nAs a result, I have revised my overall score to 4.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n- The manuscript is well-written, making it easy to follow.\n- The experiments conducted are extensive, covering a wide range of scenarios.\n- The results obtained are good, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\nHowever, some weaknesses were noted:\n- The work does not present groundbreaking contributions, largely applying existing technologies.\n- Although you have promised to publish the code, it is currently not available, which would have strengthened the manuscript.\n- The results, while good, are largely as expected and do not offer significant surprises.\nIn the general discussion, it would be beneficial to explore why established audio features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) were not utilized.\nRegarding minor details:\n- In several places, including L155, \"a LSTM\" should be corrected to \"an LSTM\" for grammatical accuracy.\n- The use of hyphens after text in L160, L216, and other locations seems unnecessary and could be removed for clarity.\n- The explanation of convolution provided in L205 could be improved for better understanding.\n- Table 1 is referenced early on page 2 and should be placed accordingly for easier access.\n- On L263, it is questioned whether 3D-CNN is a standard approach in video processing, and alternatives could be discussed.\n- In L375 and L378, the positioning of the caret (^) above \"y\" seems incorrect and should be adjusted.\n- The phrase \"to check overfitting\" in L380 might be better rephrased as \"to avoid overfitting\" for clarity.\n- For L403 and L408, using quotation marks or italics for names would enhance readability.\n- Similar to L155, L420 should be corrected from \"a SVM\" to \"an SVM\".\n- In L448, there is a numeral inconsistency; it should be either \"Outputs\" or the verb should be adjusted to \"is\".\n- A superfluous whitespace after \"layer\" in L489 should be removed.\n- The term \"concatenation\" in L516 and L519 should not be on a new line.\n- It is puzzling why the exact number of persons is unknown, as mentioned in L567.\n- A comma after \"Since\" in L626 is unnecessary and should be removed.\n- The abbreviation \"doesnt\" in L651 should be spelled out as \"does not\".\n- In L777, inserting \"hand, the\" after \"other\" would improve sentence flow.\n- The references section requires cleanup: L823 has superfluous whitespace, L831 should specify the full name of the location instead of just \"Munich\", L860's reference to \"ACL(1)\" is unclear, L888 has an unnecessary closing parenthesis, L894 should be \"Volume\" without unnecessary formatting, L951 has superfluous new lines, and L956's indentation of \"Linguistics\" is improper."
