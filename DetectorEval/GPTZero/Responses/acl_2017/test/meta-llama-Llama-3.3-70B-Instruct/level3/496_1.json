The authors propose a novel approach using grid-type recurrent neural networks (Grid-RNN) to capture multi-predicate interactions in Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis.\nMain Contributions:\n1. The authors introduce a Grid-RNN-based model that effectively captures multi-predicate interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art models without syntactic information.\n2. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the benefits of using Grid-RNNs in PAS analysis, particularly for zero argument identification.\n3. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving the accuracy of PAS analysis, especially for languages with complex morphology like Japanese.\nStrengths:\n1. The paper presents a novel and effective approach to capturing multi-predicate interactions in PAS analysis.\n2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of their approach, including a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art models.\n3. The paper demonstrates the potential of Grid-RNNs in improving the accuracy of PAS analysis, which can be applied to other languages and NLP tasks.\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper lacks a detailed explanation of the character-based encoder, which may limit the generality of the findings.\n2. The analysis could be improved by using languages with more complex morphology, such as Turkish or Finnish, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n3. The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other neural network architectures, which may limit the understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the character-based encoder and its impact on the overall performance of the model?\n2. How do you plan to extend the approach to other languages and NLP tasks, and what challenges do you anticipate?\n3. Can you provide a more detailed comparison with other neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach?"
