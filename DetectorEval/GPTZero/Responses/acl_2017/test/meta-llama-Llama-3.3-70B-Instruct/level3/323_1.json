            "inputText": "This paper proposes a neural sequence model for Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis, which automatically induces effective feature representations from word sequence information of a sentence. The model uses a grid-type recurrent neural network (Grid-RNN) to capture multi-predicate interactions, and achieves state-of-the-art results without syntactic information.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The introduction of a neural sequence model that effectively captures multi-predicate interactions using Grid-RNNs.\n2. The demonstration that the model achieves state-of-the-art results without syntactic information, outperforming previous models that rely on syntactic information.\n3. The improvement of performance for zero argument identification, a problematic issue in Japanese PAS analysis, by considering multi-predicate interactions.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposal of a novel neural architecture that effectively captures multi-predicate interactions, which is a key challenge in Japanese PAS analysis.\n2. The achievement of state-of-the-art results without syntactic information, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n3. The thorough evaluation of the model, including comparisons with previous models and analysis of the results.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The lack of a comprehensive comparison with the existing neural coherence model of Li and Hovy, which is a relevant baseline for this task.\n2. The questionable experimental setup and results, particularly with regards to the low score achieved by the Li and Hovy model.\n3. The need for proofreading to address issues with definite article usage and unclear expressions.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of comparison with the Li and Hovy model, and what are the implications of this omission?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and results, particularly with regards to the low score achieved by the Li and Hovy model?\n3. How do the authors plan to improve the clarity and readability of the paper, particularly with regards to the use of definite articles and unclear expressions?"
