            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis by utilizing grid-type recurrent neural networks (Grid-RNNs) to capture interactions between multiple predicates. The main contributions of this work are: \n1. The introduction of a new prediction model for Japanese SRL tasks by extending the English state-of-the-art model with Grid-RNNs, \n2. The achievement of significantly better performance than the current state-of-the-art system on a well-known benchmark dataset in Japanese SRL, and \n3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of Grid-RNNs in detecting zero arguments.\nThe strengths of this paper include its well-structured and well-motivated content, improved accuracy, and better performance with Grid-RNNs. The use of Grid-RNNs allows the model to capture complex interactions between predicates and arguments, leading to improved performance in PAS analysis.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are that the impact of predicate interactions is smaller than in previous work, and the main contribution is an extension of a single-sequential model to a multi-sequential model, lacking comparison with similar previous work. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the results and more extensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models.\nThe key arguments supporting the acceptance of this submission are: \n1. The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to Japanese PAS analysis, \n2. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the baseline models, and \n3. The use of Grid-RNNs provides a new perspective on capturing complex interactions between predicates and arguments.\nThe key arguments against the acceptance of this submission are: \n1. The impact of predicate interactions is smaller than in previous work, \n2. The paper lacks comparison with similar previous work, and \n3. The analysis of the results could be more detailed and extensive.\nQuestions to the authors include: \n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of smaller impact of predicate interactions compared to previous work? \n2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the results and comparison with other state-of-the-art models? \n3. How do the authors plan to extend this work to other languages and tasks?"
