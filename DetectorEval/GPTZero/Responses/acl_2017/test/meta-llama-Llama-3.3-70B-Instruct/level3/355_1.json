The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the implementation and results, particularly for dropped arguments and zero pronouns.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a neural model using Grid-RNNs to capture multi-predicate interactions without syntactic information.\n2. The demonstration that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on the NAIST Text Corpus 1.5, outperforming previous models that rely on syntactic information.\n3. The improvement of performance for zero argument identification, a problematic issue in Japanese PAS analysis, by considering multi-predicate interactions.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The effective use of Grid-RNNs to model multi-predicate interactions, which is a key challenge in Japanese PAS analysis.\n2. The thorough evaluation of the model on various metrics, including F-measures for different argument types and case roles.\n3. The comparison with previous state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Minor typos and formatting issues, such as the use of boldface in Table 2, which affect the overall readability of the paper.\n2. The lack of explicit examples to illustrate key points, such as the benefits of using Grid-RNNs for multi-predicate interactions.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest:\n1. Providing explicit examples to illustrate key points, such as Figure 6, to help readers understand the benefits of using Grid-RNNs.\n2. Correcting minor typos and formatting issues to improve the overall readability of the paper.\nOverall, I am satisfied with the author's response to my comments and suggestions, and I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Japanese PAS analysis."
