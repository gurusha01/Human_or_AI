The authors argue that the encoding of the meaning of the two events is required for the disambiguation of their causal meaning. They evaluate their system on the AltLex corpus, which contains a large number of causal expressions, and show that their system outperforms the state-of-the-art.\nMain Contributions\n1. Neural Network Architecture: The authors propose a neural network architecture with two inputs, one for the first event and the other for the lexical marker and the second event, which outperforms the state-of-the-art on the AltLex corpus.\n2. Encoding of Context: The authors demonstrate the importance of encoding the context of the relation for the disambiguation of the causal meaning, which is a key contribution to the field of causality classification.\n3. Evaluation on AltLex Corpus: The authors evaluate their system on the AltLex corpus, which is a large and challenging dataset for causality classification, and show that their system achieves state-of-the-art results.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Use of Neural Networks: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in causality classification, which is a complex task that requires the encoding of contextual information.\n2. Improved Performance: The authors show that their system outperforms the state-of-the-art on the AltLex corpus, which is a significant achievement in the field of causality classification.\n3. Robustness to Ambiguity: The authors demonstrate that their system is robust to ambiguity in causal expressions, which is a common challenge in causality classification.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Corpus: The authors only evaluate their system on the AltLex corpus, which may not be representative of all types of causal expressions.\n2. Lack of Interpretability: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the neural network's decisions, which may make it difficult to understand why the system is effective.\n3. Dependence on Word Embeddings: The authors rely on pre-trained word embeddings, which may not capture the nuances of causal expressions.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limited size and scope of the AltLex corpus, and what efforts will they make to create a more comprehensive dataset for causality classification?\n2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the neural network's decisions, and what insights can be gained from this analysis?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their system to handle more complex causal expressions, such as those involving multiple events or nested causal relationships?"
