The model captures long-range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without losing generalization power. The authors present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a target task and learn task-specific high-level features. The evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that the model achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.\nMain Contributions\n1. Neuralization of Entity Grid Models: The paper proposes a neural architecture that neuralizes the popular entity grid models, allowing for the capture of long-range entity transitions and incorporation of entity-specific features without losing generalization power.\n2. Convolutional Architecture: The authors introduce a convolutional architecture to model entity transitions, which enables the model to capture sufficiently long entity transitions without overfitting.\n3. Pairwise Ranking Approach: The paper presents a pairwise ranking approach to train the model on a target task and learn task-specific features, which allows for end-to-end training and improves the model's performance.\nStrengths\n1. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different coherence assessment tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing local coherence.\n2. Flexibility and Generalization: The neural architecture and convolutional approach enable the model to capture long-range entity transitions and incorporate entity-specific features, making it flexible and generalizable to different tasks and datasets.\n3. End-to-End Training: The pairwise ranking approach allows for end-to-end training, which simplifies the training process and improves the model's performance.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Interpretability: The neural architecture and convolutional approach may make it challenging to interpret the model's decisions and understand the underlying factors that contribute to its performance.\n2. Dependence on Hyperparameters: The model's performance may depend on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of filters, window size, and pooling length, which can be time-consuming to tune.\n3. Limited Comparison to Other Models: The paper primarily compares the proposed model to existing entity grid models, and a more comprehensive comparison to other coherence models and neural architectures would be beneficial.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limited interpretability of the model, and what techniques can be used to provide insights into the model's decisions?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model's performance to different hyperparameter settings?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the model to other forms of discourse, such as asynchronous conversations, and what challenges do they anticipate in adapting the model to these new domains?"
