Well-motivated architecture: The authors provide a clear motivation for their hierarchical decoder architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the chunk structure in the target language.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their approach on a single translation task (English-to-Japanese) and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation on other languages or tasks.\n2. Complexity of the model: The authors' hierarchical decoder architecture may be more complex and difficult to train than traditional NMT models.\n3. Lack of comparison to other chunk-based approaches: The authors do not provide a comparison to other chunk-based approaches to NMT, which would be useful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other languages and tasks?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the training process and the hyperparameters used in their experiments?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of their hierarchical decoder architecture and make it more efficient to train?"
