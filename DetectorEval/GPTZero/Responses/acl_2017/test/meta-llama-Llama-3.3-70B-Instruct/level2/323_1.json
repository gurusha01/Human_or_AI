The model captures long-range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without losing generalization power. The authors present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a target task and learn task-specific high-level features. The evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that the model achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.\nMain Contributions\n1. Neural Coherence Model: The paper proposes a neural architecture for coherence assessment that can capture long-range entity transitions along with arbitrary entity-specific features.\n2. Pairwise Ranking Approach: The authors present a pairwise ranking approach to train the model on a target task and learn task-specific features.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different coherence assessment tasks, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Use of Distributed Representation: The model effectively uses distributed representation to capture long-range entity transitions and entity-specific features.\n2. End-to-End Training: The pairwise ranking approach allows for end-to-end training of the model, enabling it to learn task-specific features.\n3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different coherence assessment tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Analysis of Hyperparameters: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the hyperparameters used in the model, which could be useful for understanding the model's behavior.\n2. No Comparison with Other Neural Models: The paper does not compare the proposed model with other neural models for coherence assessment, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n3. Limited Evaluation on Other Tasks: The paper only evaluates the model on three coherence assessment tasks, and it would be useful to evaluate the model on other related tasks to demonstrate its generalizability.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameters used in the model and their impact on the model's performance?\n2. How does the proposed model compare with other neural models for coherence assessment, such as the model proposed by Li and Hovy (2014)?\n3. Can you evaluate the model on other related tasks, such as text summarization or question answering, to demonstrate its generalizability?"
