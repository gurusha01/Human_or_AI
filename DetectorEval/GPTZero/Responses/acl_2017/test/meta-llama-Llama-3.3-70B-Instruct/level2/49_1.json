The main claims of the paper are: (1) chunk information is introduced into NMT to improve translation performance, and (2) a novel hierarchical decoder is devised to model the properties of chunk structure in the encoder-decoder framework.\nThe paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the architecture of the chunk-based decoders and the training procedure. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline models, including the word-based sequence-to-sequence model and the tree-to-sequence model, on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese translation task.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n1. Novel approach: The paper proposes a new approach to NMT that captures the hierarchical structure of sentences using chunk-based decoders.\n2. Clear explanation: The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the architecture of the chunk-based decoders and the training procedure.\n3. Experimental results: The paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese translation task.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n1. Limited evaluation: The paper only evaluates the proposed approach on a single translation task, and it would be beneficial to evaluate it on other tasks and languages.\n2. Comparison to other models: The paper compares the proposed approach to other models, but it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed comparison, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each model.\n3. Lack of theoretical analysis: The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, and it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis of the theoretical foundations of the approach.\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to NMT, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on a specific translation task. However, further evaluation and analysis are needed to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to other languages and translation tasks?\n2. Can you provide a more detailed comparison of the proposed approach to other models, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each model?\n3. How do you plan to address the issue of chunking errors in the training data, and what impact do you think this will have on the performance of the proposed approach?"
