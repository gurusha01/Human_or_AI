The authors investigate how different neural MT systems capture part-of-speech (POS) and morphology through a series of experiments along several parameters, including word-based vs. character-based representations, depth of the encoding layer, the identity of the target language, and encoder vs. decoder representations. The results show that character-based representations are better for learning morphology, especially for low-frequency words, and that lower layers of the neural network are more focused on word structure.\nMain Contributions\n1. Character-based representations are superior for learning morphology: The authors demonstrate that character-based representations outperform word-based representations in learning morphology, especially for low-frequency words.\n2. Lower layers of the neural network are more focused on word structure: The results show that lower layers of the neural network are better at capturing word structure, while higher layers are more focused on word meaning.\n3. Translating into morphologically-poorer languages leads to better source-side representations: The authors find that translating into morphologically-poorer languages leads to better source-side representations, which is partly correlated with BLEU scores.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive analysis: The paper provides a thorough investigation of the representations learned by neural MT models, covering various parameters and languages.\n2. Quantitative evaluation: The authors use a quantitative evaluation method to assess the quality of the representations, which provides a clear and objective measure of the results.\n3. Insights for future development: The paper provides valuable insights for future development of neural MT systems, such as jointly learning translation and morphology.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited scope: The paper focuses on a specific aspect of neural MT models, which may limit its applicability to other areas of natural language processing.\n2. No comparison to other models: The authors do not compare their results to other models or approaches, which makes it difficult to assess the significance of their findings.\n3. No analysis of error types: The paper does not provide an analysis of error types, which could provide further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the results change when using different evaluation metrics, such as accuracy or F1-score, instead of BLEU?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the size of the training data and the hyperparameters used?\n3. How do the results generalize to other languages and domains, and what are the implications for real-world applications?"
