The authors provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the implementation and results, with particular attention to the challenging cases of dropped arguments and zero pronouns prevalent in Japanese. Notably, their multi-sequence model, which considers all predicates in a sentence, yields the best results for these examples. The paper's clarity and detailed writing are significant strengths.\nOne of the minor weaknesses of the paper is the presence of typos that could be corrected to enhance English fluency. Additionally, illustrating the concept of PRED, including context around the \"predicate,\" with an example such as the one from Figure 6 where the accusative marker is included with the verb in the PRED string, could further clarify this point. The use of boldface in Table 2 on page 7 is also not clearly explained.\nRegarding specific corrections, several typos and minor adjustments can be made: on page 1, \"error propagation\" does not require the definite article \"the,\" and \"multi-predicate interactions\" should not be preceded by \"the.\" On page 2, \"As an solution\" should be corrected to \"As a solution,\" and both \"single-sequence model\" and \"multi-sequence model\" should be preceded by the indefinite article \"a.\" The example in Figure 4 on page 3 contains a minor error, where \"She ate a bread\" should be corrected to \"She ate bread.\" On page 4, \"assumes the independence\" should be \"assumed independence,\" and the references to \"the multi-predicate interactions\" and \"the multi-sequence model\" should be adjusted to \"multi-predicate interactions\" and \"a multi-sequence model,\" respectively.
