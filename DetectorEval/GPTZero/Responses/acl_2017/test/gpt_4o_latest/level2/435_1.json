            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the task of causality classification in natural language, proposing a neural network architecture to disambiguate causal meaning between two events. The authors claim that encoding the meaning of the events is essential for causal disambiguation and demonstrate that their approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the AltLex corpus. The primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Neural Network Architecture: The proposal of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based architecture with two configurations (Stated Pair LSTM and Pair LSTM) to encode the causal context between two events.\n2. Empirical Validation: Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed system on the AltLex corpus, achieving improvements in F1 score and accuracy compared to baselines and prior work.\n3. Analysis of Ambiguous Cases: A detailed analysis of challenging linguistic constructions, highlighting the system's ability to generalize beyond lexical markers and syntactic patterns.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a significant gap in causality classification by moving beyond reliance on lexical and syntactic features, which are limited in coverage and flexibility. The use of LSTMs for encoding causal context is a novel and relevant contribution to the field.\n2. Empirical Performance: The proposed system consistently outperforms baselines and the state-of-the-art across multiple configurations, particularly in the \"non bootstrapping\" version of the AltLex corpus. The improvements in F1 score and accuracy are statistically significant.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors evaluate multiple configurations of their architecture, including different padding strategies and optimizers, providing a thorough exploration of the design space.\n4. Insightful Analysis: The paper includes an in-depth analysis of ambiguous cases and examples where the proposed system succeeds while prior methods fail. This strengthens the claim that context encoding is critical for causal disambiguation.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Scope: The paper focuses exclusively on the first subtask of causality classification (causal meaning classification) and does not address the second subtask (causal argument identification). While this is acknowledged, it limits the completeness of the proposed solution.\n2. Corpus Limitations: The reliance on the AltLex corpus, which has known limitations in size and coverage, restricts the generalizability of the results. The authors mention plans to create a new corpus, but this remains future work.\n3. Insufficient Discussion of Limitations: While the paper highlights the strengths of the proposed system, it does not adequately discuss its limitations, such as the potential overfitting to frequent lexical markers or the challenges posed by rare or highly ambiguous expressions.\n4. Comparison with Broader Baselines: The paper compares its approach primarily with the system of Hidey and McKeown (2016) and simple baselines. A broader comparison with other neural architectures (e.g., transformers) or transfer learning approaches could strengthen the evaluation.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed system perform on other datasets or domains beyond the AltLex corpus? Have you considered evaluating on multilingual corpora or other causal relation datasets?\n2. Can the proposed architecture be extended to handle the second subtask of causality classification (causal argument identification)? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. How does the system handle cases where the causal relation is implicit and not signaled by a lexical marker? Are there specific examples where the system fails?\nConclusion\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and effective approach to causality classification, with clear improvements over prior work. While the scope is somewhat limited and the reliance on a single corpus restricts generalizability, the proposed architecture and empirical results are compelling. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and has the potential to inspire further research on causality classification. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses and provide additional clarity on limitations and future directions."
