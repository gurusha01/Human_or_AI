            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces chunk-based decoders for neural machine translation (NMT), addressing the limitations of sequential decoders in modeling long-distance dependencies and handling free word-order languages like Japanese. The proposed approach incorporates a hierarchical structure with a chunk-level decoder to model inter-chunk dependencies and a word-level decoder to handle intra-chunk word order. Three models are presented: (1) a standard chunk-based NMT, (2) an improved model with inter-chunk connections, and (3) a further enhanced model with word-to-chunk feedback. Experimental results on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese translation task demonstrate that the best model (Model 3) outperforms state-of-the-art single NMT models by significant margins in BLEU and RIBES scores. The authors claim two primary contributions: (1) introducing chunk information into NMT for the first time and (2) designing a novel hierarchical decoder to model chunk structures explicitly.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of Approach: The paper presents an innovative approach by incorporating chunk structures into NMT decoders, a significant departure from traditional sequential decoders. This is particularly valuable for free word-order languages, where capturing long-distance dependencies is challenging.\n2. Experimental Validation: The proposed models are rigorously evaluated on a well-established benchmark (WAT '16 English-to-Japanese task). The results show consistent improvements over baseline models, including state-of-the-art tree-to-sequence models, with clear evidence of the effectiveness of chunk-based decoders.\n3. Hierarchical Design: The hierarchical architecture (chunk-level and word-level decoders) is well-motivated and effectively addresses the limitations of sequential decoders. The incremental improvements from Model 1 to Model 3 are clearly demonstrated, with detailed analysis of translation examples.\n4. Practical Relevance: The method has practical implications for improving NMT in languages with complex syntactic structures and free word order, such as Japanese, Korean, and Turkish.\n5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the models, experimental setup, and results. The inclusion of translation examples helps illustrate the qualitative differences between the models.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Scope of Evaluation: The experiments are restricted to English-to-Japanese translation. While the authors mention plans to extend the approach to other languages, the current evaluation does not demonstrate the generalizability of the method to other free word-order languages like Czech or Turkish.\n2. Chunk Dependency on Preprocessing: The chunk-based approach relies on external tools for chunking (e.g., CaboCha), which may introduce errors or limit applicability to languages without robust chunking tools. This dependency is not fully addressed in the paper.\n3. Comparison with Transformer Models: The paper does not compare the proposed models with transformer-based architectures, which are now the dominant paradigm in NMT. While the focus is on RNN-based models, the lack of comparison with transformers limits the relevance of the results in the current NMT landscape.\n4. Scalability and Training Time: The training time for each model (approximately one week on a high-end GPU) raises concerns about scalability. The paper does not discuss whether the hierarchical structure introduces additional computational overhead compared to standard NMT models.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed chunk-based decoder compare with transformer-based models, especially in terms of translation quality and computational efficiency?\n2. Can the chunk-based approach be adapted to languages without robust chunking tools? If so, how would errors in chunking affect the performance of the models?\n3. Have you explored the impact of chunking errors on translation quality, particularly for languages where chunking accuracy is lower than Japanese?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to improving NMT for free word-order languages, the lack of evaluation on other languages and comparison with transformer models limits its broader applicability. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these concerns."
