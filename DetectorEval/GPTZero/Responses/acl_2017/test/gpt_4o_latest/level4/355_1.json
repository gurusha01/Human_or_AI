            "inputText": "- Strengths: \nThis paper introduces an advanced application of Grid-type Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to the task of identifying predicate-argument structures (PAS) in Japanese. The proposed method does not rely on explicit syntactic structures yet surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art (SOA) systems that do incorporate such structures. The authors provide a thorough and well-articulated explanation of their implementation and results. Notably, they focus on the challenging issue of dropped arguments, or zero pronouns, which are common in Japanese and pose significant difficulties for PAS tasks. Their multi-sequence model, which considers all predicates within a sentence, achieves superior performance on these challenging cases. Overall, the paper is comprehensive and clearly written. \n- Weaknesses: \nMy comments are largely minor. There are a few typographical errors listed below, and addressing these would enhance the fluency of the paper. Additionally, it would be helpful to illustrate the point about the PRED string including context around the \"predicate\" using the example from Figure 6, where the accusative marker is incorporated with the verb in the PRED string. Lastly, the use of boldface in Table 2 (page 7) is unclear and could benefit from clarification. \n- General Discussion: \nTypos: \n- Page 1: \"error propagation\" does not require \"the,\" nor does \"multi-predicate interactions.\" \n- Page 2: \"As an solution\" \"As a solution,\" \"single-sequence model\" \"a single-sequence model,\" \"multi-sequence model\" \"a multi-sequence model.\" \n- Page 3: Example in Figure 4: \"She ate a bread\" \"She ate bread.\" \n- Page 4: \"assumes the independence\" \"assumed independence,\" \"the multi-predicate interactions\" \"multi-predicate interactions,\" \"the multi-sequence model\" \"a multi-sequence model.\" \n- Page 7: \"the residual connections\" \"residual connections,\" \"the multi-predicate interactions\" \"multi-predicate interactions\" (appears twice). \n- Page 8: \"NAIST Text Corpus\" \"the NAIST Text Corpus,\" \"the state-of-the-art result\" \"state-of-the-art results.\" \nI have reviewed the authors' response and find it satisfactory."
