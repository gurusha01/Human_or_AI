The proposed approach incorporates chunk structures into the decoding process by introducing a hierarchical architecture consisting of a chunk-level decoder and a word-level decoder. Three models are presented: (1) a baseline chunk-based decoder, (2) an enhanced version with inter-chunk connections, and (3) a further improved model with word-to-chunk feedback. Experimental results on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese translation task demonstrate that the proposed models outperform existing single NMT models, including tree-to-sequence and character-based approaches.\nMain Contributions \n1. Chunk-based Decoding Framework: The paper introduces a novel hierarchical decoder architecture that explicitly models the chunk structure in the target language. This is a significant contribution as it addresses long-distance dependencies and word order flexibility, which are critical for free word-order languages. \n2. Improved Translation Performance: The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese translation task, outperforming previous single NMT models by up to +4.68 BLEU and +3.31 RIBES scores. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the chunk-based approach. \n3. Hierarchical RNN Design: The feedback mechanism in Model 3, which allows information flow between the word-level and chunk-level decoders, is an innovative design that enhances memory capacity and reduces errors in chunk generation.\nStrengths \n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses an important gap in NMT by focusing on the structure of the target language, a relatively underexplored area compared to source-side structural modeling. \n2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are robust, showing consistent improvements across multiple metrics (BLEU and RIBES) and providing qualitative examples that highlight the advantages of the proposed models. \n3. Scalability and Practicality: By using standard preprocessing tools and avoiding reliance on additional syntactic parsing during inference, the approach is practical and scalable to other languages. \n4. Clear Comparisons: The paper provides thorough comparisons with baseline models, including tree-to-sequence and character-based NMT, effectively situating its contributions within the broader NMT landscape. \n5. Potential for Generalization: The authors outline future directions, including applying the method to other languages and combining it with advanced encoders, which enhances the paper's impact and relevance.\nWeaknesses \n1. Limited Language Scope: While the method is evaluated on Japanese, the paper does not provide results for other free word-order languages like Turkish or German, limiting the generalizability of the findings. \n2. Chunking Dependency: The approach relies on high-quality chunking tools, which may not be available or accurate for all languages, potentially limiting its applicability. \n3. Computational Complexity: While the hierarchical design is innovative, the paper does not discuss the computational overhead introduced by the chunk-level and word-level decoders, which could be a concern for large-scale applications. \n4. Ablation Studies: The paper lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components (e.g., inter-chunk connections vs. word-to-chunk feedback) beyond the qualitative examples provided.\nQuestions to Authors \n1. Have you evaluated the computational efficiency of the proposed models compared to standard NMT architectures? \n2. How does the performance of the chunk-based decoder vary when applied to other free word-order languages like Turkish or German? \n3. Can the proposed approach handle noisy or low-resource chunking tools effectively? \nAdditional Comments \nThe paper is well-written and provides a compelling case for incorporating chunk structures into NMT. Addressing the above weaknesses and questions could further strengthen its contributions and applicability."
