            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper investigates the representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models, focusing on their ability to capture word structure and morphology. It evaluates these representations through extrinsic tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) and morphological tagging across multiple languages with varying morphological richness. The authors analyze the impact of factors such as word-based vs. character-based representations, encoder depth, the identity of the target language, and the division of labor between encoder and decoder. The study provides a quantitative, data-driven evaluation of NMT models, shedding light on how these systems encode linguistic features.\nMain Contributions\n1. Character-based Representations for Morphology: The paper demonstrates that character-based representations significantly outperform word-based representations for learning morphology, particularly for low-frequency and out-of-vocabulary words. This is a key insight for improving NMT systems in morphologically-rich languages.\n2. Layer-wise Analysis of Encoders: The study reveals that lower layers of the encoder are better at capturing word structure, while higher layers focus on word meaning. This finding provides a nuanced understanding of the hierarchical nature of NMT representations.\n3. Impact of Target Language on Source Representations: The paper shows that translating into morphologically-poorer languages leads to better source-side representations, highlighting an intriguing relationship between translation difficulty and representation quality.\n4. Decoder Representations and Attention Mechanism: The analysis indicates that the decoder learns impoverished representations of word structure, with the attention mechanism playing a significant role in shifting the burden of representation learning to the encoder.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper provides a thorough and systematic evaluation of NMT representations across multiple languages, tasks, and architectural configurations. This breadth of analysis strengthens the generalizability of the findings.\n2. Novel Insights into NMT Architectures: The study offers valuable insights into the division of labor between encoder and decoder, the role of attention, and the impact of target language morphology, which are underexplored areas in NMT research.\n3. Practical Implications: The findings have clear implications for improving NMT systems, such as emphasizing character-based representations for morphologically-rich languages and optimizing encoder depth for specific linguistic tasks.\n4. Rigorous Methodology: The use of quantitative metrics (e.g., POS and morphological tagging accuracy) and controlled experiments (e.g., varying target languages while keeping source data constant) ensures the validity of the results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Decoder Analysis: While the paper highlights the impoverished nature of decoder representations, it does not explore potential solutions or alternative architectures that might improve decoder learning.\n2. Focus on Morphology: The study primarily focuses on morphological and syntactic features, leaving semantic aspects (e.g., semantic parsing or meaning representation) largely unexplored. This limits the scope of the findings.\n3. Evaluation on BLEU Scores: The reliance on BLEU scores as a proxy for translation quality may not fully capture the nuanced relationship between representation quality and translation performance.\n4. Generalization to Other Architectures: The experiments are limited to LSTM-based models with attention. It is unclear how the findings generalize to more modern architectures, such as Transformer-based models.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered analyzing semantic tasks (e.g., semantic role labeling) to evaluate the representations learned by NMT models?\n2. Could the impoverished decoder representations be mitigated by alternative architectures, such as explicitly modeling morphology in the decoder?\n3. How do the findings generalize to Transformer-based NMT models, which are now the dominant architecture in the field?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper provides valuable insights into the inner workings of NMT models and their ability to learn linguistic features. However, extending the analysis to modern architectures and semantic tasks would make the findings more broadly applicable. Overall, this is a strong submission with significant contributions to the field."
