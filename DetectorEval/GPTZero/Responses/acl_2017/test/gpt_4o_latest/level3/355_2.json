The authors extend the model with Grid-RNNs to capture interactions between arguments of multiple predicates, addressing a key challenge in Japanese Predicate Argument Structure (PAS) analysis窶配ero argument detection. The proposed models are evaluated on the NAIST Text Corpus, achieving significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, particularly in zero argument identification. The paper's primary contributions are:\n1. Grid-RNN-based Multi-Predicate Interaction Modeling: The use of Grid-RNNs to capture multi-predicate interactions is a novel extension that improves zero argument detection, a critical issue in Japanese PAS analysis.\n2. Syntactic-Independent Neural Architecture: The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art performance without relying on syntactic information, mitigating error propagation from syntactic parsers.\n3. Empirical Performance Gains: The models demonstrate significant improvements over prior work, particularly in zero argument detection, which is a challenging aspect of Japanese SRL.\nStrengths\n1. Significant Performance Improvement: The proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art (Ouchi et al., 2015) on the NAIST Text Corpus, with notable gains in zero argument detection. This highlights the effectiveness of the Grid-RNN architecture in capturing multi-predicate interactions.\n2. Well-Motivated and Structured: The paper is well-organized, with a clear problem statement, detailed methodology, and comprehensive experiments. The motivation to address error propagation from syntactic parsers is compelling.\n3. Focus on Zero Argument Detection: The emphasis on zero argument detection, a key challenge in Japanese PAS analysis, is a strong contribution. The results demonstrate that the Grid-RNN model effectively captures long-distance dependencies, which are critical for this task.\n4. Ablation and Comparative Analysis: The experiments include comparisons with baseline models and an analysis of network depth, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Contribution of Predicate Interactions: While the Grid-RNN model captures multi-predicate interactions, the improvement over single-sequence models is relatively small (e.g., 81.42% vs. 81.15% in F-measure). This diminishes the impact of the multi-predicate interaction modeling compared to prior work (Ouchi et al., 2015).\n2. Missing Comparison with Shibata et al. (2016): The paper does not compare its results with Shibata et al. (2016), which extends Ouchi et al.'s model using neural networks. Including this comparison would strengthen the claim of achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n3. Lack of Multilingual Evaluation: While the authors mention the applicability of their model to multilingual SRL, no experiments are conducted to validate this claim. This limits the generalizability of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a direct comparison with Shibata et al. (2016) to clarify how your model performs relative to their neural extension of Ouchi et al.'s work?\n2. The contribution of multi-predicate interactions appears modest. Could you elaborate on why this improvement is smaller compared to prior work, and whether additional architectural changes could enhance this aspect?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a well-executed study with significant contributions to Japanese SRL, particularly in zero argument detection. While the lack of comparison with Shibata et al. (2016) and the modest gains in multi-predicate interaction modeling are limitations, the overall contributions and empirical results justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the missing comparison and further clarify the impact of multi-predicate interactions."
