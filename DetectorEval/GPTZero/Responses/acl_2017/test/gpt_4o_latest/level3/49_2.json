            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary\nThis paper introduces a novel chunk-level architecture for neural machine translation (NMT) models, addressing the challenges of long-distance dependencies and free word-order languages. The authors propose three hierarchical models that incorporate word-chunk correlations on the target side: (1) a standard chunk-based NMT model, (2) an enhanced model with inter-chunk connections, and (3) a further improved model with word-to-chunk feedback. The architecture separates chunk-level and word-level decoding, enabling a more structured and efficient translation process. Experimental results on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese task demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models, with the best model achieving state-of-the-art performance.\nContributions\n1. Novel Chunk-Based Decoder Architecture: The paper introduces a hierarchical decoder that explicitly models chunk structures in target sentences, a first in the NMT domain. This approach effectively captures both intra-chunk and inter-chunk dependencies, addressing the limitations of sequential decoders.\n2. Improved Translation Performance: The proposed models outperform existing single-model baselines on the WAT '16 English-to-Japanese task, demonstrating the effectiveness of chunk-based decoding for free word-order languages.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide detailed experimental results, including BLEU and RIBES scores, and qualitative analyses of translation outputs, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each proposed model.\nStrengths\n1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and provides clear explanations of the proposed models, supported by detailed mathematical formulations and illustrative figures.\n2. Novelty and Motivation: The idea of incorporating chunk structures into NMT decoders is innovative and well-motivated, addressing a significant gap in the literature.\n3. Applicability: The proposed approach is generalizable to other free word-order languages, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\n4. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct thorough experiments, comparing their models against strong baselines and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative results.\n5. Impact on NMT: The work bridges the gap between traditional phrase-based SMT and modern NMT, offering a promising direction for future research.\nWeaknesses\n1. Clarification on Function Words: The dominance of function words over content words in Japanese sentences (Figure 1) requires further explanation to avoid confusion.\n2. Notation Issues: Some equations lack consistent notation (e.g., sequences/vectors should be bolded to distinguish them from scalars), which could hinder readability.\n3. Typographical Errors: Equation 12 contains an error (\"sj-1\" should replace \"sj\"), and Equation 21 could benefit from inserting \"k\" into \"s1(w)\" for clarity.\n4. Ambiguity in Terminology: The phrase \"non-sequential information such as chunks\" is unclear\"\"are chunks still sequential within their structure?\n5. Experimental Details: Key details about baseline comparisons, preprocessing steps, and chunk generation are missing, making it difficult to fully assess the experimental setup.\n6. Beam Size Concerns: The use of a beam size of 20 in decoding raises questions about its impact on sentence length preferences, which should be addressed.\n7. Tense Consistency: The experiments section inconsistently switches between past and present tense, which affects readability.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Could you provide more details on how function words dominate content words in Japanese sentences and how this impacts your models?\n2. How were the baseline models selected, and were any additional preprocessing or hyperparameter tuning steps applied to ensure fair comparisons?\n3. Could you clarify whether chunks are treated as sequential units within their structure, and how this aligns with the phrase \"non-sequential information\"?\nRecommendation\nThis paper presents a solid and pioneering contribution to NMT, particularly for free word-order languages. Despite some minor weaknesses in clarity and experimental details, the novelty, rigor, and potential impact of the proposed approach make it a strong candidate for acceptance at ACL. Addressing the identified weaknesses during the author response period would further strengthen the submission."
