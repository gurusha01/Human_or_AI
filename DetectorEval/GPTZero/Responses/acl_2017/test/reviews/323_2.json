The model is based on the well-known entity grid\nrepresentation for coherence, but puts a CNN on top of it. \nThe approach is well motivated and described, I especially appreciate the clear\ndiscussion of the intuitions behind certain design decisions (e.g. why CNN and\nthe section titled 'Why it works').\nThere is an extensive evaluation on several tasks, which shows that the\nproposed approach beats previous methods. It is however strange that one\nprevious result could not be reproduced: the results on Li/Hovy (2014) suggest\nan implementation or modelling error that should be addressed.\nStill, the model is a relatively simple 'neuralization' of the entity grid\nmodel. I didn't understand why 100-dimensional vectors are necessary to\nrepresent a four-dimensional grid entry (or a few more in the case of the\nextended grid). How does this help? I can see that optimizing directly for\ncoherence ranking would help learn a better model, but the difference of\ntransition chains for up to k=3 sentences vs. k=6 might not make such a big\ndifference, especially since many WSJ articles may be very short.\nThe writing seemed a bit lengthy, the paper repeats certain parts in several\nplaces, for example the introduction to entity grids. In particular, section 2\nalso presents related work, thus the first 2/3 of section 6 are a repetition\nand should be deleted (or worked into section 2 where necessary). The rest of\nsection 6 should probably be added in section 2 under a subsection (then rename\nsection 2 as related work).\nOverall this seems like a solid implementation of applying a neural network\nmodel to entity-grid-based coherence. But considering the proposed\nconsolidation of the previous work, I would expect a bit more from a full\npaper, such as innovations in the representations (other features?) or tasks.\nminor points:\n- this paper may benefit from proof-reading by a native speaker: there are\narticles missing in many places, e.g. 'the WSJ corpus' (2x), 'the Brown ...\ntoolkit' (2x), etc.\n- p.1 bottom left column: 'Figure 2' -> 'Figure 1'\n- p.1 Firstly/Secondly -> First, Second\n- p.1 'limits the model to' -> 'prevents the model from considering ...' ?\n- Consider removing the 'standard' final paragraph in section 1, since it is\nnot necessary to follow such a short paper."
