I had to read the paper 4 times\nand I still do not understand what you are talking about!\n- The article is highly ambiguous what it talks about - machine comprehension\nor text readability for humans\n- you miss important work in the readability field\n- Section 2.2. has completely unrelated discussion of theoretical topics.\n- I have the feeling that this paper is trying to answer too many questions in\nthe same time, by this making itself quite weak. Questions such as \"does text\nreadability have impact on RC datasets\" should be analyzed separately from\nall these prerequisite skills.\n- General Discussion:\n- The title is a bit ambiguous, it would be good to clarify that you are\nreferring to machine comprehension of text, and not human reading\ncomprehension, because \"reading comprehension\" and \"readability\"\nusually mean that.\n- You say that your \"dataset analysis suggested that the readability of RC\ndatasets does not directly affect the question difficulty\", but this depends\non the method/features used for answer detection, e.g. if you use\nPOS/dependency parse features.\n- You need to proofread the English of your paper, there are some important\nomissions, like \"the question is easy to solve simply look..\" on page 1.\n- How do you annotate datasets with \"metrics\"??\n- Here you are mixing machine reading comprehension of texts and human reading\ncomprehension of texts, which, although somewhat similar, are also quite\ndifferent, and also large areas.\n- \"readability of text\" is not \"difficulty of reading contents\". Check\nthis:\nDuBay, W.H. 2004. The Principles of Readability. Costa Mesa, CA: Impact\ninformation. \n- it would be good if you put more pointers distinguishing your work from\nreadability of questions for humans, because this article is highly ambiguous.\nE.g. on page 1 \"These two examples show that the readability of the text does\nnot necessarily correlate with the difficulty of the questions\" you should\nadd \"for machine comprehension\"\n- Section 3.1. - Again: are you referring to such skills for humans or for\nmachines? If for machines, why are you citing papers for humans, and how sure\nare you they are referring to machines too?\n- How many questions the annotators had to annotate? Were the annotators clear\nthey annotate the questions keeping in mind machines and not people?"
