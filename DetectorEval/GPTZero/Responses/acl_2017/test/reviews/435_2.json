            "inputText": "This paper proposes a method for detecting causal relations between clauses,\nusing neural networks (\"deep learning\", although, as in many studies, the\nnetworks are not particularly deep). Indeed, while certain discourse\nconnectives are unambiguous regarding the relation they signal (e.g. 'because'\nis causal) the paper takes advantage of a recent dataset (called AltLex, by\nHidey and McKeown, 2016) to solve the task of identifying causal vs. non-causal\nrelations when the relation is not explicitly marked. Arguing that\nconvolutional networks are not as adept as representing the relevant features\nof clauses as LSTMs, the authors propose a classification architecture which\nuses a Glove-based representation of clauses, input in an LSTM layer, followed\nby three densely connected layers (tanh) and a final decision layer with a\nsoftmax.\nThe best configuration of the system improves by 0.5-1.5% F1 over Hidey and\nMCkeown's 2016 one (SVM classifier). Several examples of generalizations where\nthe system performs well are shown (indicator words that are always causal in\nthe training data, but are found correctly to be non causal in the test data).\nTherefore, I appreciate that the system is analyzed qualitatively and \nquantitatively.\nThe paper is well written, and the description of the problem is particularly\nclear. However a clarification of the differences between this task and the \ntask of implicit connective recognition would be welcome. This could possibly \ninclude a discussion of why previous methods for implicit connective \nrecognition cannot be used in this case.\nIt is very appreciable that the authors uploaded their code to the submission\nsite (I inspected it briefly but did not execute it). Uploading the (older)\ndata (with the code) is also useful as it provides many examples. It was not\nclear to me what is the meaning of the 0-1-2 coding in the TSV files, given\nthat the paper mentions binary classification. I wonder also, given that this\nis the data from Hidey and McKeown, if the authors have the right to repost it\nas they do. -- One point to clarify in the paper would be the meaning of\n\"bootstrapping\", which apparently extends the corpus by about 15%: while the\nconstruction of the corpus is briefly but clearly explained in the paper, the\nadditional bootstrapping is not. \nWhile it is certainly interesting to experiment with neural networks on this\ntask, the merits of the proposed system are not entirely convincing. It seems\nindeed that the best configuration (among 4-7 options) is found on the test\ndata, and it is this best configuration that is announced as improving over\nHidey by \"2.13% F1\". However, a fair comparison would involve selecting the\nbest configuration on the devset.\nMoreover, it is not entirely clear how significant the improvement is. On the\none hand, it should be possible, given the size of the dataset, to compute some\nstatistical significance indicators. On the other hand, one should consider\nalso the reliability of the gold-standard annotation itself (possibly from the\ncreators of the dataset). Upon inspection, the annotation obtained from the\nEnglish/SimpleEnglish Wikipedia is not perfect, and therefore the scores might\nneed to be considered with a grain of salt.\nFinally, neural methods have been previously shown to outperform human\nengineered features for binary classification tasks, so in a sense the results \nare rather a confirmation of a known property. It would be interesting to see\nexperiments with simpler networks used as baselines, e.g. a 1-layer LSTM. The\nanalysis of results could try to explain why the neural method seems to favor \nprecision over recall."
