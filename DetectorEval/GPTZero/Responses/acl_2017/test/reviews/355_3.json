            "inputText": "This paper proposes a joint neural modelling approach to PAS analysis in\nJapanese, based on Grid-RNNs, which it compares variously with a conventional\nsingle-sequence RNN approach.\nThis is a solidly-executed paper, targeting a well-established task from\nJapanese but achieving state-of-the-art results at the task, and presenting\nthe task in a mostly accessible manner for those not versed in\nJapanese. Having said that, I felt you could have talked up the complexity of\nthe task a bit, e.g. wrt your example in Figure 1, talking through the\ninherent ambiguity between the NOM and ACC arguments of the first predicate,\nas the NOM argument of the second predicate, and better describing how the\ntask contrasts with SRL (largely through the ambiguity in zero pronouns). I\nwould also have liked to have seen some stats re the proportion of zero\npronouns which are actually intra-sententially resolvable, as this further\ncomplicates the task as defined (i.e. needing to implicitly distinguish\nbetween intra- and inter-sentential zero anaphors). One thing I wasn't sure of\nhere: in the case of an inter-sentential zero pronoun for the argument of a\ngiven predicate, what representation do you use? Is there simply no marking of\nthat argument at all, or is it marked as an empty argument? My reading of the\npaper is that it is the former, in which case there is no explicit\nrepresentation of the fact that there is a zero pronoun, which seems like a\nslightly defective representation (which potentially impacts on the ability of\nthe model to capture zero pronouns); some discussion of this would have been\nappreciated.\nThere are some constraints that don't seem to be captured in the model (which\nsome of the ILP-based methods for SRL explicitly model, e.g.): (1) a given\npredicate will generally have only one argument of a given type (esp. NOM and\nACC); and (2) a given argument generally only fills one argument slot for a\ngiven predicate. I would have liked to have seen some analysis of the output\nof the model to see how well the model was able to learn these sorts of\nconstraints. More generally, given the mix of numbers in Table 3 between\nSingle-Seq and Multi-Seq (where it is really only NOM where there is any\nimprovement for Multi-Seq), I would have liked to have seen some discussion of\nthe relative differences in the outputs of the two models: are they largely\nidentical, or very different but about the same in aggregate, e.g.? In what\ncontexts do you observe differences between the two models? Some analysis like\nthis to shed light on the internals of the models would have made the\ndifference between a solid and a strong paper, and is the main area where I\nbelieve the paper could be improved (other than including results for SRL, but\nthat would take quite a bit more work).\nThe presentation of the paper was good, with the Figures aiding understanding\nof the model. There were some low-level language issues, but nothing major:\nl19: the error propagation -> error propagation\nl190: an solution -> a solution\nl264 (and Figure 2): a bread -> bread\nl351: the independence -> independence\nl512: the good -> good\nl531: from their model -> of their model\nl637: significent -> significance\nl638: both of -> both\nand watch casing in your references (e.g. \"japanese\", \"lstm\", \"conll\", \"ilp\")"
