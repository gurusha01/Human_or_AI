            "inputText": "The paper introduces an extension of the entity grid model. A convolutional\nneural network is used to learn sequences of entity transitions indicating\ncoherence, permitting better generalisation over longer sequences of entities\nthan the direct estimates of transition probabilities in the original model.\nThis is a nice and well-written paper. Instead of proposing a fully neural\napproach, the authors build on existing work and just use a neural network to\novercome specific issues in one step. This is a valid approach, but it would be\nuseful to expand the comparison to the existing neural coherence model of Li\nand Hovy. The authors admit being surprised by the very low score the Li and\nHovy model achieves on their task. This makes the reader wonder if there was an\nerror in the experimental setup, if the other model's low performance is\ncorpus-dependent and, if so, what results the model proposed in this paper\nwould achieve on a corpus or task where the other model is more successful. A\ndeeper investigation of these factors would strengthen the argument\nconsiderably.\nIn general the paper is very fluent and readable, but in many places definite\narticles are missing (e.g. on lines 92, 132, 174, 488, 490, 547, 674, 764 and\nprobably more). I would suggest proofreading the paper specifically with\narticle usage in mind. The expression \"...limits the model to do X...\", which\nis used repeatedly, sounds a bit unusual. Maybe \"limits the model's capacity to\ndo X\" or \"stops the model from doing X\" would be clearer.\n--------------\nFinal recommendation adjusted to 4 after considering the author response. I\nagree that objective difficulties running other people's software shouldn't be\nheld against the present authors. The efforts made to test the Li and Hovy\nsystem, and the problems encountered in doing so, should be documented in the\npaper. I would also suggest that the authors try to reproduce the results of Li\nand Hovy on their original data sets as a sanity check (unless they have\nalready done so), just to see if that works for them."
