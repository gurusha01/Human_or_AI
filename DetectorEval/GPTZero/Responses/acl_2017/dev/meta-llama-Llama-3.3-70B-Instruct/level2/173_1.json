The framework, called D2-clustering, leverages the Wasserstein distance to quantify the dissimilarity between two empirical nonparametric measures over word embedding space. The authors claim that their approach outperforms existing methodologies on various document-clustering tasks and provides a tool to quantitatively inspect the gain or loss of using word-embedding models compared to traditional bag-of-words models.\nMain Contributions\n1. D2-clustering framework: The authors propose a nonparametric clustering framework that uses the Wasserstein distance to cluster documents based on their word embeddings.\n2. Efficient computation of Wasserstein barycenter: The authors utilize a recent algorithmic advance in nonparametric clustering to efficiently compute the Wasserstein barycenter, which is a crucial step in the D2-clustering framework.\n3. Quantitative evaluation of word embeddings: The authors provide a tool to quantitatively evaluate the gain or loss of using word-embedding models compared to traditional bag-of-words models.\nStrengths\n1. Robust performance: The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing methodologies on various document-clustering tasks, including short-text and long-text datasets.\n2. Efficient computation: The authors show that their approach can be computed efficiently using a modified Bregman ADMM algorithm, making it practical for large-scale document clustering tasks.\n3. Quantitative evaluation: The authors provide a tool to quantitatively evaluate the gain or loss of using word-embedding models, which is valuable for document analysis beyond clustering.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited domain-specific evaluation: The authors acknowledge that their approach may not perform well on domain-specific text datasets, such as the Ohsumed dataset, where the semantic knowledge embedded in words may not be sufficient to discriminate fine-grained concepts.\n2. Sensitivity to hyper-parameters: The authors note that their approach involves two additional hyper-parameters, the number of intended clusters (K) and the selected support size of centroid distributions (m), which may require careful tuning.\n3. Comparison to other methods: The authors compare their approach to several other methods, but the comparison may not be exhaustive, and other methods may perform better on specific datasets or tasks.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limited domain-specific evaluation of their approach, and what strategies can be employed to improve its performance on domain-specific text datasets?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the sensitivity of their approach to hyper-parameters, and how can the hyper-parameters be tuned to achieve optimal performance?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other natural language processing tasks, such as text classification or sentiment analysis, and what potential challenges or limitations may arise?"
