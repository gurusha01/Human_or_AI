The framework aims to learn task-invariant and task-specific features non-redundantly, capturing the shared-private separation of different tasks. The authors introduce two strategies: adversarial training and orthogonality constraints, to prevent the shared feature space from being contaminated by task-specific features. The model is evaluated on 16 different text classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving performance.\nMain Contributions\n1. Adversarial Multi-Task Learning Framework: The paper proposes a novel framework that uses adversarial training to learn task-invariant features, which can be transferred to new tasks.\n2. Orthogonality Constraints: The authors introduce orthogonality constraints to prevent redundant features from appearing in both shared and private spaces.\n3. Extensive Evaluation: The model is evaluated on 16 different text classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving performance.\nStrengths\n1. Improved Performance: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 text classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning task-invariant features.\n2. Transferability: The shared feature extractor can be transferred to new tasks, demonstrating its ability to capture generalizable features.\n3. Qualitative Analysis: The authors provide extensive qualitative analysis, deriving insights into the behavior of the model and explaining the quantitative improvements.\nWeaknesses\n1. Complexity: The proposed model is more complex than existing multi-task learning models, which may make it more difficult to train and tune.\n2. Hyperparameter Tuning: The authors perform a small grid search over hyperparameters, which may not be sufficient to find the optimal hyperparameters.\n3. Limited Comparison: The authors only compare their model with two existing multi-task learning models, which may not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How did the authors select the hyperparameters for the model, and what is the sensitivity of the model to these hyperparameters?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the qualitative analysis, such as the visualization of the shared and private feature spaces?\n3. How does the proposed model compare with other state-of-the-art multi-task learning models, such as those using attention mechanisms or graph-based approaches?"
