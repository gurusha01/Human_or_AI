The theoretical and algorithmic analysis provided is both lucid and perceptive, and the overall clarity of the paper is commendable.\n- Weaknesses:\nGiven the primary motivation for utilizing Covington's algorithm lies in its ability to recover non-projective arcs, a more detailed empirical error analysis focusing specifically on non-projective structures would have enhanced the paper's strength. Furthermore, although the paper's main contributions are theoretical, including a comparison with the state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL data sets, in addition to the monotonic baseline version of the parser, would have been beneficial for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n- General Discussion:\nThe paper builds upon the transition-based formulation of Covington's dependency parsing algorithm, designed for unrestricted non-projective structures, by introducing non-monotonicity. This allows later transitions to modify structures established by earlier transitions. Additionally, it demonstrates how approximate dynamic oracles can be formulated for this new system. The experimental results show that these oracles provide a tight approximation and that the non-monotonic system yields improved parsing accuracy over its monotonic counterpart for most languages studied.\nIn my opinion, the theoretical contributions of this paper are substantial enough to warrant publication. However, empirical aspects could be further strengthened. Specifically, an error analysis investigating whether the non-monotonic system enhances accuracy on non-projective structures would be valuable. This is justified by two key points: (i) the recovery of non-projective structures is the primary reason for using Covington's algorithm, and (ii) non-projective structures often involve long-distance dependencies that are challenging for greedy transition-based parsers to predict, suggesting that the new system could offer improvements.\nAnother noteworthy discussion point is how the empirical results compare to the current state-of-the-art, especially considering recent advancements facilitated by word embeddings and neural network techniques. For instance, non-monotonicity is claimed to reduce error propagation characteristic of traditional greedy transition-based parsers. Alternatively, using recurrent neural networks as preprocessors to capture more global sentence context in word representations can also mitigate this issue. It would be interesting to explore whether these techniques are complementary or competing. While a comprehensive investigation of these issues exceeds the paper's scope, some discussion would be highly pertinent.\nSpecific questions:\nThe decision to use only 9 out of the 13 data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task warrants clarification. Stating the reason explicitly could prevent readers from speculating about the omission.\nDo the authors have any hypotheses regarding why accuracy decreases for Basque with the non-monotonic system? Similar, albeit weaker, trends are observable for Turkish, Catalan, Hungarian, and possibly German.\nHow do the results compare to the state-of-the-art on these data sets? This context is crucial for understanding the significance of the reported improvements and allowing readers to assess their impact.\nAuthor response:\nI am satisfied with the author's response and see no reason to alter my initial review."
