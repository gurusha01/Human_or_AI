The proposed solutions address both subtasks to some extent, utilizing neural networks trained on poetry corpora to encode linguistic continuity and ensure meaningful output. However, it is an overstatement to claim that this approach provides the poem with appropriate semantics. The problem of form is partially addressed, particularly in terms of rhythm, and some poetic devices are also considered. Nevertheless, larger-scale structural aspects, such as stanzas and rhyme schemes, remain unaddressed.\nThe review of related work in section 2 is insufficient, omitting key previous efforts, including those cited later in the paper (Manurung et al., 2000, and Misztal and Indurkhya, 2014).\nNotable research efforts that the authors should consider include:\n- Gabriele Barbieri et al.'s (2012) work on Markov constraints for generating lyrics with style, which addresses similar problems of n-gram-based generation and constrained generation processes.\n- Stephen McGregor et al.'s (2016) research on process-based evaluation of computer-generated poetry, which models language at a phonological level and considers word n-gram levels and sentiment, offering relevant insights for evaluation.\n- M. Ghazvininejad et al.'s (2016) work on generating topical poetry, which combines finite-state machinery with deep learning to produce iambic pentameter, providing an interesting contrast to the proposed approach.\nThe authors should also consider extending their classification of poetry generation systems to include evolutionary solutions, as they have already mentioned the evolutionary work of Manurung.\nOverall, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with prior approaches to poetry generation, particularly in cases where similar problems are addressed or similar methods are applied. The authors should strive to contextualize their work within the existing research landscape to demonstrate its novelty and impact."
