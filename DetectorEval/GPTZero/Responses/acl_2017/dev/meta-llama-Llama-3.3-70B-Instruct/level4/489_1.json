            "inputText": "COMMENTS AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE:\nI appreciate the authors' response, particularly the clarification regarding the hypothesis. I concur with the comment on cross-modal mapping. However, I disagree with the equation \"visual = referential\" that the authors seem to imply. A referent can be visually presented, but visual information can also be aggregated and added to a word's representation to encode its perceptual aspects, similar to how textual information is handled. For instance, the fact that bananas are yellow is rarely mentioned in text, but incorporating visual information from images can account for this aspect of the word's semantic representation. This is a technical point related to building distributional models, but it also pertains to human cognition, where our representation of \"banana\" likely includes aggregate information from various sensory experiences. I suggest the authors explicitly discuss this issue, distinguishing between multi-modal distributional semantics and the use of cross-modal mapping.\nRegarding the comment \"all models perform similarly,\" I strongly encourage the authors to state this explicitly in the paper, even if it doesn't fully align with their initial hypotheses or goals. This is a more accurate and useful description of the results for the community, rather than focusing on minor differences between models. The statistical significance of these differences is secondary to their practical implications, as illustrated by the analogy of two bridges with slightly different collapse probabilities.\nAs a minor suggestion, I recommend finding a more concise and descriptive title that reflects the paper's main exploration or findings.\nThe paper explores the concept of \"referential word meaning,\" which refers to the connection between a word's meaning and the objects it represents in the external world. The authors argue that this is distinct from typical word meaning representations obtained through distributional methods, as it involves the relationship between a word's abstract \"lexical meaning\" and the specific properties of the referent in a given context. This hypothesis has been previously explored in work by Schlangen and colleagues.\n- Strengths:\n1. The problem tackled by the paper is extremely interesting, and the authors' use of current techniques and datasets to address it is commendable. The scope of the research extends beyond REG to the broader link between semantic representations and reference.\n2. The paper employs current techniques and datasets, such as cross-modal mapping and word classifiers, and the ReferIt dataset, to investigate the problem.\n3. The authors conduct a substantial number of experiments and analyses.\n- Weaknesses:\n1. The main weakness is the statement of the specific hypothesis, which I found confusing. As a result, it is challenging to understand how the results relate to the initial hypothesis, particularly given the numerous experiments with varying outcomes.\n2. The paper uses previously developed methods on a previously available dataset, which limits its originality.\n3. The authors select a limited subset of the ReferIt dataset, with a small vocabulary of 159 words, without clear justification.\n4. Some aspects of the paper could be clearer, and the presentation of the empirical results and analyses could be more coherent.\n5. The paper contains many experiments and analyses, but it is difficult to discern the overall picture and how the different components fit together.\n- General Discussion:\nDespite the weaknesses, I find the topic of the paper relevant and novel, with an interesting application of current techniques to address an \"old\" problem. The experiments and analyses are a substantial contribution, although I would like to see a more coherent presentation of how they address the research question.\n- Detailed comments:\nSection 2 is missing references to computational semantic approaches to reference, such as the work by Abhijeet Gupta et al. and Aurelie Herbelot and Eva Maria Vecchi.\nThe paper could benefit from clarifying how Roy's work builds upon early REG research and providing more context for the links between sections.\nIn Section 3, I suggest presenting the dataset numbers in a table, including image regions, number of REs, overall number of words, and number of object names in the original ReferIt dataset and the version used in the paper. The authors should also consider releasing their data.\nThe paper contains several minor errors and unclear statements, such as the definition of \"the semantically annotated portion\" of ReferIt and the motivation behind the choice of a restricted subset of the dataset.\nThe authors should provide more details on the features used in the experiments, such as the list of 7 features and how they were extracted.\nThe results and discussion sections could be improved by addressing the statistical significance of the differences between models and providing more insight into the phenomenon and the models.\nThe format of the \"wac\" and the presentation of the results in Table 3 could be improved for clarity.\nThe task described in Section 6 is confusing, and an example would help to illustrate the idea.\nThe paper could benefit from mixing in train set examples with hypernyms and non-hypernyms and exploiting more of the ReferIt data before moving on to other datasets."
