Additionally, the authors introduce a heuristic method for the second approach, allowing for the generation of poems constrained by theme (e.g., love) or poetic devices (e.g., alliteration). The generated poems are evaluated both intrinsically, by comparing the rhythm of generated lines to a gold standard, and extrinsically, through a survey of 70 human evaluators who assess whether a poem was written by a human or a machine and rate poems based on readability, form, and evocation.
