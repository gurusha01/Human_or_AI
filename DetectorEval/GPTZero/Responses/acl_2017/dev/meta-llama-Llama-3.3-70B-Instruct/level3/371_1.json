The authors introduce a pyramid encoder that learns to represent phrases in a hierarchical manner, which is then used to improve the performance of language models and machine translation systems.\nMain Contributions\n1. Phrasal Representation Learning: The paper proposes a new method for learning phrasal representations using a pyramid encoder, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.\n2. Improved Language Modeling: The authors demonstrate that the proposed phrasal representation learning approach can improve the performance of language models, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information.\n3. Neural Machine Translation: The paper also shows that the proposed approach can be applied to neural machine translation, leading to improved translation performance and better handling of out-of-vocabulary words.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to phrasal representation learning, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Improved Performance: The authors demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the performance of language models and neural machine translation systems.\n3. Well-Motivated: The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing approaches and the benefits of the proposed approach.\nWeaknesses\n1. Difficulty in Following: The paper is difficult to follow, and the description of the proposed approach is not clear, which makes it hard to understand the methodology and results.\n2. Lack of Clarity in Equation 1 and 2: The authors use Equation 1 and 2 to describe phrase representation, but it is unclear how these equations are used in the model, which raises questions about their purpose.\n3. Unclear Choice of GRU and LSTM: The authors use GRU for the pyramid encoder and LSTM for the sequential part, but it is unclear why this combination is chosen, and whether it contributes to the improvements.\n4. Simplified Version of GRU: The authors mention a simplified version of GRU, but it is unclear how it is used and what its performance is on large datasets.\n5. Confusion in Table 4: The difference between RNNsearch (groundhog) and RNNsearch (baseline) in Table 4 is not explicitly stated, causing confusion.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a clearer explanation of the proposed approach and the methodology used in the paper?\n2. How do you plan to address the difficulty in following the paper, and what changes can be made to improve clarity?\n3. Can you provide more details on the choice of GRU and LSTM and how they contribute to the improvements?\n4. Can you clarify the use of Equation 1 and 2 and their purpose in the model?\n5. Can you provide more information on the simplified version of GRU and its performance on large datasets?"
