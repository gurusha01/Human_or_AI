The authors explore three different models: Direct Cross-Modal Mapping (TRANSFER), Lexical Mapping Through Individual Word Classifiers (WAC), and Word Prediction via Cross-Modal Similarity Mapping (SIM-WAP). The models are evaluated on a standard object naming task and a zero-shot naming task, where the goal is to predict object names without seeing any visual instances of the object during training.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper introduces a new approach to modeling referential word meaning by combining visual and distributional information.\n2. The authors propose three different models for combining visual and distributional information, including TRANSFER, WAC, and SIM-WAP.\n3. The paper evaluates the models on a standard object naming task and a zero-shot naming task, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nStrengths\n1. The paper proposes a novel approach to modeling referential word meaning, which combines visual and distributional information.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed models on a standard object naming task and a zero-shot naming task.\n3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing referential word meaning and generalizing to unseen objects.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper lacks a clear explanation of the limitations of the proposed approach and the potential biases in the evaluation datasets.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the results, making it difficult to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the limitations of the proposed approach and the potential biases in the evaluation datasets?\n2. How do you plan to address the issue of scalability, given that the current evaluation is limited to a small vocabulary?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the differences between the proposed models and how they capture referential word meaning in different ways?"
