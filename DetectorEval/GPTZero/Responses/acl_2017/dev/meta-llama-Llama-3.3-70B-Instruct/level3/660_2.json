            "inputText": "This paper proposes two methodologies for automatic generation of rhythmic poetry using neural networks. The first methodology uses a direct cross-modal mapping approach, while the second one allows for better control of form by using individual word classifiers. \nThe strengths of the paper include a good procedure for generating rhythmic poetry, proposals for adding control of theme and poetic devices, and strong results in evaluation of rhythm. However, the paper has several weaknesses, including poor coverage of existing literature on poetry generation, no comparison with existing approaches, and no evaluation of results on theme and poetic devices.\nThe paper addresses the problem of poetry generation as divided into two subtasks: content and form. However, the solutions proposed are limited and rely on neural networks trained over corpora of poetry. The review of related work is poor and does not cover previous efforts that the authors themselves consider worth mentioning.\nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. A new approach to generating rhythmic poetry using neural networks, which allows for better control of form.\n2. A proposal for adding control of theme and poetic devices to the generated poetry.\n3. Strong results in evaluation of rhythm, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nThe strengths of this submission are:\n1. The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to generate high-quality rhythmic poetry.\n2. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating poetry with good rhythm.\n3. The proposal for adding control of theme and poetic devices is a good direction for future work.\nThe weaknesses of this submission are:\n1. The paper lacks a thorough review of existing literature on poetry generation.\n2. There is no comparison with existing approaches to poetry generation.\n3. The evaluation of results is limited to rhythm and does not consider other important aspects of poetry, such as theme and poetic devices.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of comparison with existing approaches to poetry generation?\n2. How do the authors plan to evaluate the results on theme and poetic devices?\n3. Can the authors provide more details on how the proposed approach can be used to generate poetry with specific themes and poetic devices?"
