Complexity of the model: The proposed model involves multiple components, including adversarial training, orthogonality constraints, and multi-task learning, which may make it challenging to train and tune.\n2. Limited interpretation of the results: While the authors provide some qualitative analysis, it is not clear how the learned features relate to the specific tasks and datasets used in the experiments.\n3. Lack of comparison to other multi-task learning models: The authors only compare their proposed model to a few baseline models, and it is not clear how it performs compared to other state-of-the-art multi-task learning models.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their proposed model to other NLP tasks, such as sequence labeling or machine translation?\n2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the learned features and how they relate to the specific tasks and datasets used in the experiments?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the proposed model and make it more efficient to train and tune?"
