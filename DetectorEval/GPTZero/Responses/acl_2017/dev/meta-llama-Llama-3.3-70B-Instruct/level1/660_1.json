            "inputText": "This paper proposes two novel methodologies for the automatic generation of rhythmic poetry in various forms. The main contributions of this work are:\n1. Phonetic-level model: A neural language model trained on a phonetic encoding of poetry to learn an implicit representation of both form and content.\n2. Constrained character-level model: A pipeline approach that combines a generative language model with a discriminative model to represent form, allowing for more control over the style of generated poetry.\n3. Evaluation methodology: A large-scale extrinsic evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models in generating high-quality rhythmic verse.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel approach: The use of phonetic encoding and constrained character-level models is a new and innovative approach to poetry generation.\n2. High-quality output: The generated poetry is of high quality, with 54% of participants considering machine-generated poems to be written by humans.\n3. Flexibility: The constrained character-level model allows for greater control over the style of generated poetry, including themes and poetic devices.\n4. Evaluation methodology: The extrinsic evaluation is well-designed and provides a thorough assessment of the proposed models.\n5. Comparison to human poetry: The comparison to human poetry provides a useful benchmark for evaluating the quality of the generated poetry.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited generalizability: The phonetic-level model is limited in its ability to generalize to novel forms of verse.\n2. Transliteration errors: The phonetic-level model is prone to transliteration errors, which can affect the quality of the generated poetry.\n3. Dependence on training data: The quality of the generated poetry is dependent on the quality of the training data.\n4. Lack of interpretability: The neural language models used in this paper can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why certain poetry is generated.\n5. Limited analysis of results: The analysis of the results is limited, and more in-depth analysis could provide further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed models.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the proposed models handle out-of-vocabulary words, and what strategies can be employed to improve their handling of such words?\n2. Can the constrained character-level model be used to generate poetry in languages other than English, and what modifications would be necessary to achieve this?\n3. How do the proposed models compare to other state-of-the-art poetry generation models, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?"
