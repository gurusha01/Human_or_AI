The authors demonstrate the potential of their approach for real-world applications, such as referring expression generation and conversational agents.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include: \n1. The authors' evaluation is limited to a relatively small vocabulary and dataset, which may limit the generality of their conclusions.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of their approach to other state-of-the-art methods for object naming and referring expression generation.\n3. The authors' analysis of the results is largely qualitative, and could be strengthened by more quantitative evaluation metrics and statistical analysis.\nQuestions to authors: \n1. How do the authors plan to scale up their approach to larger vocabularies and datasets, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?\n2. How do the authors' models compare to other state-of-the-art methods for object naming and referring expression generation, and what are the key differences and advantages of their approach?\n3. What additional evaluation metrics and analysis could be used to further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the authors' approach?"
