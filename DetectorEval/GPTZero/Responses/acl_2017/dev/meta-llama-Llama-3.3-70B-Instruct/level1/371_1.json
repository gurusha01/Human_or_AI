Dependence on hyperparameters: The model's performance may be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, which can be time-consuming and require significant expertise.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the model and make it more efficient for large-scale applications?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the model and the decision-making process behind the attention mechanisms and parallel RNN sequences?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the pRNN architecture to other natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and sentiment analysis?"
