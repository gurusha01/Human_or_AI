            "inputText": "The paper describes two methodologies for the automatic generation of rhythmic\npoetry. Both rely on neural networks, but the second one allows for better\ncontrol of form.\n- Strengths:\nGood procedure for generating rhythmic poetry.\nProposals for adding control of theme and poetic devices (alliteration,\nconsonance, asonance).\nStrong results in evaluation of rhythm.\n- Weaknesses:\nPoor coverage of existing literature on poetry generation.\nNo comparison with existing approaches to poetry generation.\nNo evaluation of results on theme and poetic devices.\n- General Discussion:\nThe introduction describes the problem of poetry generation as divided into two\nsubtasks: the problem of content (the poem's semantics) and the problem of form\n(the \naesthetic rules the poem follows). The solutions proposed in the paper address\nboth of these subtasks in a limited fashion. They rely on neural networks\ntrained over corpora \nof poetry (represented at the phonetic or character level, depending on the\nsolution) to encode the linguistic continuity of the outputs. This does indeed\nensure that the \noutputs resemble meaningful text. To say that this is equivalent to having\nfound a way of providing the poem with appropriate semantics would be an\noverstatement. The \nproblem of form can be said to be addressed for the case of rhythm, and partial\nsolutions are proposed for some poetic devices. Aspects of form concerned with\nstructure at a \nlarger scale (stanzas and rhyme schemes) remain beyond the proposed solutions.\nNevertheless, the paper constitutes a valuable effort in the advancement of\npoetry generation.\nThe review of related work provided in section 2 is very poor. It does not even\ncover the set of previous efforts that the authors themselves consider worth\nmentioning in their paper (the work of Manurung et al 2000 and Misztal and\nIndurkhya 2014 is cited later in the paper - page 4 - but it is not placed in\nsection 2 with respect to the other authors mentioned there).\nA related research effort of particular relevance that the authors should\nconsider is:\n- Gabriele Barbieri, FranÃ§ois Pachet, Pierre Roy, and Mirko Degli Esposti.\n2012. Markov constraints for generating lyrics with style. In Proceedings of\nthe 20th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'12), Luc De\nRaedt, Christian Bessiere, Didier Dubois, Patrick Doherty, and Paolo Frasconi\n(Eds.). IOS Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, The Netherlands, 115-120. DOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-115\nThis work addresses very similar problems to those discussed in the present\npaper (n-gram based generation and the problem of driving generation process\nwith additional constraints). The authors should include a review of this work\nand discuss the similarities and differences with their own.\nAnother research effort that is related to what the authors are attempting (and\nhas bearing on their evaluation process) is:\n- Stephen McGregor, Matthew Purver and Geraint Wiggins, Process Based\nEvaluation of Computer Generated Poetry, in: Proceedings of the INLG 2016\nWorkshop on Computational Creativity and Natural Language Generation, pages\n51\"\"60,Edinburgh, September 2016.c2016 Association for Computational\nLinguistics\nThis work is also similar to the current effort in that it models language\ninitially at a phonological level, but considers a word n-gram level\nsuperimposed on that, and also features a layer representint sentiment. Some of\nthe considerations McGregor et al make on evaluation of computer generated\npoetry are also relevant for the extrinsic evaluation described in the present\npaper.\nAnother work that I believe should be considered is:\n- \"Generating Topical Poetry\" (M. Ghazvininejad, X. Shi, Y. Choi, and K.\nKnight), Proc. EMNLP, 2016.\nThis work generates iambic pentameter by combining finite-state machinery with\ndeep learning. It would be interesting to see how the proposal in the current\npaper constrasts with this particular approach.\nAlthough less relevant to the present paper, the authors should consider\nextending their classification of poetry generation systems (they mention\nrule-based expert systems and statistical approaches) to include evolutionary\nsolutions. They already mention in their paper the work of Manurung, which is\nevolutionary in nature, operating over TAG grammars.\nIn any case, the paper as it stands holds little to no effort of comparison to\nprior approaches to poetry generation. The authors should make an effort to\ncontextualise their work with respect to previous efforts, specially in the\ncase were similar problems are being addressed (Barbieri et al, 2012) or\nsimilar methods are being applied (Ghazvininejad, et al, 2016)."
