            "inputText": "COMMENTS AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE:\nThanks for your response, particularly for the clarification wrt the\nhypothesis. I agree with the comment wrt cross-modal mapping. What I don't\nshare is the kind of equation \"visual = referential\" that you seem to assume. A\nreferent can be visually presented, but visual information can be usefully\nadded to a word's representation in aggregate form to encode perceptual aspects\nof the words' meaning, the same way that it is done for textual information;\nfor instance, the fact that bananas are yellow\nwill not frequently be mentioned in text, and adding visual information\nextracted from images will account for this aspect of the semantic\nrepresentation of the word. This is kind of technical and specific to how we\nbuild distributional models, but it's also relevant if you think of human\ncognition (probably our representation for \"banana\" has some aggregate\ninformation about all the bananas we've seen --and touched, tasted, etc.). \nIt would be useful if you could discuss this issue explicitly, differentiating\nbetween multi-modal distributional semantics in general and the use of\ncross-modal mapping in particular.\nAlso, wrt the \"all models perform similarly\" comment: I really\nurge you, if the paper is accepted, to state it in this form, even if it\ndoesn't completely align with your hypotheses/goals (you have enough results\nthat do). It is a better description of the results, and more useful for the\ncommunity, than clinging to the\nn-th digit difference (and this is to a large extent independent of whether the\ndifference\nis actually statistical significant or not: If one bridge has 49% chances of\ncollapsing and another one 50%, the difference may be statistically\nsignificant, but that doesn't really make the first bridge a better bridge to\nwalk on).\nBtw, small quibble, could you find a kind of more compact and to the point\ntitle? (More geared towards either generally what you explore or to what you\nfind?)\n----------\nThe paper tackles an extremely interesting issue, that the authors label\n\"referential word meaning\", namely, the connection between a word's meaning and\nthe referents (objects in the external world) it is applied to. If I understood\nit correctly, they argue that\nthis is different from a typical word meaning representation as obtained e.g.\nwith distributional\nmethods, because one thing is the abstract \"lexical meaning\" of a word and the\nother which label is appropriate for a given referent with specific properties\n(in a specific context, although context is something they explicitly leave\naside in this paper). This hypothesis has been previously explored in work by\nSchlangen and colleagues (cited in the paper). The paper explores referential\nword meaning empirically on a specific version of the task of Referential\nExpression Generation (REG), namely, generating the appropriate noun for a\ngiven visually represented object.\n- Strengths:\n1) The problem they tackle I find extremely interesting; as they argue, REG is\na problem that had previously been addressed mainly using symbolic methods,\nthat did not easily allow for an exploration of how speakers choose the names\nof the objects. The scope of the research goes beyond REG as such, as it\naddresses the link between semantic representations and reference more broadly.\n2) I also like how they use current techniques and datasets (cross-modal\nmapping and word classifiers, the ReferIt dataset containing large amounts of\nimages with human-generated referring expressions) to address the problem at\nhand. \n3) There are a substantial number of experiments as well as analysis into the\nresults. \n- Weaknesses:\n1) The main weakness for me is the statement of the specific hypothesis, within\nthe general research line, that the paper is probing: I found it very\nconfusing. As a result, it is also hard to make sense of the kind of feedback\nthat the results give to the initial hypothesis, especially because there are a\nlot of them and they don't all point in the same direction.\nThe paper says:\n\"This paper pursues the hypothesis that an accurate\nmodel of referential word meaning does not\nneed to fully integrate visual and lexical knowledge\n(e.g. as expressed in a distributional vector\nspace), but at the same time, has to go beyond\ntreating words as independent labels.\"\nThe first part of the hypothesis I don't understand: What is it to fully\nintegrate (or not to fully integrate) visual and lexical knowledge? Is the goal\nsimply to show that using generic distributional representation yields worse\nresults than using specific, word-adapted classifiers trained on the dataset?\nIf so, then the authors should explicitly discuss the bounds of what they are\nshowing: Specifically, word classifiers must be trained on the dataset itself\nand only word classifiers with a sufficient amount of items in the dataset can\nbe obtained, whereas word vectors are available for many other words and are\nobtained from an independent source (even if the cross-modal mapping itself is\ntrained on the dataset); moreover, they use the simplest Ridge Regression,\ninstead of the best method from Lazaridou et al. 2014, so any conclusion as to\nwhich method is better should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I'm\nhoping that the research goal is both more constructive and broader. Please\nclarify. \n2) The paper uses three previously developed methods on a previously available\ndataset. The problem itself has been defined before (in Schlangen et al.). In\nthis sense, the originality of the paper is not high. \n3) As the paper itself also points out, the authors select a very limited\nsubset of the ReferIt dataset, with quite a small vocabulary (159 words). I'm\nnot even sure why they limited it this way (see detailed comments below).\n4) Some aspects could have been clearer (see detailed comments).\n5) The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes a\nconcerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to get\nthe whole picture: What is it exactly that the experiments in the paper tell us\nabout the underlying research question in general, and the specific hypothesis\ntested in particular? How do the different pieces of the puzzle that they\npresent fit together?\n- General Discussion: [Added after author response]\nDespite the weaknesses, I find the topic of the paper very relevant and also\nnovel enough, with an interesting use of current techniques to address an \"old\"\nproblem, REG and reference more generally, in a way that allows aspects to be\nexplored that have not received enough attention. The experiments and analyses\nare a substantial contribution, even though, as mentioned above, I'd like the\npaper to present a more coherent overall picture of how the many experiments\nand analyses fit together and address the question pursued.\n- Detailed comments:\nSection 2 is missing the following work in computational semantic approaches to\nreference:\nAbhijeet Gupta, Gemma Boleda, Marco Baroni, and Sebastian Pado. 2015. \nDistributional vectors encode \nreferential \nattributes.\nProceedings of\nEMNLP,\n12-21\nAurelie Herbelot and Eva Maria Vecchi. \n2015. \nBuilding\na\nshared\nworld:\nmapping\ndistributional to model-theoretic semantic spaces.

By the way,\nwill you release your data? I put a \"3\" for data because in the reviewing form\nyou marked \"Yes\" for data, but I can't find the information in the paper.\n229 \"cannot be considered to be names\" ==> \"image object names\"\n230 what is \"the semantically annotated portion\" of ReferIt?\n247 why don't you just keep \"girl\" in this example, and more generally the head\nnouns of non-relational REs? More generally, could you motivate your choices a\nbit more so we understand why you ended up with such a restricted subset of\nReferIt?\n258 which 7 features? (list) How did you extract them?\n383 \"suggest that lexical or at least distributional knowledge is detrimental\nwhen learning what a word refers to in the world\": How does this follow from\nthe results of Frome et al. 2013 and Norouzi et al. 2013? Why should\ncross-modal projection give better results? It's a very different type of\ntask/setup than object labeling.\n394-395 these numbers belong in the data section\nTable 1: Are the differences between the methods statistically significant?\nThey are really numerically so small that any other conclusion to \"the methods\nperform similarly\" seems unwarranted to me. Especially the \"This suggests...\"\npart (407). \nTable 1: Also, the sim-wap method has the highest accuracy for hit @5 (almost\nidentical to wac); this is counter-intuitive given the @1 and @2 results. Any\nidea of what's going on?\nSection 5.2: Why did you define your ensemble classifier by hand instead of\nlearning it? Also, your method amounts to majority voting, right? \nTable 2: the order of the models is not the same as in the other tables + text.\nTable 3: you report cosine distances but discuss the results in terms of\nsimilarity. It would be clearer (and more in accordance with standard practice\nin CL imo) if you reported cosine similarities.\nTable 3: you don't comment on the results reported in the right columns. I\nfound it very curious that the gold-top k data similarities are higher for\ntransfer+sim-wap, whereas the results on the task are the same. I think that\nyou could squeeze more information wrt the phenomenon and the models out of\nthese results.\n496 format of \"wac\"\nSection 6 I like the idea of the task a lot, but I was very confused as to how\nyou did and why: I don't understand lines 550-553. What is the task exactly? An\nexample would help. \n558 \"Testsets\"\n574ff Why not mix in the train set examples with hypernyms and non-hypernyms?\n697 \"more even\": more wrt what?\n774ff \"Previous cross-modal mapping models ... force...\": I don't understand\nthis claim.\n792 \"larger test sets\": I think that you could even exploit ReferIt more (using\nmore of its data) before moving on to other datasets."
