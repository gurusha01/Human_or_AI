            "inputText": "- Strengths:\nThe paper makes several novel contributions to (transition-based) dependency\nparsing by extending the notion of non-monotonic transition systems and dynamic\noracles to unrestricted non-projective dependency parsing. The theoretical and\nalgorithmic analysis is clear and insightful, and the paper is admirably clear.\n- Weaknesses:\nGiven that the main motivation for using Covington's algorithm is to be able to\nrecover non-projective arcs, an empirical error analysis focusing on\nnon-projective structures would have further strengthened the paper. And even\nthough the main contributions of the paper are on the theoretical side, it\nwould have been relevant to include a comparison to the state of the art on the\nCoNLL data sets and not only to the monotonic baseline version of the same\nparser.\n- General Discussion:\nThe paper extends the transition-based formulation of Covington's dependency\nparsing algorithm (for unrestricted non-projective structures) by allowing\nnon-monotonicity in the sense that later transitions can change structure built\nby earlier transitions. In addition, it shows how approximate dynamic oracles\ncan be formulated for the new system. Finally, it shows experimentally that the\noracles provide a tight approximation and that the non-monotonic system leads\nto improved parsing accuracy over its monotonic counterpart for the majority of\nthe languages included in the study.\nThe theoretical contributions are in my view significant enough to merit\npublication, but I also think the paper could be strengthened on the empirical\nside. In particular, it would be relevant to investigate, in an error analysis,\nwhether the non-monotonic system improves accuracy specifically on\nnon-projective structures. Such an analysis can be motivated on two grounds:\n(i) the ability to recover non-projective structures is the main motivation for\nusing Covington's algorithm in the first place; (ii) non-projective structures\noften involved long-distance dependencies that are hard to predict for a greedy\ntransition-based parser, so it is plausible that the new system would improve\nthe situation. \nAnother point worth discussion is how the empirical results relate to the state\nof the art in light of recent improvements thanks to word embeddings and neural\nnetwork techniques. For example, the non-monotonicity is claimed to mitigate\nthe error propagation typical of classical greedy transition-based parsers. But\nanother way of mitigating this problem is to use recurrent neural networks as\npreprocessors to the parser in order to capture more of the global sentence\ncontext in word representations. Are these two techniques competing or\ncomplementary? A full investigation of these issues is clearly outside the\nscope of the paper, but some discussion would be highly relevant.\nSpecific questions:\nWhy were only 9 out of the 13 data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task used? I am\nsure there is a legitimate reason and stating it explicitly may prevent readers\nfrom becoming suspicious. \nDo you have any hypothesis about why accuracy decreases for Basque with the\nnon-monotonic system? Similar (but weaker) trends can be seen also for Turkish,\nCatalan, Hungarian and (perhaps) German.\nHow do your results compare to the state of the art on these data sets? This is\nrelevant for contextualising your results and allowing readers to estimate the\nsignificance of your improvements.\nAuthor response:\nI am satisfied with the author's response and see no reason to change my\nprevious review."
