Comparison to an extensive set of\nalternative systems.\n- Weaknesses:\nWeak results/summary of \"side-by-side human\" comparison in Section 5. Some\ndisfluency/agrammaticality.\n- General Discussion:\nThe article proposes a principled means of modeling utterance context,\nconsisting of a sequence of previous utterances. Some minor issues:\n1. Past turns in Table 1 could be numbered, making the text associated with\nthis table (lines 095-103) less difficult to ingest. Currently, readers need to\ncount turns from the top when identifying references in the authors'\ndescription, and may wonder whether \"second\", \"third\", and \"last\" imply a\nside-specific or global enumeration.\n2. Some reader confusion may be eliminated by explicitly defining what\n\"segment\" means in \"segment level\", as occurring on line 269. Previously, on\nline 129, this seemingly same thing was referred to as \"a sequence-sequence\n[similarity matrix]\". The two terms appear to be used interchangeably, but it\nis not clear what they actually mean, despite the text in section 3.3. It seems\nthe authors may mean \"word subsequence\" and \"word subsequence to word\nsubsequence\", where \"sub-\" implies \"not the whole utterance\", but not sure.\n3. Currently, the variable symbol \"n\" appears to be used to enumerate words in\nan utterance (line 306), as well as utterances in a dialogue (line 389). The\nauthors may choose two different letters for these two different purposes, to\navoid confusing readers going through their equations.\n4. The statement \"This indicates that a retrieval based chatbot with SMN can\nprovide a better experience than the state-of-the-art generation model in\npractice.\" at the end of section 5 appears to be unsupported. The two\napproaches referred to are deemed comparable in 555 out of 1000 cases, with the\nbaseline better than the proposed method in 238 our of the remaining 445 cases.\nThe authors are encouraged to assess and present the statistical significance\nof this comparison. If it is weak, their comparison permits to at best claim\nthat their proposed method is no worse (rather than \"better\") than the VHRED\nbaseline.\n5. The authors may choose to insert into Figure 1 the explicit \"first layer\",\n\"second layer\" and \"third layer\" labels they use in the accompanying text.\n6. Their is a pervasive use of \"to meet\" as in \"a response candidate can meet\neach utterace\" on line 280 which is difficult to understand.\n7. Spelling: \"gated recurrent unites\"; \"respectively\" on line 133 should be\nremoved; punctuation on line 186 and 188 is exchanged; \"baseline model over\" ->\n\"baseline model by\"; \"one cannot neglects\"."
