            "inputText": "This paper introduces new configurations and training objectives for neural\nsequence models in a multi-task setting. As the authors describe well, the\nmulti-task setting is important because some tasks have shared information\nand in some scenarios learning many tasks can improve overall performance.\nThe methods section is relatively clear and logical, and I like where it ended\nup, though it could be slightly better organized. The organization that I\nrealized after reading is that there are two problems: 1) shared features end\nup in the private feature space, and 2) private features end up in the \nshared space. There is one novel method for each problem. That organization up\nfront would make the methods more cohesive. In any case, they introduce one \nmethod that keeps task-specific features out of shared representation\n(adversarial\nloss) and another to keep shared features out of task-specific representations\n(orthogonality constraints). My only point of confusion is the adversarial\nsystem.\nAfter LSTM output there is another layer, D(s^kT, \\thetaD), relying on\nparameters\nU and b. This output is considered a probability distribution which is compared\nagainst the actual. This means it is possible it will just learn U and b that\neffectively mask task-specific information from the LSTM outputs, and doesn't \nseem like it can guarantee task-specific information is removed.\nBefore I read the evaluation section I wrote down what I hoped the experiments\nwould look like and it did most of it. This is an interesting idea and there\nare \na lot more experiments one can imagine but I think here they have the basics\nto show the validity of their methods. It would be helpful to have best known\nresults on these tasks.\nMy primary concern with this paper is the lack of deeper motivation for the \napproach. I think it is easy to understand that in a totally shared model\nthere will be problems due to conflicts in feature space. The extension to \npartially shared features seems like a reaction to that issue -- one would \nexpect that the useful shared information is in the shared latent space and \neach task-specific space would learn features for that space. Maybe this works\nand maybe it doesn't, but the logic is clear to me. In contrast, the authors\nseem to start from the assumption that this \"shared-private\" model has this\nissue. I expected the argument flow to be 1) Fully-shared obviously has this\nproblem; 2) shared-private seems to address this; 3) in practice shared-private\ndoes not fully address this issue for reasons a,b,c.; 4) we introduce a method\nthat more effectively constrains the spaces.\nTable 4 helped me to partially understand what's going wrong with\nshared-private\nand what your methods do; some terms are usually one connotation\nor another, and that general trend can probably get them into the shared\nfeature\nspace. This simple explanation, an example, and a more logical argument flow\nwould help the introduction and make this a really nice reading paper.\nFinally, I think this research ties into some other uncited MTL work [1],\nwhich does deep hierarchical MTL - supervised POS tagging at a lower level,\nchunking\nat the next level up, ccg tagging higher, etc. They then discuss at the end\nsome of the qualities that make MTL possible and conclude that MTL only works\n\"when tasks are sufficiently similar.\" The ASP-MTL paper made me think of this\nprevious work because potentially this model could learn what sufficiently\nsimilar is -- i.e., if two tasks are not sufficiently similar the shared model\nwould learn nothing and it would fall back to learning two independent systems,\nas compared to a shared-private model baseline that might overfit and perform\npoorly.\n[1]\n@inproceedings{sogaard2016deep,\n title={Deep multi-task learning with low level tasks supervised at lower\nlayers},\n author={S{\\o}gaard, Anders and Goldberg, Yoav},\n booktitle={Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for\nComputational Linguistics},\n volume={2},\n pages={231--235},\n year={2016},\n organization={Association for Computational Linguistics}\n}"
