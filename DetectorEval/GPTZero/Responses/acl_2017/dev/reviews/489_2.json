Also increase ratings for the dataset and software that are\npromised to become public before the article publishing.\n======================\nGENERAL \nThe paper presents an interesting empirical comparison of 3 referring\nexpression generation models. The main novelty lies in the comparison of a yet\nunpublished model called SIM-WAP (in press by Anonymous). The model is\ndescribed in SECTION 4.3 but it is not clear whether it is extended or modified\nanyhow in the current paper. \nThe novelty of the paper may be considered as the comparison of the unpublished\nSIM-WAP model to existing 2 models. This complicates evaluation of the novelty\nbecause similar experiments were already performed for the other two models and\nit is unclear why this comparison was not performed in the paper where SIM-WAP\nmodel was presented. A significant novelty might be the combined model yet this\nis not stated clearly and the combination is not described with enough details.\nThe contribution of the paper may be considered the following: the side-by-side\ncomparison of the 3 methods for REG; analysis of zero-shot experiment results\nwhich mostly confirms similar observations in previous works; analysis of the\ncomplementarity of the combined model. \nWEAKNESSES\nUnclear novelty and significance of contributions. The work seems like an\nexperimental extension of the cited Anonymous paper where the main method was\nintroduced. \nAnother weakness is the limited size of the vocabulary in the zero-shot\nexperiments that seem to be the most contributive part. \nAdditionally, the authors never presented significance scores for their\naccuracy results. This would have solidified the empirical contribution of the\nwork which its main value. \nMy general feeling is that the paper is more appropriate for a conference on\nempirical methods such as EMNLP. \nLastly, I have not found any link to any usable software. Existing datasets\nhave been used for the work. \nObservations by Sections: \nABSTRACT\n\"We compare three recent models\" -- Further in the abstract you write that you\nalso experiment with the combination of approaches. In Section 2 you write that\n\"we present a model that exploits distributional knowledge for learning\nreferential word meaning as well, but explore and compare different ways of\ncombining visual and lexical aspects of referential word meaning\" which\neventually might be a better summarization of the novelty introduced in the\npaper and give more credit to the value of your work. \nMy suggestion is to re-write the abstract (and eventually even some sections in\nthe paper) focusing on the novel model and results and not just stating that\nyou compare models of others. \nINTRODUCTION \n\"Determining such a name is is\" - typo \n\"concerning e.g.\" -> \"concerning, e.g.,\" \n\"having disjunct extensions.\" - specify or exemplify, please \n\"building in Figure 1\" -> \"building in Figure 1 (c)\"\nSECTION 4\n\"Following e.g. Lazaridou et al. (2014),\" - \"e.g.\" should be omitted \nSECTION 4.2\n\"associate the top n words with their corresponding distributional vector\" -\nWhat are the values of N that you used? If there were any experiments for\nfinding the optimal values, please, describe because this is original work. The\nuse top N = K is not obvious and not obvious why it should be optimal (how\nabout finding similar vectors to each 5 in top 20?) \nSECTION 4.3 \n\"we annotate its training instances with a fine-grained similarity signal\naccording to their object names.\" - please, exemplify. \nLANGUAGE \nQuite a few typos in the draft. Generally, language should be cleaned up (\"as\nwell such as\"). \nAlso, I believe the use of American English spelling standard is preferable\n(e.g., \"summarise\" -> \"summarize\"). Please, double check with your conference\ntrack chairs."
