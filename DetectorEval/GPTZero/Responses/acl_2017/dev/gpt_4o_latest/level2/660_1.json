            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents two novel methodologies for the automatic generation of rhythmic poetry: (1) a phonetic-level neural language model trained on a phonetic encoding of poetry to implicitly represent both form and content, and (2) a constrained character-level model that separates content generation from form constraints, treating poetry generation as a constraint satisfaction problem. The second approach introduces a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) to enforce rhythmic constraints such as Iambic Pentameter. The authors also propose a mechanism for thematic and stylistic control by boosting probabilities of thematic words and poetic devices (e.g., alliteration). The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these approaches through intrinsic evaluations (e.g., adherence to poetic form) and extrinsic evaluations (e.g., human indistinguishability tests), showing that participants considered machine-generated poems to be written by humans 54% of the time.\nThe primary contributions of this work are:\n1. The development of a phonetic-level neural language model capable of learning poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm through phonetic encodings.\n2. A constrained character-level model that decouples content and form, allowing for flexible generation of poetry with arbitrary rhythmic constraints and themes.\n3. A large-scale human evaluation demonstrating that machine-generated poetry can be indistinguishable from human poetry.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Methodology: The constrained character-level model is a significant innovation, as it separates content generation from form enforcement, enabling flexibility in generating poetry with diverse structures and themes. This approach addresses the limitations of prior models that required retraining for each poetic form.\n2. Human Evaluation: The large-scale human evaluation is a strong point, providing evidence that the generated poetry is of high quality and often indistinguishable from human-written poetry. The finding that participants rated a machine-generated poem as the best among all evaluated is particularly compelling.\n3. Thematic and Stylistic Control: The ability to control themes and poetic devices during generation is a practical and creative advancement, making the model more versatile and user-friendly for applications in creative writing.\n4. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper provides detailed intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, including error analysis and statistical significance testing, which strengthen the validity of the results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization of the Phonetic Model: The phonetic-level model is constrained by its reliance on corpora with consistent poetic forms, limiting its applicability to novel or less structured poetic styles. This limitation is acknowledged but not sufficiently addressed.\n2. Lack of Semantic Depth: While the generated poems adhere to rhythmic and stylistic constraints, their semantic coherence and depth are not thoroughly evaluated. The paper could benefit from an analysis of how well the models capture meaningful content beyond surface-level aesthetics.\n3. Dependence on External Resources: The reliance on pronunciation dictionaries and n-gram models for phonetic transliteration and decoding introduces potential errors, as highlighted in the intrinsic evaluation. This dependency may limit the robustness of the phonetic-level model.\n4. Evaluation Bias: The human evaluation focuses on \"nonsense verse,\" which may not fully represent the diversity of poetic styles. Including more semantically rich poetry in the evaluation could provide a more comprehensive assessment.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the constrained character-level model handle more complex poetic forms, such as free verse, which lack strict rhythmic constraints?\n2. Could the phonetic-level model be adapted to incorporate semantic coherence, perhaps through joint training with a semantic model?\n3. How does the performance of the constrained character-level model compare to state-of-the-art poetry generation systems in terms of semantic quality?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of creative AI by advancing the state of poetry generation. While there are some limitations, particularly regarding semantic depth and generalization, the methodologies proposed are innovative and well-supported by empirical evidence. Encouraging further exploration of semantic modeling and broader evaluations could strengthen the impact of this work."
