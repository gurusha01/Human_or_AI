The authors compare (1) direct cross-modal mapping (TRANSFER), (2) visual word predictors (WAC), and (3) a hybrid approach that incorporates lexical similarity during training (SIM-WAP). The main contributions of the paper are:\n1. Model Comparison and Analysis: The paper provides a detailed comparison of the three models, demonstrating their complementary strengths and weaknesses in both standard and zero-shot naming tasks.\n2. Novel Hybrid Model (SIM-WAP): The authors propose and evaluate SIM-WAP, which combines visual and distributional knowledge by training individual word predictors with fine-grained similarity signals, showing its advantages in zero-shot learning.\n3. Empirical Insights: The paper highlights the limitations of cross-modal mapping in preserving referential appropriateness and demonstrates how combining models improves performance, particularly in challenging scenarios like zero-shot naming.\nStrengths\n1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper rigorously evaluates the models on standard and zero-shot naming tasks using a well-established dataset (REFERIT), providing both quantitative results and qualitative examples.\n2. Complementary Model Insights: The analysis reveals how different models capture distinct aspects of referential meaning, such as taxonomic relations (TRANSFER) and specific word use (WAC), which is a valuable contribution to understanding multi-modal learning.\n3. Zero-Shot Learning Contribution: The paper addresses the underexplored challenge of zero-shot naming in referential expression generation (REG), demonstrating that SIM-WAP outperforms other models in generalizing to unseen object names.\n4. Constructive Directions: The authors propose promising avenues for future work, such as scaling to larger vocabularies and incorporating contextual information, which could significantly advance the field.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Vocabulary: The experiments are conducted on a relatively small vocabulary (159 names), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to larger, more diverse datasets.\n2. Lack of Human Evaluation: While the paper provides quantitative metrics, it lacks human evaluation to assess the semantic appropriateness of generated names, which is critical for tasks like REG.\n3. Sparse Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed SIM-WAP model, such as potential scalability issues or reliance on high-quality distributional embeddings.\n4. Insufficient Contextual Integration: The models are evaluated in isolation without considering contextual factors (e.g., surrounding objects), which are crucial for real-world REG applications.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the performance of SIM-WAP scale when applied to larger vocabularies or datasets with more diverse object categories?\n2. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of SIM-WAP compared to WAC and TRANSFER, especially in large-scale applications?\n3. Have you considered evaluating the models using human judgments to assess the semantic appropriateness of generated names?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of multi-modal learning and REG by systematically comparing models and introducing a novel hybrid approach. Addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly scaling to larger vocabularies and incorporating human evaluation, would further strengthen the work. The findings are likely to inspire future research on integrating visual and lexical knowledge for referential tasks."
