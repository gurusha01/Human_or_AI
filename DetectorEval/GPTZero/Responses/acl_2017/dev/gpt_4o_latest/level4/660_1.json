The first method integrates a neural phonetic encoder, which predicts the next phoneme, with a phonetic-orthographic HMM decoder that determines the most probable word corresponding to a sequence of phonemes. The second method combines a character-based language model with a weighted FST to enforce rhythm constraints on the language model's output. Additionally, for the second approach, the authors propose a heuristic mechanism that allows the generated poetry to be constrained by themes (e.g., love) or poetic devices (e.g., alliteration). The generated poems are evaluated using both intrinsic and extrinsic metrics: intrinsically, by comparing the rhythm of the generated lines to a gold standard, and extrinsically, through a study involving 70 human evaluators who (i) assessed whether the poem was human- or machine-generated and (ii) rated the poems based on readability, form, and evocation. The results demonstrate that the second model outperforms the first and that human evaluators often struggle to distinguish between human-written and machine-generated poetry.\nThis is a well-written and engaging paper that presents innovative ideas (two distinct models for poetry generation: one leveraging a phonetic language model and the other a character-based language model) and provides compelling results.\nHowever, the evaluation section could benefit from additional clarity regarding the evaluators and the protocol. For instance, did all evaluators assess all poems? If not, how many judgments were collected per poem for each task? Furthermore, the paper mentions nine non-native English speakers among the evaluators.
