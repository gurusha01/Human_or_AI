            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces two neural network-based methodologies for generating rhythmic poetry. The first approach employs a neural language model trained on phonetic encodings to implicitly represent both content and form, while the second approach frames poetry generation as a constraint satisfaction problem, using a generative language model for content and a discriminative model for form. The latter methodology provides greater control over poetic form and themes. The paper also proposes mechanisms for incorporating themes and poetic devices, such as alliteration and assonance, into generated poetry. A human evaluation reveals that participants were unable to reliably distinguish machine-generated poems from human-written ones, with some machine-generated poems being rated higher in quality.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. A constrained character-level model that allows for flexible control over poetic form, rhythm, and themes, outperforming the phonetic-level model in generalizability and quality.\n2. A novel evaluation framework demonstrating the indistinguishability of machine-generated poetry from human poetry, with some generated poems rated as superior.\n3. Proposals for integrating thematic content and poetic devices into generative poetry systems.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Rhythm Modeling: The paper demonstrates strong performance in rhythm generation, particularly with the constrained character-level model, which adheres well to Iambic Pentameter. The use of Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFST) for rhythm constraints is a notable strength.\n2. Human Evaluation Results: The indistinguishability study is a compelling contribution, showing that machine-generated poems can rival human-written poetry in perceived quality. This is a significant achievement in computational creativity.\n3. Control over Form and Themes: The second methodology provides a flexible framework for generating poetry with specific forms, themes, and poetic devices, offering practical utility for creative applications.\nWeaknesses\n1. Inadequate Literature Review: The related work section is insufficient, omitting key prior studies such as Barbieri et al. (2012), McGregor et al. (2016), and Ghazvininejad et al. (2016). This lack of contextualization weakens the paper's positioning within the field.\n2. No Comparative Baseline: The paper does not compare its methodologies to existing poetry generation approaches, making it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed models relative to prior work.\n3. Evaluation Gaps: While rhythm is well-evaluated, the paper does not provide quantitative or qualitative evaluations of its handling of themes and poetic devices, leaving these claims unsubstantiated.\n4. Form Limitations: Larger-scale structural aspects of poetry, such as stanza organization and rhyme schemes, remain unresolved. This limits the applicability of the models to more complex poetic forms.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does your approach compare quantitatively or qualitatively to prior poetry generation systems, such as those by Barbieri et al. (2012) or Ghazvininejad et al. (2016)?\n2. Can you provide more detailed evaluations of the thematic and poetic device control mechanisms? How effective are they in practice?\n3. Have you considered incorporating larger-scale structural constraints, such as stanza organization or rhyme schemes, into your models?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents promising methodologies and compelling evaluation results, the lack of a thorough literature review, comparative baselines, and evaluation of thematic and poetic devices weakens its overall contribution. Addressing these issues would significantly strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions to improve contextualization and evaluation."
