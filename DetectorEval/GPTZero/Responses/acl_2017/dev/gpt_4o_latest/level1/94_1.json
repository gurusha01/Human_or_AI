            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper introduces a novel, fully non-monotonic transition system for the non-projective Covington dependency parser, along with a dynamic oracle tailored for training in non-monotonic scenarios. The authors propose a system that allows the repair of erroneous attachments regardless of their direction, addressing limitations of prior work that only supported partial non-monotonicity. The key contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Fully Non-Monotonic Transition System: The paper extends the Covington algorithm to support full non-monotonicity, enabling the correction of past errors in both leftward and rightward arcs. This is a significant step forward compared to prior work, which was limited to projective trees and partial non-monotonicity.\n \n2. Approximate Dynamic Oracle: The authors develop an approximate dynamic oracle based on tight bounds of the loss, circumventing the computational challenges of exact loss calculation in non-monotonic, non-projective scenarios. This oracle is empirically shown to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.\n3. Empirical Evaluation Across Multiple Languages: The paper evaluates the proposed system on datasets from the CoNLL-X and CoNLL-XI shared tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in parsing accuracy over monotonic systems for the majority of languages tested.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Scope: The introduction of full non-monotonicity for non-projective parsing is a notable advancement. It addresses a key limitation in transition-based dependency parsing by enabling the correction of a wider range of errors.\n \n2. Practicality of Approximation: The use of approximate loss bounds is a pragmatic and innovative solution to the computational challenges posed by non-monotonicity. The empirical results demonstrate that these approximations are both tight and effective in practice.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are thorough, covering 19 languages and comparing multiple loss expressions. The results convincingly show that the non-monotonic system outperforms the monotonic baseline in most cases, with statistically significant improvements in several languages.\n4. Generality of the Approach: The proposed oracle is adaptable to neural-network-based parsers, opening avenues for further research and application in modern parsing systems.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Analysis of Failure Cases: While the paper highlights the drop in accuracy for Basque, it does not provide a detailed analysis of why the non-monotonic system underperforms for this language. A deeper investigation could strengthen the paper's conclusions.\n2. Complexity of Cycle Handling: The paper introduces mechanisms for handling cycles in non-monotonic parsing but does not provide a clear theoretical justification for why the chosen approach (e.g., removing arcs to enforce acyclicity) is optimal. This could leave room for alternative interpretations or improvements.\n3. Feature Engineering Reliance: The experiments rely on traditional feature templates for the perceptron model. While the authors mention the potential for neural implementations, the lack of experiments with neural models limits the paper's relevance to state-of-the-art parsing systems.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. Can you provide more insights into why the non-monotonic system underperforms for Basque? Are there specific linguistic or structural properties of the language that make it challenging for your approach?\n \n2. How does the computational overhead of the non-monotonic oracle compare to the monotonic oracle in practice, especially for larger datasets?\n3. Have you considered testing the proposed oracle with neural-network-based parsers? If so, what challenges do you anticipate in adapting the oracle to such systems?\nOverall Assessment: \nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of dependency parsing by addressing the limitations of monotonic systems and introducing a practical approach to full non-monotonicity. While there are areas for further exploration, the work is well-motivated, methodologically sound, and empirically validated. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses."
