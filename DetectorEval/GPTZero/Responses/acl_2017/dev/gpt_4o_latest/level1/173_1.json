            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel nonparametric clustering framework for document analysis that leverages the Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover's Distance) to quantify dissimilarity between documents represented as empirical measures over word embedding space. The authors claim that their approach sidesteps the need for fixed-length document vector representations and high-level assumptions, resulting in a robust and intuitive clustering method. The framework is computationally feasible due to recent advances in solving Wasserstein barycenters and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document clustering tasks. The authors also provide a quantitative evaluation of the gains from word embeddings compared to traditional bag-of-words models.\nThe main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. A scalable and robust nonparametric clustering framework: The proposed method uses Wasserstein distance for document clustering, offering superior performance across datasets of varying lengths and domains. This is the primary contribution, as it demonstrates the practical application of optimal transport theory to document clustering.\n2. Empirical evaluation of word embeddings: The framework provides a means to quantitatively assess the utility of word embeddings in document clustering tasks, offering insights into their advantages over bag-of-words models.\n3. Computational efficiency improvements: By adopting a modified Bregman ADMM algorithm and leveraging parallelization, the authors address the computational challenges of Wasserstein barycenter calculations, making the approach scalable for real-world datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Performance and Robustness: The proposed method consistently outperforms traditional clustering methods (e.g., LDA, NMF, and TF-IDF) and embedding-based methods (e.g., AvgDoc, PV) across diverse datasets. Its robustness to hyperparameter changes is a significant strength.\n2. Theoretical and Practical Contributions: The paper bridges the gap between optimal transport theory and document clustering, presenting a theoretically sound yet practically feasible framework.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on six datasets, including short-text, long-text, and domain-specific datasets, using multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., AMI, ARI, V-measure). This thorough evaluation strengthens the validity of their claims.\n4. Insights into Word Embeddings: The paper provides valuable insights into the limitations of pre-trained word embeddings, particularly in domain-specific tasks, and highlights the importance of task-relevant embeddings.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the application of Wasserstein distance to document clustering is well-motivated, the core methodological contribution\"\"adapting existing algorithms for Wasserstein barycenters\"\"is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The novelty lies more in the application than in the underlying algorithmic advances.\n2. Computational Overhead: Despite the improvements in computational efficiency, the proposed method remains computationally expensive compared to simpler clustering techniques. This may limit its adoption for very large-scale datasets or resource-constrained environments.\n3. Limited Exploration of Domain-Specific Embeddings: The paper acknowledges the limitations of pre-trained word embeddings in domain-specific tasks (e.g., Ohsumed dataset) but does not explore or propose solutions to address this issue. Incorporating domain-specific embeddings could have strengthened the contributions.\n4. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is dense with technical details, particularly in the explanation of the modified Bregman ADMM algorithm. This may make it less accessible to readers unfamiliar with optimal transport theory.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method scale with increasing dataset size, particularly for datasets with millions of documents? Are there specific scenarios where the computational cost becomes prohibitive?\n2. Have you considered incorporating domain-specific word embeddings or fine-tuning pre-trained embeddings to improve performance on datasets like Ohsumed? If not, how do you envision addressing this limitation in future work?\n3. Could you provide more details on the sensitivity of the method to the choice of the Wasserstein barycenter algorithm? Are there alternative algorithms that could further improve scalability?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, the paper presents a robust and effective clustering framework with strong empirical results. However, the limited methodological novelty and computational overhead are notable drawbacks. Addressing these issues in future work could further enhance the impact of this research."
