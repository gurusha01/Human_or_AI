The approach combines item-specific information and the structure of WordNet, taking into account unlabeled data to perform a full annotation of WordNet. The system is evaluated using crowd-sourcing and compared to previous works, showing improvements of around 10% in F1 on 4 labels in the TempEval-3 task.\nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. A semi-supervised graph-based classification paradigm for recognizing temporal dimension of word senses, \n2. The use of WordNet relations, glosses, and other attributes for the classification process, and \n3. The development of a reliable temporal lexical resource that can be used for various temporal information extraction tasks.\nThe strengths of this paper include its well-constructed and clear presentation, the use of a semi-supervised approach to leverage unlabeled data, and the evaluation of the system using crowd-sourcing and comparison to previous works. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and questions that need to be addressed. The experimental settings could be improved with more information on the task performed in the extrinsic evaluation section. Additionally, clarification is needed on the use of the SVM algorithm, including the optimized parameters and the potential redundancy between Lexica and Entity. The presentation of results could be improved with more detailed information on the gold data and the number of ambiguous words. Minor errors, such as missing references and unclear technical terms, should also be corrected.\nQuestions to the authors include: How did you optimize the parameters of the SVM algorithm? How did you handle the potential redundancy between Lexica and Entity? Can you provide more information on the task performed in the extrinsic evaluation section? How did you ensure the quality of the crowd-sourced annotations? What are the plans for future work and potential applications of the developed temporal lexical resource?"
