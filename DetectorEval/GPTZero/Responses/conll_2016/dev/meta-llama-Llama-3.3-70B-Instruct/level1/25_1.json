Limited interpretability: The graph-based approach may be less interpretable than traditional machine learning models, making it challenging to understand the underlying decisions.\n3. Dependence on WordNet: The approach relies heavily on WordNet, which may limit its applicability to other languages or domains.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the task and improve the interpretability of the graph-based approach?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the construction of the gold standard dataset and the crowdsourcing process?\n3. How do the authors envision the application of their temporal lexical resource in real-world scenarios, such as automatic analysis of time-oriented clinical narratives?"
