            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the task of associating word senses with their temporal orientation (past, present, future, or atemporal) using a semi-supervised graph-based classification framework. The proposed method leverages WordNet glosses, conceptual-semantic, and lexical relations to construct a graph and employs the max-flow min-cut theorem to classify synsets. The authors claim that their approach outperforms prior methods in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. The main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Novel Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Framework: The paper introduces a minimum cut-based graph classification paradigm that combines individual scores (from supervised classifiers) and association scores (from WordNet relations). This dual-view approach is a significant improvement over prior single-view methods and is particularly effective for sparse, high-dimensional data.\n2. Improved Temporal Lexical Resource: The proposed method generates a time-annotated WordNet resource with higher accuracy than existing resources (e.g., TempoWordNet). The resource demonstrates strong performance in downstream tasks, such as temporal relation classification in TempEval-3.\n3. Efficient Use of Limited Labeled Data: The semi-supervised framework achieves competitive performance with significantly less labeled data (e.g., 400 labeled examples outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on 1264 examples). This is a practical contribution for resource-scarce scenarios.\nStrengths\n1. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed method achieves substantial improvements over prior approaches (e.g., TempoWordNet) in both intrinsic (temporal classification) and extrinsic (TempEval-3) evaluations. The results are well-documented and statistically significant.\n \n2. Scalability and Flexibility: The graph-based formulation is flexible, allowing the integration of multiple views (individual and association scores) and the use of unlabeled data to improve performance. This scalability is demonstrated by the ability to handle the entire WordNet hierarchy.\n3. Thorough Evaluation: The authors conduct comprehensive intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, including feature ablation studies and experiments with varying amounts of labeled data. These analyses provide strong evidence for the robustness and utility of the proposed approach.\n4. Practical Applicability: The resulting temporal lexical resource has clear applications in NLP tasks such as question answering, information retrieval, and clinical narrative analysis. The authors also make the resource publicly available, which is a valuable contribution to the community.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion on Ambiguity: While the authors acknowledge the difficulty of classifying ambiguous synsets (e.g., \"dinosaur\"), the paper does not propose specific strategies to address such cases. A deeper exploration of ambiguity resolution could strengthen the work.\n2. Evaluation on Real-World Applications: Although the resource is evaluated on TempEval-3, additional experiments on more diverse real-world tasks (e.g., clinical narratives or economic text analysis) would better demonstrate its practical utility.\n3. Dependence on WordNet: The approach heavily relies on WordNet relations and glosses, which may limit its applicability to other languages or domains where such resources are unavailable or incomplete. Exploring methods to generalize beyond WordNet would improve the impact of the work.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the method handle synsets with multiple temporal orientations (e.g., \"monthly\")? Are such cases explicitly modeled or treated as noise?\n2. Could the proposed framework be extended to other languages or domains where WordNet-like resources are unavailable? If so, how?\n3. Have you considered incorporating external resources (e.g., distributional word embeddings) to improve the association scores in the graph?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper presents a novel and effective approach to temporal classification of word senses, with strong empirical results and practical contributions. Addressing the identified weaknesses and questions could further enhance the impact and applicability of the work."
