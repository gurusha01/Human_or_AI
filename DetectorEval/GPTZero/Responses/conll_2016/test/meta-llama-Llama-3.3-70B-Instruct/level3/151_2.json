The proposed system, UDP, does not require training data and is competitive with a delexicalized transfer system.\nSummary of the Paper:\nThe authors propose an unsupervised algorithm for Universal Dependencies that does not require training, utilizing PageRank and hard-coded rules for tagging. The article is well-written, detailed, and clearly explains the intuition behind the model and prior information added to it. The contribution is substantial to the field of unsupervised parsing, with possibilities for future work that can lead to additional research.\nMain Contributions:\n1. The development of an unsupervised dependency parsing algorithm that does not require training data.\n2. The use of personalized PageRank to improve main predicate identification.\n3. The incorporation of UD constraints on building POS and dependency annotations.\nStrengths:\n1. The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised dependency parsing that is competitive with supervised methods.\n2. The use of PageRank and hard-coded rules allows for a linguistically sound and robust parsing system.\n3. The system is less affected by deteriorating POS tags and is more resilient to domain changes compared to supervised methods.\n4. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the system on multiple languages and domains.\n5. The authors make their parser and in-domain annotated test sets freely available.\nWeaknesses:\n1. The system relies on a set of hard-coded rules, which may not be applicable to all languages or domains.\n2. The use of PageRank may not be suitable for all types of sentences or languages.\n3. The system does not handle multiword expressions, coordination, or proper names.\n4. The evaluation is limited to unlabeled attachment score, and the system could be augmented with partial edge labeling.\n5. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the system.\nQuestions to Authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the parser to handle multiword expressions, coordination, and proper names?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the error analysis of the system, including the types of errors made and their frequency?\n3. How does the system perform on languages with non-standard word orders or grammatical structures?\n4. Can the authors provide more information on the computational resources required to run the system?\n5. How does the system compare to other unsupervised dependency parsing systems in terms of performance and robustness?"
