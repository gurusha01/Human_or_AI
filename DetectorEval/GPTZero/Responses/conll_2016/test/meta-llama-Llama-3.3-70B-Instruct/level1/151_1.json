Limited handling of complex linguistic phenomena: The parser does not handle multiword expressions, coordination, and proper names, which may limit its performance on certain languages or domains.\n2. Dependence on UD constraints: The parser relies heavily on the constraints imposed by UD, which may not be applicable to all languages or linguistic formalisms.\n3. Room for improvement in edge labeling: The authors only consider unlabeled attachment, and augmenting the system with partial edge labeling could further improve its performance.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend the parser to handle more complex linguistic phenomena, such as multiword expressions and coordination?\n2. Can the authors provide more insight into the performance of the parser on languages with limited resources or non-standard linguistic structures?\n3. How do the authors envision the integration of UDP with other NLP tasks, such as semantic role labeling or machine translation?"
