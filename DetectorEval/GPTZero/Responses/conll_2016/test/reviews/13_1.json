            "inputText": "This paper models event linking using CNNs. Given event mentions, the authors\ngenerate vector representations based on word embeddings passed through a CNN\nand followed by max-pooling. They also concatenate the resulting\nrepresentations with several word embeddings around the mention. Together with\ncertain pairwise features, they produce a vector of similarities using a\nsingle-layer neural network, and compute a coreference score. \nThe model is tested on an ACE dataset and an expanded version with performance\ncomparable to previous feature-rich systems.\nThe main contribution of the paper, in my opinion, is in developing a neural\napproach for entity linking that combines word embeddings with several\nlinguistic features. It is interesting to find out that just using the word\nembeddings is not sufficient for good performance. Fortunately, the linguistic\nfeatures used are limited and do not require manually-crafted external\nresources. \nExperimental setting\n- It appears that gold trigger words are used rather than predicted ones. The\nauthors make an argument why this is reasonable, although I still would have\nliked to see performance with predicted triggers. This is especially\nproblematic as one of the competitor systems used predicted triggers, so the\ncomparison isn't fair. \n- The fact that different papers use different train/test splits is worrisome.\nI would encourage the authors to stick to previous splits as much as possible. \nUnclear points\n- The numbers indicating that cross-sentential information is needed are\nconvincing. However, the last statement in the second paragraph (lines 65-70)\nwas not clear to me.\n- Embeddings for positions are said to be generaties \"in a way similar to word\nembeddings\". How exactly? Are they randomly initialized? Are they lexicalized?\nIt is not clear to me why a relative position next to one word should have the\nsame embedding as a relative position next to a different word.\n- How exactly are left vs right neighbors used to create the representation\n(lines 307-311)? Does this only affect the max-pooling operation?\n- The word embeddings of one word before and one word after the trigger words\nare appended to it. This seems a bit arbitrary. Why one word before and after\nand not some other choice? \n- It is not clear how the event-mention representation v_e (line 330) is used?\nIn the following sections only v{sent+lex} appear to be used, not ve.\n- How are pairwise features used in section 3.2? Most features are binary, so I\nassume they are encoded as a binary vector, but what about the distance feature\nfor example? And, are these kept fixed during training?\nOther issues and suggestions\n- Can the approach be applied to entity coreference resolution as well? This\nwould allow comparing with more previous work and popular datasets like\nOntoNotes. \n- The use of a square function as nonlinearity is interesting. Is it novel? Do\nyou think it has applicability in other tasks?\n- Datasets: one dataset is publicly available, but results are also presented\nwith ACE++, which is not. Do you have plans to release it? It would help other\nresearchers compare new methods. At least, it would have been good to see a\ncomparison to the feature-rich systems also on this dataset.\n- Results: some of the numbers reported in the results are quite close.\nSignificance testing would help substantiating the comparisons.\n- Related work: among the work on (entity) coreference resolution, one might\nmention the neural network approach by Wiseman et al. (2015) \nMinor issues\n- line 143, \"that\" is redundant. \n- One of the baselines is referred to as \"same type\" in table 6, but \"same\nevent\" in the text (line 670). \nRefs\n- Learning Anaphoricity and Antecedent Ranking Features for Coreference\nResolution.
