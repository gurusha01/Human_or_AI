            "inputText": "This paper presents a model for the task of event entity linking, where they\npropose to use sentential features from CNNs in place of external knowledge\nsources which earlier methods have used. They train a two-part model: the first\npart learns an event mention representation, and the second part learns to\ncalculate a coreference score given two event entity mentions.\nThe paper is well-written, well-presented and is easy to follow. I rather like\nthe analysis done on the ACE corpus regarding the argument sharing between\nevent coreferences. Furthermore, the analysis on the size impact of the\ndataset is a great motivation for creating their ACE++ dataset. However, there\nare a few\nmajor issues that need to be addressed:\n- The authors fail to motivate and analyze the pros and cons of using CNN for\ngenerating mention representations. It is not discussed why they chose CNN and\nthere are no comparisons to the other models (e.g., straightforwardly an RNN).\nGiven that the improvement their model makes according various metrics against\nthe\nstate-of-the-art is only 2 or 3 points on F1 score, there needs to be more\nevidence that this architecture is indeed superior.\n- It is not clear what is novel about the idea of tackling event linking with\nsentential features, given that using CNN in this fashion for a classification\ntask is not new. The authors could explicitly point out and mainly compare to\nany existing continuous space methods for event linking. The choice of methods\nin Table 3 is not thorough enough.\n- There is no information regarding how the ACE++ dataset is collected. A major\nissue with the ACE dataset is its limited number of event types, making it too\nconstrained and biased. It is important to know what event types ACE++ covers.\nThis can also help support the claim in Section 5.1 that 'other approaches are\nstrongly tied to the domain where these semantic features are available\"¦our\napproach does not depend on resources with restricted\"¦', you need to show\nthat those earlier methods fail on some dataset that you succeed on. Also,\nfor enabling any meaningful comparison in future, the authors should think\nabout making this dataset publicly available.\nSome minor issues:\n- I would have liked to see the performance of your model without gold\nreferences in Table 3 as well.\n- It would be nice to explore how this model can or cannot be augmented with a\nvanilla coreference resolution system. For the specific example in line 687,\nthe off-the-shelf CoreNLP system readily links 'It' to 'bombing', which can be\nsomehow leveraged in an event entity linking baseline.\n- Given the relatively small size of the ACE dataset, I think having a\ncompelling model requires testing on the other available resources as well.\nThis further motivates working on entity and event coreference simultaneously.\nI also believe that testing on EventCorefBank in parallel with ACE is\nessential. \n- Table 5 shows that the pairwise features have been quite effective, which\nsignals that feature engineering may still be crucial for having a competitive\nmodel (at least on the scale of the ACE dataset). One would wonder which\nfeatures were the most effective, and why not report how the current set was\nchosen and what else was tried."
