            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions \nThis paper introduces UDP, a deterministic, unsupervised dependency parsing algorithm for Universal Dependencies (UD) that leverages personalized PageRank and a small set of dependency head rules. The parser requires no training data and is evaluated across 32 languages, demonstrating competitive performance compared to a supervised delexicalized transfer parser (MSD). Key contributions include: \n1. The adaptation of dependency head rules to UD-compliant POS relations and the incorporation of UD constraints, such as treating function words as leaves. \n2. The use of personalized PageRank for ranking content words and identifying main predicates. \n3. A novel approach to estimating adposition attachment direction directly on test data, eliminating the need for language-specific parameters. \n4. A robust evaluation across languages and domains, highlighting the parser's resilience to domain shifts and its reduced sensitivity to POS tagging errors compared to supervised methods.\nStrengths \n1. Novelty and Simplicity: The paper presents a linguistically sound and computationally efficient unsupervised parsing approach that avoids reliance on training data. Its reliance on UD constraints and deterministic rules makes it a robust baseline for cross-lingual parsing. \n2. Cross-Lingual and Domain Robustness: The evaluation across 32 languages and multiple domains demonstrates the parser's generalizability and stability, particularly in low-resource and domain-shift scenarios. The system's reduced sensitivity to POS tagging errors is a notable advantage over supervised methods. \n3. Empirical Results: The parser achieves competitive performance, even surpassing the MSD parser on Hindi, and shows consistent results across development and test sets. The detailed breakdown by POS and domain further strengthens the empirical analysis. \n4. Reproducibility: The parser and annotated datasets are made publicly available, promoting transparency and reproducibility. \nWeaknesses \n1. Similarity to Prior Work: The approach bears notable similarities to SÃƒÂ¸gaard (2012), particularly in its use of PageRank for ranking words. While the paper introduces personalized PageRank and UD-specific adaptations, the novelty of the method could be more explicitly distinguished from prior work. \n2. Missing Analysis: The paper lacks an analysis of disconnected graphs generated by the dependency rules (Table 1) and their frequency across languages. This omission limits the understanding of the algorithm's behavior in such cases. \n3. Tie-Breaking Clarification: The paper does not adequately explain how ties in PageRank scores are resolved and how this impacts parsing performance. \n4. Oracle Experiments: The absence of oracle results for constraints (e.g., head rules, directionality, distance) makes it difficult to assess the individual contributions of these components to the parser's performance. \n5. Presentation Issues: Minor issues include unclear phrasing in Sections 4.1 and 6.1, as well as inconsistent column orders in Tables 5 and 7, which detract from the paper's readability.\nQuestions to Authors \n1. How does the system handle disconnected graphs during PageRank computation, and how frequently do such cases occur across languages? \n2. Could you provide oracle results for individual constraints (e.g., head rules, directionality) to better understand their impact on performance? \n3. How are ties in PageRank scores resolved, and what is the observed impact of tie-breaking on parsing accuracy? \nConclusion \nThis paper presents a compelling unsupervised dependency parsing approach that is both linguistically grounded and computationally efficient. While the method's novelty relative to prior work could be better articulated, and some analyses are missing, the parser's robustness and competitive performance make it a valuable contribution to cross-lingual parsing research. With revisions to address the identified weaknesses, this paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance."
