            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach to event coreference resolution using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate sentential features, eliminating reliance on external semantic resources like WordNet or FrameNet. The proposed model processes event mentions in two steps: (1) generating latent feature representations for individual event mentions using CNNs, and (2) determining coreference between event mention pairs using a trainable similarity function augmented with lexical and pairwise features. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, including the ACE 2005 dataset, and provides an error analysis to identify future research directions. The key contributions of the paper are:\n1. A domain-independent event linking model that achieves competitive performance without requiring external semantic features.\n2. The use of CNNs to generate sentential features for event mentions, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing document-level context.\n3. A thorough evaluation on multiple datasets, including a new ACE++ dataset, and an insightful error analysis highlighting challenges like pronoun resolution.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Practicality: The model's independence from external semantic resources makes it highly adaptable to diverse domains, addressing a significant limitation of prior approaches.\n2. State-of-the-Art Performance: The model achieves competitive results on the ACE 2005 dataset, outperforming or matching existing methods that rely on extensive external features.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the model on multiple datasets and provides detailed ablation studies to assess the contribution of different feature classes (e.g., sentential, lexical, pairwise).\n4. Error Analysis: The error analysis is thoughtful and highlights key challenges in the task, such as pronoun resolution and annotation inconsistencies, which are valuable insights for future research.\n5. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient implementation details, including hyperparameters and architectural choices, to facilitate reproducibility.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Comparison with Non-Neural Methods: While the paper compares its approach to several state-of-the-art methods, it does not sufficiently discuss how the proposed model compares to simpler, non-neural baselines in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.\n2. Pronoun Resolution: The model struggles with resolving pronouns, a critical aspect of event coreference resolution. While this limitation is acknowledged, no concrete solutions or future directions are proposed to address it.\n3. Dataset Bias: The reliance on gold-annotated event mentions in the evaluation pipeline may overestimate the model's real-world applicability, where noisy or incomplete event detection is common.\n4. Cross-Document Coreference: The paper focuses exclusively on within-document event linking, leaving its applicability to cross-document settings unexplored.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the model perform when integrated into a full event extraction pipeline, where event mentions are automatically detected rather than gold-annotated?\n2. Could the model benefit from incorporating discourse-level features, such as rhetorical structure or coreference chains for entities, to address pronoun resolution challenges?\n3. Have you considered extending the model to handle cross-document event coreference resolution? If so, what modifications would be required?\nOverall Assessment\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of event coreference resolution by proposing a domain-independent neural model that achieves state-of-the-art performance without relying on external semantic resources. While the model has some limitations, such as its inability to handle pronoun resolution effectively and its focus on within-document coreference, these do not detract from its overall impact. The paper is well-written, methodologically sound, and provides valuable insights for future research. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses and clarify the model's broader applicability."
