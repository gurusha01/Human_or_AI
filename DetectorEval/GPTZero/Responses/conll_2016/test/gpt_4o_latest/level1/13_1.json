            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to event coreference resolution that eliminates the reliance on external semantic resources, such as WordNet or FrameNet, which have limited cross-domain applicability. Instead, the authors utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate sentential feature representations for event mentions and their contexts. These representations are augmented with lexical and pairwise features to compute a coreference score. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 dataset and an extended version (ACE++), demonstrating its effectiveness. The authors also provide a detailed error analysis, highlighting challenges such as pronoun resolution and annotation inconsistencies.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are:\n1. Model Design: The proposed two-step architecture effectively combines sentential features with pairwise features, removing the need for external semantic resources while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.\n2. Empirical Results: The model achieves competitive results on multiple metrics compared to prior systems, demonstrating its robustness across datasets.\n3. Error Analysis: The authors provide a thorough analysis of system errors, identifying key challenges and directions for future research, such as pronoun resolution and annotation inconsistencies.\nStrengths\n1. Elimination of External Semantic Resources: The model's independence from external resources like WordNet and FrameNet is a significant strength, as it enhances portability across domains and reduces reliance on costly, domain-specific knowledge bases.\n2. State-of-the-Art Performance: The model achieves competitive results on the ACE 2005 dataset, outperforming or matching prior systems that rely heavily on external features. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.\n3. Error Analysis and Insights: The paper provides a detailed error analysis, offering valuable insights into the challenges of event coreference resolution, such as pronoun resolution and annotation inconsistencies. This analysis adds depth to the evaluation and highlights areas for improvement.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors evaluate their model on multiple datasets (ACE and ACE++) and metrics, providing a well-rounded assessment of its performance. They also compare alternative clustering strategies and feature ablations, which strengthens the empirical findings.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Novelty in Neural Architecture: While the use of CNNs for sentential feature extraction is effective, it is not particularly novel. The paper could benefit from a discussion of why CNNs were chosen over other architectures, such as recurrent or transformer-based models, which are more commonly used for sequence modeling.\n2. Pronoun Resolution: The model struggles with resolving pronouns to event mentions, as highlighted in the error analysis. While this is a challenging problem, the paper does not propose concrete steps to address it, leaving a key limitation unaddressed.\n3. Evaluation on Additional Datasets: The model is evaluated primarily on ACE and ACE++, which are closely related datasets. Testing on more diverse datasets or in cross-document settings would strengthen the claims of generalizability.\n4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper occasionally conflates its contributions with prior work, making it harder to isolate the novel aspects of the proposed approach. A clearer delineation of what is new versus what is borrowed from existing methods would improve the presentation.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Why were CNNs chosen over other architectures, such as recurrent or transformer-based models, for sentential feature extraction? Have these alternatives been explored?\n2. How does the model perform in cross-document event coreference resolution tasks? Would the proposed architecture generalize to such settings?\n3. Could incorporating discourse-level features or pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) improve pronoun resolution? Have these been considered?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of event coreference resolution by demonstrating that external semantic resources are not strictly necessary for achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, addressing the limitations in pronoun resolution and evaluating the model on more diverse datasets would further strengthen the work."
