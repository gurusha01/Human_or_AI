            "inputText": "The paper presents the first broad-coverage semantic parsers for UCCA, one\nspecific approach to graph-based semantic representations. Unlike CoNLL\nsemantic dependency graphs, UCCA graphs can contain \"nonterminal\" nodes which\ndo not represent words in the string. Unlike AMRs, UCCA graphs are \"grounded\",\nwhich the authors take to mean that the text tokens appear as nodes in the\nsemantic representation. The authors present a number of parsing methods,\nincluding a transition-based parser that directly constructs UCCA parses, and\nevaluate them.\nGiven that UCCA and UCCA-annotated data exist, it seems reasonable to develop a\nsemantic parser for UCCA. However, the introduction and background section hit\na wrong note to my ear, in that they seem to argue that UCCA is the only\ngraph-based semantic representation (SR) formalism that makes sense to be\nstudied. This doesn't work for me, and also seems unnecessary -- a good UCCA\nparser could be a nice contribution by itself.\nI do not entirely agree with the three criteria for semantic representation\nformalisms the authors lay out in the introduction. For instance, it is not\nclear to me that \"nonterminal nodes\" contribute any expressive capacity. Sure,\nit can be inconvenient to have to decide which word is the head of a\ncoordinated structure, but exactly what information is it that could only be\nrepresented with a nonterminal and not e.g. with more informative edge labels?\nAlso, the question of discontinuity does not even arise in SRs that are not\n\"grounded\". The advantages of \"grounded\" representations over AMR-style ones\ndid not become clear to me. I also think that the word \"grounded\" has been used\nfor enough different concepts in semantics in the past ten years, and would\nencourage the authors to find a different one (\"anchored\"? \"lexicalized\"?).\nThus I feel that the entire introductory part of the paper should be phrased\nand argued much more carefully.\nThe parser itself seems fine, although I did not check the details. However, I\ndid not find the evaluation results very impressive. On the \"primary\" edges,\neven a straightforward MaltParser outperforms the BSP parser presented here,\nand the f-scores on the \"remote\" edges (which a dependency-tree parser like\nMalt cannot compute directly) are not very high either. Furthermore, the\nconversion of dependency graphs to dependency trees has been studied quite a\nbit under the name \"tree approximations\" in the context of the CoNLL 2014 and\n2015 shared tasks on semantic dependency parsing (albeit without \"nonterminal\"\nnodes). Several authors have proposed methods for reconstructing the edges that\nwere deleted in the graph-to-tree conversion; for instance, Agic et al. (2015),\n\"Semantic dependency graph parsing using tree approximations\" discuss the\nissues involved in this reconstruction in detail. By incorporating such\nmethods, it is likely that the f-score of the MaltParser (and the LSTM-based\nMaltParser!) could be improved further, and the strength of the BSP parser\nbecomes even less clear to me."
