            "inputText": "This paper presents a transition-based graph parser able to cope with the rich\nrepresentations of a semantico-cognitive annotation scheme, instantiated in the\nUCCA corpora. The authors start first by exposing what, according to them,\nshould cover a semantic-based annotation scheme: (i) being graph-based\n(possibility for a token/node of having multiple governors) (2) having\nnon-terminal nodes (representing complex structures \"\" syntactic -: coordinate\nphrases, lexical: multiword expression) and (3) allowing discontinuous elements\n(eg. Verbs+particules). Interestingly, none of these principles is tied to a\nsemantic framework, they could also work for syntax or other representation\nlayers. The authors quickly position their work by first introducing the larger\ncontext of broad-coverage semantic parsing then their annotation scheme of\nchoice (UCCA). They then present 3 sets of parsing experiments: (i) one\ndevoted to phrase-based parsing using the Stanford parser and an UCCA to\nconstituency conversion, (ii) one devoted to dependency parsing using an UCCA\nto dependency conversion and finally (iii) the core of their proposal, a set\nof experiments showing that their transition-based graph parser is suitable for\ndirect parsing of UCCA graphs.\nI found this work interesting but before considering a publication, I have\nseveral concerns with regards to the methodology and the empirical\njustifications:\nThe authors claimed that there are the first to propose a parser for a\nsemantically-oriented scheme such as theirs. Of course, they are. But with all\ndue respect to the work behind this scheme, it is made of graphs with a various\nlevel of under-specified structural arguments and semantically oriented label\n(Process, state) and nothing in their transition sets treats the specificities\nof such a graph. Even the transitions related to the remote edges could have\nbeen handled by the other ones assuming a difference in the label set itself\n(like adding an affix for example). If we restrict the problem to graph\nparsing, many works post the 2014-2015 semeval shared tasks (Almeda and\nMartins, 2014,2015 ; Ribeyre et al, 2014-2015) proposed an extension to\ntransition-based graph parser or an adaptation of a higher-model one, and\nnothing precludes their use on this data set. It's mostly the use of a\nspecific feature template that anchors this model to this scheme (even though\nit's less influencial than the count features and the unigram one). Anyway,\nbecause the above-mentioned graph-parsers are available [1,2] I don't\nunderstand why they couldn't be used as a baseline or source of comparisons.\nRegarding the phrase-based experiments using uparse, it could have been also\nvalidated by another parser from Fernandez-Gonzales and Martins (2015) which\ncan produce LCFRS-like parsing as good as Uparse (ref missing when you first\nintroduced uparse). \nBecause this scheme supports a more abstract view of syntaxico-semantic\nstructures than most of the SDP treebanks, it would have been important to use\nthe same metrics as in the related shared task. At this point in the field,\nmany systems, models and data set are competing and I think that the lack of\ncomparison points with other models and parsers is detrimental to this work as\nwhole. Yet I found it interesting and because we're at crossing time in term\nof where to go next, I think that this paper should be discussed at a\nconference such as ConLL.\nNote in random order\n- please introduce the \"grounded semantic\" before page 2, you use\nthat phrase before\n- why haven't you try to stick to constituent-tree with rich node\nlabels and propagater traces and then train/parse with the Berkeley parser? It\ncould have been a good baseline. \n- The conversion to surface dependency trees is in my mind useless: you\nloose too many information, here a richer conversion such as the one from\n'Schluter et al, 2014, Semeval SDP) should have been used.\n- Can you expand on \"UCCA graphs may contains implicit unit that have\nno correspondent in the text\" or provide a ref or an example.\n- You mentioned other representations such as MRS and DRT, this raises\nthe fact that your scheme doesn't seem to allow for a modelling of quantifier\nscope information. It's thus fully comparable to other more syntax-oriented\nscheme. It's indeed more abstract than DM for example and probably more\nunderspecified than the semantic level of the PCEDT but how much? How really\ninformative is this scheme and how really \"parsable\" is it? According to\nyour scores, it seems \"harder\" but an error analysis would have been\nuseful.\n- As I said before, the 3 principles you devised could apply to a lot of\nthings, they look a bit ad-hoc to me and would probably need to take place in\na much wider (and a bit clearer) introduction. What are you trying to argue\nfor: a parser that can parse UCCA? a model suitable for semantic analysis ? or\na semantic oriented scheme that can actually be parsable? you're trying to say\nall of those in a very dense way and it's borderline to be be confusing.\n[1] http://www.corentinribeyre.fr/projects/view/DAGParser\n[2] https://github.com/andre-martins/TurboParser and\nhttps://github.com/andre-martins/TurboParser/tree/master/semeval2014_data"
