In the simplest setup,\nthe words are considered one by one, and each is either put into an existing\n\"bucket\" \"\" if its cosine similarity to the other words in the bucket is below\na certain threshold \"\" or a new bucket is created for the word. Two more\ncomplicated methods based on eigenvectors and reorganisation are also\nsuggested. The method is evaluated on three standard data sets and in a weakly\nsupervised text classification setting. It outperforms or is en par with the\nstate of the art (RÃ¶der et al., 2015).\nThe basic idea behind the paper is rather simple and has a certain ad\nhoc-flavour. The authors do not offer any new explanations for why topic\nquality should be measurable in terms of word\"\"word similarity. It is not\nobvious to me why this should be so, given that topics and word embeddings are\ndefined with respect to two rather different notions of context (document vs.\nsequential context). At the same time, the proposed method seems to work quite\nwell. (I would like to see some significance tests for Table 1 though.)\nOverall the paper is clearly written, even though there are some language\nissues. Also, I found the description of the techniques in Section 3 a bit hard\nto follow; I believe that this is mostly due to the authors using passive voice\n(\"the threshold is computed as\") in places were they were actually making a\ndesign choice. I find that the authors should try to explain the different\nmethods more clearly, with one subsection per method. There seems to be some\nspace for that: The authors did not completely fill the 8 pages of content, and\nthey could easily downsize the rather uninformative \"trace\" of the method on\npage 3.\nOne question that I had was how sensitive the proposed technique was to\ndifferent word embeddings. For example, how would the scores be if the authors\nhad used word2vec instead of GloVe?"
