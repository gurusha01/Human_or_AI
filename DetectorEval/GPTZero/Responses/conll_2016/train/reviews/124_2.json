I think that the idea of introducing eye-tracking\nfeatures as a proxy for cognitive load for sentiment analysis is an interesting\none. \nI think the discussion on the features and comparison of feature sets is clear\nand very helpful. I also like that the feasibility of the approach is\naddressed in section 7.\nI wonder if it would help the evaluation if the datasets didn't conflate\ndifferent domains, e.g., the movie review corpus and the tweet corpus. \nFor one\nit might improve the prediction of movie review (resp. tweets) if the tweets\n(resp. movie reviews) weren't in the training. It would also make the\nresults\neasier to interpret. The results in Table 2 would seem rather low compared to\nstate-of-the art results for the Pang and Lee data, but look much better if\ncompared to results for Twitter data.\nIn Section 3.3, there are no overlapping snippets in the training data and\ntesting data of datasets 1 and 2, right? Even if they come from the same\nsources (e.g., Pang & Lee and Sentiment 140).\nMinor: some of the extra use of bold is distracting (or maybe it's just me);"
