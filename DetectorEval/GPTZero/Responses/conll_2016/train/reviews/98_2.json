It reports results that are on\naverage slightly lower than a couple of delexicalized transfer parsers but\n(sometimes substantially) better on a few non-Indo-European languages.\nThe idea of biasing an otherwise unsupervised parser with some basic\n\"universal\" rules have been used a number of times before in the literature, so\nthe main value of the present paper is an empirical evaluation of this approach\non the new UD treebanks. However, the approach and evaluation leaves some \nquestions unanswered.\nFirst of all, I want to know why only unlabeled parsing is considered. This may\nhave been appropriate (or at least necessary) before dependency labels were\nstandardised, but the whole point of UD is to give a uniform analysis in terms\nof typed dependencies, and any parsing approach that does not take this into\naccount seems misguided. And since the approach is based on manually defined\nuniversal rules, it would have been easy enough to formulate rules for labeled\ndependencies.\nSecond, I would like to know more about how the prior probabilities were set\nor, in other words, what universal grammar they are meant to encode and how.\nWere alternatives tested and, if so, how were they evaluated? In the present\nversion of the paper, we are just presented with a bunch of numbers without any\nexplanation or justification except that they are \"based on UD annotation\nstyle\".\nThird, one of the main claims of the paper is that the unsupervised system\nworks better for non-Indo-European languages. This seems to be supported by the\nraw numbers, but what exactly is going on here? What types of dependencies are\nhandled better by the unsupervised system? Even though a full error analysis\nwould be out of scope in a short paper, an analysis of a small sample could be\nreally interesting.\nFinally, the comparison to the delexicalized transfer parsers seems to be\nbiased by a number of factors. Restricting it to unlabeled dependencies is one\nsuch thing, since the delexicalized parser could easily have produced labeled\ndependencies. Another thing is the amount of training data, which was\narbitrarily restricted to 10,000 tokens per treebank. Finally, it seems that\nthe delexicalized parsers were not properly tuned. Just replacing word forms\nand lemmas by underscores without revising the feature models is not likely to\nproduce optimal results."
