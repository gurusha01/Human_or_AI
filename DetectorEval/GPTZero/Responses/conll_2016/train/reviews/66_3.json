Joint models are one of the most promising things about the\nsuccess of transition-based neural network parsers.\nThere are two contributions here. First, the authors present a new transition\nsystem, that seems better than the Hendersen (2008) system it is based on. The\nother contribution is to show that the neural network succeeds on this problem,\nwhere linear models had previously struggled. The authors attribute this\nsuccess to the ability of the neural network to automatically learn which\nfeatures to extract. However, I think there's another advantage to the neural\nnetwork here, that might be worth mentioning. In a linear model, you need to\nlearn a weight for each feature/class pair. This means that if you jointly\nlearn two problems, you have to learn many more parameters. The neural network\nis much more economical in this respect.\nI suspect the transition-system would work just as well with a variety of other\nneural network models, e.g. the global beam-search model of Andor (2016). There\nare many other orthogonal improvements that could be made. I expect extensions\nto the authors' method to produce state-of-the-art results.\nIt would be nice to see an attempt to derive a dynamic\noracle for this transition system, even if it's only in an appendix or in\nfollow-up work. At first glance, it seems similar to the\narc-eager oracle. The M-S action excludes all semantic arcs between the word at\nthe start of the buffer and the words on the semantic stack, and the M-D action\nexcludes all semantic arcs between the word at the top of the stack and the\nwords in the buffer. The L and R actions seem to each exclude the reverse arc,\nand no other."
