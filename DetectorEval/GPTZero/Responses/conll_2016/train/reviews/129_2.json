            "inputText": "The paper describes a method for in-domain data selection for SMT with a\nconvolutional neural network classifier, applying the same framework as Johnson\nand Zhang, 2015. The method performs about 0.5 BLEU points better than language\nmodel based data selection, and, unlike the other methods, is robust even if\nonly a very small in-domain data set is provided. \nThe paper claims improvements of 3.1 BLEU points. However, from the results we\nsee that improvements of this magnitude are only achieved if there are\nin-domain data in the training set - training only on the in-domain data\nalready produces +2.8 BLEU. It might be interesting to also compare this to a\nsystem which interpolates separate in- and out-domain models. \nThe more impressive result, in my opinion, comes from the second experiment,\nwhich demonstrates that the CNN classifier is still effective if there is very\nlittle in-domain data. However, the second experiment is only run on the zh2en\ntask which includes actual in-domain data in the training set, possibly making\nselection easier. Would the result also hold for the other tasks, where there\nis no in-domain data in the training set? The results for the en2es and en2zh\ntask already point in this direction, since the development sets only contain a\nfew hundred sentence pairs. I think the claim would be better supported if\nresults were reported for all tasks when only 100 sentence pairs are used for\ntraining. \nWhen translating social media text one often has to face very different\nproblems from other domains, the most striking being a high OOV rate due to\nnon-conventional spelling (for Latin scripts, at least). The texts can also\ncontain special character sequences such as usernames, hashtags or emoticons.\nWas there any special preprocessing or filtering step applied to the data? \nSince data selection cannot address the OOV problem, it would be interesting to\nknow in more detail what kinds of improvements are made through adaptation via\ndata selection, maybe by providing examples. \nThe following remarks concern specific sections:\nSection 3.2:\n- It could be made clearer how the different vectors (word embeddings, segment\nvectors and one-hot vectors) are combined in the model. An illustration of the\narchitecture would be very helpful. \n- What was the \"designated loss function\"?\nSection 5.2:\nFor completeness' sake, it could be mentioned how the system weights were\ntuned."
