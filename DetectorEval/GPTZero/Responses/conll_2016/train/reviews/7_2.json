This\nis a random projection method with a random projection matrix whose expected\nvalue is positive. The authors argue that this enables the application of PPMI\nwhich is not possible with an expected value of 0 and that being a random\nprojection method, their computation is efficient.\nMy main reservation about this paper has to do with its clarity. Particularly:\n1. I could not understand the core difference between the method proposed in\nthe paper and previous random projection methods. Hence, I could not understand\nhow (and whether) the advantages the authors argue to achieve hold.\n2. It was hard to follow the arguments of the paper starting from the\nintroduction. \n3. Some of the arguments of the paper are not supported: \n- Line 114: Sentence starts with \"in addition\"\n- Line 137: Sentence starts with \"Since\"\n- Line 154: Sentence starts with \"thus\"\n4. While I have worked on vector space modeling (who hasn't ?), I am not an\nexpert to random projections and have not used them in my research. It was hard\nfor me to understand the logic behind this research avenue from the paper. I\nbelieve that a paper should be self contained and possible to follow by people\nwith some experience in the field.\n5. The paper has lots of English mistakes (86: \"To a large extend\", 142: \"such\nPPMI\").\nIn addition, I cannot see why the paper is evaluating only on MEN. There are a\ncouple of standard benchmarks (MEN, WordSeim, SimLex and a couple of others) -\nif you present a new method, I feel that it is insufficient to evaluate only on\none dataset unless you provide a good justification.\nI recommend that the authors will substantially improve the presentation in the\npaper and will resubmit to another conference."
