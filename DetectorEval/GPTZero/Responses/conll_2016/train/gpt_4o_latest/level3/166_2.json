            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper investigates cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a language-independent model built on cross-lingual wikification. The key contribution lies in leveraging a cross-lingual wikifier to generate language-independent features, enabling direct transfer of NER models across languages without requiring parallel corpora or annotated data in the target language. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through experiments on high-resource (CoNLL) and low-resource languages, showing improvements over existing baselines. The paper also explores the utility of wikifier features in monolingual NER and multi-source training, highlighting the role of Wikipedia size and interlanguage links in determining feature quality.\nWhile the method is well-motivated and yields promising results, the contribution is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The reliance on existing cross-lingual wikification techniques (Tsai and Roth, 2016) and the lack of novel methodological advancements limit the paper's innovation. However, the empirical evaluation is thorough, and the results are convincing, particularly for low-resource languages.\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n1. Demonstrating the utility of cross-lingual wikifier features for NER, particularly in low-resource and multilingual settings.\n2. Providing empirical evidence that training on multiple source languages improves cross-lingual NER performance.\n3. Highlighting the correlation between Wikipedia size and the quality of wikifier features, offering insights into the limitations of the proposed approach.\nStrengths\n1. Clear and Coherent Presentation: The paper is well-structured, with a clear narrative that effectively communicates the motivation, methodology, and results. The inclusion of detailed experimental setups and analyses strengthens the paper's empirical foundation.\n2. Thorough Evaluation: The authors evaluate their approach on nine languages, including five low-resource ones, and compare it against strong baselines. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of wikifier features, particularly in the absence of annotated data.\n3. Practical Utility: The proposed method is simple, scalable, and requires minimal resources (a Wikipedia dump), making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios involving low-resource languages.\nWeaknesses\n1. Incremental Contribution: The paper builds on existing cross-lingual wikification techniques without introducing significant methodological innovations. The novelty primarily lies in applying these features to NER, which limits the paper's impact.\n2. Limited Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not compare its approach against a strong projection-based baseline, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses.\n3. Lack of Statistical Significance Testing: The small improvements reported in Table 4 are not accompanied by statistical significance testing, which weakens the claims of improvement.\n4. Insufficient Related Work Discussion: The paper lacks a detailed comparison with Kazama and Torisawa (2007) and other NER systems leveraging Wikipedia knowledge, which would provide better context for the contributions.\n5. Unexplored Features: The utility of POS tag features (as in Tackstrom et al., 2012) is not explored, and the absence of a running example in Section 3.3 makes it harder to understand the modifications to the wikifier model.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Why was a strong projection-based baseline not included in the experiments? How does the proposed approach compare to such methods?\n2. Can the authors provide insights into why Dutch performs best for Spanish and Spanish for Yoruba in the language pair results? Are there linguistic or cultural factors at play?\n3. Could the inclusion of POS tag features improve the model's performance, especially for low-resource languages?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper contains several typos and unclear sentences that require proofreading. For example, the description of the modifications to the wikifier in Section 3.3 could benefit from a running example to clarify the process. Additionally, mentioning alternative projection methods (e.g., Peirsman and Pado, 2009; Vulic and Moens, 2013) would strengthen the discussion of related work.\nOverall, while the paper's contributions are incremental, its empirical rigor and practical utility make it a valuable addition to the field of cross-lingual NER. Addressing the identified weaknesses could significantly enhance its impact."
