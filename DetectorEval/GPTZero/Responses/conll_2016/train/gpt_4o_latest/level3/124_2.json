            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces the novel concept of using eye-tracking features as a proxy for cognitive load to enhance sentiment analysis, particularly for text with complex constructs such as sarcasm, irony, and thwarted expectations. The authors propose an augmented feature set that combines traditional sentiment features, sarcasm-related features, and cognitive features derived from eye-movement patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of cognitive features improves the F-score by up to 3.7% and 9.3% on two datasets, respectively, compared to systems using only traditional features. The paper also provides a detailed feature significance analysis and discusses the feasibility of the approach, including the potential for real-world applications using mobile eye-tracking technology.\nThe primary contributions of this work are:\n1. Introduction of Cognitive Features for Sentiment Analysis: The paper is the first to use eye-tracking data to derive cognitive features for sentiment analysis, demonstrating their utility in handling nuanced and complex text.\n2. Comprehensive Feature Design and Analysis: The authors provide a well-structured discussion of the feature sets, including traditional sentiment features, sarcasm-related features, and gaze-based cognitive features, along with their individual contributions to classification performance.\n3. Feasibility Discussion: The paper addresses practical concerns about the approach, such as the availability of mobile eye-trackers and potential applications, making a case for its future scalability.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty: The use of eye-tracking data to derive cognitive features for sentiment analysis is a novel and intriguing idea, addressing challenges that traditional linguistic features struggle with, such as sarcasm and implicit sentiment.\n2. Clear and Comprehensive Feature Analysis: The paper provides a detailed breakdown of the feature sets and their contributions, supported by statistical significance tests and feature rankings, which enhance the interpretability of the results.\n3. Robust Experimental Design: The authors evaluate their approach on two datasets and a held-out dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of cognitive features, particularly for complex constructs like sarcasm.\n4. Feasibility and Applicability: The discussion in Section 7 highlights the potential for real-world deployment, leveraging advancements in mobile eye-tracking technology, which adds practical relevance to the work.\nWeaknesses\n1. Domain Conflation in Datasets: The authors combine datasets from different domains (e.g., movie reviews and tweets), which may introduce noise and reduce the interpretability of the results. Separating domains could improve prediction accuracy and provide clearer insights into the efficacy of the proposed features.\n2. Performance on State-of-the-Art Benchmarks: The results for the Pang and Lee dataset (Table 2) are lower than state-of-the-art methods, raising questions about the competitiveness of the approach for simpler text without complex constructs.\n3. Potential Dataset Overlap: It is unclear whether the training and testing datasets (e.g., Pang & Lee and Sentiment 140) have overlapping snippets, which could artificially inflate performance metrics. This needs clarification.\n4. Distracting Formatting: The excessive use of bold text throughout the paper detracts from readability and professionalism.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Did you ensure that there is no overlap between the training and testing datasets, particularly for Pang & Lee and Sentiment 140? If not, how might this affect the reported results?\n2. Have you considered evaluating your approach on datasets from distinct domains (e.g., separating movie reviews and tweets) to better understand the domain-specific impact of cognitive features?\n3. Can you provide more details on the computational cost and scalability of extracting gaze-based features, particularly in real-world scenarios with large datasets?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper presents a promising direction for sentiment analysis by incorporating cognitive features, but further refinement in dataset handling and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods is necessary to strengthen its contributions. The feasibility discussion is a valuable addition, but practical implementation details, such as user consent and data privacy, should be explored further."
