The authors propose two parsing approaches: (1) conversion-based methods leveraging existing parsers and (2) a novel transition-based parser, Broad-coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), designed to directly handle UCCA's structural properties. The paper evaluates these methods on UCCA-annotated corpora, achieving an F-score of nearly 70% on primary edges for the highest-performing parser. The authors also make their tools publicly available, which is a valuable contribution to the community.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are: \n1. The introduction of BSP, a novel transition-based parser explicitly designed for UCCA's structural requirements, including multiple parents, nonterminal nodes, and discontinuous units. \n2. A systematic evaluation of conversion-based and direct parsing approaches for UCCA, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each. \n3. The release of parsing tools and conversion protocols, which can facilitate further research in semantic parsing and UCCA.\nStrengths \n1. Novelty of BSP: The development of a parser tailored to UCCA's unique structural features is a significant contribution, addressing gaps in existing semantic parsing approaches. The parser's ability to handle remote edges, albeit with limited success, is a step forward in broad-coverage semantic parsing. \n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates multiple parsing strategies, including conversion-based methods and direct parsing, providing a well-rounded analysis of their performance. The inclusion of out-of-domain experiments demonstrates the robustness of the proposed methods. \n3. Public Availability: The authors' commitment to releasing their tools and datasets is commendable and will likely encourage adoption and further development of UCCA parsing. \nWeaknesses \n1. Overstated Claims in the Introduction: The introduction implies that UCCA is the only viable graph-based semantic representation formalism, which is an overstatement. Other formalisms, such as AMR and SDP, also address broad-coverage semantic phenomena, albeit with different design choices. \n2. Ambiguity of \"Grounded\" Terminology: The term \"grounded\" is used ambiguously, and its necessity as a criterion for semantic representation is not convincingly argued. Alternative terms like \"anchored\" or \"lexicalized\" might better convey the intended meaning. \n3. Underwhelming Parsing Results: The BSP parser's performance on primary edges is comparable to existing parsers (e.g., MaltParser), but its results on remote edges are low. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of BSP over enhanced versions of existing parsers, such as MaltParser with reconstruction methods. \n4. Limited Exploration of Prior Work: The paper could benefit from a deeper engagement with prior work on dependency graph-to-tree conversion, which might improve parsing results. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. Could you clarify the specific advantages of UCCA's \"grounded\" representation over non-grounded alternatives like AMR, particularly in practical applications? \n2. Have you considered incorporating LSTM-based classifiers into BSP to improve its performance, given the success of the LSTM parser in your experiments? \n3. How do you envision the use of UCCA parsing in downstream tasks like machine translation or summarization, and what challenges do you foresee? \nOverall Recommendation \nWhile the paper makes a valuable contribution by introducing BSP and exploring UCCA parsing, the overstated claims, low performance on remote edges, and lack of compelling evidence for BSP's superiority over existing parsers temper its impact. With revisions to the introduction and further improvements to the parser, this work has the potential to make a stronger contribution to the field."
