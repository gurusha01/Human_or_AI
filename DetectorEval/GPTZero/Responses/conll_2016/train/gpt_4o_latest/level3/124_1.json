            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection by incorporating cognitive features derived from human annotators' eye-movement patterns. The authors argue that these cognitive features, when combined with traditional linguistic features, can better handle the nuanced and complex constructs often present in user-generated text. The main contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Novelty of Cognitive Features: The paper is the first to propose using gaze-based cognitive features for sentiment analysis, demonstrating their potential to capture subtleties like sarcasm and thwarted expectations.\n2. Empirical Validation: The authors show that incorporating cognitive features improves F-scores by up to 3.7% and 9.3% on two datasets, compared to systems using only traditional features.\n3. Feature Significance Analysis: The paper provides a detailed analysis of feature importance, highlighting the contribution of gaze-based features in improving classification performance, particularly for complex constructs like irony and sarcasm.\nStrengths\n1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a logical flow and clear explanations of the methodology, experiments, and results.\n2. Innovative Idea: The use of cognitive features derived from eye-tracking data is highly innovative and represents a significant departure from traditional NLP approaches. This idea has the potential to inspire further research in integrating psycholinguistic insights into NLP tasks.\n3. Empirical Evidence: The authors provide extensive experimental results, including performance comparisons, statistical significance tests, and feature importance analysis, which lend credibility to their claims.\nWeaknesses\n1. Motivation for Cognitive Features: The paper does not convincingly justify why cognitive features are necessary for sentiment analysis. While the results show marginal improvements, the theoretical motivation for using eye-tracking data remains underexplored. For example, why should cognitive features outperform deep learning methods that automatically learn complex representations?\n2. Marginal Performance Gains: The reported improvements in F-scores (3.7% and 9.3%) are relatively modest, especially considering the additional complexity and cost of collecting eye-tracking data. The practical utility of such small gains in real-world applications is questionable.\n3. Feasibility Concerns: The feasibility of the proposed approach is not adequately addressed. The example in Section 7.2, which discusses using mobile eye-trackers for applications like e-commerce, seems speculative and lacks concrete evidence or implementation details. Additionally, the reliance on eye-tracking hardware may limit the scalability and accessibility of the approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a stronger theoretical justification for why cognitive features derived from eye-tracking are expected to outperform other feature engineering or deep learning approaches?\n2. How do you envision scaling this approach to large datasets or real-world applications, given the logistical challenges of collecting eye-tracking data?\n3. Have you considered alternative ways to simulate or approximate cognitive features without requiring actual eye-tracking hardware?\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents an innovative idea and is well-executed in terms of experiments and analysis, the marginal performance gains and feasibility concerns limit its practical impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the authors addressing the motivation for cognitive features and providing a more robust discussion of the approach's scalability and real-world applicability."
