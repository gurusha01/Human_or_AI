            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions \nThis paper investigates the use of probabilistic models, specifically Gaussian Processes (GPs), for Machine Translation Quality Estimation (QE) with a focus on estimating uncertainty rather than relying solely on point estimates. The authors argue that uncertainty estimates are crucial for real-world applications, particularly in scenarios with asymmetric risks. The paper introduces the use of Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD) as a metric to evaluate uncertainty and explores the application of warped GPs and MatÃ¨rn kernels to improve predictive performance. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the utility of predictive distributions in asymmetric risk scenarios, providing a compelling case for moving beyond traditional point-estimate metrics.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are: \n1. A detailed exploration of probabilistic QE models, emphasizing uncertainty estimation and its importance in real-world applications. \n2. The introduction of NLPD as a preferred evaluation metric for probabilistic models in QE, alongside experiments demonstrating its advantages over traditional point-estimate metrics. \n3. A novel application of asymmetric loss functions to simulate real-world scenarios, showcasing the practical benefits of uncertainty-aware models. \nStrengths \n1. Clear Motivation and Problem Framing: The paper is well-structured, with a clear introduction that highlights the limitations of point estimates in QE and motivates the need for uncertainty-aware models. The discussion of asymmetric risk scenarios is particularly insightful and relevant to practical applications. \n2. Accessible Explanation of GPs: The theoretical background on Gaussian Processes, kernel choices, and warping is explained in a manner that is accessible to readers, even those less familiar with the topic. This makes the paper educational and engaging. \n3. Evaluation in Asymmetric Scenarios: The exploration of asymmetric loss functions (e.g., AL and linex losses) and their integration with predictive distributions is a novel and practical contribution, demonstrating the real-world utility of the proposed models. \n4. Well-Written Results Section: Section 4 provides an intuitive and thorough explanation of the results, linking them back to the research questions and practical implications. \nWeaknesses \n1. Choice of Post-Editing Rates: The decision to use post-editing rates as the response variable instead of more established metrics like HTER is not well-justified. This raises concerns about the generalizability and relevance of the findings. \n2. Unclear Trend Analysis: The trend analysis in Section 3.2 for the fr-en, en-de, and en-es datasets is not well-explained. The results are difficult to interpret, and the discussion lacks clarity, particularly regarding the differences between datasets. \n3. Lack of State-of-the-Art Baseline Comparison: The paper does not include a comparison with a state-of-the-art point-estimate model, which would provide a stronger baseline for evaluating the proposed probabilistic models. \n4. Interpretability of Metrics: While the paper emphasizes NLPD and NLL, these metrics are hard to interpret without qualitative examples. Including examples of predictions with uncertainty estimates would provide better context for the reported reductions. \n5. Limited Novelty: While the paper highlights the importance of uncertainty estimation, it does not introduce significant modeling innovations or advance the state-of-the-art in QE. The work primarily applies existing GP techniques to a new evaluation framework. \nQuestions to Authors \n1. Why was post-editing rate chosen as the response variable instead of HTER or other established metrics? Could this choice limit the applicability of the findings? \n2. Can you provide qualitative examples or case studies to contextualize the reductions in NLPD and NLL? \n3. How do the proposed models compare to state-of-the-art point-estimate models in terms of both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency? \nAdditional Comments \n- There are minor issues, such as a typo in Section 4, an incorrect figure caption, and missing references to the GP modeling toolkit used. These should be addressed in the final version. \n- The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the trend analysis in Section 3.2, particularly for the en-es dataset. \nRecommendation \nThis paper is a solid contribution to the field of QE, particularly in its emphasis on uncertainty estimation and asymmetric risk scenarios. However, the lack of justification for key decisions (e.g., choice of response variable), unclear trend analysis, and absence of a state-of-the-art baseline comparison limit its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these concerns."
