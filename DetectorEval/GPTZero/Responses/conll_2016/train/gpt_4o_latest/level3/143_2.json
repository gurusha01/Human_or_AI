            "inputText": "Review\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper introduces two novel dictionary-based methods for estimating multilingual word embeddings: MultiCluster, which is clustering-based, and MultiCCA, which leverages canonical correlation analysis (CCA). These methods are designed to work without requiring parallel corpora, relying instead on monolingual data and bilingual dictionaries. The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, multiQVEC-CCA, which improves upon the QVEC metric by addressing its theoretical shortcomings and extending it to multilingual settings. A web portal is developed to facilitate evaluation and benchmarking of multilingual embeddings, providing a valuable resource for the community. The paper evaluates the proposed methods on a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, demonstrating competitive performance in some cases.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of Methods: The introduction of MultiCluster and MultiCCA as dictionary-based approaches for multilingual embeddings is a significant contribution. These methods provide an alternative to parallel corpus-based approaches, broadening the applicability of multilingual embeddings to resource-scarce languages.\n2. Improved Evaluation Metric: The proposed multiQVEC-CCA metric addresses key limitations of QVEC, such as sensitivity to basis rotation and dimensionality, and demonstrates better correlation with downstream tasks. This is a meaningful advancement in the evaluation of multilingual embeddings.\n3. Practical Contributions: The development of a web portal for evaluating multilingual embeddings is a valuable resource for the research community. It promotes reproducibility and standardization in this area of research.\n4. Writing Quality: The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it accessible to readers. The authors provide detailed explanations of their methods and evaluation framework.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Depth in Analysis: While the paper covers a broad range of tasks and metrics, it sacrifices depth in discussing the results. For instance, the conflicting outcomes of MultiCluster across different tasks are not sufficiently analyzed, and the effects of hyperparameters are not explored in detail.\n2. Limited Insights into Research Questions: The paper focuses heavily on practical contributions but provides limited theoretical insights into why the proposed methods perform as they do. For example, the performance gap between MultiCluster and MultiCCA is not thoroughly explained.\n3. Missing Correlation Results: The paper does not include correlation results for monolingual QVEC and QVEC-CCA, which would have provided a more complete picture of the evaluation framework.\n4. Related Work Coverage: While the paper cites relevant prior work, it misses several important studies in multilingual embeddings, clustering, and translational context, which could have strengthened the discussion of contributions and positioning of the work.\n5. Minor Issues: There are minor issues with phrasing (e.g., \"cross-lingual datasets\") and formatting (e.g., equations exceeding margins). These detract slightly from the overall presentation quality.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more detailed insights into the conflicting outcomes of MultiCluster across different tasks? What factors might explain its performance variability?\n2. How sensitive are the proposed methods to the quality and size of the bilingual dictionaries used? Have you tested their robustness in low-resource settings?\n3. Why were correlation results for monolingual QVEC and QVEC-CCA omitted? Could these be included in the final version for completeness?\nRecommendation\nThe paper makes meaningful contributions to the field of multilingual embeddings, particularly with its practical tools and improved evaluation metric. However, the lack of depth in result analysis and theoretical insights limits its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on addressing the identified weaknesses and providing additional analyses where possible."
