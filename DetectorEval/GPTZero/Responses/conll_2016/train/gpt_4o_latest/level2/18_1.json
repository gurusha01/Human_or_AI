The authors propose two approaches: (1) a conversion-based method that maps BSS into related formalisms (dependency and constituency trees) for parsing with existing tools, and (2) a novel transition-based parser, Broad-coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), designed to directly support BSS properties. Experiments are conducted on UCCA-annotated corpora, demonstrating that BSP achieves competitive performance, with nearly 70% labeled F-score for primary edges and some success in predicting remote edges. The authors also make their tools publicly available, promoting reproducibility and further research.\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n1. The introduction of BSP, the first parser to support all three structural properties of BSS.\n2. A thorough evaluation of conversion-based methods for BSS parsing, highlighting their limitations.\n3. Experimental results on UCCA corpora, providing insights into the effectiveness of transition-based methods for semantic parsing.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Scope: The paper introduces a novel parser (BSP) that directly supports BSS properties, addressing a significant gap in semantic parsing research. This is a meaningful contribution to the field, as existing parsers lack support for all three structural properties.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors compare BSP with conversion-based methods and provide detailed results for both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. This evaluation demonstrates the robustness of BSP and highlights areas for improvement.\n3. Practical Impact: By making their tools publicly available, the authors enable further research and practical applications of BSS parsing, particularly in cross-linguistic and semantic tasks.\n4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methods, algorithms, and experimental setup. The inclusion of upper bounds for conversion-based methods provides useful context for interpreting the results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Performance on Remote Edges: While BSP achieves reasonable performance on primary edges, its ability to predict remote edges is limited (13.3% F-score). This is a critical limitation, as remote edges are essential for capturing semantic phenomena like shared arguments.\n2. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: Although the paper compares BSP with existing parsers using conversion-based methods, it does not benchmark against state-of-the-art semantic parsers for related tasks (e.g., AMR or SDP parsing). This limits the broader contextualization of the results.\n3. Classifier Simplicity: The use of a linear classifier with a perceptron algorithm for BSP may limit its performance. The authors acknowledge this and suggest adopting LSTM-based classifiers, but this remains unexplored in the current work.\n4. Error Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed error analysis to identify specific challenges in parsing BSS (e.g., types of errors made by BSP or conversion-based methods). This would provide actionable insights for improving parsing performance.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered integrating pre-trained language models or neural architectures (e.g., transformers) into BSP to improve its performance, particularly for remote edges?\n2. Can you provide more details on the types of errors made by BSP and how they differ from those made by conversion-based methods?\n3. How does BSP perform on languages other than English, given UCCA's cross-linguistic applicability?\nRecommendation\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of semantic parsing by introducing BSP and evaluating BSS parsing methods. While there are limitations in performance and contextual benchmarking, the work is novel, well-executed, and impactful. I recommend acceptance, with encouragement to address the identified weaknesses in future work."
