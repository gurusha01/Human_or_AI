            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the problem of discovering statistically significant correspondences between words in multiple languages using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The authors propose a deterministic algorithm that identifies string-level correspondences without imposing prior assumptions about their distribution or shape. The primary contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Novel MDL-Based Framework: The paper introduces a two-part MDL-based approach for discovering correspondences, which balances model complexity with data description length. This framework is objective, avoids prior assumptions, and allows for fine-grained analysis of linguistic similarities.\n \n2. Efficient Algorithm: The authors propose a deterministic algorithm for correspondence discovery, leveraging Expectation-Maximization (EM) and graph-based alignment techniques. The algorithm is scalable for analyzing multiple languages simultaneously, a significant improvement over pairwise-only methods.\n3. Experimental Validation: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method through experiments on Slavic languages. It constructs phylogenetic trees, quantifies linguistic similarities across subsets of languages, and provides interpretable results that align with linguistic classifications.\n4. Practical Utility: The method allows for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of linguistic correspondences, with potential applications in historical linguistics, language teaching, and multi-language natural language processing (NLP).\nStrengths\n1. Innovative Methodology: The use of MDL for linguistic correspondence discovery is novel and well-grounded in statistical theory. The deterministic nature of the algorithm ensures reproducibility and interpretability, which is particularly valuable for linguists.\n \n2. Scalability Beyond Pairwise Analysis: The ability to analyze correspondences across more than two languages simultaneously is a significant advancement over existing approaches, which are often limited to pairwise comparisons.\n3. Comprehensive Experiments: The experiments are thorough, using both pairwise and multi-language analyses. The results align well with established linguistic classifications, lending credibility to the method.\n4. Flexibility and Customization: The introduction of data over-weighting allows users to adjust the granularity of discovered correspondences, making the method adaptable to different use cases.\n5. Potential for Broader Impact: The approach is not limited to linguistics and could be extended to other domains requiring multi-set correspondence discovery, such as bioinformatics or comparative genomics.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Dataset Scope: The experiments are restricted to Slavic languages, which share significant structural similarities. It is unclear how the method performs on more diverse language families with less regular correspondences.\n2. Computational Bottlenecks: While the method is efficient for small datasets, the scalability to larger datasets or higher numbers of languages remains a concern, as acknowledged by the authors. The reported runtime of several hours for five languages may limit practical applicability.\n3. Lack of Linguistic Interpretation: While the paper emphasizes statistical significance, it provides limited discussion on the linguistic implications of the discovered correspondences. This could hinder adoption by linguists who require more interpretive insights.\n4. Over-Weighting Subjectivity: The introduction of data over-weighting, while useful, introduces subjectivity into the analysis. This could lead to results that are less objective and harder to compare across studies.\n5. Reproducibility Concerns: The paper does not provide sufficient details about the implementation or datasets used, which may hinder reproducibility and independent validation of the results.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the proposed method perform on datasets with languages from different families (e.g., Indo-European vs. Sino-Tibetan)?\n2. Can the algorithm be parallelized to address the computational bottlenecks for larger datasets or higher numbers of languages?\n3. How does the choice of initial alignment (null vs. greedy) affect the final results? Are there cases where one is clearly preferable?\n4. Could you provide more linguistic insights or examples of how the discovered correspondences could be used in practical applications, such as machine translation or historical linguistics?\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a novel and promising approach to linguistic correspondence discovery using MDL. While the method is innovative and well-supported by experiments, its applicability to diverse languages and larger datasets remains to be demonstrated. The paper would benefit from additional discussion on linguistic implications and broader reproducibility. Nonetheless, the work has significant potential and could inspire further research in both computational linguistics and related fields."
