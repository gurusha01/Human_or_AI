            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper addresses the challenge of parsing Broad-Coverage Semantic Structures (BSS), which require support for three key structural properties: multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors propose two approaches: (1) a conversion-based method that maps BSS into related formalisms (dependency and constituency trees) to leverage existing parsers, and (2) a novel transition-based parser, the Broad-coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), which directly supports all three properties. Experiments are conducted on UCCA-annotated corpora, with results demonstrating the feasibility of both approaches and highlighting areas for improvement.\nMain Contributions\n1. Transition-Based Parser for BSS (Primary Contribution): The development of BSP is a significant contribution as it is the first parser to natively support all three structural properties of BSS. This work builds on and extends existing transition-based parsing techniques, introducing novel features and transitions tailored for UCCA.\n \n2. Evaluation of Conversion-Based Methods: The paper provides a thorough assessment of conversion-based approaches, including their strengths and limitations. This evaluation offers valuable insights into the trade-offs between leveraging existing parsers and developing specialized solutions.\n3. Public Release of Tools and Data: The authors commit to releasing their converters and parsers, which will facilitate reproducibility and further research in semantic parsing.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty of BSP: The introduction of BSP fills a significant gap in semantic parsing by supporting multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. This addresses limitations in existing parsers and advances the field.\n \n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates both in-domain and out-of-domain performance, demonstrating the robustness of BSP and providing a baseline for future work.\n3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The detailed description of the transition set, features, and training procedure ensures that the work is transparent and reproducible. The inclusion of upper bounds for conversion-based methods further contextualizes the results.\n4. Impact on Broader Applications: By focusing on UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation, the work has potential implications for multilingual NLP tasks such as machine translation and summarization.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Performance of BSP: While BSP achieves competitive results on primary edges, its performance on remote edges is modest (13.3% F-score). This highlights a need for further refinement, particularly in handling remote edges effectively.\n \n2. Lack of Advanced Classifiers in BSP: The LSTM-based dependency parser outperforms BSP significantly, suggesting that integrating neural architectures into BSP could yield substantial improvements. The current reliance on a linear classifier limits its potential.\n3. Conversion Loss in Dependency Format: The dependency-based conversion approach suffers from substantial information loss, particularly for non-terminal nodes and remote edges. This limits its utility and underscores the need for more sophisticated conversion methods.\n4. Evaluation Metrics: The paper introduces custom evaluation metrics for BSS parsing, but these metrics are not widely used or validated in the community. This may hinder comparability with other semantic parsing approaches.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the performance of BSP compare with other state-of-the-art parsers for semantic representations such as AMR or SDP, beyond UCCA?\n2. Could the integration of neural architectures (e.g., LSTMs or transformers) into BSP improve its performance, particularly for remote edges?\n3. Are there plans to extend BSP to other semantic annotation schemes beyond UCCA? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and addresses an important problem in semantic parsing. While BSP shows promise, further work is needed to improve its performance and scalability. The authors' commitment to releasing their tools is commendable and will likely have a positive impact on the field."
