            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Contributions: \nThis paper introduces TBuckets, a novel approach for measuring the quality of topics generated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The central idea is to group topic words into \"buckets\" based on their semantic similarity, with the coherence of a topic being reflected by the size and organization of these buckets. The authors propose three techniques for bucket creation: (i) TBuckets-Clustering, which uses agglomerative clustering; (ii) TBuckets-SVD, which leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify orthogonal sub-themes; and (iii) TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which reorganizes buckets from TBuckets-SVD to improve coherence. The paper evaluates these techniques on three datasets, demonstrating that TBuckets-SVD-Reorg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of correlation with human-annotated coherence scores. Additionally, the paper highlights the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification, showing that selecting high-quality topics improves classification performance.\nThe primary contributions of the paper are: \n1. TBuckets-SVD-Reorg as a Parameter-Free Coherence Measure: The introduction of TBuckets-SVD-Reorg is a significant contribution, as it outperforms existing methods on two datasets without requiring parameter tuning. This is an important advancement in the field of topic coherence evaluation. \n2. Application to Weakly Supervised Text Classification: The demonstration that TBuckets can improve text classification by prioritizing high-quality topics is a practical and impactful extension of the proposed method. \n3. Novel Use of SVD for Topic Coherence: The use of SVD to identify sub-themes within topics is an innovative approach that provides an interpretable and computationally efficient way to assess topic quality.\n---\nStrengths: \n1. Strong Empirical Results: TBuckets-SVD-Reorg achieves state-of-the-art performance on two out of three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. The parameter-free nature of the method is a notable advantage over existing approaches, which often require extensive tuning. \n2. Practical Utility for Text Classification: The application of TBuckets to weakly supervised text classification is well-motivated and demonstrates the broader applicability of the method. The results show that coherence-based topic selection can significantly improve classification accuracy. \n3. Clear and Intuitive Methodology: The paper provides a clear explanation of the TBuckets approach, including illustrative examples of bucket formation and reorganization. This makes the method accessible and easy to understand. \n4. Robust Evaluation: The use of multiple datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art methods ensures that the results are robust and generalizable. The inclusion of human-annotated coherence scores strengthens the evaluation. \n5. Focus on Interpretability: The emphasis on human interpretability of topics aligns well with the goals of topic modeling and makes the proposed method valuable for real-world applications.\n---\nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Domain-Specific Evaluation: While the authors mention plans to improve word similarity measures for specific domains like Genomics, the current evaluation does not address domain-specific challenges. The performance of TBuckets on specialized datasets with unique vocabularies remains unclear. \n2. Comparative Analysis with Other Techniques: Although TBuckets is compared with state-of-the-art methods, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why TBuckets outperforms existing approaches. A deeper exploration of the strengths and limitations of competing methods would enhance the paper. \n3. Scalability Concerns: The computational cost of TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, particularly for large-scale datasets with many topics and words, is not discussed. This could be a limitation for practical deployment in large corpora. \n4. Limited Exploration of Alternative Metrics: The paper primarily focuses on bucket size and eigenvector similarity for coherence scoring. Exploring additional metrics or combinations could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of topic quality.\n---\nQuestions to Authors: \n1. How does the computational complexity of TBuckets-SVD-Reorg compare to other state-of-the-art methods, particularly for large datasets? \n2. Have you considered evaluating TBuckets on datasets with highly domain-specific vocabularies (e.g., medical or legal texts)? If so, how does it perform compared to general-purpose datasets? \n3. Could the reorganization step in TBuckets-SVD-Reorg introduce instability or variability in coherence scores across runs? If so, how is this mitigated? \n---\nConclusion: \nThis paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to measuring topic coherence with TBuckets, particularly through the parameter-free TBuckets-SVD-Reorg method. The strong empirical results and practical application to text classification make this work a valuable contribution to the field. However, addressing scalability, domain-specific performance, and comparative analysis with other methods would further strengthen the paper. Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
