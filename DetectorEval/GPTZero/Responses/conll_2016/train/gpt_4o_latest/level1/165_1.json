            "inputText": "Review of the Submission\nSummary and Contributions\nThis paper addresses the problem of discovering statistically significant correspondences between words from multiple languages using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The authors propose a deterministic algorithm for inferring correspondence rules and demonstrate its efficacy through experiments on Slavic languages. The key contributions of this paper, as I see them, are:\n1. Novel Application of MDL for Multilingual Correspondence Discovery: The paper introduces a principled approach to identifying string-level correspondences across multiple languages using MDL. Unlike prior methods, it avoids imposing arbitrary assumptions about the shape or distribution of correspondences, making the approach more objective and data-driven.\n2. Efficient Algorithm for Rule Discovery: The authors propose a deterministic algorithm that employs Expectation-Maximization (EM) to iteratively refine correspondence rules. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable to multiple languages, overcoming limitations of pairwise-only approaches in prior work.\n3. Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation: The paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed method through experiments on Slavic languages. It constructs phylogenetic trees, identifies linguistic subgroups, and provides detailed analyses of shared description lengths, offering both quantitative and qualitative insights into language similarity.\nStrengths\n1. Theoretical Rigor: The use of MDL as the foundation for the approach is well-motivated and statistically sound. The authors provide detailed derivations and explanations of the encoding scheme, ensuring clarity and reproducibility.\n2. Scalability Beyond Pairwise Analysis: A significant strength of the proposed method is its ability to analyze correspondences among more than two languages simultaneously. This is a notable advancement over existing methods that are typically limited to pairwise comparisons.\n3. Linguistic Insights: The experiments yield meaningful linguistic insights, such as the identification of subgroups within Slavic languages and the quantification of shared description lengths. The results align well with established linguistic classifications, lending credibility to the approach.\n4. Flexibility for Linguistic Expertise: The ability to incorporate linguistic knowledge and adjust the granularity of discovered correspondences (via data over-weighting) makes the method particularly appealing for linguists.\n5. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the method on multiple datasets, including Swadesh lists and pan-Slavic cognates, and provides detailed examples of discovered correspondences, enhancing the interpretability of the results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization Beyond Slavic Languages: While the method is theoretically general, the experiments are restricted to Slavic languages. It remains unclear how well the approach would perform on unrelated language families or languages with non-alphabetic scripts.\n2. Scalability to Larger Datasets: The computational feasibility of the method for larger datasets or higher numbers of languages is not fully addressed. The reported runtime (a few hours for five languages) suggests potential scalability concerns for broader applications.\n3. Over-Reliance on Data Quality: The method assumes high-quality, gap-free input data for optimal results. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the practical challenges of applying the method to noisy or incomplete datasets are not explored.\n4. Linguistic Interpretability of Rules: While the discovered correspondences are statistically significant, their linguistic interpretability and utility for tasks like machine translation or historical linguistics are not deeply discussed.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How does the method handle languages with non-alphabetic scripts (e.g., logographic or syllabic systems)? Are there any adaptations required for such cases?\n2. Can the algorithm scale to datasets with hundreds of languages or significantly larger vocabularies? If not, what are the main bottlenecks, and how might they be addressed?\n3. How robust is the method to noisy or incomplete data? For example, how does it perform when some languages in the dataset have significant gaps or errors?\nAdditional Comments\nOverall, this paper presents a well-motivated and technically sound approach to multilingual correspondence discovery. While the focus on Slavic languages limits its generalizability, the method has clear potential for broader applications in linguistics and natural language processing. Addressing scalability and robustness concerns in future work would further strengthen the contribution."
