The authors train classifiers to predict PoS tags based on word embeddings and analyze the results to uncover patterns of linguistic interest. Their findings suggest that word embeddings encode PoS-related information, enabling the identification of \"outlier\" words that deviate from their annotated PoS classes. These outliers often reveal inconsistencies in the annotation process or highlight the \"graded\" nature of PoS boundaries. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that PoS-related information is distributed across multiple embedding dimensions, rather than being concentrated in a few.\nMain Contributions\n1. Discovery of Linguistic Outliers: The paper identifies words with distributional patterns that deviate from their annotated PoS classes, shedding light on inconsistencies in existing annotation schemes and supporting the notion of \"soft\" PoS boundaries.\n2. Demonstration of Distributed PoS Information: The authors show that PoS-related information is distributed across numerous embedding dimensions, challenging the notion that specific linguistic features are tied to isolated components of word embeddings.\n3. Potential for Resource-Poor Languages: The paper suggests that embeddings can be used to bootstrap PoS tagging in resource-poor languages, requiring minimal manual annotation of prototypical words.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Linguistic Insights: The paper provides compelling evidence for the graded nature of PoS boundaries, supported by quantitative analysis of misclassified words. This is a valuable contribution to both computational linguistics and theoretical linguistics.\n2. Robust Methodology: The authors employ a well-designed experimental pipeline, including training on a widely used corpus (BNC) and testing on an independent dataset (Universal Dependencies Treebank). The use of cross-validation and error analysis strengthens the reliability of their findings.\n3. Practical Implications: The proposed method for detecting annotation inconsistencies and bootstrapping PoS tagging in resource-poor languages has practical utility, especially for linguistic resource development.\n4. Comparison with Traditional Taggers: By contrasting their approach with the Stanford PoS Tagger, the authors highlight the unique insights that distributional models can provide, such as uncovering systematic annotation errors.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Generalization Across Languages: The experiments are conducted solely on English, which limits the generalizability of the findings. While the authors mention plans to extend the study to other languages, this remains a gap in the current work.\n2. Shallow Exploration of Embedding Components: While the paper identifies that PoS information is distributed across embedding dimensions, the analysis of specific components is limited. A deeper exploration of how individual components contribute to PoS prediction would strengthen the findings.\n3. Overemphasis on Annotation Errors: While the discovery of annotation inconsistencies is interesting, it is unclear how significant these findings are for practical applications. The paper could better contextualize the importance of these errors in improving downstream tasks.\n4. Lack of Comparison with State-of-the-Art PoS Taggers: Although the authors compare their approach with the Stanford PoS Tagger, they do not benchmark their method against modern neural PoS taggers, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Have you considered applying your method to languages with more complex morphology or freer word order than English? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?\n2. Could you provide more details on the specific embedding components (e.g., dimensions 31, 51, and 11) that were most predictive of PoS classes? Are these components interpretable in linguistic terms?\n3. How do you envision integrating your method into existing PoS tagging pipelines for resource-poor languages? Would it complement or replace traditional approaches?\nAdditional Comments\nThe paper is well-written and presents a novel perspective on the relationship between distributional semantics and linguistic categories. However, expanding the scope to include other languages and providing a more detailed analysis of embedding components would significantly enhance its impact."
