            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to identifying correspondences between languages using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The author models relationships between words with shared meanings across multiple Slavic languages by developing codes for rules that match substrings in two or more languages. An MDL objective function is formulated to balance model complexity and data description, given the model. The model is trained using Expectation-Maximization (EM) and evaluated on a dataset of 13 Slavic languages, with results presented through various distance measures, a phylogenetic tree, and examples of discovered correspondences.\nThe motivation behind the approach is sound, and the use of MDL appears to be a reasonable choice for tackling this problem. The justification for employing EM is also well-presented. However, some of the derivations were not entirely transparent to me. The authors note the similarity between the MDL objective and Bayesian inference, which invites comparisons to Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods, such as those using MrBayes. An empirical comparison with these methods could provide valuable insights.\nRegarding related work, the paper lacks a comprehensive comparison to existing methods for borrowing and cognate detection, as well as other computational approaches to historical linguistics. For instance, studies by Alexandre Bouchard-Cote, Tandy Warnow, Luay Nakhleh, and Andrew Kitchen could be relevant. Although some of these methods may not be directly applicable to the given dataset, mentioning List and Moran (2013) would be a good starting point. Additionally, tools from biological phylogeny inference, such as paup and MrBayes, could be explored.\nThe approach and methodology employed in the paper have some limitations. The alignment procedure is computationally expensive, restricting the comparison to only five languages at most. As the paper involves multiple languages and phylogenetic trees, it would be interesting to see how the authors plan to address this issue. Furthermore, the use of neighbor joining for phylogenetic tree construction has known drawbacks, such as requiring manual root specification. More sophisticated methods could be considered. It is also unclear whether EM is run until convergence or if an alternative stopping criterion is used.\nThe data used in the paper consists of two mixed datasets, one containing cognates and the other not necessarily (Swadesh lists). It would be beneficial to examine how this mixture affects the results. Moreover, the data is in orthographic form, which may obscure many correspondences, particularly in languages with different scripts. This could lead to learned rules indicating script changes rather than genuine linguistic correspondences. Working with phonetic transcriptions could mitigate this shortcoming.\nSome aspects of the paper remain unclear, such as the definition of the \"optimal unigram for symbol usages in all rules\" (line 286) and the merging process in the maximization step.\nA minor issue is the use of \"focus in on\" instead of \"focus on\" (line 440).\nReferences:\nJohann-Mattis List, Steven Moran. 2013.
