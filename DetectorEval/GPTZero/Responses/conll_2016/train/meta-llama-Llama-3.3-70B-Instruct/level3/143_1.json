The proposed model is language-independent and can be applied to all languages in Wikipedia, requiring only a Wikipedia dump. The authors evaluate their model on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages, and demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a language-independent model for cross-lingual NER using a cross-lingual wikifier.\n2. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed model on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages.\n3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The novelty of the approach, which combines cross-lingual wikification with NER.\n2. The thorough evaluation of the proposed model on a wide range of languages.\n3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER models.\n2. The limited analysis of the proposed model's performance on low-resource languages.\n3. The need for further research to incorporate other techniques for multilingual NER into the proposed model.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How does the proposed model perform compared to other state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER models?\n2. Can the authors provide more analysis on the performance of the proposed model on low-resource languages?\n3. How do the authors plan to incorporate other techniques for multilingual NER into the proposed model?\nOverall, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach to cross-lingual NER, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of languages. However, further research is needed to compare the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models and to incorporate other techniques for multilingual NER."
