            "inputText": "This paper proposes a new approach to coreference resolution, specifically tailored to Wikipedia articles, with a focus on identifying coreference chains that correspond to the main entity of the article. The authors annotate 30 documents with coreference chains and develop a basic classifier that outperforms simple baselines and state-of-the-art systems on Wikipedia. The task of main concept resolution has the potential to bridge the gap between coreference literature and entity linking literature, providing a useful discourse anchor for coreference with many potential applications in information extraction.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a new version of the coreference task tailored to Wikipedia, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in coreference resolution.\n2. The development of a basic classifier that outperforms simple baselines and state-of-the-art systems on Wikipedia, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n3. The creation of a dataset of 30 annotated documents, which can be used as a testbed for future research in coreference resolution.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The novelty of the proposed approach, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in coreference resolution.\n2. The effectiveness of the developed classifier, which outperforms simple baselines and state-of-the-art systems on Wikipedia.\n3. The creation of a dataset of annotated documents, which can be used as a testbed for future research in coreference resolution.\n4. The potential impact of the proposed approach on information extraction tasks, such as entity linking and question answering.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The limited size of the annotated dataset, which may not be representative of the entire Wikipedia corpus.\n2. The simplicity of the developed classifier, which may not be able to capture the complexity of coreference relationships in Wikipedia articles.\n3. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do you plan to extend the annotated dataset to cover a larger portion of the Wikipedia corpus?\n2. Can you provide more details on the features used in the classifier, and how they were selected?\n3. How do you plan to improve the performance of the classifier, and what are the potential limitations of the proposed approach?"
