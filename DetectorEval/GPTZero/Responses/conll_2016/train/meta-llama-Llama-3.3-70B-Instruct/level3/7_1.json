            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than the state-of-the-art results.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a new approach, TBuckets, to measure topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.\n2. Parameter-Free Techniques: The authors propose two parameter-free techniques, TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which outperform the state-of-the-art techniques that require multiple parameter tuning.\n3. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance of TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, with TBuckets-SVD-Reorg outperforming the state-of-the-art on two out of three datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Use of Word Embeddings: The paper effectively uses word embeddings to compute semantic similarities between words, which is essential for grouping topic words into buckets.\n2. Simple and Intuitive Approach: The TBuckets approach is simple and intuitive, making it easy to understand and implement.\n3. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance of TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Direct Comparison: The paper lacks a direct comparison to related work in the field, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the contributions.\n2. Non-Standard Datasets: The paper uses non-standard datasets for evaluation, which may not be representative of the broader topic modeling community.\n3. Error in Figure 1: The paper contains an error in Figure 1, which only shows two lines instead of three, which may indicate a lack of attention to detail.\n4. Typos and Clarity: The paper contains typos and lacks clarity in some sections, which may make it difficult for readers to understand the contributions.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide a direct comparison to related work in the field, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?\n2. Can you explain why you chose to use non-standard datasets for evaluation, and how you plan to address the lack of representativeness of these datasets?\n3. Can you provide more details on the error in Figure 1 and how you plan to correct it?\n4. Can you clarify the definition of Kendall's tau used in the paper, as it is not standard and may be unclear to readers?"
