            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) by utilizing a cross-lingual wikifier to generate language-independent features. The key contribution of this work is the development of a method that leverages cross-lingual wikification to produce features that can be used for NER in any language, without requiring annotated training data in the target language.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. Language-independent features: The proposed approach generates features that are independent of the language, allowing for direct transfer of a trained NER model across languages.\n2. Cross-lingual wikifier: The use of a cross-lingual wikifier to disambiguate words and phrases to the English Wikipedia, providing valuable information for NER.\n3. Improved performance: The proposed model outperforms strong baselines on a range of languages, including low-resource languages.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Novel approach: The proposed approach is innovative and addresses a significant challenge in cross-lingual NER.\n2. Extensive experimentation: The paper presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed model on a range of languages and datasets.\n3. Improved performance: The proposed model achieves significant improvements over strong baselines.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Dependence on Wikipedia size: The quality of the wikifier features depends on the size of the Wikipedia in the target language, which may limit the applicability of the approach to low-resource languages.\n2. Limited analysis: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach.\n3. Comparison to other approaches: The paper could be strengthened by a more comprehensive comparison to other approaches to cross-lingual NER.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the approach to low-resource languages with small Wikipedia sizes?\n2. Can the authors provide more insight into the characteristics of the languages that are more suitable for the proposed approach?\n3. How do the authors envision the proposed approach being used in practice, and what are the potential applications of this work?"
