            "inputText": "This paper proposes a cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) model that utilizes a cross-lingual wikifier to disambiguate words and phrases to the English Wikipedia, providing language-independent features for NER. The model is trained on annotated documents in one or multiple source languages and can be applied to all languages in Wikipedia. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages, and show significant improvements over strong baselines.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. The development of a language-independent model for cross-lingual NER using a cross-lingual wikifier.\n2. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages.\n3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The proposed approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several languages, including low-resource languages.\n2. The use of a cross-lingual wikifier provides a novel and effective way to obtain language-independent features for NER.\n3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features provides valuable insights into the importance of Wikipedia size for cross-lingual NER.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The related work section could be more detailed, particularly in describing the differences between this paper and other related NER systems that rely on Wikipedia knowledge.\n2. The authors should report experiments with POS tags as features to provide empirical evidence on their usefulness for different languages.\n3. The paper could benefit from a running example in Section 3.3 to clarify the edited model from Tsai and Roth.\n4. The results in Table 4 are not convincing, and a statistical significance test could help support the claims.\n5. The paper needs more careful proofreading to fix typos and improve clarity.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of Wikipedia size and its impact on the quality of wikifier features for low-resource languages?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the cross-lingual wikifier used in the paper and how it is trained?\n3. How do the authors plan to incorporate other techniques for multilingual NER, such as parallel projection and generating training data from Wikipedia automatically, into their model?"
