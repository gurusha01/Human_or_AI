            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures (BSS), which require representing multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors propose two complementary parsing strategies: a conversion-based approach, which leverages existing parsers, and a direct approach, which introduces a new transition-based parser, Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP). \nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. The proposal of a new transition system for BSS parsing, which supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.\n2. The successful application of neural networks to BSS parsing, which outperforms linear models.\n3. The introduction of a novel feature, ratio, which serves as a regularizer for the creation of new nodes.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of existing semantic parsing approaches and motivate the need for a new approach that can handle BSS.\n2. The proposed transition system and parser are well-designed and effective, as demonstrated by the experimental results.\n3. The authors provide a detailed comparison with existing parsers and conversion-based approaches, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The conversion-based approach may not be optimal, as it relies on lossy conversions between different representation formats.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by their parser, which could help to identify areas for improvement.\n3. The experimental results are limited to a single dataset and language (English), which may not be representative of other languages and datasets.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle implicit nodes and edges, which are currently discarded?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the dynamic oracle used for training the parser, and how it is computed?\n3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach on other languages and datasets, and what challenges do they anticipate in adapting their approach to these new settings?"
