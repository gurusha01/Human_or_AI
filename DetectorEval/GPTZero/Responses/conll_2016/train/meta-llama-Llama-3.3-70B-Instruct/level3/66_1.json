            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures, which require the representation of multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors propose a transition-based parser, called Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), that supports these criteria and achieves impressive results on the UCCA Wikipedia corpus.\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper introduces the concept of broad-coverage semantic structures and the challenges associated with parsing them. The authors discuss the limitations of existing parsers and propose a novel transition-based approach that can handle the required structural properties. They also explore a conversion-based parsing approach, which involves converting the broad-coverage semantic structures into related formalisms, such as constituency trees or dependency trees, and then applying existing parsers.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper proposes a novel transition-based parser, BSP, that supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.\n2. The authors explore a conversion-based parsing approach and evaluate its effectiveness in parsing broad-coverage semantic structures.\n3. The paper presents an extensive evaluation of the proposed parser on the UCCA Wikipedia corpus, demonstrating its effectiveness in parsing broad-coverage semantic structures.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a well-written and well-explained methodology, with a clear description of the proposed parser and the conversion-based approach.\n2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed parser, including an analysis of the feature sets and their impact on the parser's performance.\n3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed parser in parsing broad-coverage semantic structures, achieving impressive results on the UCCA Wikipedia corpus.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper builds upon existing work, and the proposed parser may lack originality.\n2. The conversion-based approach may not be as effective as the proposed parser, and the authors could have explored more sophisticated conversion procedures.\n3. The paper could have benefited from a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the parser and the conversion-based approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to improve the performance of the proposed parser, and what future directions do they envision for this research?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the feature sets used in the parser and their impact on the parser's performance?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the conversion-based approach, and what alternative approaches do they propose for parsing broad-coverage semantic structures?"
