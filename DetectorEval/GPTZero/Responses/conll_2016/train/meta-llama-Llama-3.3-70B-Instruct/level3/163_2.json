However, the paper lacks a critical point about the original purpose of PoS tagging in corpora like the BNC, which was to facilitate NLP tasks like parsing. \nThe paper is missing related work in the context of distributional PoS induction, including reviews and non-DNN work from Christodoulopoulos et al. and Blunsom and Cohn. The results in section 5 are not novel due to the existence of similar systems with comparable results, and the paper's contribution is diminished by the lack of related work. \nThe abstract's claim that distributional vectors contain information about PoS affiliation is not a new result, and has been shown by previous distributionally-based PoS induction systems. The assertion that relations between vectors are mostly semantic is incorrect, as previous work has shown that there is syntactic information in these vectors. \nThe decision to move to UPOS tags is questioned, as the fine-grained distinctions of the original tagset may be more interesting. The observation that proper nouns are not similar to common nouns is not particularly interesting, as it can be explained by the existence of function words like \"the\". \nThe analysis of the most frequent word/tag pairs is practical, but it would be interesting to see what happens in the tail of the distribution, and to explore alternatives to pure distributional features for better generalizations of PoS tags. \nThe main contributions of this work are: \n1. The exploration of the connection between part-of-speech tags and word embeddings, \n2. The analysis of the most frequent word/tag pairs, \n3. The proposal of two transition-based techniques for parsing semantic structures. \nThe strengths of this paper are: \n1. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the connection between part-of-speech tags and word embeddings, \n2. The paper proposes two novel transition-based techniques for parsing semantic structures, \n3. The paper provides a detailed evaluation of the proposed techniques. \nThe weaknesses of this paper are: \n1. The lack of related work in the context of distributional PoS induction, \n2. The results in section 5 are not novel due to the existence of similar systems with comparable results, \n3. The paper's contribution is diminished by the lack of related work. \nQuestions to authors: \n1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of related work in the context of distributional PoS induction? \n2. How do the authors plan to improve the novelty of the results in section 5? \n3. How do the authors plan to explore alternatives to pure distributional features for better generalizations of PoS tags? \nAdditional comments: The paper has minor issues, including the need to change sentential references to \\newcite{}. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work and the implications of the results."
