            "inputText": "This paper presents a comparison of delexicalized transfer parsing and minimally supervised parsing techniques on 32 languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank collection. The authors introduce a minimally supervised parser that uses external prior probabilities to guide the parsing process, which are either manually set or learned from other treebanks. The results show that the minimally supervised parser performs better on non-Indo-European languages, making it a suitable choice for low-resourced languages.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The evaluation of a minimally supervised dependency parser on Universal Dependencies treebanks, which provides insights into the effectiveness of this approach for low-resourced languages.\n2. The comparison of delexicalized transfer parsing and minimally supervised parsing techniques, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n3. The introduction of a novel approach to parsing, which combines unsupervised dependency parsing with external prior probabilities.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The thorough evaluation of the minimally supervised parser on a large number of languages, providing a comprehensive understanding of its performance.\n2. The comparison with delexicalized transfer parsing, which provides a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of the minimally supervised approach.\n3. The use of Universal Dependencies treebanks, which ensures that the results are comparable across languages and provides a standardized framework for evaluating parsing techniques.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses:\n1. The paper only considers unlabeled parsing, which may not provide a complete picture of the parser's performance.\n2. The manually set prior probabilities are not fully explained or justified, which may limit the reproducibility of the results.\n3. The comparison with delexicalized transfer parsers is biased due to factors such as restricting to unlabeled dependencies and arbitrary training data limits.\n4. The claim that the unsupervised system works better for non-Indo-European languages needs further analysis to understand what types of dependencies are handled better and why.\nQuestions to the authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the manually set prior probabilities and how they were chosen?\n2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the current evaluation, such as considering labeled parsing and providing a more comprehensive comparison with delexicalized transfer parsers?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the types of dependencies that are handled better by the minimally supervised parser for non-Indo-European languages?"
