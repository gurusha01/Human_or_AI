            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: TBuckets-Clustering, TBuckets-SVD, and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than the state-of-the-art results. They also highlight the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification.\nMain Contributions\n1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.\n2. Improved Performance: The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms the state-of-the-art results on two out of three datasets.\n3. Parameter-Free Techniques: The paper introduces two parameter-free techniques, TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which require no parameter tuning.\nStrengths\n1. Effective Coherence Measurement: The paper proposes an effective approach to measure topic coherence, which is essential for evaluating the quality of topics.\n2. Improved Text Classification: The authors demonstrate the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification, which can lead to better classification performance.\n3. Parameter-Free Techniques: The introduction of parameter-free techniques reduces the computational expense and makes the approach more practical.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Details: The paper lacks details on preprocessing and filtering steps applied to the data, particularly for social media text with high OOV rates and special character sequences.\n2. Unclear Combination of Vectors: The combination of different vectors in the model and the designated loss function used are not clearly explained and could be improved with illustrations and more details.\n3. No System Weights Tuning: The system weights tuning process is not mentioned, which could be an important aspect of the approach.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the preprocessing and filtering steps applied to the data?\n2. How do you plan to extend the approach to other applications beyond text classification?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the system weights tuning process and its impact on the performance of the approach?"
