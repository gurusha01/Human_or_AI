            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures (BSS), which require representing multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors introduce a transition-based parser, called Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), that supports these criteria. They also explore a conversion-based parsing approach, where existing parsers are applied to converted representations of BSS.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a novel transition-based parser, BSP, that supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.\n2. The exploration of a conversion-based parsing approach, which assesses the ability of existing technology to address the task.\n3. The first experimentation on UCCA parsing, which demonstrates the effectiveness of BSP with a primary edge F-score of 69.2%.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. The introduction of a novel parser that addresses the limitations of existing parsers in handling BSS.\n2. The thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including a comparison with conversion-based methods and an analysis of the feature sets.\n3. The potential impact of this work on incorporating deeper semantic structures into various applications, such as machine translation and summarization.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses:\n1. The technical details of the paper are unclear in some parts, requiring more explanation and context.\n2. The introduction's third paragraph is confusing, with unclear statements about deriving a new approximation and evaluating features.\n3. The decision to use the same word vectors for pivot and target is questionable, and the motivation for this choice is not clear.\n4. The concepts of separating words from a marginal distribution and co-adaptation are unclear and need further explanation.\n5. The paper lacks a clear evaluation, with no quantitative results or comparison to other methods, and the example clusters and figure captions are insufficient.\nTo improve this paper, the authors should address these weaknesses by providing more clarity and context, justifying their design choices, and including a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, the authors should consider the following questions:\n* How do the results of BSP compare to other state-of-the-art parsers on BSS tasks?\n* Can the conversion-based approach be improved by using more sophisticated conversion procedures or target representations?\n* How can the proposed approach be extended to handle implicit nodes and inter-sentence relations in UCCA annotations?"
