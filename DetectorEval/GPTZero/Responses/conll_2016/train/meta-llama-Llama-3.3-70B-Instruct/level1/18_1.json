            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures (BSS), which require representing multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors introduce two transition-based techniques for parsing such semantic structures: (1) applying conversion procedures to map them into related formalisms and using existing state-of-the-art parsers on the converted representations, and (2) constructing a parser that directly supports the full set of properties.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The proposal of a novel transition-based parser, Broad-coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), that supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.\n2. The introduction of a conversion-based parsing approach to assess the ability of existing technology to address the task.\n3. The first experimentation on UCCA parsing, which demonstrates the effectiveness of transition-based methods for BSS parsing.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the transition set, features, and training procedure.\n2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with BSP obtaining comparable F-scores to state-of-the-art parsers on primary edges and outperforming them on remote edges.\n3. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the results, including feature ablation and error analysis, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The conversion-based approach may lose information during the conversion process, which can affect the accuracy of the parser.\n2. The proposed approach requires a significant amount of annotated data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work on semantic parsing, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of information loss during the conversion process?\n2. Can the proposed approach be applied to other semantic representation schemes, such as AMR or SDP?\n3. How do the authors plan to improve the accuracy of the parser, particularly on remote edges?"
