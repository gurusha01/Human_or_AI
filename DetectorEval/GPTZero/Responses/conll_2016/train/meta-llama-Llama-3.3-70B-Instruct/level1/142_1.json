            "inputText": "This paper proposes the use of probabilistic methods, specifically Gaussian Processes (GPs), for Machine Translation Quality Estimation (QE) to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. The authors argue that traditional point estimate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Pearson's r correlation coefficient, do not capture the uncertainty of predictions, which is crucial in real-world translation environments.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. The use of GPs for QE, which allows for the estimation of uncertainty in predictions.\n2. The proposal of the Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD) metric to evaluate the performance of probabilistic QE models, which takes into account the full posterior predictive distribution.\n3. The application of asymmetric loss functions, such as the asymmetric linear (AL) loss and the linear exponential (linex) loss, to scenarios with asymmetric risk, which can capture the different consequences of over and underestimates.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. The authors provide a thorough motivation for the use of probabilistic methods in QE, highlighting the limitations of traditional point estimate metrics.\n2. The proposal of NLPD as a evaluation metric for probabilistic QE models is well-justified and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.\n3. The application of asymmetric loss functions to QE is novel and provides a more realistic representation of the risks involved in translation scenarios.\n4. The experiments are well-designed and provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed methods, including a comparison with traditional point estimate metrics.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. The authors assume that the uncertainty estimates provided by the GP models are well-calibrated, which may not always be the case.\n2. The use of a single dataset for each language pair may not be representative of the entire range of possible translation scenarios.\n3. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed methods, which may be a concern for large-scale translation applications.\n4. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for the development of QE systems and their potential applications in real-world translation environments.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of well-calibrated uncertainty estimates in GP models, and what methods can be used to evaluate the calibration of the uncertainty estimates?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed methods and how they can be optimized for large-scale translation applications?\n3. How do the authors envision the application of asymmetric loss functions in real-world translation scenarios, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of using these loss functions in practice?"
