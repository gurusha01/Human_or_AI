Lack of analysis: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance, including error analysis and ablation studies.\n3. Dependence on pretrained embeddings: The model relies on pretrained word embeddings, which may not be available for all languages or domains.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. How does the model perform on other languages and domains, and what are the limitations of the approach?\n2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance, including error analysis and ablation studies?\n3. How does the model compare to other state-of-the-art models, including those that use expert-crafted features and more complex inference algorithms?"
