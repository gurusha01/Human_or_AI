Introduction of a minimally supervised parser: The authors propose a novel approach to parsing that combines unsupervised dependency parsing with external prior probabilities, which can be useful for low-resourced languages.\n3. Evaluation on a large set of languages: The authors evaluate their approach on 32 languages, providing a comprehensive analysis of the results.\nThe strengths of this paper are:\n1. Thorough evaluation: The authors provide a detailed evaluation of their approach, including a comparison with state-of-the-art delexicalized transfer parsers.\n2. Novel approach: The introduction of a minimally supervised parser is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a new approach to parsing low-resourced languages.\n3. Large-scale evaluation: The evaluation on 32 languages provides a comprehensive analysis of the approach, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.\nThe weaknesses of this paper are:\n1. Limited analysis of the results: While the authors provide a thorough evaluation, they could have provided a more in-depth analysis of the results, including a discussion of the linguistic factors that affect the performance of the parsers.\n2. Lack of comparison with other unsupervised parsing approaches: The authors could have compared their approach with other unsupervised parsing approaches, providing a more comprehensive analysis of the field.\n3. Limited discussion of the implications of the results: The authors could have provided a more detailed discussion of the implications of their results, including the potential applications of their approach to low-resourced languages.\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the linguistic factors that affect the performance of the parsers, and how these factors vary across languages?\n2. How do you plan to extend your approach to other low-resourced languages, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?\n3. Can you provide a more detailed comparison of your approach with other unsupervised parsing approaches, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?"
