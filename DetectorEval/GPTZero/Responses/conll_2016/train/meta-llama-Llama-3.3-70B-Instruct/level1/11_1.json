The authors propose a binary classification approach that exploits Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases like Freebase to classify mentions as coreferent or not. They design a classifier that outperforms state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems on this task and demonstrate its benefits in a full coreference resolution pipeline applied to Wikipedia texts.\nMain Contributions\n1. Adaptation of coreference resolution to Wikipedia: The authors adapt coreference resolution to Wikipedia, a large, multilingual, and highly structured encyclopedia, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Effective use of Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of using Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases like Freebase to improve coreference resolution performance.\n3. Simple yet powerful classification approach: The authors propose a simple yet powerful classification approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of identifying mentions of the main concept in a Wikipedia article.\nStrengths\n1. Significant improvement over state-of-the-art systems: The authors' approach achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems on the task of identifying mentions of the main concept in a Wikipedia article.\n2. Effective use of Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of using Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases like Freebase to improve coreference resolution performance.\n3. Simple and efficient classification approach: The authors propose a simple and efficient classification approach that can be easily integrated into existing coreference resolution pipelines.\n4. Release of datasets and resources: The authors release datasets and resources used in the study, allowing other researchers to reproduce and build upon their results.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited evaluation on a small dataset: The authors evaluate their approach on a relatively small dataset, which may not be representative of the entire Wikipedia corpus.\n2. Lack of comparison to other Wikipedia-specific coreference resolution systems: The authors do not compare their approach to other Wikipedia-specific coreference resolution systems, which may have achieved similar or better performance.\n3. Dependence on Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases: The authors' approach relies heavily on Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases, which may not always be available or accurate.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to identify all coreference relations in a Wikipedia article, as mentioned in the conclusion?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the datasets and resources released, including the size and characteristics of the datasets?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their approach, including the dependence on Wikipedia markup and external knowledge bases?"
