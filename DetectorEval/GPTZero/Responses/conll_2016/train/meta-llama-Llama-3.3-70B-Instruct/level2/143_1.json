The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, multiQVEC-CCA, which addresses the limitations of the existing QVEC metric. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods and evaluation metric through extensive experiments on 59 languages, using a range of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics.\nMain Contributions\n1. MultiCluster and multiCCA methods: The paper proposes two dictionary-based methods for estimating multilingual word embeddings, which do not require parallel data.\n2. MultiQVEC-CCA evaluation metric: The authors propose an improved evaluation metric, multiQVEC-CCA, which addresses the limitations of the existing QVEC metric and obtains better correlations with downstream tasks.\n3. Web portal for evaluation: The paper introduces a web portal for evaluating multilingual word embeddings, which provides a suite of evaluation metrics and facilitates sound experimentation practices.\nStrengths\n1. Effective methods: The proposed multiCCA method consistently outperforms other methods in most evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n2. Improved evaluation metric: The proposed multiQVEC-CCA metric obtains better correlations with downstream tasks, providing a more reliable evaluation metric.\n3. Comprehensive experiments: The paper conducts extensive experiments on 59 languages, using a range of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed methods.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited analysis of multiCluster method: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the multiCluster method, which may limit its understanding and adoption.\n2. Dependence on dictionary quality: The proposed methods rely on the quality of the dictionaries used, which may affect their performance in practice.\n3. Limited comparison to other methods: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison to other existing methods for multilingual word embeddings, which may limit the understanding of the proposed methods' strengths and weaknesses.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the multiCluster method and its limitations?\n2. How do you plan to address the dependence on dictionary quality in the proposed methods?\n3. Can you provide a more comprehensive comparison to other existing methods for multilingual word embeddings?"
