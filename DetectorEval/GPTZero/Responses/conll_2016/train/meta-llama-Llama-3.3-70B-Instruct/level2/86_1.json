The authors introduce their own tools, App2Check and Tweet2Check, which are based on supervised learning techniques and outperform 19 research tools on various test sets.\nMain Contributions\n1. App2Check and Tweet2Check: The authors propose two predictive models for sentiment quantification, one specialized on apps reviews and one on tweets, which achieve high accuracy and outperform state-of-the-art research tools.\n2. Experimental Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation of their tools and 19 research tools on various test sets, including app reviews and tweets in Italian and English languages.\n3. Comparison with State-of-the-Art Tools: The authors compare their tools with state-of-the-art research tools, including iFeel, SentiStrength, and Sentiment140, and demonstrate the superiority of App2Check and Tweet2Check.\nStrengths\n1. High Accuracy: App2Check and Tweet2Check achieve high accuracy on various test sets, outperforming state-of-the-art research tools.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation of their tools and state-of-the-art research tools on various test sets.\n3. Practical Applications: The authors demonstrate the practical applications of their tools, including sentiment analysis of app reviews and tweets.\nWeaknesses\n1. Lack of Details on Engine: The authors do not provide detailed information on the engine behind App2Check and Tweet2Check due to non-disclosure restrictions.\n2. Limited Comparison with Other Tools: The authors primarily compare their tools with state-of-the-art research tools, but do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other commercial tools.\n3. Neutral Class Identification: The authors note that identifying neutral reviews is challenging, and their tools may not perform as well on this class.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the engine behind App2Check and Tweet2Check, such as the specific machine learning algorithms used?\n2. How do you plan to address the challenge of identifying neutral reviews, and what strategies can be employed to improve performance on this class?\n3. Can you provide a more comprehensive comparison with other commercial tools for sentiment analysis, and how do App2Check and Tweet2Check compare to these tools?"
