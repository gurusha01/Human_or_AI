The authors investigate Gaussian Processes (GPs) and their extensions, such as MatÃ¨rn kernels and Warped GPs, to model uncertainty in QE. They evaluate the models using the Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD) metric, which takes into account the full posterior predictive distribution. The paper also explores the application of asymmetric loss functions, such as the asymmetric linear and linex losses, to scenarios with asymmetric risk.\nMain Contributions\n1. Probabilistic modeling of QE: The paper proposes the use of GPs and their extensions to model uncertainty in QE, which is a significant improvement over traditional point estimate-based methods.\n2. Evaluation using NLPD: The authors evaluate the models using NLPD, which provides a more comprehensive measure of model performance than traditional point estimate-based metrics.\n3. Application to asymmetric risk scenarios: The paper demonstrates the use of asymmetric loss functions to scenarios with asymmetric risk, such as post-editing and gisting, and shows that the proposed models can provide better performance in these scenarios.\nStrengths\n1. Novel approach to QE: The paper proposes a novel approach to QE by using probabilistic methods to model uncertainty, which is a significant improvement over traditional methods.\n2. Comprehensive evaluation: The authors evaluate the models using a comprehensive metric, NLPD, which provides a more complete picture of model performance.\n3. Practical applications: The paper demonstrates the practical applications of the proposed models to real-world scenarios, such as post-editing and gisting.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited experimentation: The paper only experiments with a limited number of datasets and models, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.\n2. Lack of comparison to other methods: The paper does not compare the proposed models to other state-of-the-art methods for QE, which makes it difficult to assess their performance relative to other approaches.\n3. Limited analysis of results: The paper provides limited analysis of the results, which makes it difficult to understand the implications of the findings.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. How do the proposed models perform compared to other state-of-the-art methods for QE?\n2. Can the authors provide more analysis of the results, such as visualizations of the predictive distributions and uncertainty estimates?\n3. How can the proposed models be extended to other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and text classification?"
