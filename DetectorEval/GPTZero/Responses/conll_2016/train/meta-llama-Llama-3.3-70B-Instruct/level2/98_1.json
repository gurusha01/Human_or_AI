The authors introduce a minimally supervised parser that uses external prior probabilities to push the inferred dependency trees in the right direction. The parser is evaluated on its ability to parse languages with unknown syntax, and the results show that it performs better on non-Indo-European languages.\nMain Contributions\n1. The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of delexicalized transfer and minimally supervised parsing techniques on a large number of languages.\n2. The authors introduce a novel minimally supervised parser that uses external prior probabilities to improve parsing accuracy.\n3. The paper provides insights into the suitability of different parsing techniques for low-resourced languages.\nStrengths\n1. The paper presents a thorough evaluation of different parsing techniques on a large number of languages, providing a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\n2. The introduction of a minimally supervised parser that uses external prior probabilities is a novel contribution that shows promise for improving parsing accuracy on low-resourced languages.\n3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the suitability of different parsing techniques for different language families.\nWeaknesses\n1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the minimally supervised parser and its potential applications.\n2. The authors could provide more insights into the choice of external prior probabilities and their impact on parsing accuracy.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other related work in the field.\nQuestions to Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the choice of external prior probabilities and their impact on parsing accuracy?\n2. How do you plan to extend the minimally supervised parser to handle more complex linguistic phenomena?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the potential applications of the minimally supervised parser for low-resourced languages?"
