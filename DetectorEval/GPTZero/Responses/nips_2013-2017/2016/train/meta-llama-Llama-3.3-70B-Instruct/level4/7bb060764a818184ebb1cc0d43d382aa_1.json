The authors commence by analyzing a linear shallow network, deriving risk bounds and update rules that utilize multinomial sampling for selecting dropout neurons at each update step, incorporating second-order statistics of the data's features. They then extend these update rules to deep networks, leveraging second-order statistics of a layer for mini-batches of data, which also reveals a connection to the internal covariate shift, a well-studied phenomenon in the literature. The proposed technique demonstrates superior convergence and accuracy for both shallow and deep learning across multiple datasets. Notably, the implementation appears straightforward, yet the results show significant performance gains compared to standard dropout, establishing a new state-of-the-art for dropout techniques. This work is expected to have a profound impact and become widely adopted in the near future.
