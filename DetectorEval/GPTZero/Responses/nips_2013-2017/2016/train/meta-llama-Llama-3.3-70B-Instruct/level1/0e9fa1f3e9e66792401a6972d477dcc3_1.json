The method extends the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique to bound the symmetrized KL divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD by integrating it into two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan, and validating it on several models and datasets.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including its strengths and limitations. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms.\nThe paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the area of probabilistic inference and MCMC methods. The authors cite relevant papers and provide a clear discussion of how their work builds upon and extends existing research.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a novel method for evaluating the accuracy of MCMC based posterior inference algorithms\n* The provision of a thorough analysis of the method, including its strengths and limitations\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of BREAD through well-designed experiments\n* The integration of BREAD into two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The method is limited to certain types of MCMC algorithms, such as annealed importance sampling (AIS) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\n* The method requires an exact posterior sample, which can be difficult to obtain in practice\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of BREAD\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of probabilistic inference\n* The method has the potential to be widely applicable and useful in practice\n* The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD\n* The paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The method is limited to certain types of MCMC algorithms\n* The method requires an exact posterior sample, which can be difficult to obtain in practice\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of BREAD\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and that it has the potential to be widely applicable and useful in practice. I recommend acceptance. \nQuality: 9/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are clearly presented.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions of the paper are clearly explained.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe paper presents a novel method for evaluating the accuracy of MCMC based posterior inference algorithms. While the method builds upon existing research, it is a significant contribution to the field.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper has the potential to be widely applicable and useful in practice. The method could be used to evaluate the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms in a variety of fields, including machine learning, statistics, and engineering."
