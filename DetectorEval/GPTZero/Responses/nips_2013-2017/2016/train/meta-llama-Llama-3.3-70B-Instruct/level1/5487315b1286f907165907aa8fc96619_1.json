The model is designed for unsupervised learning of structured predictors, which has been a long-standing pursuit in machine learning. The authors develop a convex formulation that allows for the inference of latent structured representations while maintaining a globally optimal solution.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and background of the problem. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work in the area, including the use of conditional random fields and auto-encoders for structured output prediction. The proposed model is carefully derived, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the convex relaxation and the optimization algorithm used to solve it.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel convex relaxation of a two-layer conditional model that captures latent structure and estimates model parameters jointly and optimally.\n* The development of a efficient optimization algorithm that can solve the convex relaxation.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed model on two machine learning problems: transliteration and inpainting for occluded images.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the support set Y is bounded and admits an efficient polar operator, which may not be the case in all applications.\n* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which may be important for large-scale applications.\n* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised learning of structured predictors, which may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed model.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The proposed model and optimization algorithm have the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and efficient convex relaxation of a two-layer conditional model that captures latent structure and estimates model parameters jointly and optimally.\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model on two machine learning problems: transliteration and inpainting for occluded images.\n* The paper provides a clear and well-written explanation of the proposed model and optimization algorithm.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the support set Y is bounded and admits an efficient polar operator, which may not be the case in all applications.\n* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which may be important for large-scale applications.\n* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised learning of structured predictors, which may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed model.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 8/10\nSignificance: 8/10\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model on two machine learning problems. However, the authors should address the weaknesses of the paper, including providing a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and comparing the proposed model with other state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised learning of structured predictors."
