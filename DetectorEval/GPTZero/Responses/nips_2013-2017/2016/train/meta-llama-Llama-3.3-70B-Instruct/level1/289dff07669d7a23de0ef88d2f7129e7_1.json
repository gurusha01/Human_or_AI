            "inputText": "This paper proposes a modification to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, a popular derivative-free optimization method. The authors introduce the Cholesky-CMA-ES, which replaces the traditional matrix square root update with a triangular Cholesky factorization, reducing the time complexity from O(d^3) to O(Î¼d^2), where Î¼ is typically O(log(d)). This modification is theoretically justified and empirically verified to not impair the algorithm's performance.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the CMA-ES algorithm and its limitations. The proposed modification is thoroughly explained, and the theoretical justification is sound. The empirical evaluation is extensive, comparing the Cholesky-CMA-ES to other CMA-ES variants on various benchmark functions.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed modification is novel and addresses a significant limitation of the traditional CMA-ES algorithm.\n* The theoretical justification is rigorous and well-explained.\n* The empirical evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Cholesky-CMA-ES.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in optimization and linear algebra, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in optimization.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and drawbacks of the proposed modification.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant modification to a widely used optimization algorithm.\n* The theoretical justification is sound, and the empirical evaluation is comprehensive.\n* The paper has the potential to impact the field of optimization and machine learning.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper may be too specialized for a general audience, and the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and drawbacks of the proposed modification.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a significant and novel modification to a widely used optimization algorithm, and the theoretical justification and empirical evaluation are sound. However, I suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more accessible to a broader audience and to provide a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and drawbacks of the proposed modification. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the CMA-ES algorithm and its limitations. The proposed modification is thoroughly explained, and the theoretical justification is sound.\nClarity: 7/10\nThe paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in optimization and linear algebra, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow. Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in optimization.\nOriginality: 9/10\nThe proposed modification is novel and addresses a significant limitation of the traditional CMA-ES algorithm.\nSignificance: 8/10\nThe paper has the potential to impact the field of optimization and machine learning, as the CMA-ES algorithm is widely used in various applications."
