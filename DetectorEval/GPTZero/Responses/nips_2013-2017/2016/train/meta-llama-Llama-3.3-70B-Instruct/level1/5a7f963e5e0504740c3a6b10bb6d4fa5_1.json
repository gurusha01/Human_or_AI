            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the tractability of arithmetic circuits (ACs) and their applications in probabilistic graphical models. The authors investigate the multiplication and summing-out operations on ACs, showing that both operations are intractable for deterministic and decomposable ACs. However, they introduce a sub-class of ACs, called Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), which support a polytime multiplication operator. The authors also demonstrate that PSDDs do not support summing-out in polytime.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow, with appropriate references to previous work. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that PSDDs can be used to compile probabilistic graphical models efficiently.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A thorough investigation of the tractability of ACs and their operations\n* The introduction of PSDDs as a sub-class of ACs with a polytime multiplication operator\n* A clear and concise presentation of the technical results\n* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of a clear comparison with other existing approaches, such as Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) and Algebraic Sentential Decision Diagrams (ASDDs)\n* The limited scope of the experimental results, which only consider Markov networks\n* The absence of a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and arithmetic circuits\n* The introduction of PSDDs as a sub-class of ACs with a polytime multiplication operator is a novel and important result\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks a clear comparison with other existing approaches\n* The scope of the experimental results is limited\n* The absence of a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach may raise concerns about its practical applicability\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly by providing a clear comparison with other existing approaches and a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of the technical results. However, the lack of a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach may raise concerns about its practical applicability.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe introduction of PSDDs as a sub-class of ACs with a polytime multiplication operator is a novel and important result. However, the paper builds on existing work on arithmetic circuits and probabilistic graphical models.\nSignificance: 8/10\nThe paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and arithmetic circuits. The proposed approach has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including probabilistic reasoning and learning."
