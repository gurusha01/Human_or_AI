            "inputText": "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors focus on the cases of `1 and `âˆž losses, which are commonly used to account for sparse or uniform noise models, and provide a sharp condition that ensures the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise in the observations.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their theoretical contributions. The main result, Theorem 1, is a significant extension of previous work on support recovery guarantees, which were limited to smooth loss functions. The authors also provide numerical simulations to illustrate their theoretical findings, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a compressed sensing setting.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise presentation of the theoretical results, with a detailed proof of the main theorem\n* A thorough analysis of the support recovery guarantees, including the derivation of a sharp condition for stability\n* Numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a compressed sensing setting\n* A detailed comparison with previous work on support recovery guarantees, highlighting the significance of the authors' contributions\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a specific form of the loss function, which may not be applicable to all scenarios\n* The analysis is limited to the case of small additive noise, and it is unclear how the results would generalize to larger noise regimes\n* The numerical simulations are limited to a specific setting, and it would be useful to see more extensive simulations to demonstrate the robustness of the approach\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sparse regression and support recovery guarantees. The authors' theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, and the paper provides a clear and concise presentation of the results.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant extension of previous work on support recovery guarantees\n* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their theoretical contributions\n* The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a compressed sensing setting\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a specific form of the loss function, which may not be applicable to all scenarios\n* The analysis is limited to the case of small additive noise, and it is unclear how the results would generalize to larger noise regimes\n* The numerical simulations are limited to a specific setting, and it would be useful to see more extensive simulations to demonstrate the robustness of the approach\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 8/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nOverall score: 8.5/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should consider addressing the limitations of their analysis, such as the assumption of small additive noise, and providing more extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the robustness of their approach."
