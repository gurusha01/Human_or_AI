The authors derive a gradient of the Wasserstein distance with respect to the model parameters and demonstrate its practical potential on data completion and denoising tasks. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a new objective function for Boltzmann machines that incorporates the metric between observations, which is a significant departure from the traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n* The derivation of the gradient of the Wasserstein distance with respect to the model parameters, which is a crucial step in making the approach practical.\n* The demonstration of the approach on real-world datasets, including MNIST and UCI PLANTS, which shows the potential of the method in practice.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The reliance on the Sinkhorn algorithm for computing the Wasserstein distance, which may not be efficient for large datasets.\n* The need for careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the smoothing parameter Î³ and the regularization coefficients Î» and Î·.\n* The lack of a clear understanding of the relationship between the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which may make it difficult to choose between the two objectives in practice.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and interesting approach to training Boltzmann machines that takes into account the metric between observations.\n* The approach has been demonstrated to work well on real-world datasets, including MNIST and UCI PLANTS.\n* The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The approach relies on the Sinkhorn algorithm, which may not be efficient for large datasets.\n* The need for careful tuning of hyperparameters may make the approach difficult to use in practice.\n* The lack of a clear understanding of the relationship between the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence may make it difficult to choose between the two objectives in practice.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and deserves to be accepted. The approach proposed in the paper has the potential to improve the performance of Boltzmann machines on a wide range of tasks, and the demonstration of the approach on real-world datasets is convincing. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, such as the reliance on the Sinkhorn algorithm and the need for careful tuning of hyperparameters. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The approach proposed in the paper is novel and interesting, and the demonstration of the approach on real-world datasets is convincing. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the weaknesses mentioned above.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the ideas are clearly presented. The notation is consistent, and the equations are well-formatted. The paper is easy to follow, and the reader can quickly understand the main ideas.\nOriginality: 9/10\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to training Boltzmann machines that takes into account the metric between observations.
