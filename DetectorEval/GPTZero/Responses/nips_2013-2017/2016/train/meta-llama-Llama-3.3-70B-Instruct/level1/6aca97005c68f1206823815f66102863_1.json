            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. The authors introduce a parametric method that learns a flexible representation of the posterior distribution, allowing for efficient and accurate inference in simulator-based models. The key idea is to use a neural density estimator to learn the posterior distribution, which is then used to guide future simulations and improve the accuracy of the inference.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of likelihood-free inference and the limitations of existing methods. The proposed approach is thoroughly explained, and the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its components. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of existing methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed approach is novel and addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as the need for a large number of simulations and the difficulty of representing complex posterior distributions.\n* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the method, including experiments on several benchmark problems and comparisons with existing methods.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its components.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The proposed approach requires a significant amount of computational resources, particularly for large-scale problems.\n* The authors assume that the simulator-based model is available, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed approach, such as its consistency and convergence rates.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The proposed approach is novel and addresses the limitations of existing methods.\n* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the method, including experiments on several benchmark problems and comparisons with existing methods.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its components.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The proposed approach requires a significant amount of computational resources, particularly for large-scale problems.\n* The authors assume that the simulator-based model is available, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed approach, such as its consistency and convergence rates.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of likelihood-free inference and provides a novel and effective approach to addressing the challenges of simulator-based models. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of the method. I recommend acceptance of the paper. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its components. The evaluation of the method is thorough, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its components.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe proposed approach is novel and addresses the limitations of existing methods. However, the use of neural density estimators is not new, and the authors could have provided more context and motivation for their approach.\nSignificance: 8/10\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of likelihood-free inference and provides a novel and effective approach to addressing the challenges of simulator-based models. However, the impact of the paper could be increased by providing more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed approach and its potential applications in practice."
