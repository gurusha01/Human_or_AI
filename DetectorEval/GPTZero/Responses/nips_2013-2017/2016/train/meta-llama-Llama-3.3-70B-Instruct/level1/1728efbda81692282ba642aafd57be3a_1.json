            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The authors propose a modal decomposition algorithm to perform this analysis, which is reduced to the calculation of orthogonal bases for the Krylov matrix in RKHS and the eigendecomposition of the projection of the Koopman operator onto the subspace spanned by the bases. The algorithm provides a decomposition of the dynamics into a finite number of modes, which can be used as a feature extraction procedure for nonlinear dynamical systems.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its connection to existing methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The empirical examples and applications presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in estimating Koopman modes and predicting future states of nonlinear dynamical systems.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator in RKHSs.\n* The development of a modal decomposition algorithm that can be used to perform this analysis.\n* The provision of empirical examples and applications that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the background and technical details of the Koopman operator and RKHSs, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods such as DMD and other spectral analysis techniques.\n* Some of the empirical examples and applications presented in the paper are relatively simple and may not demonstrate the full potential of the proposed approach.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and original approach to spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems.\n* The proposed algorithm is well-motivated and has the potential to be widely applicable.\n* The empirical examples and applications presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper may be too technical and assume too much background knowledge from the reader.\n* The comparison with existing methods is limited, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach.\n* Some of the empirical examples and applications presented in the paper are relatively simple and may not demonstrate the full potential of the proposed approach.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of nonlinear dynamical systems and spectral analysis, and with some revisions, it could be even stronger. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its connection to existing methods.\nClarity: 8/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. However, the paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the background and technical details of the Koopman operator and RKHSs, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\nOriginality: 9/10\nThe paper presents a novel and original approach to spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator in RKHSs.\nSignificance: 8/10\nThe paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of nonlinear dynamical systems and spectral analysis.
