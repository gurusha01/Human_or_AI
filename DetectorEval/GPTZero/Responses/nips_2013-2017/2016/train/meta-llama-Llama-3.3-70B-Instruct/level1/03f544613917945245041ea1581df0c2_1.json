            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) algorithm, called Stochastic Gradient Richardson-Romberg Langevin Dynamics (SGRRLD), which aims to reduce the bias of existing SG-MCMC methods while keeping the variance at a reasonable level. The approach is based on the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation method, which involves running two chains with different step sizes in parallel. The authors provide a formal theoretical analysis of SGRRLD, including its asymptotic consistency, central limit theorem, and non-asymptotic bounds for bias and mean squared error.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical analysis. The experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of SGRRLD in reducing bias and improving convergence rates compared to existing SG-MCMC methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel SG-MCMC algorithm that addresses the bias issue in existing methods\n* A thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including its asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties\n* Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The algorithm requires running two chains in parallel, which may increase computational costs\n* The choice of step sizes and mini-batch sizes may require careful tuning in practice\n* The paper could benefit from more discussions on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed algorithm\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and theoretically sound algorithm that addresses a significant issue in SG-MCMC methods\n* The experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in reducing bias and improving convergence rates\n* The paper is well-written and provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical analysis\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The algorithm may be computationally more expensive than existing methods due to the need to run two chains in parallel\n* The paper could benefit from more discussions on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed algorithm\n* The choice of step sizes and mini-batch sizes may require careful tuning in practice, which could be a limitation in some scenarios.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and theoretically sound algorithm that addresses a significant issue in SG-MCMC methods, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness. However, the authors should be encouraged to provide more discussions on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed algorithm, as well as to explore ways to reduce the computational costs and improve the practicality of the algorithm."
