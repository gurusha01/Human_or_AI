The authors consider an adversarial setting where both buyer valuation and window size are selected adversarially. The main contribution of the paper is the development of an online algorithm that achieves a regret bound of O(T2/3) with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight. The authors also provide a matching lower bound of ç«(T2/3), demonstrating that the regret bound is tight.\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the model, algorithm, and proofs. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of related work and the implications of their results. The use of a reduction from a multi-armed bandit problem with switching costs to prove the lower bound is particularly clever.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The development of a novel model of strategic buyers that captures the complexity of real-world pricing scenarios\n* The design of an online algorithm that achieves a tight regret bound\n* The provision of a matching lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of the algorithm\n* The clear and concise writing style, making the paper easy to follow\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of an adversarial setting, which may not be realistic in all scenarios\n* The limitation of the model to a single seller and a single item, which may not capture the complexity of multi-seller or multi-item settings\n* The lack of experimental evaluation, which would provide additional insight into the performance of the algorithm in practice\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online learning and pricing, and the results have important implications for practitioners and researchers alike. The paper is well-suited for publication at NIPS, and I would recommend acceptance.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of online learning and pricing\n* The results are well-motivated and have important implications for practitioners and researchers\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the model, algorithm, and proofs\n* The use of a reduction from a multi-armed bandit problem with switching costs to prove the lower bound is particularly clever\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The assumption of an adversarial setting may not be realistic in all scenarios\n* The limitation of the model to a single seller and a single item may not capture the complexity of multi-seller or multi-item settings\n* The lack of experimental evaluation may limit the paper's impact and relevance to practitioners."
