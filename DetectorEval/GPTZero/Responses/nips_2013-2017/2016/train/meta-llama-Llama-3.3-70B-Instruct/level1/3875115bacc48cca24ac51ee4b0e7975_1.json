            "inputText": "This paper presents two fundamental results on the population likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with at least three components. The first result shows that the population likelihood function can have bad local maxima, even in the case of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians. This resolves an open question of Srebro [2007] and has significant implications for the use of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in practice. The second result demonstrates that the EM algorithm, or its first-order variant, with random initialization will converge to bad critical points with high probability, highlighting the importance of careful initialization.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the population likelihood function and the EM algorithm, and their proofs introduce new techniques for reasoning about the structure of the population log-likelihood.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The resolution of an open question in the field, which has significant implications for the use of EM algorithm in practice.\n* The introduction of new techniques for analyzing the population log-likelihood, which can be applied to other non-convex optimization problems.\n* The clear and thorough presentation of the results, which makes the paper accessible to a wide range of readers.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians, which may not be realistic in many applications.\n* The lack of experimental results to validate the theoretical findings, which would provide further evidence of the importance of careful initialization.\nIn terms of the review criteria, the paper scores high on:\n* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis.\n* Originality: The paper introduces new techniques for analyzing the population log-likelihood and resolves an open question in the field.\n* Significance: The results have significant implications for the use of EM algorithm in practice and highlight the importance of careful initialization.\nHowever, the paper scores lower on:\n* Clarity: While the paper is well-written, some of the technical details may be challenging for non-experts to follow.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents significant and original contributions to the field of machine learning and statistics. \nArguments pro acceptance:\n1. Resolution of an open question in the field.\n2. Introduction of new techniques for analyzing the population log-likelihood.\n3. Clear and thorough presentation of the results.\nArguments con acceptance:\n1. Assumption of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians may not be realistic in many applications.\n2. Lack of experimental results to validate the theoretical findings."
