            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel multivariate online dictionary-learning method, dubbed Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL), for decomposing brain images into structured and sparse components. The method combines a sparsity-inducing `1 penalty with a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms, resulting in more interpretable and denoised dictionaries. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project dataset, comparing their method to state-of-the-art models such as Canonical ICA and sparse online dictionary-learning.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of their method, including the mathematical formulation and algorithmic implementation. The experimental results are convincing, showing that Smooth-SODL outperforms competing methods in terms of explained variance, stability, and prediction of behavioral variables.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance model complexity and interpretability. The authors demonstrate that their method can extract meaningful and structured patterns from large-scale brain data, which is a significant challenge in neuroimaging. The use of a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms is a novel and effective approach, and the authors provide a clear justification for this choice.\nHowever, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of comparison to other methods that incorporate spatial structure, such as TV-`1 minimization. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter Î³ and the sparsity parameter Ï . The paper could also benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and its scalability to larger datasets.\nIn terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in neuroimaging, namely the extraction of meaningful and structured patterns from large-scale brain data. The proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable in the field, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of experiments. Overall, the paper is well-written, well-structured, and makes a significant contribution to the field of neuroimaging.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for decomposing brain images into structured and sparse components.\n* The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem and related work, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities in neuroimaging.\n* The experimental results are convincing, showing that Smooth-SODL outperforms competing methods in terms of explained variance, stability, and prediction of behavioral variables.\n* The paper addresses an important problem in neuroimaging, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable in the field.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other methods that incorporate spatial structure, such as TV-`1 minimization.\n* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter Î³ and the sparsity parameter Ï .\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and its scalability to larger datasets."
