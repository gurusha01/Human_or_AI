            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to neural memory architectures, introducing Sparse Access Memory (SAM), which enables efficient training of neural networks with large external memories. The key innovation is the use of sparse read and write operations, allowing for significant speedups during training while maintaining end-to-end gradient-based optimization.\nThe paper is well-written, clearly presented, and contains sufficient technical details. The authors provide a thorough background on memory-augmented neural networks, including Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks, and motivate the need for scalable memory architectures. The introduction of SAM is well-explained, and the authors provide a detailed description of the architecture, including the sparse read and write operations, the controller, and the efficient backpropagation through time.\nThe paper presents convincing quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements in speed and memory usage compared to dense memory architectures. The authors also show that SAM is able to learn with comparable efficiency to dense models on a range of tasks, including synthetic tasks and real-world datasets such as Omniglot. The results on the Babi tasks are particularly impressive, with SAM achieving state-of-the-art results without supervising memory retrieval.\nThe novelty of the paper is limited, as the combination of sparse read and write operations has been explored in other contexts. However, the application of this approach to neural memory architectures is new and significant. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and demonstrate the generality of their approach by applying it to other architectures, such as the Differentiable Neural Computer.\nThe paper has several strengths, including:\n* Significant improvements in speed and memory usage compared to dense memory architectures\n* Ability to learn with comparable efficiency to dense models on a range of tasks\n* State-of-the-art results on the Babi tasks without supervising memory retrieval\n* Clear and well-written presentation\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:\n* Limited novelty, as the combination of sparse read and write operations has been explored in other contexts\n* Potential limitations in the scalability of the approach to very large memories\n* Need for further investigation into the choice of approximate nearest neighbor indexes and their impact on performance\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural memory architectures and is a strong candidate for acceptance. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this area and provide a well-written and well-motivated paper that presents significant advances in the state of the art.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* Significant improvements in speed and memory usage compared to dense memory architectures\n* Ability to learn with comparable efficiency to dense models on a range of tasks\n* State-of-the-art results on the Babi tasks without supervising memory retrieval\n* Clear and well-written presentation\nArguments against acceptance:\n* Limited novelty, as the combination of sparse read and write operations has been explored in other contexts\n* Potential limitations in the scalability of the approach to very large memories\n* Need for further investigation into the choice of approximate nearest neighbor indexes and their impact on performance\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the limitations and potential areas for further investigation."
