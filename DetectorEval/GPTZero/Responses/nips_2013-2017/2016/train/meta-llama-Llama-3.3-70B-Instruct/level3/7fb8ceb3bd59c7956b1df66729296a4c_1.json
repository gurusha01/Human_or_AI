            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems, allowing for the recovery of true user preferences without the influence of the recommender system. The authors propose a set of assumptions that enable the creation of a tractable model of a recommender system, which is then used to develop an algorithm for deconvolving feedback loops. The algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition of the observed ratings matrix and is able to recover the true ratings matrix up to a scaling constant.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly presents the main ideas and contributions. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the assumptions made and their implications, as well as a detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying items affected by feedback loops and in recovering the true ratings matrix.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide insights into the extent of feedback loops in real-world recommender systems. The authors demonstrate that their approach can be used to identify datasets that use a recommender system and to quantify the extent of recommender effects on the final ratings matrix. The paper also provides a metric for evaluating the influence of a recommender system on each user-item rating pair, which can be used to rank items based on their recommendation score.\nThe paper is closely related to recent work on network deconvolution, and the authors acknowledge this connection. However, the paper makes a significant contribution by extending the ideas to general rectangular matrices and by providing a detailed analysis of the assumptions and their implications.\nSome minor comments on formatting and grammar include capitalizing \"F\" in \"Frobenius\" and correcting minor errors in sentences. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recommender systems and provides a novel approach to deconvolving feedback loops. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, and the paper is well-written and clear.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to deconvolving feedback loops in recommender systems.\n* The approach is based on a set of reasonable assumptions that enable the creation of a tractable model of a recommender system.\n* The algorithm is able to recover the true ratings matrix up to a scaling constant.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying items affected by feedback loops and in recovering the true ratings matrix.\n* The paper provides insights into the extent of feedback loops in real-world recommender systems.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The approach relies on a set of assumptions that may not hold in all cases.\n* The algorithm may not be able to recover the true ratings matrix in cases where the feedback loops are strong.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.\nOverall, I believe that the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recommender systems and provides a novel approach to deconvolving feedback loops. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, and the paper is well-written and clear. I recommend acceptance of the paper."
