The authors characterize the limits of the population EM algorithm and prove its equivalence to the sample-based EM algorithm in terms of asymptotic properties. The focus of the work is on the performance of the EM algorithm for two specific models, mixture of two Gaussian distributions, providing a complete description of its performance.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including a thorough review of the related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the population EM algorithm, including proofs of convergence and characterization of the fixed points.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A thorough analysis of the population EM algorithm, including proofs of convergence and characterization of the fixed points.\n* A clear and concise introduction to the problem, including a thorough review of the related work.\n* The authors provide a complete description of the performance of the EM algorithm for two specific models, mixture of two Gaussian distributions.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The proofs in the paper are considered unreasonably long given the specific model focus.\n* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the EM algorithm in practice.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the population EM algorithm, and the results are interesting and relevant to the field. The paper is worthy of acceptance, despite the lengthy proofs, due to the limited understanding of mixtures of even two Gaussian components.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the population EM algorithm, including proofs of convergence and characterization of the fixed points.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including a thorough review of the related work.\n* The results are interesting and relevant to the field.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The proofs in the paper are considered unreasonably long given the specific model focus.\n* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the EM algorithm in practice.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a significant contribution to the field. The results are original and relevant, and the paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem. Overall, the paper is worthy of acceptance."
