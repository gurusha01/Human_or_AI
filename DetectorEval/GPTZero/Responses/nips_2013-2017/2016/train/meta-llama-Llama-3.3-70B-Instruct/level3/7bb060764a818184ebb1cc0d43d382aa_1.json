            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel technique for improving the performance of deep neural networks by using multinomial sampling for dropout. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the risk bound for stochastic optimization with multinomial dropout and demonstrate that a distribution-dependent dropout leads to faster convergence and smaller generalization error. The proposed approach is applied to both shallow and deep networks, and experimental results on several benchmark datasets show significant improvements in convergence speed and testing error compared to standard dropout.\nThe paper is well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, a thorough review of related research, and a detailed explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the experimental results are convincing. The paper also provides a good discussion of the implications of the results and potential future directions.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel technique for improving the performance of deep neural networks\n* A thorough theoretical analysis of the risk bound for stochastic optimization with multinomial dropout\n* Experimental results on several benchmark datasets that demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed and testing error\n* A clear and well-organized presentation of the material\nThe weaknesses of the paper are minor and include:\n* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in machine learning and optimization\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach\n* Some of the experimental results could be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and deep learning. The proposed technique has the potential to improve the performance of deep neural networks in a wide range of applications, and the theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of the approach.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant technique for improving the performance of deep neural networks\n* The theoretical analysis is sound and provides a clear understanding of the benefits and limitations of the approach\n* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed and testing error\n* The paper is well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper may be of limited interest to readers without a strong background in machine learning and optimization\n* The computational complexity of the proposed approach could be a limitation in some applications\n* Some of the experimental results could be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed."
