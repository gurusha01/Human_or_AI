TrailBlazer alternates between Avg and Max nodes, using a Monte Carlo estimator to compute average values and eliminating low-value children with high probability.\nThe paper improves upon previous worst-case upper bounds for finite state spaces with stochastic dynamics and provides new results for infinite state spaces. The introduction of TrailBlazer is a significant contribution to the field, as it has the potential to be applied to various planning problems.\nThe strengths of the paper include its thorough theoretical analysis and the provision of theoretical guarantees. The algorithm's ability to alternate between Avg and Max nodes and eliminate low-value children with high probability is also a notable strength.

Arguments against acceptance include the need for more intuition on why TrailBlazer works better than other algorithms and the algorithm's limitations. Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves consideration for acceptance.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of the TrailBlazer algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The significance of the paper is high, as it has the potential to be applied to various planning problems and improve upon existing algorithms.\nIn conclusion, the paper is a strong contribution to the field, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.
