            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel method, Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), to evaluate the accuracy of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based posterior inference algorithms. The method extends the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique to estimate the Jeffreys divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference on simulated data and provide a protocol for using this technique to analyze sampler accuracy on real-world data.\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed method is potentially useful for debugging and evaluating MCMC implementations, which is a significant challenge in probabilistic inference. The idea of using BDMC to diagnose failures of a sampler to converge is novel and has the potential to improve the reliability of MCMC-based inference. The authors also provide a clear and detailed derivation of the estimator, which upper bounds the Jeffreys divergence in expectation.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. The derivation in Section 3.1 is hard to follow, with undefined notations and a lack of clarity, requiring the reader to refer to the supplement for better understanding. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear statement of how to apply the method from start to finish, requiring the reader to piece together the information. There are also minor issues with notation and formatting, such as the use of unnecessary variables and missing close parentheses.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and provides a clear derivation of the estimator. The paper also meets the criteria for originality, as the proposed method is novel and has the potential to improve the reliability of MCMC-based inference. However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity, as the derivation and protocol for applying the method are not clearly stated.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and potentially useful method for evaluating the accuracy of MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. However, the authors should be encouraged to revise the paper to improve clarity and address the minor issues with notation and formatting.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The proposed method is novel and has the potential to improve the reliability of MCMC-based inference.\n* The paper provides a clear and detailed derivation of the estimator.\n* The method is potentially useful for debugging and evaluating MCMC implementations.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The derivation in Section 3.1 is hard to follow and requires the reader to refer to the supplement for better understanding.\n* The paper lacks a clear statement of how to apply the method from start to finish.\n* There are minor issues with notation and formatting."
