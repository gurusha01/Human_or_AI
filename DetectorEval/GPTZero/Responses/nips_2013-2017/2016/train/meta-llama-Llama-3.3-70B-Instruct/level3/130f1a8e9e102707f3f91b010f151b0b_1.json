            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel online dictionary learning framework, dubbed Smooth-SODL, for identifying structured and sparse components in brain images. The method extends previous work on online dictionary learning by incorporating a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on a large public dataset, showcasing improved performance in capturing inter-subject variability and predicting behavioral variables.\nThe paper is well-motivated, and the proposed method addresses a significant problem in neuroimaging. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work, setting the stage for their contributions. The technical sections are well-organized, and the notation is consistent throughout. The experiments are thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.\nHowever, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. While the authors provide some intuition and justification for their approach, a more rigorous theoretical framework would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the authors appear to be careless in writing the paper, with leftover comments and minor errors throughout the text. A more careful review of the draft before submission would improve the overall quality of the paper.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The proposed method is novel and addresses a significant problem in neuroimaging, making it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, the lack of theoretical analysis and careless writing detract from the paper's overall quality.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for online dictionary learning in neuroimaging.\n* The experiments demonstrate improved performance in capturing inter-subject variability and predicting behavioral variables.\n* The method has the potential to become a widely used tool in the field of neuroimaging.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n* The authors appear to be careless in writing the paper, with leftover comments and minor errors throughout the text.\n* The paper could benefit from a more rigorous review of the draft before submission to improve the overall quality.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The authors should provide a more thorough theoretical analysis and carefully review the draft to improve the overall quality of the paper."
