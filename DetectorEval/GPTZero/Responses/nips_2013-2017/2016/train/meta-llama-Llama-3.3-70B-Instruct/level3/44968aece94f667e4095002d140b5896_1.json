            "inputText": "This paper discusses the problem of setting reserve prices for buyers who participate for a limited number of rounds and buy only if the minimum price is below their reserve. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves O(T2/3) regret over any sequence of T buyers with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight and prove that no algorithm can perform better in the worst case.\nThe paper's main contributions come from the lower bound proved in the paper, which highlights the difficulty of achieving lower regret due to the lost revenue that the seller suffers every time she tries to lower costs. The authors also provide an upper bound, which relies on creating epochs where the price within each epoch is fixed, and the number of epochs limits the number of times the seller switches prices.\nHowever, the paper's abstract needs significant improvement to better represent the content and contributions of the paper. The authors should emphasize that the problem can be viewed as a policy regret problem, putting this key aspect front and center.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of related work. The algorithm and its analysis are well-explained, and the proof of the lower bound is convincing. The authors also provide a discussion of the implications of their results and potential future directions.\nHere are the arguments for and against acceptance:\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper provides a novel algorithm for setting reserve prices in a strategic buyer setting.\n* The authors prove a lower bound that highlights the difficulty of achieving lower regret.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of related work.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper's abstract needs significant improvement.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the implications of their results and potential future directions.\n* The paper assumes a discrete set of prices, and it is not clear how the results would extend to continuous pricing.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, but the authors should revise the abstract and provide more discussion on the implications of their results and potential future directions. The paper's contributions to the field of algorithmic game theory and online learning are significant, and the results have important implications for practice."
