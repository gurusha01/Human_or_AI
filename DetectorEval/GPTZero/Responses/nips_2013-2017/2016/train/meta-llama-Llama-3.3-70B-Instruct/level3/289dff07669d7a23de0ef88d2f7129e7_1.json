            "inputText": "This paper proposes a new variant of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, called Cholesky-CMA-ES, which updates the covariance matrix using triangular Cholesky factors. This approach reduces the complexity and memory needs of the algorithm, making it more efficient for large-scale optimization problems. The authors provide a theoretical justification for the convergence of the new algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on various benchmark functions.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the background and motivation for the proposed algorithm. The authors provide a detailed description of the Cholesky-CMA-ES algorithm and its properties, including its asymptotically optimal time complexity and optimal memory complexity. The experimental results show that the Cholesky-CMA-ES algorithm requires the same number of function evaluations as the standard CMA-ES algorithm but significantly reduces the wall-clock time, especially for large dimensions.\nThe strengths of the paper include its clear and concise writing style, the thorough explanation of the algorithm and its properties, and the comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the related work and the advantages of their approach over other methods.\nOne minor weakness of the paper is that the authors could provide more clarification on the implementation details of the Cholesky-CMA-ES algorithm, such as how the triangular Cholesky factors are updated and how the inverse of the Cholesky factor is computed. Additionally, some of the results in Figure 2 could be explained in more detail, such as the sudden increase in wall-clock time for the CMA-ES-Ref algorithm at high dimensions.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization and is expected to become a default method for medium/large-scale applications due to its advantages. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the CMA-ES algorithm and its limitations, and their proposed variant addresses some of the key challenges in large-scale optimization.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a new and efficient algorithm for large-scale optimization problems.\n* The authors provide a thorough theoretical justification for the convergence of the algorithm.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in reducing wall-clock time while maintaining the same number of function evaluations as the standard CMA-ES algorithm.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the background and motivation for the proposed algorithm.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could provide more clarification on the implementation details of the Cholesky-CMA-ES algorithm.\n* Some of the results in Figure 2 could be explained in more detail.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed algorithm."
