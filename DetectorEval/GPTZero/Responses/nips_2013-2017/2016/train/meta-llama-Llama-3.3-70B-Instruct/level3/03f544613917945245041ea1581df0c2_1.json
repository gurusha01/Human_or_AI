            "inputText": "This paper proposes a framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) where the learner interacts with a domain expert through same-cluster queries to improve clustering performance. The authors introduce a novel notion of clusterability, called the Î³-margin property, and provide an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under this assumption. They also establish a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard clustering problems feasible.\nThe paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of the SSAC problem, which is a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm proposed is simple and efficient, making it a practical solution for real-world clustering tasks.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between the clustering and query complexity literatures. The authors demonstrate that access to a limited number of same-cluster queries can significantly improve the computational efficiency of clustering algorithms, even under conditions that render the problem NP-hard without such queries.\nThe paper also raises interesting questions about the trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity in clustering. The authors show that there is a sharp phase transition between the regime where clustering is NP-hard and the regime where it becomes efficiently solvable with a reasonable number of queries.\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n* Introduction of the SSAC framework and the Î³-margin property\n* Development of an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under the Î³-margin assumption\n* Establishment of a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard clustering problems feasible\nThe paper has some minor issues, such as a potentially misleading figure and a need for further discussion on the bias in one of the results. However, these issues do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, well-written, and provides a clear contribution to the field. The authors have also done a good job of relating their work to previous research in the area.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering that has significant potential for improving clustering performance in real-world applications.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of the SSAC problem, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The paper raises interesting questions about the trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity in clustering.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper may not be revolutionary in terms of its technical contributions, as the algorithm proposed is a straightforward application of existing techniques.\n* The paper could benefit from further discussion on the practical implications of the results and the potential applications of the SSAC framework.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication at NIPS. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering, and its results have important implications for the development of more efficient and effective clustering algorithms."
