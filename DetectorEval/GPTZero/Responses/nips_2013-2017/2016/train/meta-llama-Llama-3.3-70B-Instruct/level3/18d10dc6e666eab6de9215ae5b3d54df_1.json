The q-KG method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art batch-sequential Bayesian optimization algorithms in numerical experiments on both synthetic test functions and practical machine learning algorithms, especially in the presence of noisy function evaluations.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed description of the proposed method. The authors provide a clear motivation for the development of the q-KG method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive numerical experiments.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a novel batch-sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm that is derived from a decision-theoretical perspective.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the q-KG method in numerical experiments on both synthetic test functions and practical machine learning algorithms.\n* The provision of a clear and detailed description of the proposed method, including the derivation of the q-KG factor and the computation of its gradient.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper lacks a study on the speed-ups from sequential to batch-sequential Bayesian optimization, which would be useful in understanding the benefits of the proposed method.\n* There are some imprecise statements in the literature review, which could be clarified or removed.\n* The paper raises several technical questions and remarks, including the compactness and continuity of the function A, the restriction of A to be an LHS, and the hyperparameter re-estimation in Algorithm 1, which could be addressed in future work.\n* The paper contains some minor mistakes, including an incorrect specification of the MatÃ©rn parameter and a potential issue with the reproducibility of the experiments using different software.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization. The proposed q-KG method has the potential to be widely used in practice, especially in the presence of noisy function evaluations.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel batch-sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm that is derived from a decision-theoretical perspective.\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the q-KG method in numerical experiments on both synthetic test functions and practical machine learning algorithms.\n* The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the proposed method, including the derivation of the q-KG factor and the computation of its gradient.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks a study on the speed-ups from sequential to batch-sequential Bayesian optimization.\n* There are some imprecise statements in the literature review.\n* The paper raises several technical questions and remarks that could be addressed in future work.\n* The paper contains some minor mistakes that could be corrected in a revised version.\nIn conclusion, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization.
