            "inputText": "This paper presents a modification to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, a popular derivative-free optimization method. The authors propose replacing the matrix square root in the CMA-ES with a triangular Cholesky factor, leading to a new algorithm called Cholesky-CMA-ES. This change reduces the time complexity of the covariance update from O(d^3) to O(Î¼d^2), where Î¼ is the number of updates and d is the dimensionality of the search space.\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, including a theoretical justification for the convergence of the algorithm and empirical results demonstrating its performance on various benchmark functions. The authors show that the Cholesky-CMA-ES requires the same number of function evaluations as the standard CMA-ES but significantly reduces the wall-clock time, especially for high-dimensional problems.\nThe strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, thorough analysis, and empirical evaluation. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the CMA-ES algorithm and its modification, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the topic. The empirical results are convincing, demonstrating the superiority of the Cholesky-CMA-ES over other CMA-ES variants.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in optimization and linear algebra, which might make it challenging for readers without this expertise to fully appreciate the contributions. Additionally, the authors could have provided more discussion on the limitations of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, such as its scalability to extremely high-dimensional problems or its performance on non-convex functions.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis and empirical evaluation, demonstrating the technical soundness of the paper. The writing is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow. The paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, providing a significant improvement over existing methods.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant improvement over existing CMA-ES algorithms, reducing the time complexity of the covariance update.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis and empirical evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Cholesky-CMA-ES.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers familiar with the topic.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in optimization and linear algebra, which might limit its accessibility to a broader audience.\n* The authors could have provided more discussion on the limitations of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, such as its scalability to extremely high-dimensional problems or its performance on non-convex functions.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of optimization and provides a thorough analysis and empirical evaluation. However, the authors could consider addressing the limitations and providing more discussion on the potential applications and future directions of the Cholesky-CMA-ES."
