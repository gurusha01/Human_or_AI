            "inputText": "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors focus on the cases of `1 and ` losses and provide a sharp condition that ensures the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise in the observations. The paper also includes numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings on a compressed sensing scenario.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases α {1,+ } that allows one to control the deviation of the support of the minimizer from the true support; (2) they identify an \"extended support\" and show that this extended support is stable to small additive noise; and (3) they provide numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings.\nThe support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The authors use a novel proof strategy to establish the stability of the support recovery, which is different from the classical approach developed for smooth loss functions. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide insights into the behavior of the support recovery under different noise models.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical results and numerical simulations. The use of notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the mathematical concepts and techniques used.\nThe paper has several strengths, including: (1) it provides a novel proof strategy for establishing the stability of support recovery; (2) it includes numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings; and (3) it provides insights into the behavior of support recovery under different noise models.\nHowever, the paper also has some limitations, including: (1) the analysis is limited to the cases of `1 and ` losses; (2) the numerical simulations are limited to a specific scenario; and (3) the paper does not provide a comparison with other existing methods.\nIn terms of usefulness, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of sparse regression and compressed sensing. The theoretical results and numerical simulations provide insights into the behavior of support recovery under different noise models, which can be useful for practitioners and researchers in the field.\nThe paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field and the relevant literature. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical results and numerical simulations, and they demonstrate a good understanding of the mathematical concepts and techniques used.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in the provision of a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases α {1,+ } and the identification of an \"extended support\" that is stable to small additive noise. The paper also provides a novel proof strategy for establishing the stability of support recovery, which is different from the classical approach developed for smooth loss functions.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical results and numerical simulations. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods and a more extensive analysis of the numerical simulations.\nThe limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, and they provide a clear explanation of the limitations and potential extensions of the work.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical results and numerical simulations. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field and the relevant literature, and it provides a significant contribution to the field of sparse regression and compressed sensing.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper provides a novel proof strategy for establishing the stability of support recovery.\n* The paper includes numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings.\n* The paper provides insights into the behavior of support recovery under different noise models.\n* The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field and the relevant literature.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The analysis is limited to the cases of `1 and ` losses.\n* The numerical simulations are limited to a specific scenario.\n* The paper does not provide a comparison with other existing methods.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions.
