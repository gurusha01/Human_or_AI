The authors investigate the non-convex optimization algorithms used in practice, which are known to be effective but lack theoretical guarantees. The main claim of the paper is that the commonly used non-convex objective function for positive semidefinite matrix completion has no spurious local minima, implying that many popular optimization algorithms can provably solve the problem with arbitrary initialization in polynomial time.\nThe support for this claim is based on a thorough analysis of the objective function's geometry, which is carefully crafted to exclude spurious local minima. The authors employ a \"simple\" proof strategy, focusing on inequalities linear in the sampling probability, to demonstrate that the function has no spurious local minima. This approach is not only elegant but also generalizable to other statistical problems involving partial or noisy observations.\nThe paper's usefulness is evident in its potential to provide guarantees for various optimization algorithms used in practice, such as stochastic gradient descent. The results are also robust to noise, making them applicable to real-world scenarios where data is often corrupted. The authors' technique for analyzing the effect of the regularizer and its role in modifying the first and second-order conditions is particularly noteworthy.\nThe paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, with a clear and concise overview of previous work on matrix completion and non-convex optimization. The authors' discussion of related work is thorough, and they provide a clear explanation of how their results differ from and build upon existing research.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in its ability to provide a geometric characterization of the matrix completion objective, which has significant implications for the development of optimization algorithms. The authors' use of concentration inequalities to link the full observation objective with the partial observation counterpart is a key innovation, allowing them to establish the desired properties of the objective function.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide a detailed proof of their main result, which is carefully structured to facilitate understanding. The use of appendices to provide additional technical details is also helpful.\nIn terms of limitations, the paper assumes a symmetric matrix completion setting, which may not be applicable to all scenarios. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential extensions to asymmetric matrix completion.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion, providing a thorough analysis of the non-convex optimization algorithms used in practice. The authors' results have important implications for the development of optimization algorithms and demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying geometry of the problem.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion, providing a thorough analysis of the non-convex optimization algorithms used in practice.\n* The authors' results have important implications for the development of optimization algorithms and demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying geometry of the problem.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.\n* The authors provide a detailed proof of their main result, which is carefully structured to facilitate understanding.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a symmetric matrix completion setting, which may not be applicable to all scenarios.\n* The authors do not provide extensive experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.\n* Some of the technical details, such as the concentration inequalities used in the proof, may be challenging for non-experts to follow."
