            "inputText": "This paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs), a widely used random graph model for networks with communities. The authors consider the SBM in its full generality, allowing for a growing number of communities with varying sizes and connectivity probabilities. They provide guarantees for exact recovery via a semidefinite program and upper and lower bounds on SBM parameters for exact recoverability.\nThe paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and mathematical proofs. The authors introduce a key parameter, relative density, which plays a crucial role in their results and provides improvements in the statistical assessment and efficient computational approaches for certain configurations of heterogenous SBM. The paper also presents several examples that illustrate the tradeoffs among the parameters of SBM, leading to recovery guarantees for interesting SBM configurations.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of the related literature. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are provided in the appendix.\nThe paper's strengths include:\n* The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the SBM in its full generality, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The introduction of the relative density parameter is a key insight that allows for improved recovery guarantees.\n* The paper presents several examples that illustrate the tradeoffs among the parameters of SBM, which helps to build intuition and understanding of the results.\nThe paper's weaknesses include:\n* The paper assumes that the number of communities is growing with the number of nodes, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The authors do not provide any experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.\n* Some of the proofs and technical sections may be challenging to follow for readers without a strong background in mathematical analysis and convex optimization.\nOverall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field, and the authors provide a thorough and well-written analysis of the problem. While there are some weaknesses, they do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the SBM in its full generality.\n* The introduction of the relative density parameter is a key insight that allows for improved recovery guarantees.\n* The paper presents several examples that illustrate the tradeoffs among the parameters of SBM.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the number of communities is growing with the number of nodes, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The authors do not provide any experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.\n* Some of the proofs and technical sections may be challenging to follow for readers without a strong background in mathematical analysis and convex optimization.\nHowever, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and I believe that it makes a significant contribution to the field. Therefore, I recommend acceptance."
