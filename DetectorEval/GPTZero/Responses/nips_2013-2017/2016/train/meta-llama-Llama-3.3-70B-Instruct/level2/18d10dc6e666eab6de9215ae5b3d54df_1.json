The main claim of the paper is that q-KG outperforms existing batch Bayesian optimization algorithms, especially in the presence of noisy function evaluations.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of batch Bayesian optimization, and the authors do a good job of motivating the need for a new algorithm. The proposed q-KG algorithm is derived from a decision-theoretical perspective, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of how it works.\nThe paper also provides an extensive evaluation of the q-KG algorithm on several synthetic functions and real-world problems, including hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms. The results show that q-KG consistently outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms, especially in the presence of noise.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed q-KG algorithm is novel and has a strong theoretical foundation.\n* The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the algorithm on several benchmark problems.\n* The authors do a good job of explaining the algorithm and its implementation details.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the function evaluations are independent and identically distributed, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The algorithm requires a significant amount of computational resources to optimize the q-KG factor, which may be a limitation in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of batch Bayesian optimization. The proposed q-KG algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted in practice, especially in applications where function evaluations are expensive and noisy.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated algorithm for batch Bayesian optimization.\n* The algorithm has a strong theoretical foundation and is evaluated extensively on several benchmark problems.\n* The results show that the algorithm outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the function evaluations are independent and identically distributed, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The algorithm requires a significant amount of computational resources to optimize the q-KG factor, which may be a limitation in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of batch Bayesian optimization. However, the authors should address the limitations of the algorithm and provide a more detailed analysis of its computational complexity."
