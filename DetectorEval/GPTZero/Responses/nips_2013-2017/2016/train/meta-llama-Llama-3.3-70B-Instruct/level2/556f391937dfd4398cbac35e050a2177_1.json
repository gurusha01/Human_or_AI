            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings, called Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM), which adapts to the local feature structure in a heterogeneous space. The main claim of the paper is that PDDM can learn a similarity metric that is more effective for hard sample mining, leading to improved performance in image retrieval and transfer learning tasks.\nThe paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on two challenging image retrieval datasets (CUB-200-2011 and CARS196) and two large-scale datasets (ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K) for transfer learning and zero-shot learning. The results demonstrate that PDDM outperforms state-of-the-art deep embedding methods, including those using Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis metric, in terms of recall and accuracy.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n1. Novel approach: PDDM is a new and innovative approach to learning deep feature embeddings, which adapts to the local feature structure in a heterogeneous space.\n2. Effective hard sample mining: The proposed approach can learn a similarity metric that is more effective for hard sample mining, leading to improved performance in image retrieval and transfer learning tasks.\n3. Extensive experiments: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on multiple datasets and tasks.\nHowever, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:\n1. Computational cost: The paper mentions that the proposed approach incurs a lower computational cost than some existing methods, but it would be helpful to provide more detailed analysis and comparison of the computational cost.\n2. Hyperparameter tuning: The paper uses a grid search to select the hyperparameters, but it would be helpful to provide more insight into the sensitivity of the approach to hyperparameter tuning.\n3. Comparison to other metrics: While the paper compares PDDM to Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis metric, it would be helpful to compare it to other metrics, such as cosine similarity or learned metrics.\nOverall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to learning deep feature embeddings, with promising results on multiple datasets and tasks. With some additional analysis and comparison to other approaches, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.\nArguments for acceptance:\n1. Novel approach: PDDM is a new and innovative approach to learning deep feature embeddings.\n2. Effective hard sample mining: The proposed approach can learn a similarity metric that is more effective for hard sample mining.\n3. Extensive experiments: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on multiple datasets and tasks.\nArguments against acceptance:\n1. Limited analysis of computational cost: The paper could provide more detailed analysis and comparison of the computational cost.\n2. Limited comparison to other metrics: The paper could compare PDDM to other metrics, such as cosine similarity or learned metrics.\n3. Limited insight into hyperparameter tuning: The paper could provide more insight into the sensitivity of the approach to hyperparameter tuning."
