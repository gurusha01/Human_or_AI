The authors develop a framework that captures latent structure and estimates model parameters jointly and optimally. The flexibility of the model is demonstrated on two structures based on total unimodularity\"\"graph matching and linear chain. Experimental results confirm the promise of the method.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed convex relaxation of two-layer conditional models with latent structured representation is effective, and (2) the method outperforms local training and other state-of-the-art approaches on two prediction problems with latent structure.\nThe support for these claims comes from the theoretical analysis of the convex relaxation and the experimental results on two datasets. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the convex formulation and demonstrate its effectiveness on graph matching and inpainting tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method, CVX, outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, Local, on the transliteration task and CRF-AE on the inpainting task.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of problems with latent structure. The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in the proposed convex relaxation of two-layer conditional models with latent structured representation. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the convex formulation and demonstrate its effectiveness on two datasets.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, as the authors provide a detailed derivation of the convex formulation and experimental results on two datasets. The limitations of the paper are acknowledged, and the authors provide a discussion of the potential limitations and future directions.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.\n* The proposed method is novel and has the potential to be widely applicable.\n* The experimental results are thorough and well-presented.\n* The authors provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper may benefit from additional experimental results on more datasets.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and future directions.\n* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in machine learning and optimization, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow."
