            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel sampling algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Richardson-Romberg Langevin Dynamics (SGRRLD), which aims to reduce the bias of Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods while keeping the variance at a reasonable level. The algorithm is based on the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation method, which involves running two SG-MCMC chains in parallel with different step sizes.\nThe paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of SGRRLD, including its asymptotic consistency, central limit theorem, and non-asymptotic bounds for bias and mean squared error. The results show that SGRRLD attains higher rates of convergence than existing SG-MCMC methods with first-order integrators, both in finite-time and asymptotically.\nThe paper also presents experimental results on both synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effectiveness of SGRRLD in reducing bias and improving convergence rates. The experiments include a linear Gaussian model and a large-scale matrix factorization problem, where SGRRLD is compared to existing SG-MCMC methods, including Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC).\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of bias in SG-MCMC methods\n* A thorough and rigorous theoretical analysis of SGRRLD\n* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of SGRRLD in reducing bias and improving convergence rates\n* A clear and well-organized presentation of the results\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in SG-MCMC methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow\n* Some of the theoretical results, such as the central limit theorem, are presented without proof, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the underlying mathematics\n* The experimental results are limited to a few specific examples, and it is not clear how well SGRRLD will perform in other settings\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of SG-MCMC methods, and the results have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Bayesian inference in large-scale applications.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated algorithm for reducing bias in SG-MCMC methods\n* The theoretical analysis is thorough and rigorous, and the results are well-supported by experimental evidence\n* The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of Bayesian inference and machine learning\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in SG-MCMC methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo theory, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts\n* The experimental results are limited to a few specific examples, and it is not clear how well SGRRLD will perform in other settings\n* Some of the theoretical results are presented without proof, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the underlying mathematics."
