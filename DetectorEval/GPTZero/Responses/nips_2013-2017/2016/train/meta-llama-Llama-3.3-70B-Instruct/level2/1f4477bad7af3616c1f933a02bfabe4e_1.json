The authors claim that their method is the first practically feasible algorithm to achieve global optimality for a non-trivial neural network model. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach.\nThe main contribution of the paper is the development of a nonlinear spectral method for training neural networks with one or two hidden layers. The authors show that their method converges to the global optimum with a linear convergence rate, and they provide a detailed analysis of the conditions under which this convergence is guaranteed. The authors also present experimental results on several UCI datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical derivations and the algorithmic implementation.\n* The paper presents a novel approach to training neural networks, which guarantees global optimality under certain conditions.\n* The authors provide experimental results on several UCI datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The authors' approach is limited to neural networks with one or two hidden layers, and it is not clear how to extend their approach to deeper networks.\n* The authors' approach requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters, including the number of hidden units, the activation functions, and the regularization parameters.\n* The authors' approach is not directly comparable to other optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and it is not clear how their approach would perform on larger datasets.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neural networks, and the authors' approach has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications. However, further research is needed to extend their approach to deeper networks and to compare their approach to other optimization methods.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to training neural networks, which guarantees global optimality under certain conditions.\n* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical derivations and the algorithmic implementation.\n* The paper presents experimental results on several UCI datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The authors' approach is limited to neural networks with one or two hidden layers, and it is not clear how to extend their approach to deeper networks.\n* The authors' approach requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters, including the number of hidden units, the activation functions, and the regularization parameters.\n* The authors' approach is not directly comparable to other optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and it is not clear how their approach would perform on larger datasets.\nRecommendation:\n* Accept the paper, but require the authors to address the limitations of their approach and to provide more experimental results on larger datasets.\n* Suggest that the authors compare their approach to other optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach.\n* Encourage the authors to extend their approach to deeper networks and to explore the potential applications of their approach in a variety of fields."
