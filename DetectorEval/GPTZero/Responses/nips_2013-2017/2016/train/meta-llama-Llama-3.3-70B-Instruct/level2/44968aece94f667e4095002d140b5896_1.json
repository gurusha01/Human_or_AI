            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel model of strategic buyers with patience, where each buyer has a window of time in which they would like to purchase an item. The seller posts prices in advance for the entire window, and the buyer chooses the lowest price within their window, provided it is lower than their private value. The authors provide an algorithm that achieves an O(T2/3) additive regret in an adversarial setting, compared to the best fixed posted price in hindsight. They also exhibit a matching lower bound of 立(T2/3) regret.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The model is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm and its performance. The lower bound is also well-established, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the reduction from the multi-armed bandit problem with switching costs.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a novel model of strategic buyers with patience, which is a realistic and important extension of existing models.\n* The provision of an algorithm with a guaranteed regret bound, which is a significant improvement over existing results.\n* The establishment of a matching lower bound, which provides a clear understanding of the limits of the problem.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of discrete prices, which may not be realistic in all settings.\n* The lack of consideration of continuous pricing, which may be an important extension of the model.\n* The gap between the upper and lower bounds for continuous pricing, which is an open problem.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of online learning and pricing. The results are interesting and important, and the paper is a valuable addition to the literature.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel and realistic model of strategic buyers with patience.\n* The authors provide a guaranteed regret bound for their algorithm, which is a significant improvement over existing results.\n* The lower bound is well-established, and provides a clear understanding of the limits of the problem.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption of discrete prices may not be realistic in all settings.\n* The lack of consideration of continuous pricing may be a limitation of the model.\n* The gap between the upper and lower bounds for continuous pricing is an open problem, which may be a limitation of the results."
