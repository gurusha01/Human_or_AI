            "inputText": "This paper presents a new algorithm, TrailBlazer, for sampling-based planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The algorithm is designed to be efficient in terms of sample complexity, which is the number of calls to the generative model. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, including its consistency and sample complexity guarantees.\nThe main claims of the paper are that TrailBlazer has a sample complexity that depends on a measure of the quantity of near-optimal nodes, and that it can exploit the structure of the MDP to achieve better performance than previous algorithms. The authors also claim that TrailBlazer is easy to implement and numerically efficient.\nThe support for these claims comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed proof of the algorithm's consistency and sample complexity guarantees, and they also present experimental results that demonstrate the algorithm's performance on a variety of MDPs.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is clear. TrailBlazer has the potential to be a powerful tool for planning in MDPs, particularly in situations where the number of next states is large or infinite. The algorithm's ability to exploit the structure of the MDP could lead to significant improvements in performance, and its ease of implementation and numerical efficiency make it a practical choice for many applications.\nThe paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, citing relevant previous work and providing a clear explanation of the key concepts and techniques. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's limitations and potential areas for improvement.\nThe novelty of the work is significant. TrailBlazer is a new algorithm that combines elements of Monte Carlo planning and tree search to achieve efficient sampling-based planning in MDPs. The algorithm's use of a tree representation and its ability to exploit the structure of the MDP are key innovations that set it apart from previous work.\nThe completeness of the paper is also good. The authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm, including its pseudocode and a clear explanation of its key components. They also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including its consistency and sample complexity guarantees.\nOne potential limitation of the paper is that the analysis of the algorithm's performance is largely theoretical, and it would be useful to see more experimental results to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other algorithms for planning in MDPs.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and detailed presentation of the TrailBlazer algorithm. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field and provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of planning in MDPs.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a new and innovative algorithm for sampling-based planning in MDPs.\n* The algorithm has the potential to be a powerful tool for planning in MDPs, particularly in situations where the number of next states is large or infinite.\n* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, including its consistency and sample complexity guarantees.\n* The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field and provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's limitations and potential areas for improvement.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The analysis of the algorithm's performance is largely theoretical, and it would be useful to see more experimental results to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other algorithms for planning in MDPs.\n* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers who are not experts in the field, and it would be helpful to provide more explanation and context."
