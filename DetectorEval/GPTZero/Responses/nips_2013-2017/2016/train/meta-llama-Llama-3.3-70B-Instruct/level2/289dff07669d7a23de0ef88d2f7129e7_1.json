The main claim of the paper is that the proposed Cholesky-CMA-ES algorithm achieves a better time complexity of O(Âµd2) for the covariance update, while maintaining the same optimization performance as the original CMA-ES. The authors support this claim through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on various benchmark functions.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the CMA-ES algorithm and its limitations. The proposed modification, which replaces the matrix square root with a triangular Cholesky factor, is well-motivated and theoretically justified. The empirical experiments demonstrate a significant increase in optimization speed, especially for high-dimensional problems.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work. The references are relevant and properly cited. The novelty of the paper lies in the proposed modification to the CMA-ES algorithm, which addresses a significant limitation of the original algorithm.\nThe paper is complete, and the authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility. The limitations of the paper are acknowledged, and the authors discuss the potential risks of using low-dimensional approximations for very large optimization problems.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise introduction to the CMA-ES algorithm and its limitations\n* A well-motivated and theoretically justified proposed modification\n* Empirical experiments demonstrating a significant increase in optimization speed\n* A comprehensive review of related work\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with the CMA-ES algorithm and its applications\n* The empirical experiments are limited to a specific set of benchmark functions\n* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm\nOverall, I believe that this paper is a significant contribution to the field of derivative-free optimization and deserves to be accepted. The proposed modification to the CMA-ES algorithm has the potential to improve the optimization performance of many applications, and the empirical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a significant modification to a popular optimization algorithm\n* The proposed modification is theoretically justified and empirically validated\n* The paper reflects common knowledge in the field and provides a comprehensive review of related work\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with the CMA-ES algorithm and its applications\n* The empirical experiments are limited to a specific set of benchmark functions\n* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm\nHowever, I believe that the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance."
