            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThis paper addresses the problem of exact recovery in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) under highly general and heterogeneous settings. The authors extend prior work by considering SBMs with no restrictions on the number, size, or growth of communities, as well as arbitrary connectivity probabilities. They provide exact recovery guarantees using a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach and a modified maximum likelihood estimator. Additionally, the paper explores the case of partial observations, aligning this with the \"Censored Block Model\" in the literature. The results are supported by theoretical bounds and examples that demonstrate the recoverability of configurations previously considered unsolvable.\nThe paper's primary strength lies in its generality. By relaxing assumptions on community sizes and connectivity probabilities, the authors significantly broaden the applicability of their results. The introduction of the \"relative density\" parameter as a key summary statistic is particularly noteworthy, as it enables the identification of new recoverable SBM configurations. For instance, the authors demonstrate that communities as small as \\(O(\\sqrt{\\log n})\\) can be recovered under specific conditions, breaking the conventional \\(O(\\log n)\\) threshold. The treatment of partial observations is also a valuable contribution, as it extends the results to more realistic scenarios.\nHowever, the paper has notable limitations. The results are valid only up to constants, which weakens their practical applicability. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it remains a significant drawback, particularly given the rapid evolution of research in SBM. Furthermore, the paper does not address phase transitions or the potential information-computation gap in heterogeneous SBMs, leaving important questions unanswered. The authors also fail to provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods, such as the \"peeling strategy,\" beyond a few specific examples. Additionally, the term \"partial observations\" could be more explicitly distinguished from the \"Censored Block Model\" to avoid confusion.\nStrengths:\n1. Generality: The paper significantly extends the scope of SBM recovery guarantees to heterogeneous and sparse graphs.\n2. Novel Insights: Introduction of the \"relative density\" parameter and recovery of very small communities (\\(O(\\sqrt{\\log n})\\)) are valuable contributions.\n3. Theoretical Rigor: The proofs are well-grounded in matrix concentration inequalities and convex optimization techniques.\n4. Partial Observations: The extension to partially observed graphs is relevant for practical applications.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Practical Utility: Results are valid only up to constants, which reduces their applicability in real-world scenarios.\n2. Incomplete Discussion: The paper does not address phase transitions or the information-computation gap in detail.\n3. Citation Gaps: The rapid evolution of SBM research makes it difficult to assess whether all relevant prior work is cited.\n4. Clarity: The distinction between \"partial observations\" and the \"Censored Block Model\" could be more explicit.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution to the study of SBMs, particularly in heterogeneous and challenging regimes. However, its practical impact is limited by the lack of sharp thresholds and results valid only up to constants. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and expand the discussion on phase transitions and computational gaps in future work."
