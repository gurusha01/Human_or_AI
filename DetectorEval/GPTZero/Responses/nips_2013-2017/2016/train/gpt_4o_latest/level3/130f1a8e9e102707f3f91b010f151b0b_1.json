            "inputText": "This paper proposes a multivariate online dictionary-learning framework, termed Smooth-SODL, to identify structured and sparse regions of interest (ROIs) in brain imaging data. By incorporating a Laplacian penalty to enforce spatial smoothness, the method extends the Sparse Online Dictionary Learning (SODL) framework of Mairal et al. (2010) to generate interpretable and denoised dictionary atoms. The authors demonstrate the scalability of their approach to large datasets and evaluate its performance on functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Compared to baseline methods such as CanICA and SODL, the proposed method claims to produce more interpretable and stable results while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.\nStrengths:\n1. Relevance and Novelty: The problem of identifying structured ROIs in brain imaging is significant, and the proposed method addresses a critical gap by combining sparsity and spatial regularization in a scalable online learning framework. The use of a Laplacian penalty to enforce spatial smoothness is a novel extension to the SODL framework.\n2. Scalability: The method is computationally efficient, with a runtime comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches, making it suitable for large-scale neuroimaging datasets.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the method, including comparisons with CanICA and SODL across multiple metrics such as explained variance, stability, and behavioral prediction. The results suggest that Smooth-SODL achieves a good balance between interpretability and predictive power.\n4. Potential Impact: The method has practical implications for neuroimaging research, particularly in creating data-driven atlases and dimensionality reduction for large datasets.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Theoretical Analysis: The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence and optimality. While empirical results are promising, a deeper theoretical validation would strengthen the contribution.\n2. Writing Quality: The manuscript suffers from poor organization and unclear explanations. Key concepts, such as the role of hyperparameters and the Laplacian penalty, are not adequately explained, making it difficult for readers to fully grasp the methodology.\n3. Unaddressed Reviewer Comments: The presence of unaddressed reviewer comments indicates insufficient proofreading and a lack of attention to detail, which detracts from the paper's overall quality.\n4. Comparison with Related Work: While the authors reference prior work, the discussion of how Smooth-SODL differs from or improves upon existing methods is limited. For instance, the relationship to clustering-based ROI methods or alternative structured decomposition techniques is not thoroughly explored.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\n- Pro: The method is novel, scalable, and addresses an important problem in neuroimaging. The empirical results are compelling, and the approach has the potential to advance the state of the art.\n- Con: The lack of theoretical analysis, poor writing quality, and insufficient attention to reviewer feedback reduce the paper's scientific rigor and accessibility.\nRecommendation: While the topic and proposed method are intriguing, the paper requires significant revisions to improve clarity, address theoretical gaps, and respond to reviewer comments. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage resubmission after addressing these issues."
