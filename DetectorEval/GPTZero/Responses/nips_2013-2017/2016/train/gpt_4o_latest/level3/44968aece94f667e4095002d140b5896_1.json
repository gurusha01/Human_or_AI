            "inputText": "The paper addresses the problem of setting reserve prices for a seller dealing with strategic buyers who can delay purchases within a limited time window. The authors propose an algorithm achieving an \\(O(T^{2/3})\\) regret bound compared to the best fixed price in hindsight, and they establish a matching lower bound of \\(\\Omega(T^{2/3})\\), demonstrating the tightness of their results. This work builds on and extends prior research, such as Kleinberg and Leighton's study of single-period buyers, by considering buyers with patience windows greater than one. The authors also connect their lower bound to multi-armed bandit problems with switching costs, which is a novel and insightful contribution.\nStrengths: \nThe paper makes significant theoretical contributions by proving tight upper and lower regret bounds in a challenging adversarial setting. The introduction of epochs to limit price fluctuations and the use of the EXP3 algorithm to manage regret are well-motivated and technically sound. The lower bound proof, which reduces the problem to a multi-armed bandit with switching costs, is particularly compelling and highlights the inherent difficulty of the problem. The paper also provides a clear distinction from prior works by focusing on adversarial settings and strategic buyers, making it a valuable addition to the literature on online pricing and algorithmic game theory.\nWeaknesses: \nThe abstract lacks clarity and focus, failing to succinctly convey the main contributions and significance of the work. It should be rewritten to emphasize the key results, such as the tight regret bounds and the novel algorithmic approach. Additionally, the connection to policy regret problems, which is a critical aspect of the paper, is not sufficiently highlighted in the main text. Strengthening this connection would improve the paper's positioning within the broader context of regret minimization literature. Finally, while the theoretical results are robust, the paper could benefit from empirical validation or illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical implications of the proposed algorithm.\nPro Acceptance Arguments: \n1. The paper provides tight theoretical results, advancing the state of the art in online pricing with strategic buyers. \n2. The lower bound proof is novel and insightful, connecting the problem to multi-armed bandit frameworks. \n3. The work addresses a challenging and relevant problem in algorithmic game theory, with potential applications in e-commerce and dynamic pricing.\nCon Acceptance Arguments: \n1. The abstract and presentation of the paper require significant improvement for clarity and accessibility. \n2. The connection to policy regret problems is underexplored, limiting the broader impact of the work. \n3. The lack of empirical results or practical examples may hinder the paper's appeal to practitioners.\nConclusion: \nOverall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of online pricing and regret minimization. While the presentation could be improved, the results are significant and well-supported. I recommend acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing the clarity issues in the abstract and emphasizing the connection to policy regret problems."
