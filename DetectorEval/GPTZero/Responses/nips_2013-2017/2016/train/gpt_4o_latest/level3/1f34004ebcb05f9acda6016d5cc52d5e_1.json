            "inputText": "This paper addresses the convergence of a non-convex loss-minimization problem for learning parameters of a graph-based ranking model, specifically the Supervised PageRank. The authors propose a novel two-level optimization approach to overcome the limitations of existing methods, which require exact objective function values and are unsuitable for constrained problems. At the lower level, the stationary distribution of a Markov random walk is approximated using a linearly convergent method, while the upper level employs either a gradient-based or gradient-free optimization algorithm with inexact oracle guarantees. The theoretical contributions include convergence proofs for both methods and complexity bounds for the two-level framework. The proposed algorithms are validated on a real-world ranking task, demonstrating superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with detailed proofs for the convergence and complexity of the proposed methods. The use of inexact oracles is well-motivated and addresses a critical gap in existing optimization techniques for constrained non-convex problems.\n2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and experimental setup. The theoretical and experimental results are presented systematically.\n3. Significance: The proposed methods advance the state-of-the-art in learning graph-based ranking models by providing theoretical guarantees and outperforming existing algorithms in experiments. The practical implications for search engine reliability and efficiency are noteworthy.\n4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough, comparing the proposed methods against a strong baseline on a real-world dataset. The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the new algorithms.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Originality: While the paper makes meaningful contributions, some key ideas, such as the supervised PageRank framework and certain optimization techniques, build on prior work. The novelty lies primarily in adapting these methods to constrained optimization with inexact oracles.\n2. Contextualization: The optimization problem could be framed in a more general context to better highlight its relevance to broader applications and distinguish it from related work.\n3. Conclusion Section: The paper lacks a conclusion section, which could summarize the contributions, implications, and potential future directions.\n4. Proof Verification: While the proofs appear correct, not all were thoroughly verified by the reviewer due to their complexity and length.\nRecommendation:\nPro Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses an important problem with a novel and well-validated approach.\n- The theoretical contributions are significant and backed by rigorous analysis.\n- The experimental results demonstrate practical utility.\nCon Acceptance:\n- Concerns about originality and the reliance on prior work.\n- The lack of a conclusion section and broader contextualization.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Add a conclusion section to summarize the contributions and discuss future work.\n2. Position the optimization problem in a broader context to emphasize its generality and impact.\n3. Provide a more detailed discussion of how the proposed methods differ from and improve upon prior work.\nOverall, this is a high-quality submission with strong theoretical and practical contributions, and I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
