            "inputText": "The manuscript presents a novel approach to unsupervised feature construction for similarity determination using exemplars, addressing key challenges in this domain. The authors propose a unique training paradigm that combines a differentiable clustering loss with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This approach effectively mitigates issues arising from imbalanced training data by clustering data into compact, mutually consistent cliques, thereby enhancing the reliability of similarity learning. The method is evaluated on diverse datasets, including Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC 2007, demonstrating its applicability across tasks like posture analysis, pose estimation, and object classification.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Novelty: The integration of discrete optimization algorithms with deep learning for unsupervised similarity learning is innovative. The use of compact cliques to address imbalanced data and unreliable relationships is a significant contribution.\n2. Generalizability: The approach is applied to multiple datasets, showcasing its versatility. The results on Olympic Sports and Leeds Sports datasets highlight its potential for fine-grained posture analysis and pose estimation.\n3. Performance: The method achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in unsupervised settings, without requiring labeled data or fine-tuning.\n4. Clarity of Methodology: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the proposed optimization problem and its implementation, making it easier for readers to understand and potentially reproduce the results.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Experimental Limitations: While the results are promising, the experiments could be strengthened. For instance, the analysis of varying k values in the PASCAL dataset is limited, and the impact of switching initialization methods for PASCAL VOC is not thoroughly explored.\n2. Clarity and Writing: Certain sections suffer from unclear wording, which may hinder comprehension. Additionally, the manuscript contains minor grammar and spelling errors (e.g., lines in Section 2.3 and 3.1). These should be corrected for better readability.\n3. Missing Citations: Some related work is not adequately referenced, which could help contextualize the contributions more effectively.\n4. Reproducibility: While the methodology is well-detailed, the lack of explicit hyperparameter settings and training configurations for all datasets may pose challenges for replication.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in unsupervised learning, making a clear contribution to the field.\n- The proposed method is innovative and demonstrates strong performance across diverse datasets.\n- The integration of clustering with CNNs is a novel and impactful idea that could inspire future research.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The experimental evaluation, while promising, lacks depth in certain areas, such as sensitivity analysis for key parameters.\n- The paper requires significant improvements in clarity, grammar, and citation coverage.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a meaningful scientific contribution, but the authors should address the clarity issues, strengthen the experimental analysis, and ensure proper citation of related work."
