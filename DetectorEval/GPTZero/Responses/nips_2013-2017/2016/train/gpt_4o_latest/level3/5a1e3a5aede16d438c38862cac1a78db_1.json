            "inputText": "This paper investigates sparse recovery in underdetermined regression problems using `1-norm regularization with non-smooth loss functions (`1 and `âˆž norms), extending theoretical results traditionally focused on the smooth `2 loss. The authors derive conditions for support stability and introduce the concept of an \"extended support\" when stability fails. They provide theoretical guarantees for small-noise regimes and validate their findings through numerical experiments in a compressed sensing setting. While the focus on non-smooth loss functions is a valuable contribution, the paper has several strengths and weaknesses that merit discussion.\nStrengths:\n1. Extension to Non-Smooth Losses: The paper addresses a gap in the literature by analyzing `1 and `âˆž loss functions, which are relevant for handling impulse noise and uniform noise, respectively. This broadens the scope of sparse recovery research.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors present a clear and mathematically rigorous framework, including sharp conditions for support stability and instability. The use of dual certificates and restricted injectivity conditions is well-grounded in convex optimization theory.\n3. Numerical Validation: The experiments provide insights into the behavior of support recovery under different loss functions, highlighting the trade-offs between stability and sparsity.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Novelty in Proof Techniques: The theoretical contributions rely heavily on established dual witness methods, raising questions about the originality of the approach. While the extension to non-smooth losses is non-trivial, the methodology itself is not groundbreaking.\n2. Insufficient Contextualization: The paper does not adequately situate itself within the broader field of sparse recovery, particularly in relation to recent advances in compressed sensing and alternative regularization techniques. Key references are missing, and the novelty of the work relative to prior studies is not convincingly articulated.\n3. Experimental Clarity: The experimental section lacks sufficient detail about the noise distributions and parameter settings, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the results. For instance, the choice of uniformly distributed noise and its implications are not thoroughly discussed.\n4. Questionable Practical Utility: Figure 2 suggests that `2 loss techniques outperform `1 and `âˆž losses in terms of support stability, which undermines the practical significance of the proposed methods. The authors fail to provide compelling evidence for scenarios where non-smooth losses would be preferable.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses an important theoretical gap by extending sparse recovery guarantees to non-smooth loss functions.\n- The mathematical framework is rigorous and could inspire further research in this direction.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of novelty in proof techniques and insufficient contextualization within the field weaken the paper's contribution.\n- The experimental results raise doubts about the practical utility of the proposed methods, and the presentation of these results lacks clarity.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution, its limited novelty, insufficient contextualization, and unclear experimental evaluation diminish its impact. I recommend rejection unless the authors can address these issues, particularly by situating their work more effectively within the existing literature and providing clearer experimental evidence."
