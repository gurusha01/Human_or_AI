            "inputText": "The paper addresses the critical challenge of learning deep feature embeddings in non-uniform feature spaces, where global metrics like Euclidean distance fail to capture the true similarity between samples. This limitation complicates effective hard negative mining, which is crucial for improving the quality and efficiency of embedding learning. To address this, the authors propose a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit, a novel component that adapts to local feature structures by incorporating both the mean position and difference of feature pairs. This differentiable unit is compatible with existing CNN architectures and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, the authors introduce a double-header hinge loss, which operates on both pairwise differences/similarities before and after the PDDM unit, further enhancing the learning process. Hard quadruplets are mined during each mini-batch of SGD, focusing on low-similarity positive pairs and high-similarity negative pairs, ensuring robust optimization.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on image retrieval tasks (CUB-200-2011, CARS196) and transfer/zero-shot learning tasks (ImageNet-10K, ImageNet 2010). The results demonstrate significant improvements in both performance and training efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. The paper is well-written and tackles an important problem with a novel formulation, making a strong case for its contribution to the field.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Technical Soundness: The PDDM unit and double-header hinge loss are innovative and address a well-identified gap in the literature. The theoretical formulation is rigorous and well-supported by experimental results.\n2. Significance: The method demonstrates clear improvements in retrieval accuracy and training efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in both image retrieval and transfer learning tasks.\n3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient details for reproduction. The visualizations and experimental results effectively illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach.\n4. Compatibility: The pluggable nature of the PDDM unit ensures its applicability to a wide range of CNN architectures, increasing its practical utility.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarification Needed: The distinction between \"PDDM score\" and \"Quadruplet+PDDM\" in Table 1 is unclear. The authors should elaborate on how these two configurations differ in terms of implementation and performance.\n2. Embedding Loss \\(Ee\\): The necessity of the embedding loss \\(Ee\\) in Equation (4) is not fully justified. While the experiments suggest its importance, a more detailed explanation of its role and interaction with the metric loss \\(E_m\\) would strengthen the argument.\n3. Efficiency of Hard Negative Mining: Although the authors claim the hard negative mining process is computationally efficient, a more detailed analysis of its scalability with larger datasets or batch sizes would be valuable.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and effective solution to a well-recognized problem in deep metric learning.\n- The experimental results are compelling and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.\n- The proposed method is generalizable and has potential applications beyond the evaluated tasks.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Some aspects of the methodology, such as the embedding loss and hard negative mining efficiency, require further clarification.\n- The distinction between different configurations in the results table is not adequately explained.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep metric learning and is well-suited for acceptance. Addressing the raised concerns in a revision would further strengthen its impact."
