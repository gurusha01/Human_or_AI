            "inputText": "The paper presents novel optimization methods for learning Supervised PageRank models, addressing a non-convex loss-minimization problem. The authors propose two algorithms: a gradient-based method and a random gradient-free method, both leveraging the concept of an inexact oracle. The key contributions include theoretical guarantees on convergence rates for both methods, a detailed complexity analysis, and experimental validation on a real-world ranking task. The paper claims that these methods outperform the state-of-the-art gradient-based approach in terms of ranking quality and provide additional benefits, such as fewer input parameters (gradient-based) and avoidance of derivative calculations (gradient-free).\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper introduces two optimization methods with provable convergence guarantees, addressing a significant gap in the literature where existing methods lacked theoretical assurances. The adaptation of gradient-free methods to constrained optimization problems with inexact oracles is particularly innovative.\n2. Practical Relevance: The proposed methods are applied to a real-world ranking task using a commercial search engine dataset, demonstrating their practical utility. The results show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art in terms of ranking quality.\n3. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors provide a thorough complexity analysis and investigate the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, which is valuable for practitioners.\n4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed, comparing the proposed methods against a baseline and the state-of-the-art on multiple datasets. The statistical significance of the results is also reported.\n5. Clarity in Mathematical Formulation: The mathematical rigor and detailed derivations of the algorithms and their convergence properties are commendable.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the mathematical details are thorough, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with optimization theory. Simplifying some explanations or providing visual aids could improve accessibility.\n2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed methods, such as potential scalability issues for even larger datasets or the sensitivity of hyperparameters like the Lipschitz constant.\n3. Comparison with Broader Methods: The experimental comparison focuses on a specific state-of-the-art method. Including comparisons with other optimization techniques, such as advanced stochastic gradient methods, would strengthen the evaluation.\n4. Practical Implementation Details: While theoretical guarantees are provided, the paper lacks sufficient discussion on practical implementation challenges, such as parameter tuning or computational resource requirements.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions to the field of optimization and ranking algorithms.\n- The proposed methods are rigorously analyzed and experimentally validated, demonstrating clear advantages over the state-of-the-art.\n- The work addresses a relevant and challenging problem in graph-based ranking, with potential applications in search engines and recommendation systems.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.\n- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, including comparisons with a wider range of methods.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper is a strong scientific contribution, but improving clarity and expanding the discussion of limitations and comparisons would enhance its impact."
