            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel nonlinear spectral method (NLSM) for training feedforward neural networks, offering a globally optimal solution with linear convergence under specific conditions. The authors claim this is the first practically feasible method to achieve global optimality for neural networks, addressing a significant limitation of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, which lack guarantees for global convergence. The method is demonstrated on one- and two-hidden-layer networks and validated on several UCI datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper introduces a unique approach to neural network optimization by leveraging nonlinear spectral methods and fixed-point theory. The theoretical guarantees for global optimality and linear convergence are significant advancements over existing methods.\n2. Practical Feasibility: Unlike prior work that provides theoretical guarantees but is impractical for real-world use, the proposed method is computationally feasible and demonstrated on real datasets.\n3. Clarity of Theoretical Framework: The authors provide a rigorous mathematical foundation, including proofs of convergence and conditions for global optimality. The use of fixed-point theory and spectral radius analysis is well-articulated.\n4. Experimental Validation: The experiments, though limited to low-dimensional datasets, demonstrate the method's competitiveness with SGD and kernel SVMs. The linear convergence rate and lack of hyperparameter tuning requirements are practical advantages.\n5. Constructive Discussion of Limitations: The authors acknowledge the constraints of their method, such as the requirement for nonnegative weights and the dependency of spectral radius bounds on the number of hidden units, which limits scalability to high-dimensional datasets.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments are restricted to low-dimensional datasets, which limits the generalizability of the results to more complex, high-dimensional tasks. The authors note this limitation but do not provide a clear roadmap for addressing it.\n2. Architectural Constraints: The method imposes nonnegativity constraints on weights and requires specific parameter choices (e.g., Î± values), which may limit its applicability to broader neural network architectures.\n3. Performance Trade-offs: While the method achieves global optimality, its performance on some datasets (e.g., Iris and Banknote) is inferior to unconstrained ReLU networks, which can achieve zero test error. This suggests a trade-off between theoretical guarantees and practical flexibility.\n4. Complexity of Theoretical Framework: The mathematical framework, while rigorous, is dense and may be challenging for practitioners to implement or extend. The reliance on spectral radius computations and fixed-point theory may deter adoption in applied settings.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to neural network optimization and demonstrates promising results on low-dimensional datasets. However, its practical impact is currently limited by scalability and architectural constraints. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on:\n1. Expanding experimental validation to higher-dimensional datasets or more complex tasks.\n2. Providing more practical guidance on parameter selection and addressing scalability challenges.\n3. Simplifying the presentation of the theoretical framework to improve accessibility for a broader audience.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The method addresses a critical problem in neural network optimization with a novel and theoretically sound approach.\n- The paper provides a strong foundation for future work on globally optimal training methods.\n- The experimental results, while limited, demonstrate the feasibility and competitiveness of the proposed method.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The scope of experiments is narrow, and the method's applicability to real-world, high-dimensional problems remains unclear.\n- The architectural constraints and complexity of the method may limit its adoption in practice.\nOverall, the paper represents a valuable contribution to the field, and its acceptance would encourage further exploration and refinement of globally optimal training methods."
