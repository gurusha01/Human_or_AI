            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel method, Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL), for decomposing brain images into structured and sparse components. The authors extend the Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (SODL) framework by introducing a Laplacian penalty to enforce spatial smoothness, resulting in dictionary atoms that are compact and piece-wise smooth. This approach is particularly suited for neuroimaging data, where inter-subject variability and spatial structure are critical. The authors demonstrate the scalability of their method to large datasets and evaluate its performance on task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a significant extension to the SODL framework by incorporating spatial regularization, addressing a key limitation of existing methods. The use of a Laplacian penalty is well-motivated and results in more interpretable and denoised dictionary atoms.\n2. Scalability: The online nature of the algorithm ensures scalability to massive datasets, a critical requirement for modern neuroimaging studies.\n3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their method, comparing it against state-of-the-art approaches like CanICA and SODL. The results demonstrate clear advantages in terms of interpretability, stability, and explained variance, particularly in low-data regimes.\n4. Practical Utility: The method shows promise for real-world applications, such as predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging data, outperforming several baseline methods.\n5. Clarity of Results: The visual and quantitative comparisons (e.g., explained variance, stability, and prediction performance) are well-presented and effectively support the claims.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Hyperparameter Tuning: The paper acknowledges that hyperparameter selection remains a challenge. While some strategies (e.g., cross-validation) are discussed, a more systematic approach or guidelines for practitioners would enhance usability.\n2. Computational Overhead: The Smooth-SODL method is approximately three times slower than SODL. While this is justified by the improved results, the trade-off may limit its adoption in time-sensitive applications.\n3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The authors briefly mention the potential for degenerate maps with large regularization parameters but do not explore this limitation in depth. A more detailed analysis of failure cases would strengthen the paper.\n4. Reproducibility: Although the authors plan to release their implementation, the paper lacks sufficient details for immediate reproducibility. For instance, the initialization strategy and specific parameter ranges could be elaborated.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- The method addresses a critical gap in the field by combining sparsity and spatial structure in dictionary learning.\n- Experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of Smooth-SODL over existing methods.\n- The approach is scalable and applicable to large neuroimaging datasets, making it highly relevant for the community.\nCons:\n- The computational cost, while manageable, may deter some users.\n- Hyperparameter tuning and reproducibility could be better addressed.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a significant and well-validated contribution to the field of neuroimaging and dictionary learning. The strengths of the method, particularly its interpretability and scalability, outweigh the minor weaknesses. The paper is likely to stimulate further research and practical applications in brain imaging analysis."
