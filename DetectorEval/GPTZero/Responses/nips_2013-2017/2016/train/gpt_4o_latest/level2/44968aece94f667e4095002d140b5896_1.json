            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper addresses the problem of online pricing for a seller with an unlimited supply of a single good, where buyers are strategic and have a \"patience window\" during which they can wait for lower prices. The authors propose a model where the seller commits to a sequence of future prices, allowing buyers to act as \"price takers.\" The main contributions are as follows:\n1. Algorithm with Upper Bound: The authors present an algorithm that achieves \\(O(T^{2/3})\\) regret compared to the best fixed price in hindsight, where \\(T\\) is the number of buyers. The algorithm uses the EXP3 multi-armed bandit framework with modifications to account for strategic buyer behavior.\n2. Matching Lower Bound: A matching lower bound of \\(\\Omega(T^{2/3})\\) regret is proven, demonstrating the fundamental difficulty of the problem due to buyer patience and strategic behavior.\n3. Novel Insights: The paper highlights the significant jump in regret from \\(\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})\\) to \\(\\Theta(T^{2/3})\\) when buyers' patience increases from zero to one, emphasizing the impact of strategic behavior on pricing dynamics.\nStrengths\n1. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides both upper and lower bounds, ensuring the results are tight and theoretically grounded. The use of adversarial settings strengthens the generality of the findings.\n2. Novelty: The focus on strategic buyers with patience windows is a meaningful extension of prior work on posted price mechanisms. The approach of committing to future prices simplifies buyer behavior while maintaining analytical tractability.\n3. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly articulates the challenges posed by strategic buyers and demonstrates how these challenges are addressed through the proposed algorithm. The use of epochs and the EXP3 framework is well-motivated and explained.\n4. Connections to Prior Work: The paper builds on and extends prior work, such as Kleinberg and Leighton's results for non-strategic buyers, while introducing new challenges and insights for the strategic setting.\nWeaknesses\n1. Practical Applicability: While the theoretical results are strong, the practical implications of the model are less clear. For instance, the assumption that buyers know all future prices may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the model's applicability.\n2. Feedback Model: The paper assumes that the seller only observes revenue at the end of each day, which might be overly restrictive. Exploring alternative feedback models could improve the practical relevance of the results.\n3. Limited Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the theoretical findings or to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in realistic settings. Simulations could provide additional insights into the algorithm's behavior.\n4. Continuous Pricing Gap: While the authors discuss extending the results to continuous pricing, the gap between the \\(O(T^{3/4})\\) upper bound and the lower bound remains unresolved. This leaves an open question about the tightness of the results in this setting.\nArguments for and Against Acceptance\nPros:\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by addressing a novel and challenging problem.\n- The results are rigorous, with tight bounds and clear insights into the impact of buyer patience on regret.\n- The work is well-positioned within the broader literature on online pricing and multi-armed bandits.\nCons:\n- The practical relevance of the model is limited due to strong assumptions (e.g., full knowledge of future prices by buyers).\n- The lack of empirical validation weakens the paper's impact, as the results remain purely theoretical.\n- The unresolved gap in the continuous pricing case leaves room for improvement.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and addresses a novel problem, but it would benefit from additional discussion on practical applicability and empirical validation. Addressing these aspects in future work could significantly enhance the paper's impact."
