            "inputText": "The paper introduces TrailBlazer, a novel sampling-based planning algorithm for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The primary contribution is a sample-efficient algorithm that provides theoretical guarantees on sample complexity, even in challenging scenarios with infinite state spaces. The authors aim to improve upon existing Monte-Carlo planning methods by leveraging the structure of MDPs to focus on near-optimal states, thereby reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees, including PAC consistency and problem-dependent sample complexity bounds. Notably, TrailBlazer achieves polynomial sample complexity in cases where previous algorithms struggled, particularly when the number of next states \\(N\\) is infinite.\n2. Novelty: The introduction of problem-dependent measures (\\(\\kappa\\) and \\(d\\)) to quantify the complexity of identifying near-optimal nodes is innovative. These measures enable the algorithm to adapt to the structure of the MDP, improving efficiency compared to uniform or non-adaptive methods.\n3. Practical Relevance: TrailBlazer is computationally efficient and easy to implement, making it a promising candidate for real-world applications. The algorithm's ability to achieve \\(O(1/\\epsilon^2)\\) sample complexity in structured MDPs aligns with the performance of Monte-Carlo sampling, demonstrating its practical utility.\n4. Comparison to Prior Work: The paper provides a thorough comparison to related algorithms, such as UCT and StOP, highlighting both theoretical and empirical improvements. The authors address limitations of prior methods, such as exponential sample complexity in some cases, and demonstrate how TrailBlazer overcomes these issues.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the theoretical results are strong, the presentation is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations and examples. For instance, the definitions of \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(d\\) are mathematically rigorous but may be difficult for non-expert readers to interpret intuitively.\n2. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks experimental results to validate TrailBlazer's performance in practical scenarios. While the theoretical guarantees are compelling, empirical benchmarks against existing algorithms (e.g., UCT, StOP) would strengthen the paper's claims.\n3. Assumptions: The algorithm assumes access to a generative model, which may not always be feasible in real-world applications. Additionally, the reliance on problem-dependent measures like \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(d\\) may limit the generality of the results in unstructured MDPs.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes significant theoretical advancements in Monte-Carlo planning, particularly for MDPs with infinite state spaces.\n- TrailBlazer's ability to adapt to problem structure and achieve polynomial sample complexity is a notable improvement over prior work.\n- The algorithm is simple to implement and has potential for practical applications, provided access to a generative model.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of empirical results is a major limitation, as it leaves the practical performance of TrailBlazer unverified.\n- The paper's dense presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with the theoretical nuances of MDPs.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The theoretical contributions are significant and advance the state of the art in Monte-Carlo planning. However, the authors should include empirical results to validate their claims and improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in the definitions and explanations of key concepts."
