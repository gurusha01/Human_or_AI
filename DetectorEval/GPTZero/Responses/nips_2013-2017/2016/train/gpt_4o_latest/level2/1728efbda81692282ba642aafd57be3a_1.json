            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to spectral analysis of the Koopman operator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), proposing a modal decomposition algorithm that leverages finite-length data sequences from nonlinear dynamical systems. The authors extend traditional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by incorporating kernel methods, enabling richer basis functions and improving the approximation of Koopman eigenfunctions. The proposed algorithm is robustified using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) bases, addressing numerical instability issues. The paper further demonstrates the utility of the method in applications such as prediction, change-point detection, and dynamic pattern recognition, supported by empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Innovation: The integration of kernel methods into Koopman spectral analysis is a significant contribution, offering a more expressive framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems. The approach addresses limitations of traditional DMD by enabling the use of nonlinear basis functions.\n2. Technical Rigor: The paper provides a thorough theoretical foundation, including proofs of key results and connections to existing methods. The robustification using POD bases is a practical enhancement that improves the algorithm's applicability.\n3. Empirical Validation: The method is demonstrated on diverse datasets, including a toy nonlinear system, the HÃ©non map, and real-world locomotion data. The results effectively illustrate the algorithm's ability to extract meaningful dynamics and its potential for practical applications.\n4. Applications: The exploration of applications such as prediction, change-point detection, and dynamic pattern recognition highlights the versatility and relevance of the proposed method in machine learning and scientific domains.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is technically sound, it is densely written and assumes a high level of familiarity with Koopman theory, RKHS, and DMD. This may limit accessibility for a broader audience, including practitioners in related fields.\n2. Comparative Analysis: Although the paper references related work, it lacks a detailed quantitative comparison of the proposed method's performance against existing DMD variants or other spectral analysis techniques. This would strengthen the claims of superiority.\n3. Scalability: The computational complexity of the algorithm, particularly in high-dimensional RKHS, is not explicitly discussed. Practical implementation challenges, such as kernel selection and parameter tuning, are also underexplored.\n4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges potential numerical issues, it does not thoroughly discuss other limitations, such as sensitivity to noise or the dependence on kernel choice.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper makes a strong scientific contribution and demonstrates potential for advancing the state of the art in spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. However, improvements in clarity, comparative evaluation, and discussion of practical challenges would enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving accessibility and providing more comprehensive experimental comparisons. \nPro and Con Arguments:\nPro:\n- Innovative extension of Koopman spectral analysis using RKHS.\n- Rigorous theoretical development and empirical validation.\n- Broad applicability to machine learning and scientific problems.\nCon:\n- Dense presentation limits accessibility.\n- Lack of detailed comparative analysis with existing methods.\n- Insufficient discussion of computational and practical challenges."
