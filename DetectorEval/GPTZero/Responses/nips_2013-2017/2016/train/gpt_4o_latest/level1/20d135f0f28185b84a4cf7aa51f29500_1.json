            "inputText": "This paper introduces Stochastic Multiple Choice Learning (sMCL), a novel stochastic gradient descent-based approach for training ensembles of deep networks to minimize oracle loss. The authors frame the problem of generating multiple plausible outputs as a learning task, where an ensemble of predictors is trained to produce diverse solutions that collectively minimize oracle error. Unlike prior methods, such as Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and boosting-based approaches, sMCL is computationally efficient, parameter-free, and compatible with any architecture or loss function. The paper demonstrates the broad applicability of sMCL across tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and image captioning, showing consistent improvements in oracle performance and diversity of predictions.\nThe work builds on prior research in ensemble learning and multiple-choice learning, particularly the MCL framework by Guzman-Rivera et al. [8]. However, it addresses key limitations of existing methods, such as the need for costly retraining or sequential training, by introducing a \"winner-take-gradient\" strategy that integrates seamlessly with stochastic gradient descent. The authors provide comprehensive experimental results, comparing sMCL with classical ensembles, MCL, and other baselines, and demonstrate significant performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, the paper highlights the emergence of interpretable specialization among ensemble members, such as label-space clustering in classification and diverse segmentations in semantic tasks.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Novelty: The proposed sMCL method is a significant improvement over existing MCL approaches, offering a practical and scalable solution for deep learning ensembles.\n2. Broad Applicability: The method is demonstrated across diverse tasks and architectures, showcasing its generalizability.\n3. Efficiency: sMCL is computationally efficient, achieving a 5x speedup over MCL while maintaining or improving performance.\n4. Interpretable Specialization: The emergence of task-specific expertise among ensemble members is a compelling and well-analyzed result.\n5. Clarity: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and experimental results.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Analysis of Failure Cases: While the paper emphasizes the strengths of sMCL, it does not thoroughly explore scenarios where the method may underperform or fail (e.g., tasks with highly imbalanced datasets or extreme ambiguity).\n2. Comparison with Beam Search: The comparison with beam search in the image captioning task could be expanded to include a more detailed analysis of trade-offs between diversity and oracle performance.\n3. Scalability to Larger Models: While the method is efficient, the experiments are limited to relatively small-scale models and datasets. It would be valuable to see results on larger datasets like ImageNet or more complex architectures.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPro:\n- The paper addresses a critical limitation of existing MCL methods and provides a practical, scalable solution.\n- The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate significant improvements across multiple tasks.\n- The method is simple to implement and broadly applicable, making it valuable to the community.\nCon:\n- Limited exploration of potential failure cases or limitations of the method.\n- The scalability of sMCL to larger datasets and models is not fully demonstrated.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. It makes a strong technical contribution to ensemble learning for deep networks, provides clear experimental evidence of its efficacy, and has the potential to influence future work in this area. Addressing the identified weaknesses in future work would further strengthen its impact."
