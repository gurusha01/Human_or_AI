            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel nonlinear spectral method (NLSM) for training feedforward neural networks with guarantees of global optimality and linear convergence under certain conditions. The authors demonstrate that their method, which imposes nonnegativity constraints on weights and modifies the objective function, achieves global optimality for one- and two-hidden-layer networks. Theoretical results are supported by proofs leveraging fixed-point theory and the Perron-Frobenius framework. Experimental results on UCI datasets show competitive performance compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and kernel SVMs, with the added benefit of faster convergence and no need for hyperparameter tuning.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for global optimality in training neural networks, a significant advancement in understanding the optimization landscape of non-convex problems. The use of nonlinear spectral methods is novel and well-motivated.\n2. Practical Feasibility: Unlike prior work (e.g., Haeffele and Vidal [8], Janzamin et al. [11]), which struggled with practical applicability, the proposed method is computationally feasible and demonstrated on real-world datasets.\n3. Experimental Validation: The experiments, though limited to low-dimensional datasets, validate the method's efficacy and demonstrate its competitive performance compared to SGD and SVMs. The linear convergence rate and lack of hyperparameter tuning are particularly appealing.\n4. Clarity of Theoretical Framework: The authors provide detailed proofs and explanations, ensuring that the theoretical contributions are accessible to readers. The connection to fixed-point theory and spectral radius conditions is well-articulated.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Scope of Experiments: The experiments are limited to low-dimensional datasets, which restricts the generalizability of the results to high-dimensional, real-world problems. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide a clear roadmap for scaling the method.\n2. Architectural Constraints: The nonnegativity constraint on weights and the requirement for specific activation functions (generalized polynomials) limit the flexibility of the model compared to standard architectures like ReLU networks.\n3. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the method is compared to SGD and SVMs, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with other global optimization methods or advanced neural network training techniques.\n4. Parameter Sensitivity: The paper notes that the spectral radius condition depends on model parameters, but the bounds provided are conservative. This may limit the method's applicability to larger networks or more complex datasets.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by addressing global optimality in neural network training, a longstanding challenge in the field.\n- The proposed method is practical, computationally efficient, and validated on real-world datasets.\n- The work is well-written, with clear explanations of theoretical results and experimental procedures.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The experimental scope is limited, and the method's applicability to high-dimensional datasets or deeper networks remains unclear.\n- The architectural constraints and conservative parameter bounds may hinder the method's adoption in practice.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a novel and theoretically grounded approach to neural network optimization with practical implications. However, the authors should address the scalability and flexibility of their method in future work."
