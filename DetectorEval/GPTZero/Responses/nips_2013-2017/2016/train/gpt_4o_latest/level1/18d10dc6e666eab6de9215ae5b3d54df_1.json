            "inputText": "Review of \"Parallel Knowledge Gradient for Batch Bayesian Optimization\"\nThis paper introduces a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm, the parallel knowledge gradient (q-KG), which is designed to optimize derivative-free, expensive-to-evaluate functions in parallel settings. The authors derive q-KG using a decision-theoretic framework, providing a Bayes-optimal batch of points to sample. They address the computational challenges of evaluating q-KG by leveraging infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) to efficiently compute gradients, enabling practical optimization. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic test functions and hyperparameter tuning tasks for machine learning models, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art batch Bayesian optimization methods, particularly in noisy settings.\nThe paper builds on prior work in Bayesian optimization (BO), which typically uses Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the objective function and acquisition functions to guide evaluations. While most BO methods focus on sequential evaluations, recent work has explored parallel evaluations to better utilize computational resources. The authors extend the knowledge gradient (KG) method to the parallel setting, addressing limitations of existing parallel BO methods such as parallel EI and batch UCB. By jointly optimizing the batch of points rather than using iterative greedy approaches, q-KG achieves better performance, especially in problems with noisy evaluations. The paper also compares q-KG to existing methods like parallel EI, GP-BUCB, and GP-UCB-PE, demonstrating its advantages in both noise-free and noisy scenarios.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a theoretically grounded acquisition function (q-KG) for batch BO, which is a significant extension of the sequential KG method. The decision-theoretic derivation and the use of IPA for gradient computation are well-motivated and technically sound.\n2. Empirical Performance: The experiments convincingly demonstrate that q-KG outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world tasks, particularly in noisy settings where it exhibits a clear advantage.\n3. Practical Relevance: The method is highly relevant for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, a critical and computationally expensive task. The authors provide open-source code, which enhances reproducibility and practical adoption.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The inclusion of both noise-free and noisy scenarios provides a comprehensive evaluation.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Computational Complexity: While the authors address the computational challenges of q-KG, the method remains more computationally intensive than simpler approaches like parallel EI. This could limit its applicability to very high-dimensional problems or scenarios with limited computational resources.\n2. Discretization of the Domain: The need to discretize the domain for q-KG optimization may introduce approximation errors, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. While the authors briefly discuss this, more analysis or alternative strategies for continuous domains would strengthen the paper.\n3. Limited Real-World Benchmarks: Although the experiments include practical tasks like tuning logistic regression and CNNs, additional benchmarks on larger-scale or more diverse real-world problems would further validate the method's utility.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending KG to the parallel setting and provides a computationally feasible implementation.\n- The empirical results are strong and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods, particularly in noisy settings.\n- The method addresses a practical and important problem in machine learning, with potential for broad impact.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The computational cost of q-KG may limit its scalability to very high-dimensional or resource-constrained settings.\n- The reliance on domain discretization introduces potential limitations, which are not fully explored in the paper.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. It presents a novel and well-executed contribution to batch Bayesian optimization, with strong theoretical foundations and empirical results. While there are some limitations in scalability and domain discretization, these do not detract significantly from the overall quality and impact of the work. The method is likely to inspire further research and practical applications in the field."
