            "inputText": "Review of \"Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL) for Brain Imaging\"\nSummary\nThis paper introduces a novel multivariate online dictionary-learning method, Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL), designed to extract structured and sparse components (atoms) from brain imaging data. The method extends the Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (SODL) framework of Mairal et al. (2010) by incorporating a Laplacian penalty to enforce spatial smoothness, resulting in atoms that are piecewise smooth and compact. The authors demonstrate that this approach improves interpretability and denoising of brain imaging data while maintaining scalability for large datasets. Experiments on task-based fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) show that Smooth-SODL outperforms baseline methods like CanICA and SODL in terms of interpretability, stability, and predictive power for behavioral variables. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of hyperparameter tuning and computational efficiency.\nStrengths\n1. Technical Contribution: The extension of SODL with a Laplacian penalty is a significant and well-motivated improvement. The authors strike a balance between sparsity and spatial structure, addressing a key challenge in neuroimaging.\n2. Scalability: The method retains the computational efficiency of online dictionary learning, making it suitable for large-scale datasets like HCP. The reported 3x slowdown compared to SODL is acceptable given the added benefits.\n3. Experimental Rigor: The paper includes extensive experiments comparing Smooth-SODL with SODL and CanICA across multiple metrics (e.g., explained variance, stability, and behavioral prediction). The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.\n4. Interpretability: The qualitative results show that Smooth-SODL produces more structured and interpretable dictionary atoms compared to competing methods, which is crucial for neuroimaging applications.\n5. Reproducibility: The authors provide sufficient algorithmic details, and the planned integration into the Nilearn library will facilitate adoption by the community.\nWeaknesses\n1. Clarity: While the technical content is thorough, the paper is dense and occasionally difficult to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with dictionary learning. Simplifying the presentation of key equations and concepts could improve accessibility.\n2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The method relies on careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters (e.g., sparsity parameter Ï , Laplacian regularization Î³). Although the authors provide guidance, this sensitivity could limit usability for practitioners.\n3. Comparisons: The paper primarily benchmarks against SODL and CanICA. Including additional state-of-the-art methods, such as those incorporating deep learning, could strengthen the evaluation.\n4. Behavioral Prediction: While Smooth-SODL outperforms SODL and tCanICA in predicting behavioral variables, it lags behind CanICA. The authors could provide more insights into why this is the case and whether further refinements could close this gap.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper addresses a significant problem in neuroimaging by proposing a method that combines sparsity, spatial structure, and scalability.\n- The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate clear advantages over baseline methods in terms of interpretability and stability.\n- The proposed method is well-suited for large-scale datasets, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in the presentation of technical details.\n- The reliance on hyperparameter tuning may limit the method's practical applicability.\n- Comparisons with a broader range of methods would strengthen the evaluation.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a meaningful contribution to the field of neuroimaging and online dictionary learning. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the method and its demonstrated effectiveness outweigh the weaknesses. The planned integration into Nilearn further enhances its potential impact."
