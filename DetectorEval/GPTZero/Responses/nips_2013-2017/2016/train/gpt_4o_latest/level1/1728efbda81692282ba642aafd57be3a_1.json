            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to spectral analysis of the Koopman operator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), proposing a modal decomposition algorithm that leverages finite-length data sequences to extract features from nonlinear dynamical systems. The method builds on Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by extending it to RKHS, enabling the use of nonlinear basis functions through kernel methods. This allows for a richer approximation of Koopman eigenfunctions compared to traditional DMD, which relies on linear monomials. The authors also address practical challenges, such as ill-conditioning, by introducing a robustified variant using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) bases. Applications of the proposed framework, including state prediction, change-point detection, and dynamic pattern recognition, are demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending Koopman spectral analysis to RKHS, which enhances the expressiveness of the method and allows for better handling of nonlinear dynamics.\n2. Robustness: The introduction of a robustified algorithm using POD bases addresses a critical limitation of traditional DMD methods, improving numerical stability and practical applicability.\n3. Applications: The paper demonstrates the versatility of the proposed method with diverse applications, including prediction, change-point detection, and dynamic pattern recognition, supported by empirical results on synthetic and real-world data.\n4. Clarity of Mathematical Framework: The theoretical foundation is well-articulated, with clear derivations and explanations of the algorithmic steps.\n5. Relevance: The work is timely and relevant, as spectral methods and Koopman operator theory are increasingly used in machine learning, physics, and engineering.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Experimental Evaluation: While the empirical examples are illustrative, the evaluation lacks comprehensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods, such as extended DMD or other kernel-based approaches, to quantify performance improvements.\n2. Scalability: The computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly for large datasets or high-dimensional systems, is not discussed in detail. This could limit its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n3. Limited Real-World Validation: Although the method is applied to real-world data, the examples are relatively narrow in scope. Broader experiments on diverse and complex datasets would strengthen the paper's claims.\n4. Clarity in Applications: The description of certain applications, such as the prediction via preimage and change-point detection, is somewhat dense and could benefit from additional clarity or visual aids to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with these techniques.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper provides a novel and technically sound extension of Koopman spectral analysis, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n- The robustified algorithm addresses a key limitation of existing methods, enhancing practical usability.\n- The applications demonstrate the potential impact of the method across multiple domains.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The experimental evaluation is limited, lacking rigorous comparisons and scalability analysis.\n- The real-world validation is narrow, and the clarity of some application descriptions could be improved.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper offers a significant theoretical and methodological contribution, but the authors should address the experimental limitations and provide more clarity in the application sections to strengthen the paper's impact."
