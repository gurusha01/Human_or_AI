            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary and Relation to Prior Work\nThis paper addresses the problem of online pricing with strategic buyers who have a \"patience window\" during which they can wait for a lower price. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves an \\(O(T^{2/3})\\) regret bound with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight, and they prove a matching lower bound of \\(\\Omega(T^{2/3})\\), demonstrating the tightness of their results. The paper builds on prior work by Kleinberg and Leighton [11], which studied the special case where buyers have no patience (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), achieving a regret bound of \\(\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})\\). The authors extend this to the more complex case where buyers have patience windows (\\(\\tau \\geq 1\\)), introducing new challenges due to the strategic behavior of buyers. The proposed algorithm leverages the EXP3 multi-armed bandit framework, modified to account for the effects of price changes over time. The lower bound is derived through a reduction to multi-armed bandits with switching costs, highlighting the inherent difficulty of the problem.\nThe paper also situates its contributions within the broader literature on online learning, algorithmic game theory, and revenue maximization with posted prices. It contrasts its approach with prior work on single-buyer settings with discounting [1, 12, 13] and auction-based mechanisms [4, 8, 10], emphasizing the novelty of its adversarial, multi-buyer model with fixed windows.\nStrengths\n1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a tight characterization of the regret bounds for the problem, with both upper and lower bounds matching at \\(O(T^{2/3})\\). This is a significant theoretical contribution that advances the state of the art in online pricing with strategic buyers.\n2. Novel Algorithm: The proposed algorithm effectively balances exploration and exploitation while minimizing the impact of price fluctuations, a key challenge in this setting. The use of epochs and the adaptation of EXP3 are well-motivated and rigorously analyzed.\n3. Clarity of Analysis: The proofs are detailed and carefully constructed, particularly the lower bound proof, which uses reductions to multi-armed bandits with switching costs. The authors also provide clear intuition for the challenges posed by strategic buyers and how their algorithm addresses these.\n4. Broader Impact: The results have practical implications for e-commerce and other domains where sellers face strategic buyers, as well as theoretical implications for online learning and game theory.\nWeaknesses\n1. Practical Relevance: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm is not fully explored. For example, the paper does not discuss how the algorithm might perform under realistic buyer behavior models or in non-adversarial settings.\n2. Feedback Model Assumptions: The paper assumes a specific feedback model where the seller observes only the revenue at the end of each day. While the authors briefly discuss stronger feedback models, it would be valuable to explore how the algorithm could be adapted or improved under such conditions.\n3. Limited Experimental Validation: The paper does not include empirical results to validate the theoretical findings or to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in practice. Simulations with synthetic or real-world data could strengthen the paper's impact.\n4. Continuous Pricing Gap: The authors note a gap between the upper bound (\\(O(T^{3/4})\\)) and the lower bound (\\(\\Omega(T^{2/3})\\)) for continuous pricing but do not provide insights into how this gap might be closed. This leaves an open question that could have been explored further.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by providing tight regret bounds for a challenging and novel problem.\n- The algorithm is well-designed and rigorously analyzed, with clear connections to prior work and broader implications for online learning and pricing.\n- The lower bound proof is particularly strong, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of the problem and providing a solid foundation for future work.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The lack of experimental validation limits the paper's practical impact and leaves open questions about the algorithm's real-world performance.\n- The discussion of stronger feedback models and continuous pricing is somewhat superficial, and these areas could have been explored in greater depth.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as its theoretical contributions are substantial and advance the state of the art in online pricing with strategic buyers. However, I strongly encourage the authors to include experimental results and to expand the discussion of practical implications and extensions in future work."
