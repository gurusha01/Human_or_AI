            "inputText": "Review of \"Hierarchical Policy Networks for Long-Term Spatiotemporal Trajectory Planning\"\nSummary:\nThis paper introduces a novel hierarchical policy network (HPN) for modeling long-term spatiotemporal trajectories, with a focus on imitating expert demonstrations in high-dimensional settings, such as basketball gameplay. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of conventional policy learning methods, which often fail to capture cohesive long-term behavior. By decomposing decision-making into macro-goals and micro-actions, the HPN integrates these two levels using an attention mechanism. The authors validate their model on a dataset of professional basketball player trajectories, demonstrating that HPN generates more realistic movements compared to non-hierarchical baselines. A human preference study involving sports analysts and basketball players further supports the model's superiority. The paper also highlights the potential for broader applications of the proposed attention mechanism in other domains.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Novelty and Originality: The hierarchical decomposition of policies into macro-goals and micro-actions, combined with an attention mechanism, is a novel approach to addressing long-term trajectory planning. This work builds on prior research in hierarchical reinforcement learning (e.g., Sutton et al. [14]) and attention mechanisms, but applies these concepts in a unique way to output spaces.\n \n2. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental results, including visual analyses, human preference studies, and benchmark evaluations. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of HPN over baselines in generating realistic trajectories.\n3. Significance: The proposed method addresses a challenging problem in spatiotemporal planning and has potential applications in sports analytics, robotics, and other domains requiring long-term decision-making. The human preference study adds practical relevance to the work.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics. The inclusion of visualizations and human studies enhances understanding.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Scope of Evaluation: While the results are promising, the evaluation is limited to basketball player trajectories. The generalizability of the HPN to other domains or tasks (e.g., multi-agent systems or adversarial settings) is not thoroughly explored. Additionally, the model only focuses on offensive players, which limits its applicability to full-game scenarios.\n2. Dependence on Weak Labels: The reliance on heuristically generated weak labels for macro-goals and attention masks raises concerns about scalability to tasks where such labels are unavailable or difficult to define. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not propose concrete alternatives.\n3. Macro-Goal Inconsistencies: The paper notes occasional inconsistencies in macro-goal predictions, which could affect the quality of long-term planning. This suggests that the macro-policy may require further refinement.\n4. Limited Baselines: The baselines used for comparison are relatively simple (e.g., non-hierarchical GRU-CNN models). Including more advanced hierarchical or imitation learning baselines would strengthen the evaluation.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a significant and challenging problem in trajectory planning with a novel and technically sound approach.\n- The experimental results, including human preference studies, provide strong evidence of the model's effectiveness.\n- The hierarchical framework and attention mechanism have potential applications beyond the specific task studied.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The evaluation is narrowly focused on basketball gameplay, limiting the demonstrated generalizability of the approach.\n- The reliance on weak labels and occasional macro-goal inconsistencies highlight areas where the model could be improved.\n- The baselines are relatively weak, which may overstate the performance gains of HPN.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of hierarchical policy learning and trajectory modeling. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the generalizability and weak label dependency in future work.\nScore: 7/10"
