            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel framework for statistical inference on cluster trees, a hierarchical representation of high-density clusters in a density function. The authors address the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in empirical cluster trees by proposing methods to construct confidence sets and prune statistically insignificant features, yielding interpretable and parsimonious cluster trees. The paper also introduces a partial ordering on cluster trees to facilitate pruning and demonstrates the utility of the proposed methods on synthetic datasets and a Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) dataset. The authors compare various tree metrics, ultimately focusing on the `âˆž metric for its computational tractability and well-understood statistical behavior.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing statistical inference for cluster trees, a topic that has received limited attention in prior work. The introduction of confidence sets for cluster trees and pruning methods to simplify them is novel and impactful.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a rigorous analysis of tree metrics, demonstrating the suitability of the `âˆž metric for inference. They also establish asymptotic validity and dimension-independent convergence rates for their confidence set construction.\n3. Practical Relevance: The pruning methods are well-motivated and demonstrate clear utility in simplifying cluster trees while retaining statistically significant features. The application to the GvHD dataset highlights the practical importance of the proposed methods.\n4. Clarity of Experiments: The synthetic and real-world experiments are well-designed and effectively illustrate the strengths of the proposed techniques. The pruning results, in particular, are compelling and demonstrate the ability to distinguish genuine features from noise.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Discussion of Related Work: While the paper references key prior works on density clustering and tree metrics, the discussion of related work is somewhat narrow. For instance, connections to other statistical inference methods in clustering or hierarchical modeling could be expanded.\n2. Metric Limitations: Although the `âˆž metric is computationally convenient, the authors acknowledge its limitations compared to the modified merge distortion metric (dMM), which is more aligned with the structure of cluster trees. However, the paper does not provide a concrete path forward for addressing the challenges of using dMM.\n3. Bandwidth Selection: The reliance on the Silverman reference rule for bandwidth selection is a potential limitation. A more targeted bandwidth selection method for tree inference would enhance the robustness of the approach.\n4. Open Questions: The authors identify several open questions, such as finding all minimal trees in the confidence set and deriving valid confidence sets using dMM. While these are important directions for future work, their absence limits the completeness of the current contribution.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper addresses a novel and important problem in statistical inference for clustering.\n- The proposed methods are theoretically sound, computationally practical, and demonstrated to be effective in experiments.\n- The work has the potential to inspire further research on statistical inference for hierarchical clustering methods.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The reliance on the `âˆž metric, while practical, may limit the generality of the results.\n- The lack of a targeted bandwidth selection method for tree inference leaves room for improvement in the methodology.\n- The paper does not fully resolve the challenges associated with using more sophisticated metrics like dMM.\nRecommendation\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of density clustering and statistical inference. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, rigor, and practical relevance of the work outweigh its limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to expand the discussion of related work and address some of the identified weaknesses."
