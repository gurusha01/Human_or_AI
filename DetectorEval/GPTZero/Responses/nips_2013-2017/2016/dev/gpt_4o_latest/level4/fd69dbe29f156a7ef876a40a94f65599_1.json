            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel approach that employs multiple reasoning layers to iteratively refine question representations based on the image. Each reasoning layer is composed of two components. The first is the Question-Image interaction, implemented as a multilayer perceptron that takes as input the question representation from the previous layer and the image representation. The second component is weighted pooling, where the updated representations from the Question-Image interaction are aggregated using attention weights learned through backpropagation. The model leverages object proposals to identify candidate image regions, which are encoded using a convolutional neural network. These encoded image features interact with the question representations, and a soft attention mechanism is applied to compute an attention distribution over the image regions.\nStrengths: The technical contributions represent a creative and straightforward extension or combination of existing ideas, including the \"Neural Reasoner\" [B. Peng et al., arXiv:1508.05508, 2015], spatial coordinates [R. Hu et al., arXiv:1511.04164, 2015], and the soft attention mechanism [K. Xu et al., arXiv:1502.03044, 2015]. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with the model architecture and its modular components (image understanding layer, question encoding layer, reasoning layer, and answering layer) clearly explained. The novelty of iteratively updating the question representation based on the image is particularly noteworthy, as it has not been observed in prior VQA systems, adding significant strength to the paper.\nWeaknesses: In Section 3.1, the paper claims that adding an 8D spatial representation addresses the lack of spatial information for object locations. However, no ablation study is provided to compare the model's performance with and without these spatial coordinates. Without experimental evidence, it is unclear whether these additional spatial features contribute meaningfully to the model's ability to understand spatial relationships between object proposals. If these coordinates prove to be ineffective, the model may still suffer from the same spatial reasoning limitations, which would be a significant drawback.\nIn Section 4.3, the paper analyzes (starting at line 209) that, compared to SAN, the proposed model focuses only on selected object proposal regions with a high probability of being objects, leading to better performance on object-related questions. Additionally, line 216 suggests that a similar trend is observed in the VQA dataset, with notable improvements in the \"Other\" question type. However, the results in Table 3 do not appear to support this claim. While the proposed model outperforms SAN on Yes/No questions, it performs worse on the \"Other\" type. This inconsistency between the results and the analysis raises concerns, as there is no clear quantitative evidence to substantiate the model's claimed strength in answering \"Other\" questions.\nOverall, the proposed model appears to be an adaptation of the \"Neural Reasoner\" [B. Peng et al., arXiv:1508.05508, 2015], extended to incorporate images and an attention mechanism. This reduces the novelty of the approach.\nPost-Rebuttal Comments: The improved performance mentioned in the rebuttal is a positive development, but it does not demonstrate any additional strengths of the model. Other models are also likely to benefit from fine-tuning the visual representation (assuming this is what \"better results by fine-tuning the initial learning\" refers to). The two contributions outlined in lines 43-46 of the paper remain limited: \n1. Iteratively updating the question representation is similar to [21], but applied to images. The paper does not include ablation studies to demonstrate the benefits of this approach, such as comparisons with SAN [33] or architectures using single or double attention on image features. As a result, it is unclear how impactful this contribution is. The comparison to related work is insufficient, as differences in performance could be attributed to the experimental setup rather than the architecture itself, especially given the small performance gains. \n2. The use of object proposals is not novel, as it has already been explored in [23]. \nThe combination of limited novelty, marginal improvements over related work, and the absence of ablation experiments leads to the recommendation to reject the paper."
