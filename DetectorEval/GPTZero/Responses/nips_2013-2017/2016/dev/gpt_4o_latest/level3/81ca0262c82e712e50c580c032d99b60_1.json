The authors address two key problems: causal sensor placement and causal covariate selection, both formulated as cardinality-constrained DI maximization problems. The core contribution lies in demonstrating that the first problem is submodular (though not monotonic), while the second is \"nearly\" submodular. A significant innovation is the introduction of the Submodularity Index (SmI), a novel measure that quantifies the degree of submodularity, enabling performance guarantees for greedy algorithms even for non-monotonic and non-submodular functions. This work extends the applicability of greedy heuristics to a broader class of problems, making it a valuable contribution to combinatorial optimization and causal inference.\nThe paper's novelty is evident in its definition of approximate submodularity and the theoretical results surrounding SmI. This concept is more general than existing measures, such as the submodularity ratio, and does not presume monotonicity. The connection between SmI and performance guarantees for greedy algorithms is particularly compelling, as it bridges the gap between theory and practical applications. Additionally, the paper distinguishes between Granger-type (prediction-based) and counterfactual (mechanism-based) causality, focusing on the former, which aligns well with the use of DI.\nThe strengths of the paper include its rigorous theoretical analysis, particularly Theorem 3 and its corollaries, which provide a unified framework for analyzing greedy algorithms under approximate submodularity. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods, particularly in causal structure learning. The extension to non-monotonic and quasi-submodular functions is a significant advancement over prior work.\nHowever, there are areas for improvement. The proofs of Propositions 2 and 3 require further clarification, as they are central to the relaxation of submodularity. Additionally, while the paper discusses the relationship between the submodularity ratio in Das and Kempe [3] and SmI, this connection could be elaborated further. The manuscript also contains minor typographical and grammatical errors, which detract from its overall clarity and polish. The distinction between Granger causality and counterfactual causality could be more explicitly stated to avoid potential confusion.\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a strong case for acceptance, given its theoretical contributions and practical relevance. Addressing the aforementioned issues would further enhance its quality. The work is a valuable addition to the fields of causal inference and combinatorial optimization, with significant implications for applications in sensor placement, feature selection, and causal structure learning."
