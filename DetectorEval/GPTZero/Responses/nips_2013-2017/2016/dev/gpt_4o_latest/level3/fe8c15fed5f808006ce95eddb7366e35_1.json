            "inputText": "This paper proposes a hierarchical policy network (HPN) for modeling long-term spatiotemporal trajectories, with a focus on basketball player behavior. The approach combines macro-goals and micro-actions using an attention mechanism, aiming to generate realistic trajectories from expert demonstrations. The authors argue that conventional single-scale policy models struggle to capture long-term behavior in high-dimensional state spaces, and their hierarchical approach addresses this limitation. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of HPN through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including a human preference study, and shows improvements over non-hierarchical baselines.\nStrengths\nThe paper tackles an important and challenging problem in trajectory modeling, particularly in the context of sports analytics. The proposed hierarchical framework is conceptually novel, as it integrates macro- and micro-level decision-making through an attention mechanism applied to the output space. The human preference study involving experts and non-experts is a strong point, as it validates the model's practical utility in generating realistic trajectories. The experimental results, including visualizations and benchmark analyses, provide compelling evidence that HPN outperforms baseline models in both short-term prediction accuracy and long-term trajectory realism.\nThe paper also makes a meaningful contribution by adapting attention mechanisms, typically used in input spaces, to the output space, which could inspire further research in other domains. The use of weak labels for pretraining is a pragmatic approach to address the lack of ground truth for macro-goals, and the multi-stage learning process is well-motivated.\nWeaknesses\nDespite its strengths, the paper suffers from significant clarity issues, particularly in Section 4, which details the proposed method. Key terms, such as \"L\" in Equation 5 and the loss definitions, are left undefined or inadequately explained, making it difficult for readers, especially those less familiar with deep learning, to fully grasp the technical contributions. The notation is dense and inconsistent in places, further hindering comprehension.\nThe paper's situating within the broader literature is insufficient. While it references related work on hierarchical policies and attention mechanisms, it fails to adequately compare its approach to seminal works by researchers like George Konidaris and Sanjoy Krishnan, who have made significant contributions to skill learning and policy hierarchies. This omission weakens the paper's originality claim and leaves readers uncertain about how the proposed method advances the state of the art.\nAdditionally, the source of weak labels is not well-justified. The authors assume access to these labels but do not discuss how they might be obtained in practice, which raises concerns about the method's scalability and applicability to other domains. The paper also does not address key aspects of basketball gameplay, such as passing and shooting, which limits the scope of its findings.\nRecommendation\nWhile the paper presents an intriguing approach with promising results, it is not yet ready for acceptance in its current form. The authors are encouraged to revise and resubmit, addressing the following:\n1. Improve the clarity and completeness of technical explanations, particularly in Section 4.\n2. Provide a more thorough comparison to related work, especially by Konidaris and Krishnan.\n3. Justify the practical source of weak labels and discuss their generalizability.\n4. Expand the scope of the evaluation to include more aspects of basketball gameplay.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- Novel hierarchical framework combining macro- and micro-policies with an attention mechanism.\n- Strong experimental results, including human preference studies.\n- Potential applicability of the output attention mechanism to other domains.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- Lack of clarity in technical explanations and definitions.\n- Insufficient situating in the literature and lack of comparisons to related approaches.\n- Limited discussion of the practical feasibility of weak label acquisition.\n- Narrow scope of the case study, focusing only on player movement without considering other gameplay elements.\nIn summary, the paper has significant potential but requires substantial revisions to improve clarity, situate itself better in the literature, and address practical concerns."
