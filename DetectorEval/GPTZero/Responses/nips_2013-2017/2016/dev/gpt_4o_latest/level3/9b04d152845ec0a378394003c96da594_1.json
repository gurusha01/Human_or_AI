            "inputText": "This paper introduces Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN), a novel approach to the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task that combines residual-like networks with multimodal fusion of visual and language features. The authors adapt the principles of deep residual learning to multimodal tasks, proposing a joint residual mapping based on element-wise multiplication. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the VQA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel visualization method to interpret the attention effects of the joint residual mappings, even in the absence of explicit spatial attention parameters.\nStrengths:\n1. Performance: The proposed MRN significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods on standard VQA benchmarks, showcasing its practical utility.\n2. Contribution to Multimodal Learning: The use of multiplicative interactions to combine visual features with word embeddings is a notable contribution, providing a strong baseline for future research in multimodal tasks.\n3. Visualization Method: The novel back-propagation-based visualization method offers interpretability to the model, addressing a common critique of deep learning systems.\n4. Clarity of Results: The experimental section is thorough, exploring alternative models, varying hyperparameters, and comparing different pretrained visual features, which strengthens the validity of the results.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Novelty: While the adaptation of residual learning to multimodal tasks is interesting, the core idea lacks significant originality. The approach largely builds on existing techniques, such as residual networks and element-wise multiplication, rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts.\n2. Reliance on Pretrained Models: The heavy dependence on pretrained embeddings (e.g., Skip-Thought Vectors, VGG-19, ResNet-152) raises questions about the true contribution of MRN itself. A more detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of these pretrained components would enhance the paper's rigor.\n3. Clarity Issues: Some equations and concepts (e.g., Equation 5 in Section 3.2) are not fully explained, and key equations from referenced works (e.g., SAN) are not reproduced, making it harder for readers to follow without prior familiarity.\n4. Unexplored Design Choices: The use of sigmoid(W_q*q) as an attentional mask in Section 5.2 is not adequately justified or analyzed. This raises questions about its impact on performance compared to alternative activation functions.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper achieves state-of-the-art results, which is a strong indicator of its significance.\n- The visualization method is a valuable contribution to the interpretability of multimodal models.\n- The work provides a solid foundation for future research in multimodal residual learning.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The limited novelty of the approach may not meet the bar for groundbreaking contributions at a top-tier conference.\n- The reliance on pretrained models without sufficient analysis detracts from the originality and robustness of the proposed method.\n- Clarity issues in the presentation of equations and concepts may hinder reproducibility.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper makes a strong empirical contribution and offers a useful visualization method, its limited novelty and reliance on existing components temper its impact. I recommend acceptance as a borderline case, contingent on the authors addressing the clarity issues and providing a more detailed ablation study to disentangle the contributions of MRN from the pretrained components."
