            "inputText": "The paper introduces a dual-learning mechanism for neural machine translation (NMT) that leverages monolingual corpora to address the scarcity of parallel bilingual training data. By framing translation as a bidirectional game between two agents, the approach uses reinforcement learning to iteratively improve translation models through feedback loops. The proposed method, dual-NMT, demonstrates significant performance gains, achieving comparable accuracy to traditional NMT systems trained on full bilingual datasets, even with only 10% of the bilingual data.\nStrengths:\nThe paper is technically sound and well-organized, with a clear explanation of the dual-learning mechanism and its implementation. The integration of reinforcement learning into NMT is an efficient and novel application of existing techniques, particularly in its ability to exploit monolingual data effectively. The experimental results are robust, showing consistent improvements over baseline methods (NMT and pseudo-NMT) across multiple settings. The use of BLEU scores to evaluate translation quality and self-reconstruction performance further strengthens the validity of the claims. Additionally, the discussion on potential extensions, such as applying dual learning to other dual-task AI problems or multi-language loops, highlights the broader implications of the approach.\nWeaknesses:\nWhile the method is innovative in its integration, it does not represent a groundbreaking advancement in machine learning itself. The reliance on warm-start models trained on bilingual data limits its applicability for truly unsupervised scenarios. The exclusion of sentences with unknown words from monolingual corpora raises concerns about the scalability and generalizability of the approach, as real-world data often contain such sentences. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from exploring the use of a language model to assess sentence difficulty, which might provide more nuanced feedback during training. Minor issues, such as repetition in Table 3 (L254), incorrect capitalization (L255), and the citation of arXiv papers instead of their published versions, detract from the overall polish of the manuscript.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- Significant performance gains with reduced reliance on bilingual data.\n- Clear and thorough explanation of the methodology.\n- Opens new perspectives in NLP by integrating reinforcement learning into NMT.\n- Robust experimental validation and promising results.\nCons:\n- Limited novelty in terms of machine learning techniques.\n- Exclusion of unknown-word sentences reduces real-world applicability.\n- Minor presentation issues that require revision.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of NLP by addressing a critical bottleneck in NMT systems and demonstrating the potential of dual learning with monolingual data. While it is not groundbreaking in its methodology, its practical significance and well-executed experiments justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted issues."
