            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by leveraging a neural network to produce a mid-level representation of local geometric cues and combining these predictions through a globalization procedure. The authors propose a method that predicts probability distributions for depth derivatives of varying orders, orientations, and scales, rather than single-point depth estimates. These distributions are then harmonized to generate a coherent depth map. The approach is evaluated on the NYU v2 depth dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty: The paper introduces a unique formulation by predicting overcomplete representations of depth derivatives and using probabilistic distributions to express confidence and ambiguity. This is a significant departure from prior methods that directly regress to depth values or rely on simpler structural cues.\n2. Technical Soundness: The methodology is well-grounded, with a clear explanation of the neural network architecture, parameterization of distributions, and the globalization procedure. The Fourier-domain computations for efficient inference are particularly noteworthy.\n3. Experimental Rigor: The evaluation on the NYU v2 dataset is thorough, with both qualitative and quantitative results. The ablation study convincingly demonstrates the contribution of different derivative orders and scales to the final performance.\n4. Significance: The approach advances the state of the art in monocular depth estimation and has potential applications in other tasks like stereo reconstruction and motion estimation. The probabilistic framework is versatile and could be extended to other domains.\n5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with detailed descriptions of the methodology and experiments. The inclusion of visualizations and comparisons with prior work enhances readability.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Computational Efficiency: While the method achieves strong performance, the inference time of 24 seconds per image is relatively high, which may limit its applicability in real-time systems. The authors could explore strategies to optimize the globalization step.\n2. Limitations Acknowledgment: The paper briefly mentions failure cases (e.g., mis-estimation of relative positions or texture-less planar regions) but does not delve into their causes or potential solutions. A more detailed discussion of limitations would strengthen the work.\n3. Generality of Approach: While the authors suggest that the method could generalize to other tasks (e.g., motion estimation), no experiments are provided to substantiate this claim. A preliminary exploration of such extensions would enhance the paper's impact.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of monocular depth estimation. The proposed method is innovative, technically robust, and achieves state-of-the-art results on a standard benchmark. While there are minor concerns regarding computational efficiency and limitations, these do not detract significantly from the paper's overall quality. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the efficiency and limitation discussions in future work.\nPro Arguments:\n- Novel and well-motivated approach.\n- Strong experimental results and state-of-the-art performance.\n- Clear and detailed presentation.\nCon Arguments:\n- High computational cost.\n- Limited discussion of failure cases and generalizability.\nRating: 8/10 (Strong Accept)"
