            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel deep learning framework, called the Universal Correspondence Network (UCN), for estimating visual correspondences between images. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed framework can learn a feature space that preserves either geometric or semantic similarity, outperforming previous CNN-based approaches that optimize a surrogate patch similarity objective. The authors support this claim through extensive experiments on various datasets, including KITTI, PASCAL, and CUB-2011, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed framework, including its architecture, loss function, and training procedure. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, showing significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods. The use of a fully convolutional architecture, correspondence contrastive loss, and convolutional spatial transformer are innovative and contribute to the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of relevant literature, including previous works on visual correspondence, metric learning, and spatial transformers. The references are comprehensive, accessible, and relevant, with proper citations.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in its ability to learn a metric space for visual correspondence, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches. The proposed framework is also practically useful, as it can be applied to various computer vision tasks, such as 3D reconstruction, image retrieval, and object recognition.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors acknowledge that the spatial transformer may not be effective for smaller training sets, and the results on the KITTI dataset show that the transformer does not improve performance in this case. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed framework and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed framework is innovative and effective. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the potential of the Universal Correspondence Network for various computer vision tasks. The paper has a good balance of strengths and weaknesses, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed framework and its limitations.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and innovative framework for visual correspondence estimation.\n* The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances on various datasets.\n* The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of relevant literature.\n* The proposed framework is practically useful and can be applied to various computer vision tasks.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The spatial transformer may not be effective for smaller training sets.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed framework and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.\n* The results on the KITTI dataset show that the transformer does not improve performance in this case."
