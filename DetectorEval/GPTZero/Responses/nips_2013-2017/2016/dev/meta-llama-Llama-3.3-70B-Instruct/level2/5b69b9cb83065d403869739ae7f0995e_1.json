The main claim of the paper is that the dual-learning mechanism can effectively reduce the requirement for parallel bilingual data and achieve comparable accuracy to NMT trained from full bilingual data.\nThe paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the dual-learning mechanism, which involves a two-agent game with a forward translation step and a backward translation step. The mechanism is based on reinforcement learning, where the agents learn to improve the translation models by maximizing the reward function. The experimental results show that the dual-NMT algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in all settings, with significant improvements in translation accuracy.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the background, methodology, and experimental results. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* Novelty: The dual-learning mechanism is a new and innovative approach to NMT that leverages monolingual data to improve translation accuracy.\n* Effectiveness: The experimental results show that the dual-NMT algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in all settings.\n* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the background, methodology, and experimental results.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* Limited scope: The paper only focuses on English-French translation, and it would be interesting to see the results for other language pairs.\n* Dependence on warm-start models: The dual-NMT algorithm relies on warm-start models trained from bilingual data, which may not be available for all language pairs.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed dual-learning mechanism is a significant contribution to the field of NMT. The experimental results are promising, and the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the background, methodology, and results.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to NMT that leverages monolingual data to improve translation accuracy.\n* The experimental results show that the dual-NMT algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in all settings.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the background, methodology, and experimental results.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper has a limited scope, focusing only on English-French translation.\n* The dual-NMT algorithm relies on warm-start models trained from bilingual data, which may not be available for all language pairs.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach."
