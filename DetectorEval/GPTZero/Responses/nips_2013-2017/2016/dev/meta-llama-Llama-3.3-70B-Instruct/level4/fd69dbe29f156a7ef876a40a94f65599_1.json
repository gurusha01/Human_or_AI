            "inputText": "The manuscript presents a novel approach to visual question answering (VQA) by introducing multiple reasoning layers that iteratively refine question representations based on image features. Each reasoning layer comprises two components: Question-Image interaction, a multilayer perceptron that integrates the previous layer's question representation with the image representation, and weighted pooling, which combines the updated representations using attention weights learned through backpropagation. The model leverages object proposals to identify candidate image regions, encoding these regions using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The encoded image features interact with question representations, and a soft attention mechanism generates an attention distribution over image regions.\nA key strength of the manuscript is its technical contributions, which cleverly extend and combine existing concepts, such as the \"Neural Reasoner\" [B. Peng et al., 2015], spatial coordinates [R. Hu et al., 2015], and soft attention mechanisms [K. Xu et al., 2015]. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, particularly in its modular explanation of the model architecture, including the image understanding layer, question encoding layer, reasoning layer, and answering layer. The novelty of updating question representations based on image features is a significant contribution, as it has not been encountered in previous VQA systems.\nHowever, several weaknesses are noted. In Section 3.1, the addition of 8D spatial coordinates is proposed to address the lack of spatial information for object locations. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether ablation studies were conducted to compare the performance of models with and without these spatial coordinates. Without experimental results, it is challenging to determine whether these extra coordinates effectively enhance the model's understanding of spatial relationships between object proposals. If these coordinates are found to be ineffective, the model may still suffer from the same issue, which could be a significant drawback.\nFurthermore, in Section 4.3, the analysis suggests that the proposed model outperforms SAN (Stacked Attention Networks) in answering questions involving objects, as it only considers selected object proposal regions with high object probability. However, the results in Table 3 do not support this claim, as the proposed model only performs better in Yes/No questions and worse in Other types compared to SAN. This inconsistency between the results and analysis makes it difficult to quantify the model's strength in answering Other types.\nUpon reevaluation, the proposed model appears to be an extension of the \"Neural Reasoner\" [B. Peng et al., 2015] using images and attention mechanisms, which may diminish the novelty of the approach. The improved performance mentioned in the rebuttal, although promising, does not demonstrate additional strengths of the model, as other models may also improve with fine-tuning of the visual representation. The two contributions highlighted in the manuscript are limited: iteratively updating question representations is similar to existing work [21], and the use of object proposals is not novel [23]. The lack of ablation experiments and limited improvements over related work lead to the recommendation to reject the paper."
