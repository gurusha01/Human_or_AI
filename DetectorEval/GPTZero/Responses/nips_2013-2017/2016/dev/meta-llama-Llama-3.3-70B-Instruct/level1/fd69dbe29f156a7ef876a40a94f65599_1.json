The model iteratively updates the question representation by selecting image regions relevant to the query and learns to give the correct answer. The authors claim that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging VQA datasets, COCO-QA and VQA.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the VQA task, related work, and their proposed model. The model architecture is well-explained, and the use of attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons is justified. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their model's performance on different question types.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n* The proposed model is novel and well-motivated, addressing the limitations of existing VQA models.\n* The use of attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons allows the model to focus on relevant image regions and update the question representation effectively.\n* The experimental results are strong, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of their model's performance.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n* The model's performance on counting tasks is weaker than other models, which is a limitation that the authors acknowledge.\n* The use of object proposals may not always be effective, and the model may struggle with questions that require a more nuanced understanding of the image content.\n* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of their model's attention mechanisms and how they relate to human visual attention.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated model that addresses the limitations of existing VQA models.\n* The experimental results are strong, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of their model's performance.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the VQA task, related work, and their proposed model.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The model's performance on counting tasks is weaker than other models, which may be a significant limitation.\n* The use of object proposals may not always be effective, and the model may struggle with questions that require a more nuanced understanding of the image content.\n* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of their model's attention mechanisms and how they relate to human visual attention.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of VQA and deserves to be accepted. The proposed model is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results are strong. While there are some limitations to the model, the authors acknowledge these and provide a clear direction for future work."
