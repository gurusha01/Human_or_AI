            "inputText": "This paper proposes a Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) algorithmic framework for combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games, which is a general model that combines the combinatorial aspect of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with the limited feedback aspect of partial monitoring (PM) games. The authors also introduce another algorithm, PEGE2, which combines gap estimation with a PEGE algorithm to achieve a distribution-dependent O(log T) regret bound.\nThe paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly the work on CPM games by [1], which proposed a Global Confidence Bound (GCB) algorithm with O(T 2/3 log T) distribution-independent and O(log T) distribution-dependent regret bounds. The authors argue that their PEGE framework has several advantages over GCB, including not requiring the arg-secondmax oracle, not requiring the existence of a unique optimal action for distribution-dependent regret, and having regret bounds that are independent of the size of the learner's action space.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a new algorithmic framework, PEGE, which achieves competitive regret bounds with respect to GCB.\n* The introduction of PEGE2, which combines gap estimation with PEGE to achieve a distribution-dependent O(log T) regret bound.\n* The analysis of the regret bounds of the proposed algorithms, which provides insights into the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in CPM games.\n* The application of the proposed algorithms to a practical problem, online ranking with feedback at the top, which demonstrates the potential of the algorithms in real-world scenarios.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of a global observable set, which may not always be satisfied in practice.\n* The requirement of knowledge of the time horizon T for PEGE2, which may not be available in all scenarios.\n* The lack of experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms, which would provide further insights into their performance in practice.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning and decision-making, particularly in the context of CPM games. The proposed algorithms, PEGE and PEGE2, have the potential to be applied in a wide range of scenarios, including online ranking, recommendation systems, and other applications where feedback is limited.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a new algorithmic framework, PEGE, which achieves competitive regret bounds with respect to GCB.\n* The introduction of PEGE2, which combines gap estimation with PEGE, provides a more efficient algorithm for distribution-dependent regret.\n* The analysis of the regret bounds of the proposed algorithms provides insights into the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in CPM games.\n* The application of the proposed algorithms to a practical problem, online ranking with feedback at the top, demonstrates the potential of the algorithms in real-world scenarios.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption of a global observable set may not always be satisfied in practice.\n* The requirement of knowledge of the time horizon T for PEGE2 may not be available in all scenarios.\n* The lack of experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms may raise concerns about their performance in practice.\nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed algorithms and their analysis. The use of mathematical notation is consistent, and the proofs are well-organized and easy to follow.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed algorithms and their analysis.
