            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict probability distributions over local coefficients of the scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs distributions for various spatial derivatives at each location, allowing it to express confidence and ambiguity about different aspects of the scene geometry. A globalization procedure is then used to combine these local predictions and produce a consistent depth map.\nThe paper relates to previous work on monocular depth estimation, which has largely focused on direct regression to depth values or predicting surface normals. In contrast, this approach predicts a more diverse set of structural relationships and uses a distributional output space to characterize ambiguity in the predictions. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach on the NYU v2 depth dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\nThe strengths of this paper include its novel approach to monocular depth estimation, its ability to characterize ambiguity in the predictions, and its state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset. The use of an overcomplete representation and a globalization procedure allows the network to effectively summarize the depth cues present in a single image.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The network architecture is complex and has a high-dimensional output space, which may make it difficult to train and optimize. The globalization procedure is also iterative and may require careful tuning of hyperparameters. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis of the network's predictions and the globalization procedure, such as visualizations of the predicted distributions and the intermediate results of the globalization procedure.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and interesting approach to monocular depth estimation\n* The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset\n* The use of an overcomplete representation and a globalization procedure allows the network to effectively summarize the depth cues present in a single image\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The network architecture is complex and may be difficult to train and optimize\n* The globalization procedure is iterative and may require careful tuning of hyperparameters\n* The paper could benefit from more analysis of the network's predictions and the globalization procedure\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and monocular depth estimation, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the approach is well-motivated and well-explained. However, the network architecture is complex, and the globalization procedure may require careful tuning of hyperparameters.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the approach and the results. However, some of the technical details, such as the network architecture and the globalization procedure, may require careful reading to understand.\nOriginality: 9/10\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of an overcomplete representation and a globalization procedure is also original and interesting.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset, which is a significant achievement. The approach also has the potential to be used in other applications, such as stereo reconstruction or motion estimation."
