The authors develop a framework for constructing confidence intervals and p-values for testing selected groups of variables, which is a crucial aspect of selective inference. The paper builds upon previous work on selective inference, including the \"polyhedral lemma\" of Lee et al. and the work of Loftus and Taylor on group-sparse regression.\nThe main technical result of the paper is the \"truncated projection lemma,\" which characterizes the distribution of the magnitude of the projection of the data onto a given subspace, conditioned on a particular selection event. This result enables the authors to develop inference tools for a broad class of group-sparse selection methods, including the group lasso, iterative hard thresholding, and forward stepwise regression.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical results. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the results on the California health data showcase the practical applicability of the approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The development of a novel framework for selective inference in group-sparse linear regression\n* The provision of a clear and concise explanation of the technical results\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed methods through numerical experiments\n* The application of the approach to a real-world dataset\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of a fixed design matrix, which may not always be realistic in practice\n* The lack of a thorough comparison with existing methods for selective inference in group-sparse regression\n* The potential computational complexity of the proposed methods, particularly for large datasets\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of selective inference in group-sparse linear regression\n* The technical results are novel and well-motivated\n* The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods\n* The paper is well-organized and clearly written\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The assumption of a fixed design matrix may limit the applicability of the approach in practice\n* The lack of a thorough comparison with existing methods may make it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach\n* The potential computational complexity of the proposed methods may be a concern for large datasets\nOverall, I believe that the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of selective inference in group-sparse linear regression, and the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance of the paper, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
