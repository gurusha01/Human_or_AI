            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The authors replace the traditional collapse layer with a recurrent attention mechanism, allowing the network to iteratively focus on single text lines and perform implicit line segmentation.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, including the evolution of handwriting recognition systems from character to word segmentation and the current state-of-the-art MDLSTM-RNNs. The proposed model is thoroughly explained, and the experiments are well-designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed model achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art systems on two public databases, IAM and Rimes, without requiring explicit line segmentation.\n* The attention mechanism allows the network to focus on relevant parts of the input image, enabling implicit line segmentation and improving performance.\n* The model is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, making it more practical for real-world applications.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The model is limited to paragraph-level images and requires a document layout analysis to detect paragraphs before applying the model.\n* The approach may not generalize well to complex documents with multiple text blocks and arbitrary reading orders.\n* The authors acknowledge that the language model used in the experiments may not be optimal, and further improvements could be made by using more advanced language models.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to offline handwriting recognition, demonstrating competitive results with state-of-the-art systems.\n* The model is well-designed, and the experiments are thorough and well-executed.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the related work and the proposed approach, making it easy to follow and understand.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The model is limited to paragraph-level images and may not generalize well to more complex documents.\n* The approach may require significant modifications to be applied to real-world scenarios, such as document layout analysis and language model optimization.\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis and discussion of the results, including error analysis and comparison to other state-of-the-art systems.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of offline handwriting recognition, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of handwriting recognition systems. With some revisions to address the limitations and weaknesses, the paper could be even stronger and more impactful."
