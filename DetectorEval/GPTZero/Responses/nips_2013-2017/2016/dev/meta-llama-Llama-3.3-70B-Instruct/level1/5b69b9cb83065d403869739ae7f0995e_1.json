The authors introduce a two-agent game where two translation models, one for each language direction, are trained to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. The game provides feedback signals to the models, allowing them to improve without the need for parallel bilingual data.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the dual-learning mechanism and its application to NMT. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements over baseline models, especially when using limited bilingual data.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a novel dual-learning mechanism that can leverage monolingual data to improve NMT accuracy.\n* The provision of a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the two-agent game and the reinforcement learning process.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments, including comparisons with baseline models and analysis of the results.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The reliance on warm-start models trained on bilingual data, which may not be available in all scenarios.\n* The limited exploration of the dual-learning mechanism's applicability to other NLP tasks beyond machine translation.\n* The lack of a more detailed analysis of the feedback signals provided by the game and their impact on the models' performance.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to NMT that leverages monolingual data, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements over baseline models.\n* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, making it easy to understand and replicate.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The reliance on warm-start models trained on bilingual data may limit the applicability of the proposed approach in scenarios where such data is not available.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the feedback signals provided by the game and their impact on the models' performance.\n* The exploration of the dual-learning mechanism's applicability to other NLP tasks beyond machine translation is limited, which may reduce the paper's impact and relevance to the broader NLP community.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of NMT and provides a novel and innovative approach to leveraging monolingual data. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance."
