            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to causal subset selection using Directed Information as a measure of prediction causality. The authors formulate two typical tasks, causal sensor placement and covariate selection, into cardinality constrained directed information maximizations. They show that the first problem is submodular while not necessarily monotonic, and the second one is \"nearly\" submodular. To address the issue of non-submodularity, the authors introduce a novel quantity, namely submodularity index (SmI), for general set functions. They demonstrate that SmI can be used to characterize the degree of submodularity and provide a performance guarantee for greedy algorithms.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, with detailed proofs and derivations. The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of SmI, which provides a novel way to characterize the degree of submodularity for general set functions.\n* The provision of a performance guarantee for greedy algorithms using SmI, which extends the applicability of greedy heuristics to a broader class of problems.\n* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of a fixed cardinality constraint, which may not always be realistic in practice.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for causal subset selection.\n* The limited discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which may be a concern for large-scale problems.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of causal subset selection and provides a novel approach to addressing the challenges of non-submodularity. The introduction of SmI and the provision of a performance guarantee for greedy algorithms are particularly noteworthy.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of causal subset selection.\n* The introduction of SmI provides a new way to characterize the degree of submodularity for general set functions.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption of a fixed cardinality constraint may not always be realistic in practice.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for causal subset selection may limit the impact of the paper.\n* The limited discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach may be a concern for large-scale problems.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
