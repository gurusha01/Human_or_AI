            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict distributions over coefficients of a scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs a set of distributions for each coefficient, allowing it to express confidence and ambiguity in its predictions. A globalization procedure is then used to combine these local distributions and produce a single consistent depth map.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach, including the architecture of the neural network and the globalization procedure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the NYU v2 depth benchmark. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of different components of the overcomplete representation to the final estimation accuracy.\nThe main strengths of the paper are:\n* The novel approach to monocular depth estimation, which allows the network to express uncertainty and ambiguity in its predictions.\n* The use of an overcomplete representation, which enables the network to capture a wide range of depth cues.\n* The efficient globalization procedure, which allows for fast and accurate estimation of the scene depth map.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the network's performance on different types of scenes and objects.\n* The experimental results could be improved by comparing the proposed approach to other state-of-the-art methods on a wider range of benchmarks.\n* The paper could provide more insights into the interpretability of the network's predictions and the globalization procedure.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound and well-supported by experimental results. The claims made in the paper are well-supported by the results, and the approach is carefully evaluated. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand.\nIn terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of an overcomplete representation and the globalization procedure are also novel and interesting aspects of the paper.\nIn terms of significance, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of computer vision, particularly in applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. The approach proposed in the paper could be used to improve the accuracy and robustness of depth estimation in a wide range of scenarios.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and has the potential to make a significant impact in a wide range of applications. \nArguments pro acceptance:\n* Novel approach to monocular depth estimation\n* State-of-the-art performance on NYU v2 depth benchmark\n* Efficient globalization procedure\n* Well-written and clearly explained\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Limited analysis of network's performance on different types of scenes and objects\n* Limited comparison to other state-of-the-art methods on a wider range of benchmarks\n* Limited insights into interpretability of network's predictions and globalization procedure"
