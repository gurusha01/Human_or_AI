            "inputText": "This paper presents a well-structured and clearly written exploration of the use of drift-diffusion models for modeling decision making under uncertainty in psychophysics and neuroscience. The authors aim to determine the optimal threshold for a given problem by minimizing stopping time and decision error, and compute this using two different algorithms that treat the optimization as a reinforcement learning problem.\nThe strengths of this paper include its thorough discussion of the background and related work, as well as its clear explanation of the methods used to optimize the decision threshold. The use of two distinct approaches, REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization, provides a comprehensive understanding of the problem and allows for a comparison of their strengths and weaknesses. The results are well-presented and easy to follow, with clear figures and tables that support the authors' claims.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is that it relies heavily on synthetic examples, rather than real human or animal data. While the authors do compare their results to experimental data from rodent and bat studies, it would be more impactful to apply their methods to real data to provide a sense of how optimal humans are in decision making. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the methods presented.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of their work, and provide a clear and honest discussion of the limitations of their methods. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear headings and concise language.\nThe originality of the paper lies in its application of reinforcement learning methods to the problem of optimizing decision thresholds in drift-diffusion models. The use of REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization methods is novel in this context, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of how these methods can be used to solve the problem. The paper also provides a unique contribution to the field by mapping the full decision performance of the drift-diffusion model over a main portion of its parameter space.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance our understanding of decision making under uncertainty and to provide new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie this process. The methods presented in the paper could be applied to a wide range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, and could have a significant impact on our understanding of decision making and optimization.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a clear and well-structured exploration of the use of drift-diffusion models for modeling decision making under uncertainty.\n* The authors provide a thorough discussion of the background and related work, as well as a clear explanation of the methods used to optimize the decision threshold.\n* The results are well-presented and easy to follow, with clear figures and tables that support the authors' claims.\n* The paper provides a unique contribution to the field by mapping the full decision performance of the drift-diffusion model over a main portion of its parameter space.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper relies heavily on synthetic examples, rather than real human or animal data.\n* The discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the methods presented could be more detailed.\n* The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison of the REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization methods, including a discussion of their relative strengths and weaknesses."
