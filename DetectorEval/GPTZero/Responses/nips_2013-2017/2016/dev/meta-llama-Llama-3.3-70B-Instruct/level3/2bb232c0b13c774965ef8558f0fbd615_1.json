            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular MDLSTM-RNN architecture to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The authors introduce an attention mechanism that allows the model to iteratively focus on single text lines, effectively performing implicit line segmentation. The results on the Rimes and IAM datasets are competitive with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential of this approach.\nThe strengths of this paper include its innovative approach to handwriting recognition, which eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation. The use of an attention mechanism to perform implicit line segmentation is a key contribution, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the model, particularly the MD-LSTM model, to help readers understand the architecture without referencing external sources. Additionally, the implementation details of the authors' method, particularly in comparison to Graves et al, need to be clarified to explain the 20-30x speed improvement claim and other peculiar results. The authors also acknowledge that the model struggles with recognizing punctuation, which is a significant limitation.\nTo improve the paper, I would suggest adding more experimental results, such as training on combined datasets and fine-tuning on IAM training data, to help improve performance and address the system's shortcomings. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the attention mechanism and its role in implicit line segmentation, as well as explore ways to improve the model's performance on punctuation recognition.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of handwriting recognition and has the potential to be a valuable addition to the conference program. However, with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper could be even stronger.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* Innovative approach to handwriting recognition that eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation\n* Competitive results on Rimes and IAM datasets\n* Well-organized and clearly written paper\nArguments against acceptance:\n* Lack of detailed explanations of the model architecture\n* Unclear implementation details and speed improvement claims\n* Limitations in recognizing punctuation\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
