            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to learning hierarchical policy models from demonstration using deep neural networks and attention mechanisms, with an application to generating player behavior in basketball. The authors introduce diffusion-convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which learn a representation that encapsulates the results of graph diffusion, offering performance improvements over probabilistic relational models and kernel methods at node classification tasks.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and their proposed solution. The technical sections are detailed, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DCNNs on various classification tasks. However, I found some parts of the paper, particularly Section 4, to be unclear and lacking sufficient background in deep learning.\nOne of the main strengths of the paper is its ability to learn a flexible representation of graphical data that encodes node features, edge features, and purely structural information with little preprocessing. The authors also demonstrate the scalability of DCNNs, showing that they can be applied to graphs of tens to hundreds of thousands of nodes.\nHowever, the paper lacks sufficient comparison to alternate approaches and related literature. For example, the work of George Konidaris and Sanjoy Krishnan on learning skills or macro-actions from demonstration is not mentioned. Additionally, the origin of weak labels in practice is not clearly explained, and the authors could benefit from revising and resubmitting the paper with clearer explanations and a more comprehensive literature review.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, I would rate the paper as follows:\n* Quality: 7/10 (the paper is technically sound, but some parts are unclear and lack sufficient background)\n* Clarity: 6/10 (the paper is well-structured, but some sections are difficult to follow)\n* Originality: 8/10 (the paper proposes a novel approach to learning hierarchical policy models)\n* Significance: 8/10 (the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DCNNs on various classification tasks and has the potential to advance the state of the art in graph-structured data)\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to learning hierarchical policy models\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DCNNs on various classification tasks\n* The paper has the potential to advance the state of the art in graph-structured data\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks sufficient comparison to alternate approaches and related literature\n* Some parts of the paper are unclear and lack sufficient background in deep learning\n* The origin of weak labels in practice is not clearly explained\nOverall, I would recommend revising and resubmitting the paper with clearer explanations, a more comprehensive literature review, and additional comparisons to alternate approaches. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of graph-structured data and deep learning."
