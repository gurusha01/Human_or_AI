            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to visual question answering (VQA) by introducing a neural network-based reasoning model that iteratively updates the question representation by inferring image information. The model utilizes object proposals to obtain candidate image regions and employs an attention mechanism to determine the relevance between the question and each image region. The results demonstrate the ability of the model to infer image regions relevant to the question and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two challenging VQA datasets, COCO-QA and VQA.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the architecture of the model and the experimental setup. The use of object proposals and attention mechanisms is a key strength of the paper, as it allows the model to focus on relevant image regions and improve its performance on VQA tasks.\nHowever, there are some issues with the paper that need to be addressed. Firstly, the discussion on causality is limited, and the concept of causality is not clearly defined in the context of VQA. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how their approach relates to causality and how it differs from existing work on causal inference.\nSecondly, the connection to existing work on submodularity ratio is not clearly established. The authors introduce a novel definition of approximate submodularity, but it is not clear how this relates to existing work on submodularity ratio. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison with existing work and clarify the relationship between their results and existing theorems.\nAdditionally, there are some minor issues with the paper, including typos, grammatical errors, and missing references. The authors should ensure that the paper is thoroughly proofread and that all references are properly cited.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide a good overview of the related work. The approach is novel and differs from existing work on VQA.\nHowever, the paper could be improved by providing a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and the potential applications of the model. The authors should also consider providing more visualizations and examples to illustrate the performance of the model.\nOverall, I recommend that the authors address the issues mentioned above and provide a revised version of the paper that clarifies the connection to existing work and provides a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the model.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to VQA that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets.\n* The use of object proposals and attention mechanisms is a key strength of the paper.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The discussion on causality is limited, and the concept of causality is not clearly defined.\n* The connection to existing work on submodularity ratio is not clearly established.\n* There are some minor issues with the paper, including typos, grammatical errors, and missing references."
