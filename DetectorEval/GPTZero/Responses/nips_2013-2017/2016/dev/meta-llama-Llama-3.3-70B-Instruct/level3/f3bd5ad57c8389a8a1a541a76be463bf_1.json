            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation, leveraging a probabilistic model and a neural network to predict uncertainty in the output. The method uses a set of derivative filters to produce an overcomplete feature representation, which is then used to build a probabilistic model. The paper demonstrates favorable results on the NYU2 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on most metrics.\nThe strengths of this paper include its probabilistic nature, which allows the network to express confidence and ambiguity in its predictions. The consensus step, which combines partial observations to resolve ambiguities, is also a notable contribution. The use of a neural network to predict distributions over coefficients in an overcomplete representation is a novel approach, and the globalization procedure used to combine these predictions is efficient and effective.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The use of a fixed set of derivative feature estimates may limit the flexibility of the approach, and it is unclear whether these features could be learned within the same framework using an iterative algorithm. The use of K-means to learn parameters in Section 3.1 may not be the most effective approach, and the reviewer suggests that EM might be a more natural choice with better results. Additionally, the paper does not provide information on the typical running times at test time, which is a concern given the complexity of the approach.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the comparison to state-of-the-art approaches is helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the method. The use of visualizations to illustrate the accuracy and confidence of the local per-coefficient distributions is also a nice touch.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation of the approach and results. The writing is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the contributions and limitations of the approach. The paper is also significant, as it presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation that leverages a probabilistic model and a neural network to predict uncertainty in the output.\n* The method demonstrates favorable results on the NYU2 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on most metrics.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The use of a fixed set of derivative feature estimates may limit the flexibility of the approach.\n* The use of K-means to learn parameters in Section 3.1 may not be the most effective approach.\n* The paper does not provide information on the typical running times at test time, which is a concern given the complexity of the approach."
