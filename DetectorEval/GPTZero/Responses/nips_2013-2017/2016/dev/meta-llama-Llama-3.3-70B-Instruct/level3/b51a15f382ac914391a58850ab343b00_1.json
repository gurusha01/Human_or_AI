            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The authors replace the traditional collapse layer with a recurrent attention mechanism, allowing the network to iteratively focus on individual text lines within a paragraph. This approach eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation, a crucial step in traditional handwriting recognition systems.\nThe paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly explained. The authors provide a thorough overview of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the advantages of their proposed approach. The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed model achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art systems on two public databases, IAM and Rimes.\nThe strengths of the paper include its originality, clarity, and significance. The proposed approach is a significant departure from traditional methods, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and results.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The authors could provide more analysis on the attention mechanism and its role in implicit line segmentation. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the approach, particularly with regards to handling complex documents with multiple text blocks and arbitrary reading orders.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper. The proposed approach is novel, and the results are significant, demonstrating the potential for end-to-end handwriting recognition without explicit line segmentation. While there are areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly explained, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* Novel approach to offline handwriting recognition\n* Competitive performance with state-of-the-art systems\n* Well-written and clear explanation of ideas\n* Significant contribution to the field\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Limited analysis on attention mechanism and implicit line segmentation\n* Limited discussion on handling complex documents\n* Potential areas for improvement in methodology and results."
