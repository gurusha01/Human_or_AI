The model utilizes object proposals and a soft attention mechanism to generate attention distribution over image regions. While the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a modular and simple architecture, the technical contributions are a combination of existing ideas, including Neural Reasoner, spatial coordinates, and soft attention mechanism.\nThe model's ability to update the question representation based on the image is a significant strength, allowing it to focus on important image information automatically. However, the lack of ablation experiments to compare the performances of the models with and without spatial coordinates is a major weakness, making it hard to tell if these extra coordinates are actually helping the model. Additionally, the results and analysis in the paper seem to be inconsistent, with the proposed model performing worse in certain question types compared to other models, despite claims of improved performance.\nThe rebuttal's mention of improved performance through fine-tuning the visual representation does not show any additional strength of the model, as other models should improve similarly with such fine-tuning. The two contributions of the paper, iteratively updating the question representation and using object proposals, are limited and not novel, with similar ideas already presented in other works.\nOverall, while the paper has some strengths, the weaknesses and limitations outweigh them, leading to a recommendation to reject the paper. The paper's quality is compromised by the lack of novelty and inconsistent results, and the significance of the contributions is limited. The paper's clarity is good, but the originality is lacking, and the paper does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a modular and simple architecture for VQA.\n* The model's ability to update the question representation based on the image is a significant strength.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The technical contributions are a combination of existing ideas, lacking novelty.\n* The lack of ablation experiments to compare the performances of the models with and without spatial coordinates is a major weakness.\n* The results and analysis in the paper seem to be inconsistent, with the proposed model performing worse in certain question types compared to other models.\n* The two contributions of the paper are limited and not novel, with similar ideas already presented in other works."
