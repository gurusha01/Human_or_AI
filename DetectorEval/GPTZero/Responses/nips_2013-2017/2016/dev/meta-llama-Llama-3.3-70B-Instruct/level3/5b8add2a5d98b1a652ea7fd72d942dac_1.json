            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), for solving systems of quadratic equations, which is an important problem in signal processing. The algorithm proceeds in two stages: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of truncated generalized gradient iterations. The authors introduce a new initialization procedure that avoids the shortcomings of previous spectral methods and shows advantages over previous ones in empirical studies. The paper also proposes an iterative truncated-generalized-gradient algorithm to refine the solution by minimizing a non-convex and non-smooth amplitude-based cost function, with a rigorous analysis of its convergence to the correct solution.\nThe algorithm is shown to be superior to state-of-the-art algorithms, reducing the number of equations needed to solve the problem and narrowing the gap towards the information-theoretic number of equations required. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with convincing analysis and empirical results that are likely to play a significant role in future work in the field of phase retrieval problems.\nThe strengths of the paper include the novelty of the algorithm, the rigorous analysis of its convergence, and the impressive empirical results. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its components, making it easy to understand and implement. The paper also provides a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of TGGF.\nThe weaknesses of the paper are minor and include the lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and the potential limitations of the algorithm in certain scenarios. However, these weaknesses do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, with a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its components. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise language. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and empirical results, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nThe paper is also original, with a novel algorithm that builds on previous work in the field. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions and how it advances the state of the art. The paper is well-referenced, with a thorough review of previous work in the field and a clear explanation of how the authors' work relates to it.\nOverall, I highly recommend this paper for acceptance at the conference. It is a well-written, technically sound, and original paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of phase retrieval problems.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* Novel algorithm with rigorous analysis of its convergence\n* Impressive empirical results demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms\n* Well-written and easy to follow paper with clear explanation of the algorithm and its components\n* Original contribution that advances the state of the art in the field\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Lack of detailed analysis of computational complexity\n* Potential limitations of the algorithm in certain scenarios\nHowever, these weaknesses are minor and do not detract from the overall quality of the paper."
