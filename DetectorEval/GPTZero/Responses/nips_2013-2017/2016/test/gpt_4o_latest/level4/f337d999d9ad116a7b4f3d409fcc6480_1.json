By integrating a nonnegativity constraint, a spatial smoothness regularizer, a low-rank assumption, and a masking mechanism to address ambiguity at the injection site, the authors develop a model capable of leveraging observed tracer data to deduce the underlying connectivity. While the individual components of this approach have been studied in other structured regression contexts, this work provides a comprehensive and well-executed application of these techniques to a compelling scientific problem. The core model is a non-negative linear regression, y = Wx + \\eta, where \\eta is sampled from a spherical Gaussian distribution. The weight matrix, W, is constrained to be nonnegative and is modeled probabilistically using a spatially smooth prior. Additionally, the model allows for an optional low-rank assumption on the weight matrix, which can significantly enhance memory efficiency in large-scale scenarios.
