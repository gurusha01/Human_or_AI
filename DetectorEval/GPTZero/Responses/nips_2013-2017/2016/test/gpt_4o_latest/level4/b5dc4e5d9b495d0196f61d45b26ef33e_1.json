            "inputText": "The paper investigates algorithms for addressing a specific class of optimization problems, defined as min{x in Omega1} F(x), where F(x) = max{u in Omega2} \\langle Ax, u \\rangle - phi(u) + g(x). In this formulation, g is convex, Omega1 is closed and convex, Omega2 is closed, convex, and bounded, and the set of optimal solutions Omega* \\subset Omega1 is convex, compact, and non-empty. The authors also assume that the proximal mapping for g can be computed efficiently. This framework appears sufficiently general to encompass a variety of applications, including several regularized empirical loss minimization problems commonly encountered in machine learning. \nThe classic work of Nesterov combined a smoothing approximation technique with accelerated proximal gradient descent to achieve an epsilon-accurate solution in O(1/epsilon) iterations. In this approach, the smoothing parameter mu governs both the quality of the smooth approximation (smaller mu yields a better approximation) and the convergence rate (smaller mu slows convergence). By balancing these trade-offs, one can achieve an epsilon-accurate solution in O(1/epsilon) iterations. The submission demonstrates that if F satisfies a \"Local Error Bound\" (LEB), faster convergence can be achieved. Broadly, an LEB ensures that the distance of any x from an optimal solution decreases as a constant power of the gap between F(x) and the optimal value F(x^*). \nThe main idea of the proposed algorithm is to adapt Nesterov's method by starting with a large mu and gradually reducing it throughout the algorithm's execution. This approach leverages the fact that a precise approximation of the original problem is unnecessary at the outset (when the solution is far from optimal). As the algorithm progresses and approaches a better solution, mu can be reduced to improve the smooth approximation without sacrificing the convergence rate. The authors also propose a primal-dual variant of the algorithm, which does not require manual parameter tuning (details are primarily provided in the supplementary material). Applications to specific problem classes are discussed, and experimental results from three different domains are presented. These experiments demonstrate significantly improved iteration complexity for small values of epsilon compared to both standard Accelerated Proximal Gradient Descent and a first-order primal-dual method.\nOverall, this appears to be a valuable contribution, both in terms of the theoretical analysis (which is clear, intuitive, and seemingly novel for this type of smoothing algorithm) and the practical efficiency demonstrated in the experiments. (However, I lack sufficient expertise in this area to definitively confirm whether the algorithms used for comparison are truly state-of-the-art.) The class of problems considered encompasses a range of important applications, and the theoretical results appear to generalize or asymptotically improve upon several directly comparable prior works. For applications where theta=1, such as regularized empirical loss minimization with L1-norm or L{infty}-norm regularizers and non-smooth loss functions like hinge or absolute loss, the proposed algorithm is claimed to converge in O(log(epsilon_0/epsilon)) iterations. In contrast, the authors suggest that prior methods would require O(1/epsilon) iterations. If this claim is accurate, it represents an exponential improvement over prior work, which is quite remarkable. The authors might consider emphasizing this point more explicitly. \nIt would also be helpful to evaluate the algorithm's performance against prior methods for larger values of epsilon. Based on the experiments, it seems that the proposed algorithm's advantage is primarily observed for small epsilon. If this is the case, why not use existing methods to quickly obtain a reasonably good solution and then switch to the proposed algorithm to refine it further? \nAdditional questions and comments:\n- The submission mentions that if L_mu is difficult to compute, the \"backtracking trick\" can be used. Was this approach necessary in any of the experimental applications? \n- The proposed primal-dual method operates on both the primal and dual spaces. It is somewhat surprising that this version of the algorithm achieved the best overall wall time in the experiments. Does the reported wall time include the computational cost of updating both the primal and dual solutions?"
