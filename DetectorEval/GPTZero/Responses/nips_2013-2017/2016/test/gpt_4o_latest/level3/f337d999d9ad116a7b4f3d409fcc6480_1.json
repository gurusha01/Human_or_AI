            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel structured regression model designed to infer voxel-scale neural connectivity using viral tracing data. The model incorporates nonnegativity, spatial smoothness, low-rank assumptions, and ambiguity-handling masks to address the challenges of incomplete data and the high dimensionality of the problem. While the individual components of the model\"\"such as non-negative linear regression, spatial smoothing priors, and low-rank factorization\"\"are well-established in the literature, their combination and application to mesoscale neural connectivity is both innovative and well-executed. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through synthetic data experiments and real-world applications using the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, achieving significant improvements over existing regional models.\nStrengths: \nThe paper is technically sound and provides a clear and thorough presentation of the methodology. The inclusion of synthetic examples and real-world applications strengthens the validity of the proposed model. The use of a matrix completion loss to handle missing data and a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the solution is particularly well-suited to the problem of neural connectivity mapping. The low-rank factorization is a practical addition, enabling scalability to large datasets while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The results, including a 69% reduction in voxel-scale prediction error compared to regional models, highlight the significance of this work. The supplementary materials, including code and visualization resources, further enhance reproducibility and accessibility.\nWeaknesses: \nWhile the paper is strong overall, there are a few areas for improvement. First, the probabilistic perspective is underexplored; incorporating latent variable priors or addressing the limitations of the Gaussian noise model could further enhance the model's robustness. Second, the spherical covariance assumption, while computationally advantageous, may limit the realism of the results and warrants a more detailed discussion. Finally, the readability of Figure 3 labels is suboptimal and should be improved for clarity.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance: \nPros: \n- The paper introduces a novel and well-implemented combination of techniques tailored to a challenging scientific problem. \n- The results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with clear implications for advancing mesoscale connectomics. \n- The methodology is rigorously validated and supported by comprehensive supplementary materials. \nCons: \n- The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of probabilistic extensions and the implications of its modeling assumptions. \n- Minor presentation issues, such as Figure 3 labels, detract slightly from the overall clarity. \nConclusion: \nThis paper represents a strong contribution to the field of neural connectivity mapping and aligns well with the scope of the conference. It is technically robust, innovative, and impactful, with potential for future extensions. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses."
