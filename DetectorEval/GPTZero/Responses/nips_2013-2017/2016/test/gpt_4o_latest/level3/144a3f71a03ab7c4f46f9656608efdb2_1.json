            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to constrained optimization for learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints, leveraging a branch-and-bound search method on CPDAGs and employing an A* algorithm guided by heuristics from the URLearning system. The authors address the challenge of integrating non-decomposable ancestral constraints into structure learning, which is traditionally limited by decomposable scoring functions. By projecting these constraints into decomposable edge and ordering constraints, the method empowers the oracle used in the search process, significantly improving efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the ILP-based GOBNILP system by orders of magnitude, although the comparison is limited due to GOBNILP's poor handling of ancestral constraints.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Innovation: The paper introduces a sound and complete pruning method for the EC tree based on ancestral constraints and proposes a novel way to infer decomposable constraints from non-decomposable ones. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning.\n2. Efficiency Gains: The empirical results convincingly show that the proposed approach is significantly faster than existing methods, particularly for larger networks and datasets.\n3. Scalability: The system demonstrates scalability to problems with up to 20 variables, which is comparable to state-of-the-art methods for Bayesian network learning.\n4. Practical Impact: The ability to incorporate background knowledge in the form of ancestral constraints has practical implications, as it can reduce the need for large datasets while improving model accuracy.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity of Lemma 3: While Lemma 3 is central to the pruning strategy, its proof is not adequately explained, leaving a gap in the theoretical rigor.\n2. Limited Explanation of Projected Constraints: The process of inferring projected constraints and their role in empowering the oracle is underexplained, which may hinder reproducibility.\n3. Comparison with Related Work: The paper does not compare its method to van Beek and Hoffmann's approach, which could potentially be adapted for ancestral constraints. This omission weakens the evaluation of the proposed method's novelty and effectiveness.\n4. Suboptimal MAXSAT Formulation: The use of a MAXSAT formulation for encoding ancestral constraints is criticized as less efficient than an ILP-based approach. A tighter ILP formulation, as suggested, could further improve performance.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a challenging and relevant problem in Bayesian network learning, contributing novel methods for handling ancestral constraints.\n- The proposed approach demonstrates significant empirical improvements over existing methods, with potential for practical applications in data-limited scenarios.\n- The use of the EC tree and the integration of projected constraints represent innovative advancements in the field.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of clarity in key theoretical aspects (e.g., Lemma 3) and insufficient explanation of projected constraints may limit the paper's reproducibility.\n- The omission of a comparison with van Beek and Hoffmann's approach leaves a gap in the evaluation of related work.\n- The reliance on a MAXSAT formulation, despite its limitations, suggests room for further optimization.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, the paper makes a strong technical contribution to the field of Bayesian network learning and demonstrates substantial empirical improvements. However, the authors should address the theoretical gaps, clarify the inference of projected constraints, and provide a more comprehensive comparison with related work. With these improvements, the paper would be a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
