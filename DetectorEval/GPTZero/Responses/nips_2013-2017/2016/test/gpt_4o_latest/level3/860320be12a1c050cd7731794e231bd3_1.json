            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel and rigorous framework for analyzing the architectural complexity of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), introducing three key measures: recurrent depth, feedforward depth, and recurrent skip coefficient. These measures aim to quantify the complexity of RNN architectures in terms of their over-time nonlinearity, local input-output nonlinearity, and ability to propagate information across time steps, respectively. The authors provide a mathematically well-defined formulation for these measures, grounded in graph theory, and demonstrate their computability as limits when the number of time steps approaches infinity. Empirical results across various tasks, such as language modeling, sequential MNIST, and long-term dependency problems, suggest that these measures correlate with improved performance, offering insights into RNN design principles.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Rigor: The proposed measures are mathematically well-defined and grounded in a formal graph-theoretic framework. This provides a solid foundation for analyzing RNN architectures, distinguishing this work from prior empirical or heuristic approaches.\n2. Empirical Validation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across diverse tasks, demonstrating that increasing recurrent depth and feedforward depth can improve performance, while recurrent skip coefficients are particularly effective for long-term dependency tasks.\n3. Novel Contributions: The introduction of recurrent skip coefficient as a measure of long-term dependency handling is particularly insightful. It provides a principled way to evaluate the impact of skip connections beyond their mere presence.\n4. Practical Implications: The findings offer actionable guidance for designing RNN architectures, such as balancing depth and skip coefficients to optimize performance for specific tasks.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lack of Formal Guarantees: While the measures are intuitively sensible and empirically validated, the paper does not provide formal guarantees linking these measures to performance improvements. This limits their theoretical generalizability.\n2. Comparative Context: The importance of the proposed measures relative to other complexity measures (e.g., parameter count, spectral properties) remains unclear. A more thorough comparison with existing metrics would strengthen the paper.\n3. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is rigorous, the heavy reliance on mathematical formalism may make it less accessible to practitioners. Key insights could be summarized more intuitively to broaden its impact.\n4. Appendix Reliance: A significant portion of technical details is relegated to the appendix, which, while common, makes it harder to assess the completeness of the work within the main text.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically grounded framework for analyzing RNN complexity, addressing a gap in the literature.\n- Empirical results are robust and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed measures.\n- The work provides actionable insights for RNN architecture design, making it relevant to both researchers and practitioners.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of formal guarantees limits the theoretical contributions of the proposed measures.\n- The comparative significance of these measures relative to existing complexity metrics is not fully explored.\n- The paper's clarity could be improved to make it more accessible to a broader audience.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the understanding of RNN architectures and their complexity. While there are some limitations, the combination of theoretical rigor and empirical validation makes it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and provide a more comprehensive comparison with existing complexity measures."
