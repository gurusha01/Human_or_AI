            "inputText": "This paper addresses the problem of classification from positive-unlabeled (PU) data, proposing two novel algorithms that are robust to noise in positive labels and effective for high-dimensional data. The authors build on prior theoretical contributions in PU learning, which often fail in practical, noisy, high-dimensional settings. The key contributions are the development of two classification algorithms that explicitly model label noise and leverage univariate transforms based on discriminative classifiers. The authors prove that these transforms preserve the class prior, enabling estimation in the univariate space and circumventing the challenges of kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings. The paper claims to provide both theoretical advancements and practical algorithms that improve the robustness and applicability of PU learning.\nStrengths:\n1. Relevance and Novelty: The paper addresses a critical gap in PU learning by focusing on practical applicability in noisy, high-dimensional data scenarios. The explicit modeling of noise and the use of univariate transforms represent a novel and meaningful contribution.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The proof that univariate transforms preserve the class prior is a significant theoretical result, providing a strong foundation for the proposed methods.\n3. Practical Impact: The proposed algorithms have the potential to advance the state of the art in PU learning, making them more accessible for real-world applications where noise and high dimensionality are common challenges.\n4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper is well-organized, with a clear delineation of its contributions, including both parametric and nonparametric methods.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Experimental Validation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks sufficient experimental results to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The abstract mentions robustness to noise and applicability to high-dimensional data, but no quantitative evidence is provided to support these claims.\n2. Comparison with Prior Work: The paper does not adequately compare its methods to existing PU learning algorithms on benchmark datasets. This limits the ability to assess the significance of the proposed approach relative to prior work.\n3. Reproducibility: The paper does not provide sufficient implementation details or code, which may hinder reproducibility for practitioners and researchers.\n4. Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss limitations, such as potential computational overhead introduced by the univariate transforms or scenarios where the proposed methods might underperform.\nRecommendations:\nTo strengthen the paper, I recommend adding comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons with state-of-the-art PU learning methods on real-world datasets. The authors should also provide implementation details or supplementary materials to enhance reproducibility. A discussion of limitations and potential future work would further improve the paper's completeness.\nPro/Con Summary:\n- Pros: Novel and theoretically sound approach; addresses a practical gap in PU learning; potential for significant real-world impact.\n- Cons: Insufficient experimental validation; limited comparison with prior work; lack of reproducibility details.\nConclusion:\nThis paper presents a promising contribution to PU learning with strong theoretical underpinnings. However, the lack of experimental validation and practical details limits its immediate impact. I encourage the authors to address these shortcomings in a revision."
