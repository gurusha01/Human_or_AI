            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel framework for designing parameter-free algorithms for Online Linear Optimization (OLO) over Hilbert spaces and Learning with Expert Advice (LEA) by leveraging reductions to coin betting. The authors instantiate this framework using a betting algorithm based on the Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator, resulting in algorithms with optimal regret guarantees and efficient per-round complexity. The paper claims to unify and provide intuition for existing parameter-free algorithms while also proposing new constructions that improve or match prior results.\nStrengths\n1. Novel Framework: The reduction of OLO and LEA to coin betting is an elegant and intuitive contribution. This perspective provides a unified explanation for existing parameter-free algorithms and enables the design of new ones.\n2. Theoretical Guarantees: The proposed algorithms achieve optimal worst-case regret bounds for both OLO and LEA. The regret bounds are rigorously derived and align with the state-of-the-art.\n3. Simplicity: The resulting algorithms are simple and parameter-free, eliminating the need for tuning learning rates, which is a significant practical advantage.\n4. Connections to Prior Work: The paper effectively situates its contributions within the broader literature, referencing key works and demonstrating how the proposed framework subsumes or improves upon them.\n5. Empirical Validation: The experiments, though limited, demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, showing performance close to or better than oracle-tuned baselines.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Empirical Evaluation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the empirical evaluation is relatively narrow. The experiments focus on a small set of datasets and do not explore diverse real-world scenarios or large-scale problems.\n2. Practical Applicability: Although the algorithms are parameter-free, the requirement to know the number of rounds (T) in advance for LEA is a limitation. While the doubling trick addresses this, it introduces additional complexity.\n3. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the underlying mathematical tools (e.g., Fenchel conjugates, KL divergence). Some sections, such as the derivation of the KT potential, could benefit from clearer explanations or illustrative examples.\n4. Data-Dependent Bounds: The paper acknowledges that its regret bounds are not data-dependent, which limits their adaptivity to specific problem instances. This is an area where further improvements could be made.\nRecommendation\nThe paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing a novel and intuitive framework for parameter-free online learning algorithms. Its results are well-supported by rigorous analysis and connections to prior work. However, the limited empirical evaluation and dense presentation slightly detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors expand the empirical evaluation and improve the clarity of the manuscript in a future revision.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper provides a unified framework that advances the understanding of parameter-free algorithms.\n- It achieves optimal regret bounds, matching or improving upon prior work.\n- The simplicity of the proposed algorithms makes them appealing for practical use.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The empirical evaluation is limited in scope.\n- The presentation could be clearer, especially for non-expert readers.\nOverall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and merits inclusion in the conference."
