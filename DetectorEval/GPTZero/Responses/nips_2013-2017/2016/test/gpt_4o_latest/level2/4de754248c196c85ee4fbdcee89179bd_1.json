            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel, scalable approach for energy disaggregation using additive factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The authors propose a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation combined with randomized rounding and a scalable ADMM solver, which addresses the computational challenges of inference in FHMMs. The paper claims significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with a clear derivation of the SDP relaxation and randomized rounding approach. The use of ADMM to handle the large-scale nature of the problem is well-motivated and effectively exploits the problem's structure.\n2. Novelty: The proposed method is a significant innovation over prior work, particularly in its use of SDP relaxations and ADMM for FHMM inference. The combination of these techniques is novel and well-suited to the energy disaggregation task.\n3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide comprehensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches (Kolter and Jaakkola, 2012; Zhong et al., 2014) in terms of normalized disaggregation error, precision, and recall.\n4. Practical Relevance: Energy disaggregation is a critical problem for energy efficiency and safety. The proposed method has practical implications for real-world applications, as evidenced by its performance on the REDD dataset.\n5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with detailed explanations of the methodology and experimental setup. The inclusion of algorithms and mathematical formulations enhances reproducibility.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Computational Efficiency: While the proposed method achieves better accuracy, it is computationally expensive, with a runtime of 5 hours for real-world experiments compared to 5 minutes for competing methods. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide a clear roadmap for optimization.\n2. Generality: The method is tailored to energy disaggregation and may require significant adaptation for other FHMM applications. While the authors suggest broader applicability, this is not demonstrated experimentally.\n3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations, such as sensitivity to parameter choices (e.g., regularization constants) or robustness to noise in real-world data.\n4. Comparison to Broader Literature: While the paper references key prior work, it could benefit from a more extensive comparison to other recent methods in energy disaggregation beyond the selected baselines.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of energy disaggregation and FHMM inference. However, the authors should address the computational efficiency issue and provide more discussion on the method's generalizability and limitations in the final version.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- Significant improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.\n- Novel and technically sound methodology.\n- Practical relevance to energy efficiency and safety.\nCons:\n- High computational cost compared to competing methods.\n- Limited experimental validation of generalizability to other domains.\nIn summary, the paper is a strong contribution to the field, with clear potential for future impact."
