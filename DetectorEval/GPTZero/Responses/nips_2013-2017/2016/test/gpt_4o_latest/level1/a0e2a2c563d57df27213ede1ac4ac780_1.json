            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThis paper presents a novel extension to the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model by incorporating a biologically plausible mechanism, Inhibition of Return (IoR), to impose diversity on selected regions. The authors propose the Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier, which builds on the sparse region selection of RRSVM by enforcing non-maxima suppression to reduce overlap among selected regions. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SDR in predicting human gaze fixations during visual search tasks across three datasets (POET, PET, and MIT900) and under various conditions (single-target, target-absent, and multiple-target). Notably, the model achieves state-of-the-art results in fixation prediction without requiring object location annotations, while maintaining classification performance. The work bridges behavioral and computer vision literatures, offering insights into attention mechanisms and their potential to improve computer vision techniques.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Originality: The integration of IoR into RRSVM is a novel contribution, as it introduces a biologically inspired mechanism to enhance diversity in region selection. This is a meaningful step toward aligning computational models with human visual attention processes.\n2. Significance: The results are compelling, as the SDR model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations while preserving classification accuracy. This dual capability is significant for advancing both fixation prediction and classification tasks.\n3. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with a clear mathematical formulation of the SDR model and thorough experimental validation across diverse datasets and conditions. The use of AUC metrics and comparisons with strong baselines (e.g., RCNN, CAM) further supports the claims.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with detailed explanations of the methods, datasets, and experimental setup. The inclusion of qualitative examples (e.g., visualizations of priority maps) aids in understanding the model's behavior.\n5. Broader Impact: The work has implications for both computer vision and cognitive science, as it provides a computational perspective on visual attention mechanisms and suggests potential improvements for object detection systems.\nWeaknesses\n1. Center Bias: While the authors address the potential influence of center bias, the reliance on datasets like POET, which exhibit strong center bias, raises concerns about the generalizability of the results. Future work should explore datasets with more diverse object placements.\n2. Limited Scope of IoR: The IoR mechanism is implemented via non-maxima suppression, which, while effective, may oversimplify the underlying biological process. Exploring more nuanced implementations could further enhance the model's predictive power.\n3. Comparison with Saliency Models: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with traditional saliency-based fixation prediction models, as these are a key benchmark in the field.\n4. Failure Analysis: While some failure cases are discussed, a more systematic analysis of the model's limitations (e.g., distractors like text or faces) would provide deeper insights into areas for improvement.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper introduces a novel and biologically inspired extension to an existing model, achieving state-of-the-art results in fixation prediction.\n- The work is technically sound, well-executed, and clearly presented, with significant implications for both computer vision and cognitive science.\n- The proposed SDR model is versatile, maintaining classification performance while improving fixation prediction.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The reliance on center-biased datasets may limit the generalizability of the results.\n- The IoR mechanism, while effective, could be further refined to better mimic biological processes.\n- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with traditional saliency-based models and a more comprehensive failure analysis.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions to attention modeling and fixation prediction are significant, and the proposed SDR model represents a meaningful advancement in the field. However, addressing the noted weaknesses in future work would further strengthen its impact."
