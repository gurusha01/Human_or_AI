            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to designing optimization algorithms by casting the design process as a learning problem. The authors demonstrate that learned neural optimizers can outperform state-of-the-art optimization methods used in deep learning, and exhibit a remarkable degree of transfer to new tasks and datasets. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed.\nThe main idea of the paper is to replace hand-designed update rules with a learned update rule, which is implemented using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN takes the gradient of the objective function as input and outputs an update step. The authors show that this approach can be used to learn optimizers that are specialized to particular classes of functions, and that these learned optimizers can generalize well to new tasks and datasets.\nThe paper has several strengths. First, the idea of learning optimization algorithms is novel and interesting, and the authors provide a clear and well-motivated explanation of their approach. Second, the experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are impressive. The authors demonstrate that their learned optimizers can outperform state-of-the-art optimization methods on a range of tasks, including training neural networks and styling images with neural art. Third, the paper provides a good discussion of the related work, and the authors clearly explain how their approach differs from previous work in the area.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. One potential weakness is that the learned optimizers may not be as interpretable as hand-designed optimizers, which could make it more difficult to understand why they are working well. Another potential weakness is that the approach may not be as efficient as hand-designed optimizers, since it requires training a neural network to learn the update rule.\nOverall, I would argue that the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and that it meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The idea of learning optimization algorithms is novel and interesting, and the authors provide a clear and well-motivated explanation of their approach.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and interesting approach to designing optimization algorithms.\n* The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are impressive.\n* The paper provides a good discussion of the related work, and the authors clearly explain how their approach differs from previous work in the area.\n* The approach has the potential to lead to significant improvements in the field of optimization.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The learned optimizers may not be as interpretable as hand-designed optimizers.\n* The approach may not be as efficient as hand-designed optimizers, since it requires training a neural network to learn the update rule.\n* The paper could benefit from more analysis of the learned optimizers, to understand why they are working well.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, since it makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. However, I would also suggest that the authors provide more analysis of the learned optimizers, to understand why they are working well, and to address the potential weaknesses of the approach."
