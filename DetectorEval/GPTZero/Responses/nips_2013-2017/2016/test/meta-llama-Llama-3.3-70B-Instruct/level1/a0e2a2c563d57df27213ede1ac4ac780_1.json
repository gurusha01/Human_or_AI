The authors extend the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model to include Inhibition of Return, which imposes diversity on the selected regions, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations on three different visual search tasks.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work in the field. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The results show that the proposed Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including those that use object detectors and annotated bounding boxes.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel and biologically plausible approach to predicting human visual attention\n* The demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on three different visual search tasks\n* The thorough and well-designed experiments\n* The clear and concise writing style\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The potential for center bias in the POET dataset, which may affect the results\n* The lack of comparison to other methods that incorporate center bias and other factors affecting search\n* The limited analysis of the failure modes of the SDR classifier\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of computer vision and visual attention\n* The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on three different visual search tasks\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The potential for center bias in the POET dataset may affect the results\n* The lack of comparison to other methods that incorporate center bias and other factors affecting search\n* The limited analysis of the failure modes of the SDR classifier\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. However, I would like to see the authors address the potential center bias issue and provide more analysis of the failure modes of the SDR classifier in future work. \nQuality: 9/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to predicting human visual attention, but it builds on existing work in the field.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three different visual search tasks and has the potential to impact the field of computer vision and visual attention."
