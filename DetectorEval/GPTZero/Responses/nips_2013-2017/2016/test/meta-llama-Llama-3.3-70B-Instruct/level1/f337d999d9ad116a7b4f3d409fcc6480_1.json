            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to infer spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity maps of the brain from viral tracing experiments. The authors address the challenges of incomplete coverage, underdetermined problems, and missing data within injection sites by combining a matrix completion loss, a smoothing spline penalty, and optionally, a low rank factorization. The method is demonstrated on synthetic data and applied to the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, the methodology, and the results. The use of a smoothing penalty to regularize the problem is a key innovation, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving cross-validation performance. The low rank version of the algorithm is also a significant contribution, as it enables the compression of the connectivity map, making it potentially applicable to whole-brain connectivity inference.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and well-motivated problem statement\n* A novel and effective methodology that addresses the challenges of the problem\n* Strong experimental results on both synthetic and real data\n* A well-written and easy-to-follow presentation\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption of spatial smoothness of mesoscale connectivity may not always hold, and the authors could provide more justification for this assumption\n* The choice of the regularization parameter 位 is not fully explained, and the authors could provide more details on how it was selected\n* The low rank version of the algorithm is not convex, and the authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations of this approach\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective methodology for inferring spatially explicit connectivity maps from viral tracing experiments\n* The results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach\n* The low rank version of the algorithm has the potential to enable whole-brain connectivity inference\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption of spatial smoothness of mesoscale connectivity may not always hold\n* The choice of the regularization parameter 位 is not fully explained\n* The low rank version of the algorithm is not convex, and the authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations of this approach\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. The authors have presented a novel and effective methodology for inferring spatially explicit connectivity maps from viral tracing experiments, and the results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. While there are some weaknesses to the paper, they do not outweigh the strengths, and I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field."
