            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in home appliance monitoring, by developing a scalable and computationally efficient method based on factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The authors propose a semidefinite relaxation combined with randomized rounding to solve the resulting integer quadratic programming problem, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow, with a good balance between mathematical derivations and intuitive explanations. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A novel and efficient approach to energy disaggregation based on FHMMs\n* A thorough analysis of the problem and related work\n* Well-structured and easy-to-follow technical sections\n* Strong experimental results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The method requires a significant amount of computational resources, which may limit its applicability in real-time applications\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their method\n* Some of the notations and abbreviations used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts in the field\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method shows significant promise in solving the energy disaggregation problem. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and related work, and their approach is novel and efficient.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and efficient approach to energy disaggregation\n* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches\n* The paper is well-written, and the technical sections are easy to follow\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The method requires significant computational resources, which may limit its applicability in real-time applications\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their method\n* Some of the notations and abbreviations used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts in the field\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
