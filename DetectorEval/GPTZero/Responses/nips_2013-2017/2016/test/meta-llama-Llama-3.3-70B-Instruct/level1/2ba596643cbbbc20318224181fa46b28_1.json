            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel framework for studying exploration-exploitation trade-offs in the stochastic K-armed bandit setting, where cheaper approximations to the desired experiment are available. The authors introduce the concept of multi-fidelity bandits, where each arm has multiple fidelities, each providing a biased estimate of the highest fidelity. They develop a new algorithm, MF-UCB, which adapts the classical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy to this multi-fidelity setting.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough. The authors provide a regret bound for MF-UCB, which shows that it outperforms naive UCB strategies that ignore the multi-fidelity information. They also provide a lower bound, which demonstrates that MF-UCB is nearly optimal.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a new and interesting problem setting, which has many potential applications in areas such as online advertising, finance, and robotics.\n* The development of a novel algorithm, MF-UCB, which adapts the classical UCB strategy to the multi-fidelity setting.\n* The provision of a regret bound and a lower bound, which demonstrate the effectiveness of MF-UCB and its near-optimality.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption that the biases introduced by the lower fidelities are bounded by known quantities, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The lack of experimental evaluation on real-world problems, which would help to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of MF-UCB.\n* The fact that the lower bound is not tight for all arms, which leaves room for further improvement.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of bandit algorithms and has many potential applications. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above in future work.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a new and interesting problem setting, which has many potential applications.\n* The authors develop a novel algorithm, MF-UCB, which adapts the classical UCB strategy to the multi-fidelity setting.\n* The paper provides a regret bound and a lower bound, which demonstrate the effectiveness of MF-UCB and its near-optimality.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The assumption that the biases introduced by the lower fidelities are bounded by known quantities may not always be the case in practice.\n* The lack of experimental evaluation on real-world problems may limit the practical impact of the paper.\n* The fact that the lower bound is not tight for all arms may leave room for further improvement."
