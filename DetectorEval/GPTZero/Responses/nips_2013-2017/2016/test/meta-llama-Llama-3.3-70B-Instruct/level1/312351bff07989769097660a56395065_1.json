            "inputText": "This paper introduces the Neural Transducer, a novel sequence-to-sequence model that can produce output sequences incrementally as input data arrives. The model is designed to address the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models, which require the entire input sequence to be available before generating output. The Neural Transducer achieves this by conditioning the output sequence on the partially observed input sequence and the partially generated output sequence.\nThe paper relates to previous work on sequence-to-sequence models, including the work of Bahdanau et al. [2] and Chorowski et al. [6]. However, the Neural Transducer differs from these models in its ability to produce output sequences incrementally, without requiring the entire input sequence to be available. The model is also related to traditional structured prediction methods, such as HMM-DNN [11] and CTC [7], but it does not assume conditional independence between predictions at each output step.\nThe strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its thorough evaluation of the Neural Transducer on several tasks, including a toy task of addition and a phone recognition task on the TIMIT dataset. The results show that the Neural Transducer can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models, while also providing the ability to produce output sequences incrementally.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the model, which may make it difficult to train and optimize. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the model's performance on longer sequences, as well as a comparison with other models that can handle incremental output generation.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel and interesting model that addresses a significant limitation of traditional sequence-to-sequence models.\n* The model is thoroughly evaluated on several tasks, including a toy task and a real-world phone recognition task.\n* The results show that the Neural Transducer can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The model is complex and may be difficult to train and optimize.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the model's performance on longer sequences.\n* The comparison with other models that can handle incremental output generation is limited.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence-to-sequence modeling and should be accepted. However, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the model's performance on longer sequences and compare it with other models that can handle incremental output generation. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written and clearly presents the Neural Transducer model. The evaluation is thorough, but could benefit from more analysis on longer sequences.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The notation is clear, and the figures are helpful in understanding the model.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe Neural Transducer model is novel and interesting, but it builds on previous work on sequence-to-sequence models.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence-to-sequence modeling, and the results have the potential to impact several applications, including speech recognition and online translation systems."
