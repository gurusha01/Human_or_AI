The main claim of the paper is that the proposed algorithm can accurately reconstruct the connectivity map of the mouse visual system, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches. The authors support this claim through a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the problem, their approach, and the results. The use of a matrix completion loss, a smoothing penalty, and low rank factorization is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the mathematical formulation of the problem.\nThe results are impressive, with the proposed algorithm achieving a significant reduction in cross-validated error compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of the low rank version of the algorithm, which achieves a roughly 23Ã— compression of the original data while maintaining a high level of accuracy.\nThe paper reflects a good understanding of the field, with the authors citing relevant literature and providing a clear overview of the current state of the art. The use of a nonnegative least squares approach and the incorporation of a smoothing penalty are well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the mathematical formulation of the problem.\nOne potential limitation of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm, which could be an important consideration for large-scale applications. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed algorithm, such as its use in understanding neurological disorders or developing new treatments.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the results are impressive. The proposed algorithm has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the approach and the results.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to inferring spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity maps of the brain.\n* The results are impressive, with the proposed algorithm achieving a significant reduction in cross-validated error compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.\n* The authors provide a thorough explanation of the mathematical formulation of the problem and the use of a nonnegative least squares approach and a smoothing penalty.\n* The paper reflects a good understanding of the field, with the authors citing relevant literature and providing a clear overview of the current state of the art.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed algorithm.\n* The paper could benefit from additional experiments or simulations to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
