The authors introduce a new interpretation of parameter-free algorithms as coin betting algorithms, which reveals a common hidden structure between previous parameter-free algorithms for OLO and LEA. The framework is based on reductions to betting on outcomes of adversarial coins, and it provides a natural way for the analysis and design of online learning algorithms.\nThe paper's main claims are that the proposed framework provides a unified and intuitive way to design parameter-free algorithms for OLO and LEA, and that the resulting algorithms achieve optimal worst-case regret bounds. The authors support these claims through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations.\nThe strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and completeness. The framework is well-motivated and easy to understand, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the resulting algorithms. The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.\nThe weaknesses of the paper are minor. Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and future directions of the framework.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of the framework and its analysis. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear summary of the main results and contributions.\nThe originality of the paper is high, as it presents a new and innovative framework for designing parameter-free algorithms. The significance of the paper is also high, as it provides a unified and intuitive way to design parameter-free algorithms for OLO and LEA, and it has the potential to impact the field of online learning.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of the framework and its analysis. The paper is easy to follow, and the authors provide a clear summary of the main results and contributions.\nIn terms of usefulness, the paper is highly relevant to the field of online learning, and it has the potential to impact the design of parameter-free algorithms for OLO and LEA. The framework is novel and innovative, and it provides a unified and intuitive way to design parameter-free algorithms.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a novel and innovative framework for designing parameter-free algorithms, and it provides a clear and concise presentation of the framework and its analysis. The paper is technically sound, and it has the potential to impact the field of online learning.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and innovative framework for designing parameter-free algorithms.\n* The framework is well-motivated and easy to understand.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the resulting algorithms.\n* The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.\n* The paper is technically sound, and it has the potential to impact the field of online learning.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and future directions of the framework."
