            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to designing optimization algorithms by casting the design process as a learning problem. The authors propose using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn an update rule that can be used to optimize a given objective function. The learned optimizer is shown to outperform state-of-the-art optimization methods on a variety of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.\nThe paper's main claim is that the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. The authors support this claim through a series of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of their learned optimizer on different tasks.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details of their approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the novelty of their approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors' approach is novel and has the potential to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in optimization.\n* The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned optimizer on a variety of tasks.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of their approach, which could be a limitation in practice.\n* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how the learned optimizer generalizes to new tasks, which could be an important area of future research.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization and has the potential to have a significant impact on the development of new optimization algorithms.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to designing optimization algorithms that has the potential to significantly improve the state-of-the-art.\n* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned optimizer on a variety of tasks.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of their approach.\n* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how the learned optimizer generalizes to new tasks.\nRecommendation: Accept. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization and has the potential to have a significant impact on the development of new optimization algorithms. While there are some limitations to the paper, the authors' approach is novel and well-supported by the experiments. With some revisions to address the limitations, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field."
