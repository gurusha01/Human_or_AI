The authors propose an efficient optimization problem that learns a kernel by maximizing the alignment between the kernel matrix and the label matrix. The approach is based on the idea of using randomized features to approximate the kernel matrix, and then optimizing the distribution of these features to maximize the alignment.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution. The experimental results are impressive, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning a kernel that generalizes well to new data.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed approach is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.\n* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution, including consistency and generalization guarantees.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning a kernel that generalizes well to new data.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The approach requires a user-defined kernel as input, which may not always be available or easy to choose.\n* The optimization problem is solved using a bisection method, which may not be the most efficient approach for large-scale problems.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other kernel learning approaches, which would be useful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and efficient approach to learning a kernel in a supervised manner using random features. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning a kernel that generalizes well to new data.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and efficient approach to learning a kernel in a supervised manner using random features.\n* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution, including consistency and generalization guarantees.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning a kernel that generalizes well to new data.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The approach requires a user-defined kernel as input, which may not always be available or easy to choose.\n* The optimization problem is solved using a bisection method, which may not be the most efficient approach for large-scale problems.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other kernel learning approaches, which would be useful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including providing a more detailed comparison with other kernel learning approaches and exploring more efficient optimization methods. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a wider range of datasets."
