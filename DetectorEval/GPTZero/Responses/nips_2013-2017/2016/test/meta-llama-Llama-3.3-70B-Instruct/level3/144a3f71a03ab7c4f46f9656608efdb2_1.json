            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints. The authors propose a search space for structure learning with non-decomposable scores, called the EC tree, and employ an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores. The key contribution of this paper is the development of a sound and complete method for pruning the EC tree based on ancestral constraints, as well as a technique for empowering the oracle by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from the non-decomposable ancestral constraints.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the approach. The authors provide a thorough review of the related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments. The results show that the proposed approach is orders-of-magnitude more efficient compared to learning systems based on integer linear programming (ILP).\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n* The development of a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The thorough evaluation of the approach through extensive experiments, which demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency.\n* The clear and concise writing style, which makes the paper easy to follow and understand.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The comparison with GOBNILP is weakened by the use of a poor MAXSAT encoding of ancestral constraints, which could be improved using an ILP formulation.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach, as well as a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The authors suggest comparing the current method to the approach of van Beek and Hoffmann, which often outperforms GOBNILP and could be adapted to allow ancestral constraints. This comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning and demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. With some minor improvements and additional analysis, this paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance at NIPS.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning.\n* The approach is thoroughly evaluated through extensive experiments, which demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The comparison with GOBNILP is weakened by the use of a poor MAXSAT encoding of ancestral constraints.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach.\n* The authors suggest comparing the current method to the approach of van Beek and Hoffmann, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach."
