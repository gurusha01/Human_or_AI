The model, called Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR), is trained on image-level labels without object location annotations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations on three different visual search tasks.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the model and its components. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with SDR outperforming other methods in predicting human attention. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the center bias effect and its impact on the performance of the model.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between computer vision and behavioral studies of visual attention. The authors demonstrate that the core mechanisms driving high model performance in a search task also predict how humans allocate their attention in the same tasks. This has significant implications for our understanding of human visual processing and could lead to the development of more effective computer vision models.\nHowever, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the model, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters used. Additionally, the authors could explore the use of other attention mechanisms, such as bottom-up saliency or scene context, to further improve the performance of the model.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the model and its components, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field, demonstrating the potential of computer vision models to predict human attention and providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying visual attention.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to modeling visual attention that achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different visual search tasks.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the model and its components, making it easy to follow and understand.\n* The experiments are thorough and well-designed, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the model.\n* The paper makes a significant contribution to the field, demonstrating the potential of computer vision models to predict human attention and providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying visual attention.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more details on the implementation of the model, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters used.\n* The authors could explore the use of other attention mechanisms, such as bottom-up saliency or scene context, to further improve the performance of the model.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the center bias effect and its impact on the performance of the model."
