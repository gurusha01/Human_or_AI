            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel machine learning algorithm to infer spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity maps of the brain from viral tracing experiments. The algorithm combines a matrix completion loss, a smoothing spline penalty, and a low rank factorization to tackle the challenges of underdetermination, missing data, and large problem size. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on synthetic data and real-world datasets from the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, showcasing its ability to outperform current state-of-the-art approaches.\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the problem, methodology, and results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, as well as its potential applications and limitations. The use of real-world datasets and comparison to existing methods adds credibility to the results and demonstrates the practical significance of the work.\nThe algorithm itself is technically sound, with a clear and well-motivated formulation of the optimization problem. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the matrix completion loss, smoothing penalty, and low rank factorization, and demonstrate how these components work together to produce high-quality connectivity maps. The results on synthetic data and real-world datasets are impressive, with significant improvements in cross-validated predictions and unveiling of spatial patterning of connectivity.\nOne of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to balance technical rigor with practical relevance. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details, while also highlighting the potential applications and implications of their work. The use of visualizations and examples helps to illustrate the key concepts and results, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.\nIn terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques (matrix completion, smoothing penalty, and low rank factorization) to tackle a challenging problem in neuroscience. The authors demonstrate how these techniques can be adapted and combined to produce high-quality connectivity maps, and provide a clear explanation of the underlying methodology.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance our understanding of brain connectivity and function. The ability to infer spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity maps from viral tracing experiments could have major implications for neuroscience research, from understanding the neural basis of behavior and cognition to developing new treatments for neurological disorders.\nOverall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a technically sound, well-motivated, and practically significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and machine learning. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides a clear and concise explanation of the key concepts and results.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and technically sound algorithm for inferring spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity maps from viral tracing experiments.\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on synthetic data and real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to outperform current state-of-the-art approaches.\n* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the problem, methodology, and results.\n* The authors provide a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, as well as its potential applications and limitations.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper may be considered somewhat specialized, as it focuses on a specific problem in neuroscience and may not be directly applicable to other fields.\n* The authors could provide more detailed comparisons to existing methods, to further demonstrate the advantages of their approach.\n* The paper could benefit from additional visualizations and examples, to help illustrate the key concepts and results."
