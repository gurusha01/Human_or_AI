            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints. The authors introduce a search space called the EC tree, which is designed to handle non-decomposable scores, and employ an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores. The key contribution of the paper is the development of a sound and complete method for pruning the EC tree based on ancestral constraints, as well as a technique for empowering the oracle by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from the non-decomposable ancestral constraints.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach. The technical preliminaries section provides a thorough overview of the background material, and the notation is consistent throughout the paper. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of efficiency and accuracy.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints, which addresses a significant challenge in the field.\n* The development of a sound and complete method for pruning the EC tree based on ancestral constraints, which is a key contribution of the paper.\n* The technique for empowering the oracle by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from the non-decomposable ancestral constraints, which leads to significant improvements in efficiency.\n* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of formal guarantees for the proposed approach, which relies on empirical evaluations.\n* The complexity of the EC tree and the oracle, which may limit the scalability of the approach.\n* The reliance on the quality of the inferred decomposable constraints, which may affect the performance of the approach.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely adopted. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the approach and to provide formal guarantees for its performance.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints.\n* The experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.\n* The technique for empowering the oracle is a key contribution of the paper, and has significant implications for the field.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The lack of formal guarantees for the proposed approach may limit its adoption.\n* The complexity of the EC tree and the oracle may limit the scalability of the approach.\n* The reliance on the quality of the inferred decomposable constraints may affect the performance of the approach.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the limitations of the approach and provide additional experiments to demonstrate its scalability and robustness."
