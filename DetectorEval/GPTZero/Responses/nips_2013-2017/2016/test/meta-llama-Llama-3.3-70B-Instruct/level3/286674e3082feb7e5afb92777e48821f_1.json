            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel framework for graph clustering that provides distribution-free results, addressing a significant problem in the field. The main idea is that if a graph clustering method discovers a clustering that fits the graph reasonably well, then any other clustering that fits as well should be close to the first one. This concept is interesting and well-commented, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach.\nThe paper's strengths include its ability to provide \"correctness\" guarantees without assuming the data comes from a specific model. The authors also show that their framework ties in with existing model-based frameworks, allowing them to exploit results from model-based recovery and strengthen existing results. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various datasets.\nHowever, the results have some limitations. The framework relies on a \"proxy\" model, which reconstructs a model from a clustering and compares it to the original graph. This approach constrains the notion of a good clustering and may have limitations, especially on real-world examples. Additionally, the use of a non-standard distance measure between clusterings may be questionable.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.\nThe originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, providing a new perspective on graph clustering. The authors adequately reference related work and demonstrate how their approach differs from previous contributions. The significance of the paper is evident, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel framework for graph clustering that provides distribution-free results.\n* The authors provide a clear explanation of their approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on various datasets.\n* The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The framework relies on a \"proxy\" model, which may have limitations, especially on real-world examples.\n* The use of a non-standard distance measure between clusterings may be questionable.\n* The results may not be informative for certain models, such as the SBM, where the bounds are not tight.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of graph clustering and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way. However, the authors should address the limitations of their approach and provide tighter bounds for certain models to strengthen their results."
