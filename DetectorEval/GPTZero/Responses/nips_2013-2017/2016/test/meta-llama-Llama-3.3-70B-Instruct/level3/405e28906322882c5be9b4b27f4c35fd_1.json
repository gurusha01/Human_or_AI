The connection to tracking and shifting bounds is not well-explained, and the authors could have related their switching results to the large body of work done in information theory on coding piecewise stationary sources.\nDespite these criticisms, the paper shows potential, and with substantial improvements, it could be a valuable contribution to the field. The authors have provided a thorough analysis of the regret bounds, and their algorithms seem to be well-designed. However, the paper requires significant revisions to address the issues mentioned above.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the regret bounds in non-stationary stochastic environments.\n* The authors have designed algorithms with upper bound guarantees and proved matching lower bounds.\n* The consideration of the variance of random losses is a novel contribution to the field.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper lacks clarity and coherence, with missing references and unclear motivation for the complexity measures used.\n* The connection to related work is not well-explained, and the authors could have done a better job of citing and discussing previous contributions.\n* The writing of the paper needs to be improved dramatically to make it accessible to a wider audience.\nOverall, I would recommend revising and resubmitting the paper to address the issues mentioned above. With significant improvements, this paper could be a valuable contribution to the field of online learning and decision-making."
