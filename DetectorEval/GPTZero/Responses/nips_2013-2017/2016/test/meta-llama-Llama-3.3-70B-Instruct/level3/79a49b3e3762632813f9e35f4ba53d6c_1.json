I also found Figure 1 to be unclear in its relationship to the probabilistic model, and more explanation is needed. Additionally, I noticed a potential connection between equation (12) and a result from Ward et al. (2009), which could be explored further.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, I evaluate the paper based on the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. However, the originality of the work is questionable, and more discussion is needed to distinguish it from previous contributions. The paper is clearly written, but some improvements can be made to enhance clarity. The significance of the results is important, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, but more comparison to other methods is needed to demonstrate its advancement of the state of the art.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a practical classification algorithm that is robust to noise in the positive labels and effective for high-dimensional data.\n* The technical analysis of identifiability issues is thorough, and the proposed algorithms show good performance compared to existing methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The novelty of the work is questionable, as it closely follows previous research with some natural extensions.\n* The paper lacks comparison to other methods for asymmetric label noise, and more discussion is needed to distinguish it from previous contributions.\n* Some minor improvements can be made to enhance clarity and provide more explanation for certain aspects of the paper."
