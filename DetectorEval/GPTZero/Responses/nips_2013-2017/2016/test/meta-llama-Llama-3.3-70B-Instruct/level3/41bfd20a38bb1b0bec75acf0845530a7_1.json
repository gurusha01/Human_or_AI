            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial problem in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), using factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The authors propose a scalable and computationally efficient method for inference in FHMMs, which is based on a semidefinite relaxation combined with randomized rounding. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors address a core problem in deep learning, which is making deep neural networks run more efficiently.\n* The experimental results seem promising, with the proposed method outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution, including a detailed explanation of the mathematical formulations and the algorithms used.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and limitations:\n* The novelty of the paper is limited by the fact that structured sparsity is a well-established idea, although its application to convolutional neural networks is still a valuable contribution.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.\n* The computational complexity of the proposed method is not thoroughly analyzed, which could be a limitation for large-scale applications.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The paper addresses a significant problem in deep learning, and the proposed solution has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and efficient approach to energy disaggregation using FHMMs.\n* The experimental results are promising, and the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The novelty of the paper is limited by the fact that structured sparsity is a well-established idea.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The computational complexity of the proposed method is not thoroughly analyzed.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning and energy disaggregation. However, the authors should address the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above to further improve the paper."
