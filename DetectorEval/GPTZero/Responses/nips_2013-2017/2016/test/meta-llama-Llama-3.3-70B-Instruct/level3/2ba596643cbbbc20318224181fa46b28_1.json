            "inputText": "This paper proposes a framework for clustering graphs without assuming the data comes from a specific model, providing \"correctness\" guarantees based on the statistics of the data. The authors introduce a generic theorem that states if a clustering fits the graph well with respect to a model, then any other clustering that also fits the graph well will be close to the original clustering. The paper instantiates this theorem for the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and Preference Frame Model (PFM), providing model-free guarantees for these models.\nThe paper's strengths include its novel approach to model-free clustering, which ties in with existing model-based frameworks, and its ability to exploit results from model-based recovery. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their framework, including a detailed description of the model estimation algorithms and the proof of the main theorems.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. The introduction of Assumption 1 appears artificial and opaque, and its necessity and potential impact on the algorithm's design and performance are not clearly explained. The paper's results are not always easy to interpret, particularly in comparing the bounds for different models. Additionally, the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, with more datasets and comparisons to other clustering algorithms.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear presentation of the theoretical analysis. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper's clarity is good, with a well-organized structure and sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.\nThe originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new framework for model-free clustering and provides novel guarantees for the SBM and PFM models. The paper's significance is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in clustering graphs.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering graphs and provides a novel framework for model-free clustering. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly in clarifying the introduction of Assumption 1 and providing more comprehensive experimental evaluations.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* Novel approach to model-free clustering\n* Ties in with existing model-based frameworks\n* Provides model-free guarantees for SBM and PFM models\n* Technically sound and well-organized presentation\n* High originality and significance\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Introduction of Assumption 1 appears artificial and opaque\n* Results not always easy to interpret\n* Experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive\n* Some assumptions and proofs could be more clearly explained"
