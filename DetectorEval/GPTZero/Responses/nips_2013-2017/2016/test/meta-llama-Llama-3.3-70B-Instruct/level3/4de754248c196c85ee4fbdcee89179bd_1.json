            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), using an additive factorial Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The authors propose a scalable and computationally efficient method to estimate the energy consumption of individual appliances in a household from the total energy consumption time series measurements. The key contributions of this paper include the development of a convex semidefinite relaxation, randomized rounding, and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the resulting optimization problem.\nThe paper is well-written, self-contained, and provides a clear explanation of the complex solution. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of normalized disaggregation error, precision, and recall.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. Novel approach: The authors propose a new approach to energy disaggregation using an additive factorial HMM, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Scalability: The proposed method is scalable and can handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications.\n3. Efficient optimization: The authors develop an efficient optimization algorithm using convex semidefinite relaxation, randomized rounding, and ADMM, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n1. Estimation of the number of appliances: The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to estimate the number of appliances, which is a crucial parameter in the model.\n2. Computational complexity: Although the proposed method is scalable, it still requires significant computational resources, which may be a limitation for real-time applications.\n3. Comparison to other methods: While the authors compare their method to other state-of-the-art algorithms, a more comprehensive comparison to other existing methods would be beneficial.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details. The proposed approach is novel and significant, and the experimental results demonstrate its efficacy.\nArguments for acceptance:\n1. Novel approach: The paper proposes a new approach to energy disaggregation, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Scalability: The proposed method is scalable and can handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications.\n3. Efficient optimization: The authors develop an efficient optimization algorithm, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.\nArguments against acceptance:\n1.
