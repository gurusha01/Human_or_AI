            "inputText": "This paper proposes the deep dynamic Poisson factorization model, which extends traditional Poisson factorization (PF) to accommodate temporal dependencies by utilizing a simplified recurrent neural network (RNN) structure. Unlike previous dynamic PF approaches, this model leverages the RNN to capture long-term dependencies. The inference process is conducted through variational inference, incorporating an additional step to optimize the neural network parameters. Experimental results are presented across five real-world datasets.\nWhile I find the concept intriguing, I believe the paper requires refinement in its presentation to meet the standards of a conference like NIPS. My detailed comments are outlined below.\n+The formulation presented in Equation 4 does not align with a traditional RNN structure because \\(h_t^{(n)}\\) is dependent solely on the top-layer memory vectors and does not account for previous time steps within the same layer, as is characteristic of RNN setups. Could the authors provide a rationale for this simplified structure?\n+Section 2 lacks completeness in its model equations. For instance, the parameterization of the Gamma distribution in Equation 4 and the distribution generating \\(\\theta_t\\) in Equation 3 are not clearly defined.\n+I disagree with the discussion regarding \"implicit distributions\" in lines 110-118. Equations 9 and 10 explicitly define Gamma distributions with specified shapes and rates. Given that the distribution of \\(\\theta_{tk}\\) (Equation 9) can be computed in closed form conditioned on \\(h^{(0)}\\), and similarly for \\(h\\) in Equation 10, these cannot be considered implicit distributions.\n+The sentence in lines 30-31, concerning the method's potential weaknesses in analyzing data with different long-time dependence patterns, such as fanatical or disaster data, is unclear. Could the authors elaborate on this point?\n+The subsection spanning lines 133-155 is not transparent, particularly regarding the definition of the \"loss function\" in Equation 15.\n+For models akin to Poisson factorization, metrics like MSE/PMSE are typically insufficient. The results should be supplemented with predictive log-likelihood values.\n+The chosen value of \\(K\\) in the experiments (line 207) appears too small. I suggest the authors consider larger values, such as \\(K=100\\), for more robust outcomes.\n+The discussion in lines 224-232 does not clearly relate to Figure 3, necessitating further clarification.\n+The update equations for the variational inference procedure (Equations 11-14) could be relocated to the supplementary materials without affecting the paper's clarity.\n+Figure 4's caption is difficult to read and could be improved for better understanding.\n+I strongly advise adhering to general writing guidelines, particularly concerning the use of the passive voice, which is especially pertinent for the abstract.\n+The overall writing quality is subpar, with numerous typos and grammatical errors. Examples include:\n -Line 15, \"high-dimensional\" is correctly used but in other contexts, precision is needed.\n -Line 22, the term \"factorize\" should be used correctly.\n -Line 24, the phrase \"property of the\" is incomplete.\n -Lines 29 and 34, \"Dirichlet\" is mentioned without clear context.\n -Line 34, \"nested\" could be more appropriately used.\n -Figure 1, \"visual representation\" and \"transmission\" require clearer definitions.\n -Incomplete sentences, such as line 49, and missing articles (e.g., \"Although the Dirichlet distribution is often used as a prior distribution\") detract from the paper's readability."
