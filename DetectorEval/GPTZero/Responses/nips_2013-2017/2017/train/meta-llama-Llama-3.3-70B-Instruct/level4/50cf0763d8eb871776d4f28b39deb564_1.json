            "inputText": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of the convergence rates of M estimators for differential parameter estimation, focusing on two primary model classes: generative and discriminative models. The generative approach involves estimating the parameters of two distinct sample sets and then computing their difference, whereas the discriminative method directly estimates the difference using Bayes' rule and logistic regression. The authors establish convergence rates by introducing the concept of local separability, which quantifies the extent to which a loss function exhibits separable behavior. The results encompass both low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings, with the latter incorporating l1-sparsity regularization. Based on the provided theory and simulations, it appears that the generative method generally outperforms the discriminative approach. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and the theoretical foundations seem sound. However, as a non-expert in this field, I am unable to assess the originality and implications of these findings. I do have several minor remarks:\n- Line 75: The notation should be corrected to $x_i^{(0)}$.\n- Line 94, equation (5): It would be more intuitive to use $\\mu$ instead of $\\theta$, as it represents the negative average log-likelihood up to constants. The same applies to equation (6).\n- Line 95, equation (6): The correct notation should be $\\text{trace}(\\Theta \\hat{\\Sigma})$, without a comma.\n- Lines 98-104: It seems that $\\theta2^$ should be replaced with $\\theta0^$.\n- Line 102, equation (8): The equation appears to be independent of $c^*$, which warrants further clarification.\n- Line 103: The notation $\\phi(t)$ should be consistent, either as $\\Phi(t)$ or in bold.\n- Line 158: A period is missing after the term \"Irrepresentability\".\n- Line 208, Lemma 3: The definitions of $d{\\Theta}^$ and $\\kappa{\\Sigma}^$ are not provided.\n- Line 250: A hyphen is missing between \"soft\" and \"Thresholding\".\n- Line 259: A period is missing before the phrase \"For any classifier\".\n- Line 289: A period is missing before the phrase \"In this setting\"."
