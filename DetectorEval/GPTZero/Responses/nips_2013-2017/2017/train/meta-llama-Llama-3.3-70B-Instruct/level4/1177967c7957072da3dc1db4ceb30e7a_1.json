This approach is theoretically proven to be optimal with respect to these bounds, outperforming uniform or fixed importance sampling, and can be computed with negligible additional cost. Although adaptive importance sampling has been explored previously, the authors introduce a novel convex optimization formulation for selecting the optimal sampling distribution and provide an efficient algorithm for its solution.\nThis manuscript is well-written and constitutes a valuable contribution to the field of importance sampling techniques.\nComments:\nThe proof of Lemma 2.1 appears to be missing a factor of 2 in the calculation of alpha^*. \nIn Example 3.1, equation (7) aims to maximize a value, suggesting that setting c to either the upper or lower bound might yield better results than uniform sampling, which seems to contradict the preceding statement that such a naive approach can be suboptimal.\nRegarding Algorithm 4, on line 4, given that m is defined as the maximum of l^{sort}, it is unclear whether this condition will ever be met. Furthermore, on line 7, it seems that u^{sort} should be used instead of c^{sort}.\nTo strengthen the numerical results, comparisons with other existing adaptive sampling schemes, such as those in references [2], [5], and [21], as well as fixed importance sampling with non-uniform distributions, would be beneficial. \nThe absence of timing results for SGD is notable and should be addressed.\nThe title of the paper referenced in [14] is incorrect and should be corrected.\nAdditionally, the reference list should include \"Importance Sampling for Minibatches\" by Csiba and Richtarik, available on arXiv in 2016.\n============\nPOST REBUTTAL\n============\nHaving reviewed the authors' rebuttal, I appreciate their thorough responses to my comments and questions. Based on this, I firmly believe that this paper deserves acceptance."
