            "inputText": "This paper explores the integration of long-range temporal dependence into a Poisson factorization model with a deep structure, differing from prior dynamic PF works by utilizing a recurrent neural network-like structure to model long-term dependencies. The inference process employs variational inference, supplemented by optimization routines to determine the neural network's parameters. While the paper exhibits strong technical content, it is marred by grammatical and factual errors, which are outlined below:\n1. The claim regarding the modeling of nonnegative numbers on lines 86-87 is inaccurate; it is actually the Poisson Randomized Gamma distribution that serves this purpose.\n2. To enhance clarity, the best results in Table 2 should be highlighted in bold.\n3. The experiments in Section 4.2 could have benefited from a greater emphasis on held-out perplexity as a performance indicator, although MSE/PMSE are acceptable metrics.\n4. The paper adequately addresses the limitations of existing works in modeling long-range dependency (references 1 and 2). However, a comparison with dynamic PF using a single-level deep architecture would have been valuable in demonstrating the utility of the proposed method with multiple hierarchical levels. While the comparison with LSTM is useful, the differing learning algorithms undermine the validity of this comparison in justifying the need for multiple levels of hierarchy.\n5. Numerous grammatical errors and typos, listed below, detract from the paper's readability:\n-- \"unit the data\" should be revised for clarity.\n-- \"Noticing the lack of capturing\" is awkwardly phrased.\n-- The tense in \"PFA factorized a count matrix\" is inconsistent with the surrounding sentences.\n-- \"other data with different pattern long-time dependence\" is unclear.\n-- \"Examples for this including\" is poorly phrased.\n-- \"shows excellent results on predict and\" is incomplete.\n-- \"However, it is rough for them\" is vague.\n-- \"V-dimesnion sequentially\" contains a typo.\n-- \"K-dimension latent variable\" requires clarification.\n-- \"due to the including of feature-wise\" is awkwardly worded.\n-- \"recommend systems\" should be revised to \"recommendation systems\" for accuracy."
