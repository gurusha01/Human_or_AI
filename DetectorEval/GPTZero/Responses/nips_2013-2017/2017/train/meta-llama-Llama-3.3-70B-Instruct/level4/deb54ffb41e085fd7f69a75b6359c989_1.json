The authors tackle the challenging task of representing complex graph structures by transforming them into Boolean circuits, facilitating inference. They demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through an experiment on route prediction for San Francisco taxi cabs, outperforming two baseline methods.\nPSDDs provide a framework for representing probability distributions over structured objects using Boolean circuits, allowing for parameterization and the representation of any distribution under certain conditions. The authors focus on learning distributions over simple, connected routes without cycles, leveraging the advantages of SDD circuits in handling graphs that are computationally expensive to model with Bayesian networks. To address tractability issues with large maps, the authors employ hierarchical approximations, dividing the map into hierarchies to achieve polynomial representation when constraining region sizes.\nThe paper is well-structured, with clear and concise definitions of PSDDs. However, the results appear to be incremental, as the authors apply an existing representation method to graphs and utilize existing inference techniques after making some approximations. Furthermore, the paper dedicates several pages to listing theorems that seem to be basic algorithmic results.\nThe experimental evaluation raises some concerns, particularly with regards to the chosen baselines. For the task of predicting edges given a set of previous edges, the authors compare their approach to a naive frequency-based model and a Markov model that only considers the last edge used.
