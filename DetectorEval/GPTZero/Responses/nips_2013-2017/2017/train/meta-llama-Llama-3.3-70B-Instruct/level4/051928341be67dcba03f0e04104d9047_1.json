However, the writing could be improved, as it sometimes appears weak and confusing, although I believe the authors could refine the submission with additional time.\nStrengths:\n- The model is innovative, achieving impressive results.\n- The experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, are thorough and well-executed.\n- I am particularly impressed by the transition between unary, pairwise, and final attention mechanisms. Although, I would have appreciated the inclusion of marginalized trinary attention maps, which I may have overlooked in the text or supplementary materials.\nWeaknesses:\n- As mentioned earlier, the writing and presentation occasionally appear disorganized.\n- The novelty of the approach seems somewhat limited, as the added complexity, although outperforming the MCB for VQA model [7], largely builds upon the intuition of [7] at higher and lower orders. While not a significant issue, I recommend that the authors clarify their contributions to avoid potential oversight.\n- The probabilistic connection is not formally established, and its current presentation seems more motivational than concrete. I suggest the authors either provide a more rigorous formulation or adjust the language to reflect its informal nature.\n- Figure 2 is represented at an awkward level of abstraction, making it difficult to comprehend the network's functionality or grasp the overall approach. I propose simplifying this figure to emphasize the generation of unary, pairwise, and trinary potentials more clearly.\n- Figure 3 is not referenced in the text, which I found puzzling.\nAreas of Interest:\n- I am curious about the learned values for the linear coefficients in equations (1) for combining marginalized potentials. It would be fascinating to explore whether different modalities leverage distinct potential orders.\n- The underperformance of the 2-Modalities Unary+Pairwise model compared to MCB [7], despite their architectural similarities, raises interesting questions. Unfortunately, this result is not thoroughly discussed in the text, and I would appreciate any intuition the authors can provide regarding this observation, particularly its relation to the switch between MCB and MCT decision computation modules.\n- The discussion on using sequential MCB versus a single MCT layer for the decision head is engaging, but lacks supporting results. I would appreciate it if the authors could share their findings or insights regarding this aspect."
