            "inputText": "This paper presents upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of clustering based on noiseless pairwise comparisons, along with random side-information associated with every pair. Although I am somewhat familiar with the related literature, my understanding of it is limited, making it challenging to fully assess the value of the contributions. The paper's density and the complexity of the upper bound proof, particularly the lengthy proof, made it difficult for me to thoroughly verify the correctness of the results.\nMy overall impression of both papers under review, which appear to be from the same authors and on the same general topic, is that the contributions seem valuable, assuming they are correct. However, the writing quality could be significantly improved. While I acknowledge that the contributions are more important than the writing, the numerous issues with the paper affect my recommendation, making it borderline. Ideally, an additional round of reviews to address the suggested improvements would be beneficial, but I understand this is not feasible for NIPS.\nRegarding this specific paper, several relevant works were not cited. For instance, the concept of replacing Bernoulli(p) and Bernoulli(q) with a general distribution in the stochastic block model is not new and has been explored in papers on the \"labeled stochastic block model\" or \"weighted stochastic block model.\" Additionally, there is a work on the SBM with an active learning element, \"Active Learning for Community Detection in Stochastic Block Models\" (Gadde et al, ISIT 2016), which, although using a different querying model, achieves similar results for fixed k and linear-size communities. At first glance, the lower bound in this paper seems to contradict the sublinear-sample upper bound in Gadde et al., but this discrepancy might be due to the lower bound only holding as k approaches infinity.\nIn light of these existing works, I recommend that the authors remove or rephrase statements claiming to be the first or significantly generalizing previous studies. These claims are not accurate given the prior research in the area.\nFurther comments on the paper include:\n- The model and problem statement should be presented more clearly, explicitly stating whether minimax bounds are considered and if there are any restrictions on cluster sizes.\n- Theorem 2 appears to be incorrect as stated, particularly for the SBM with k=2, where no queries are required in certain cases. The assumption of k approaching infinity is crucial and should be explicitly stated in the theorem, not just in the proof.\n- The numerical section lacks value due to the absence of comparisons with existing works, only comparing against trivial baselines.\n- There are numerous confusing or unclear sentences, such as \"assume, otherwise the clustering is done,\" which seems to be missing text, and grammatical errors throughout the paper.\n- The paper is filled with grammatical mistakes, typos, and unusual wording, including incorrect capitalization, plural forms, spacing, and article usage. Commas are misused, and sentences often start with \"And,\" \"Or,\" or \"Plus,\" which is not standard in academic writing.\nLess significant comments include:\n- The abstract is too long, and the contributions are not introduced until three pages into the paper.\n- The terminology \"Monte Carlo\" and \"Las Vegas\" might not be standard, and the first mention of Las Vegas lacks the crucial specifier \"average\" query complexity.\n- Footnote 1 contains a potential error with \"1-\" after \"p=\".\n- The formal problem statement implies a non-adaptive algorithm due to the wording \"find Q subset of V x V.\"\n- The statement \"clearly exhibiting\" in the Simulations section is disputed.\n- Many brackets in the appendix are too small.\nPost-author feedback comments:\nThe authors' responses have clarified several points, leading to an updated recommendation of acceptance. However, a careful revision addressing the aforementioned comments is still necessary for the final version. While I was the only reviewer to highlight significant writing issues, these problems could affect the understanding and appreciation of the paper by a broader audience, especially those from different academic backgrounds.\nSpecifically:\n- The authors misunderstood the impact of minor issues like capitalization and comma placement on the review. These were noted as areas for revision, not as reasons for the borderline recommendation.\n- The clarification on the lack of contradiction with Gadde's paper is appreciated.\n- The precision in stating theorems and lemmas is crucial, including any conditions such as \"for sufficiently large k.\"\n- Despite the authors' responses, I still recommend revising the use of \"Else,\" \"And,\" \"Or,\" \"Plus,\" and sentences like \"assume, otherwise...\" to conform to standard academic language."
