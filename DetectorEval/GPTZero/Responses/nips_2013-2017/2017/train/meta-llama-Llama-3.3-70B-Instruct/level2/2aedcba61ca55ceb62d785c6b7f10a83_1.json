            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to identify the intrinsic group additive structure for nonparametric regression. The authors rigorously define the intrinsic group additive structure and develop a structure-penalized kernel method to simultaneously identify the intrinsic group additive structure and estimate the nonparametric functions. The method utilizes a novel complexity measure derived for group additive structures, which is based on the capacity measure of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical details are well-explained, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's consistency and performance. The simulation studies and real-data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure and estimating the nonparametric functions.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors provide a rigorous definition of the intrinsic group additive structure, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The proposed method is novel and effective in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure and estimating the nonparametric functions.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's consistency and performance, including simulation studies and real-data applications.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The method's computational cost can be high, especially for large datasets. The authors propose a backward stepwise algorithm to reduce the computational cost, but further research is needed to develop more efficient algorithms.\n* The choice of tuning parameters, such as Âµ and Î±, can be critical to the method's performance. The authors propose using cross-validation to select the tuning parameters, but further research is needed to develop more effective methods for selecting the tuning parameters.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and effective. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's consistency and performance, and the simulation studies and real-data applications demonstrate the method's effectiveness. However, further research is needed to develop more efficient algorithms and effective methods for selecting the tuning parameters.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to identifying the intrinsic group additive structure for nonparametric regression.\n* The authors provide a rigorous definition of the intrinsic group additive structure, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The proposed method is well-analyzed, and the simulation studies and real-data applications demonstrate its effectiveness.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The method's computational cost can be high, especially for large datasets.\n* The choice of tuning parameters, such as Âµ and Î±, can be critical to the method's performance, and further research is needed to develop more effective methods for selecting the tuning parameters.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the computational cost and tuning parameter selection issues in future research. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more detailed explanations of the proposed method and its analysis to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience."
