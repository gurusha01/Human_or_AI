            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The authors achieve this by removing the score function term from the reparameterized gradient estimator, which they call the path derivative gradient estimator. The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed analysis of the estimator and its properties.\nThe main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their estimator through experiments on MNIST and Omniglot datasets using variational and importance-weighted autoencoders. The results show that the path derivative gradient estimator improves over the original gradient estimator in most cases.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details. The use of algorithms and pseudocode helps to illustrate the implementation of the proposed method. The related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature, and the authors clearly position their contribution within the context of existing research.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel unbiased estimator for the ELBO with zero variance when the variational approximation is exact.\n* A clear and well-structured introduction to the problem and the proposed solution.\n* A detailed analysis of the estimator and its properties.\n* Empirical results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The method is specific to variational inference and may not be applicable to other stochastic optimization settings.\n* The authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.\n* Some of the experimental results show modest improvements, and it is not clear whether the proposed method is always better than the original gradient estimator.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of variational inference, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of existing algorithms. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their work, and the empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the ELBO with zero variance when the variational approximation is exact.\n* The authors provide a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem and the proposed solution.\n* The empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The method is specific to variational inference and may not be applicable to other stochastic optimization settings.\n* The authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.\n* Some of the experimental results show modest improvements, and it is not clear whether the proposed method is always better than the original gradient estimator.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method and clarify the conditions under which the proposed method is better than the original gradient estimator."
