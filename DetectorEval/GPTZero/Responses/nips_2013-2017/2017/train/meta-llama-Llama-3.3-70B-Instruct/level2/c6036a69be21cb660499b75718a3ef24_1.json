            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization, by introducing a deliberation process into the encoder-decoder framework. The authors argue that the traditional one-pass decoding process lacks the ability to refine the generated sequence, and propose a two-pass decoding process, where the first-pass decoder generates a raw sequence, and the second-pass decoder polishes and refines the raw sequence.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the architecture of the deliberation network, the training algorithm, and the experimental results. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task and significant improvements on the Gigaword text summarization task.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to sequence generation tasks, which addresses the limitation of the traditional one-pass decoding process.\n* The clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the architecture of the deliberation network and the training algorithm.\n* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two different tasks.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The increased computational cost of the proposed approach, which may be a limitation for large-scale applications.\n* The lack of analysis on the impact of the deliberation process on the generated sequences, such as the types of errors that are corrected or introduced.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequence generation, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of various sequence generation tasks.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to sequence generation tasks.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on two different tasks.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The increased computational cost of the proposed approach may be a limitation for large-scale applications.\n* The lack of analysis on the impact of the deliberation process on the generated sequences may be a limitation of the paper.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
