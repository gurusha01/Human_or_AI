            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to non-parametric Conditional Independence (CI) testing for continuous random variables by converting the problem into a binary classification task. The authors introduce a nearest-neighbor bootstrap procedure to generate samples that mimic the conditionally independent distribution, allowing for the use of powerful classifiers such as gradient-boosted trees and deep neural networks. The paper provides theoretical guarantees on the bootstrapped samples and generalization bounds for the classification problem under non-i.i.d near-independent samples.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed approach reduces the problem of CI testing to binary classification, (2) the nearest-neighbor bootstrap procedure generates samples that are close to the conditionally independent distribution, and (3) the approach outperforms existing methods in empirical experiments.\nThe support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The theoretical results include bounds on the total variational distance between the generated samples and the conditionally independent distribution, as well as generalization bounds for the classification problem. The empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, including a flow-cytometry dataset.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its theoretical foundations. The empirical experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed approach is novel and innovative, and it has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in CI testing.\n* The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach.\n* The empirical experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the underlying distribution is continuous, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The nearest-neighbor bootstrap procedure may not be effective in high-dimensional settings, where the curse of dimensionality may limit its performance.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is innovative and effective. The theoretical analysis and empirical experiments provide a solid foundation for the approach, and it has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in CI testing.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to CI testing.\n* The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach.\n* The empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the underlying distribution is continuous, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The nearest-neighbor bootstrap procedure may not be effective in high-dimensional settings.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
