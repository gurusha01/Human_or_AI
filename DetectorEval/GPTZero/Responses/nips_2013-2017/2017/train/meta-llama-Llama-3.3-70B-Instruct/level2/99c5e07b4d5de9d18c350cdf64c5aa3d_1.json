            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to decoding neural activity for intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs), which enable people with tetraplegia to control a computer cursor by imagining the movement of their paralyzed arm or hand. The authors introduce a dynamic Bayesian network that includes the on-screen goal position as part of its latent state, allowing for the aggregation of the person's intended angle of movement over a longer history of neural activity. They also propose a flexible, multimodal likelihood model for recordings of neural populations, which can be rapidly calibrated for clinical applications.\nThe paper's main claims are that the proposed multiscale semi-Markov (MSSM) model significantly improves the prediction of motion directions compared to the state-of-the-art Kalman filter, and that the MSSM decoder enables a clinical trial participant with tetraplegia to control a computer cursor with neural activity in real-time. The authors support these claims with offline experiments using recorded neural data and online clinical research sessions.\nThe strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, and its potential to improve the lives of individuals with tetraplegia. The authors provide a detailed description of their methods, including the derivation of an efficient online inference algorithm, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through both offline and online experiments.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include the limited scope of the online experiments, which were conducted with only one clinical trial participant, and the need for further evaluation of the suitability of the MSSM method for clinical use. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of their approach, such as the requirement for rapid calibration of the flexible likelihood model and the potential for overfitting.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of iBCIs, and its results have the potential to improve the accuracy and smoothness of cursor control for individuals with tetraplegia. The authors' use of a dynamic Bayesian network and a flexible, multimodal likelihood model represents a novel approach to decoding neural activity, and their online inference algorithm enables real-time decoding.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to decoding neural activity for iBCIs, which has the potential to improve the lives of individuals with tetraplegia.\n* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including both offline and online experiments.\n* The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the prediction of motion directions compared to the state-of-the-art Kalman filter.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The online experiments were conducted with only one clinical trial participant, which limits the scope of the results.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of their approach.\n* Further evaluation is needed to determine the suitability of the MSSM method for clinical use."
