            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-class classification problems with a large number of classes. The authors introduce a double sampling strategy on top of a multi-class to binary reduction strategy, which transforms the original multi-class problem into a binary classification problem over pairs of examples. The sampling strategy aims to overcome the curse of long-tailed class distributions and reduce the number of pairs of examples in the expanded data.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide generalization error bounds that suggest the Empirical Risk Minimization principle over the transformation of the sampled training set remains consistent.\nThe experimental evaluation is also well-conducted, and the authors compare their approach with several state-of-the-art methods on popular datasets. The results show that the proposed approach is highly competitive in terms of predictive performance, runtime, and memory usage, especially for large-scale collections.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A novel and efficient approach to multi-class classification problems with a large number of classes\n* A thorough theoretical analysis that provides generalization error bounds\n* A well-conducted experimental evaluation that compares the proposed approach with state-of-the-art methods\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the classes are mutually exclusive, which may not always be the case in real-world applications\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach\nOverall, I believe that this paper is a good scientific contribution to the field of machine learning, and it has the potential to be accepted at NIPS. The authors provide a novel and efficient approach to multi-class classification problems, and the theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation are thorough and well-conducted.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and efficient approach to multi-class classification problems\n* The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide generalization error bounds\n* The experimental evaluation is well-conducted, and the results show that the proposed approach is highly competitive\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the classes are mutually exclusive, which may not always be the case in real-world applications\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including providing a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and discussing the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach."
