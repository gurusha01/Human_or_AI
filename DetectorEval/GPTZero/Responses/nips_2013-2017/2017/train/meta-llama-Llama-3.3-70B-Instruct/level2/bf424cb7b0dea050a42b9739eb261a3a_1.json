The authors identify a fundamental limitation in using gradient descent-based methods with smooth kernels, which can lead to slow convergence and over-regularization. They propose a novel approach, called EigenPro iteration, which modifies the gradient descent algorithm to incorporate approximate second-order information. This approach is shown to significantly improve the convergence rate and accuracy of kernel methods on large datasets.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels and demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro iteration through extensive experiments on various datasets.\nThe main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that the proposed method can achieve significant acceleration over standard gradient descent and other state-of-the-art kernel methods, while maintaining a low computational overhead.\nThe paper also demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant literature and provides a thorough comparison with existing methods. The authors highlight the advantages of EigenPro iteration, including its ability to incorporate approximate second-order information, its low overhead per iteration, and its robustness to errors in the second-order preconditioning term.\nOne potential limitation of the paper is that the proposed method may not be directly applicable to all types of kernel methods or datasets. However, the authors provide a clear discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their approach, which demonstrates their awareness of the potential limitations and their willingness to explore further research directions.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and demonstrates the potential of EigenPro iteration to improve the performance of kernel methods on large datasets. The paper is well-written, well-structured, and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method, making it a strong candidate for publication.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of kernel methods and gradient descent optimization.\n* The proposed method, EigenPro iteration, is shown to significantly improve the convergence rate and accuracy of kernel methods on large datasets.\n* The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels and demonstrates the effectiveness of EigenPro iteration through extensive experiments.\n* The authors provide a clear discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their approach, demonstrating their awareness of the potential limitations and their willingness to explore further research directions.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The proposed method may not be directly applicable to all types of kernel methods or datasets.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of EigenPro iteration in different domains.\n* Some of the experimental results could be further improved with additional hyperparameter tuning or more extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods."
