The authors model the disease as a finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate external information that may trigger early arrival at the clinician. The paper provides a computationally tractable approach to constructing approximately optimal screening policies, which is demonstrated using a large breast cancer dataset.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the development of a personalized screening policy framework that accounts for patient features and dynamic history, and (2) the construction of an approximately optimal policy that reduces the number of screenings while maintaining the same delay in detection. The paper supports these claims through a combination of theoretical analysis, algorithmic development, and empirical evaluation using real-world data.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, methodology, and results. The use of a breast cancer dataset to illustrate the approach is effective in demonstrating the potential benefits of the proposed framework. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the contributions of the proposed methodology.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The development of a novel framework for personalized screening policies that accounts for patient features and dynamic history.\n* The construction of an approximately optimal policy that reduces the number of screenings while maintaining the same delay in detection.\n* The use of a large breast cancer dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* A thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the contributions of the proposed methodology.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which may limit its scalability to larger datasets or more complex disease models.\n* The reliance on a specific disease model (breast cancer) to demonstrate the approach, which may limit its generalizability to other diseases or contexts.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for personalized screening policies, which may make it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies, and the proposed framework has the potential to improve disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the approach and to demonstrate its generalizability to other diseases and contexts.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies.\n* The proposed framework has the potential to improve disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes.\n* The paper provides a thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the contributions of the proposed methodology.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm may limit its scalability to larger datasets or more complex disease models.\n* The reliance on a specific disease model (breast cancer) to demonstrate the approach may limit its generalizability to other diseases or contexts.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for personalized screening policies may make it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach."
