            "inputText": "This paper proposes a conservative linear bandit algorithm, called CLUCB, which addresses the issue of safety in contextual linear bandits. The main claim of the paper is that CLUCB satisfies a performance constraint, ensuring that its cumulative rewards are at least as good as a fraction of the performance of a baseline policy, while achieving a regret bound equivalent to that of the standard linear UCB algorithm up to an additive time-independent constant.\nThe support for this claim comes from a thorough theoretical analysis, including a regret bound decomposition into two terms: one corresponding to the regret of the standard linear UCB algorithm and another accounting for the loss of being conservative. The paper also provides an extension of CLUCB to the case where the reward function of the baseline policy is unknown, called CLUCB2, and proves a regret bound for this algorithm.\nThe paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The use of confidence sets and the construction of the CLUCB algorithm are well-explained, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous. The simulation results support the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nThe paper is practically useful, as it addresses a critical issue in implementing linear bandit algorithms in real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation systems. The proposed algorithm can be used in situations where having a reasonable performance at any time is necessary for a learning algorithm to be considered reliable and to remain in production.\nThe paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, citing relevant works and building upon existing research. The novelty of the paper lies in the formulation of the conservative linear bandit problem and the proposal of the CLUCB algorithm, which satisfies the safety constraint while achieving a regret bound equivalent to that of the standard linear UCB algorithm.\nThe completeness of the paper is satisfactory, with all necessary details provided for reproducibility. The limitations of the paper are acknowledged, and potential future directions are discussed.\nIn terms of the NIPS review criteria, the paper scores well on:\n* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results.\n* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.\n* Originality: The paper proposes a novel algorithm and formulation of the conservative linear bandit problem.\n* Significance: The paper addresses a critical issue in implementing linear bandit algorithms in real-world applications and has the potential to impact the field.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel algorithm that addresses a critical issue in implementing linear bandit algorithms in real-world applications.\n* The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the simulation results support the claims.\n* The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field and builds upon existing research.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper may benefit from more extensive simulation results and comparisons with other algorithms.\n* Some of the technical proofs and lemmas are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the paper."
