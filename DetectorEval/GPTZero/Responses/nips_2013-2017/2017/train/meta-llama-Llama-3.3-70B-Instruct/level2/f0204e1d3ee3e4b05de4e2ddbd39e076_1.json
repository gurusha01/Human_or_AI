            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel framework for controlling false alarms when multiple A/B tests are run over time, leveraging advances in adaptive sampling and online false discovery rate (FDR) control. The main claims of the paper are: (i) proposing reasonable definitions of a null hypothesis for multi-armed bandit (MAB) instances, (ii) demonstrating how to derive an always-valid sequential p-value for continuous monitoring, and (iii) showing that using rejection thresholds of online-FDR algorithms as confidence levels for MAB algorithms results in sample-optimality, high power, and low FDR at any point in time.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, highlighting the limitations of traditional A/B testing frameworks and the need for a more efficient and adaptive approach. The proposed framework, MAB-FDR, combines adaptive sampling strategies with online FDR control procedures, allowing for continuous monitoring and control of FDR at any time.\nThe paper provides extensive simulations and experiments on both artificial and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of MAB-FDR in terms of sample complexity, power, and FDR control. The results show that MAB-FDR outperforms competing procedures, such as AB-FDR and MAB-IND, in terms of power and sample complexity, while maintaining FDR control.\nThe paper also provides a thorough discussion of the theoretical guarantees of the proposed framework, including the control of FDR and the power of the procedure. The authors demonstrate that MAB-FDR achieves mFDR control at level Î± and provides a lower bound on the power of the procedure.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and well-structured introduction to the problem and the proposed framework\n* Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of MAB-FDR\n* Thorough discussion of the theoretical guarantees of the proposed framework\n* Novel combination of adaptive sampling and online FDR control procedures\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the data is sub-Gaussian, which may not always be the case in practice\n* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed framework\n* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts in the field\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of A/B testing and online FDR control, providing a novel and effective framework for controlling false alarms in multiple testing scenarios. The paper is well-written, and the results are thoroughly demonstrated through simulations and experiments.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective framework for controlling false alarms in multiple testing scenarios\n* The paper provides extensive simulations and experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of MAB-FDR\n* The paper provides a thorough discussion of the theoretical guarantees of the proposed framework\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the data is sub-Gaussian, which may not always be the case in practice\n* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed framework\n* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts in the field\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
