            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The paper presents extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over conventional methods.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (i) the proposal of an intensity-free generative model for point processes, (ii) the extension of Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for point processes with RNN architecture, and (iii) the demonstration of the promising performance of the approach on various datasets.\nThe support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that the proposed approach can accurately estimate the underlying point process without requiring prior knowledge of its parametric form. The experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with known parametric forms. The results on real-world datasets also show that the proposed approach can recover the intensity of the underlying point process better than other methods.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its theoretical background. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a GAN framework\n* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between real and generated point processes\n* The demonstration of the superiority of the proposed approach over conventional methods on various datasets\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of a clear explanation of the choice of the RNN architecture and its hyperparameters\n* The limited analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach\n* The lack of a comparison with other deep learning-based approaches for modeling point processes\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of point process modeling and provides a promising approach for estimating underlying point processes without requiring prior knowledge of their parametric forms.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a GAN framework\n* The approach is demonstrated to be superior to conventional methods on various datasets\n* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its theoretical background\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper lacks a clear explanation of the choice of the RNN architecture and its hyperparameters\n* The computational complexity of the proposed approach is not thoroughly analyzed\n* The paper does not provide a comparison with other deep learning-based approaches for modeling point processes\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide a clear explanation of the choice of the RNN architecture and its hyperparameters, and provide a more thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors should consider comparing their approach with other deep learning-based approaches for modeling point processes."
