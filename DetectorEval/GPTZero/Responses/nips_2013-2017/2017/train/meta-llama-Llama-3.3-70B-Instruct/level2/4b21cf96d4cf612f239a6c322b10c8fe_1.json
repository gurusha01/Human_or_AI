            "inputText": "This paper proposes two novel models, Gaussian Mixture Model Conditional Variational Autoencoder (GMM-CVAE) and Additive Gaussian Conditional Variational Autoencoder (AG-CVAE), for image caption generation. The main claim of the paper is that these models can generate more diverse and accurate captions than standard LSTM baselines and \"vanilla\" CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of image caption generation, and the proposed models are well-motivated and technically sound. The use of a Gaussian Mixture model and an Additive Gaussian prior is a novel approach to structuring the latent space, and the paper provides a thorough explanation of the models and their training procedures.\nThe experimental results are impressive, with both GMM-CVAE and AG-CVAE outperforming the baselines in terms of caption quality and diversity. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison of the models' performance with and without the use of object vectors as additional conditioning information.\nThe paper's strengths include its clear and well-structured presentation, its novel and well-motivated approach to image caption generation, and its impressive experimental results. The paper's weaknesses include its reliance on a specific dataset (MSCOCO) and its limited analysis of the models' performance on other datasets.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, well-written, and provides a clear and thorough explanation of the proposed models and their results. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results and discusses the limitations of the models.\nHere is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:\nPro:\n* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to image caption generation.\n* The experimental results are impressive, with both GMM-CVAE and AG-CVAE outperforming the baselines.\n* The paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the proposed models and their training procedures.\n* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison of the models' performance with and without the use of object vectors as additional conditioning information.\nCon:\n* The paper relies on a specific dataset (MSCOCO) and does not provide a thorough analysis of the models' performance on other datasets.\n* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the models' performance with other state-of-the-art models.\n* The paper's discussion of the limitations of the models is limited, and the paper could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the models' weaknesses and potential areas for improvement.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it provides a significant contribution to the field of image caption generation. With some revisions to address the limitations of the paper, it has the potential to be a high-quality publication."
