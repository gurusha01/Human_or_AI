            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to fuse visual and linguistic inputs in visual question answering (VQA) tasks. The authors introduce Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN), a mechanism that modulates the entire visual processing pipeline by a linguistic input. This is achieved by predicting the batch normalization parameters from a language embedding, allowing the linguistic input to influence the visual processing from the early stages.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) CBN is an efficient and effective way to modulate the visual processing pipeline, (2) applying CBN to a pre-trained ResNet (MODERN architecture) significantly improves strong baselines on two VQA tasks, and (3) modulating the entire visual signal is beneficial for maximum performance gains.\nThe paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including an ablation study and comparisons with state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that MODERN outperforms fine-tuning and other baseline models, and that conditioning the batch normalization on the language representation is crucial for the performance gain.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its motivations. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors highlight the differences between their approach and previous work.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel and efficient fusion mechanism (CBN) that can be incorporated into existing architectures.\n* The demonstration of significant improvements over strong baselines on two VQA tasks.\n* The provision of a thorough evaluation, including an ablation study and comparisons with state-of-the-art models.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The limited analysis of the learned representations and the modulation process.\n* The lack of exploration of the applicability of CBN to other tasks and domains.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of VQA and multimodal learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other tasks and domains.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and efficient fusion mechanism that can be incorporated into existing architectures.\n* The results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines on two VQA tasks.\n* The paper provides a thorough evaluation, including an ablation study and comparisons with state-of-the-art models.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The analysis of the learned representations and the modulation process is limited.\n* The applicability of CBN to other tasks and domains is not explored.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the limited analysis of the learned representations and the modulation process, and to explore the applicability of CBN to other tasks and domains."
