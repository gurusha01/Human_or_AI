            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating human feedback into a reinforcement learning framework for image captioning. The main claim of the paper is that using natural language feedback can provide a stronger learning signal than numeric rewards, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance. The authors argue that this approach can enable non-expert users to teach and guide artificial agents, which is critical for the development of household robots and other AI systems.\nThe paper is well-supported by experiments on the MS-COCO dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors show that their model, which uses a hierarchical phrase-based RNN and a feedback network to incorporate human feedback, outperforms baseline models that use only numeric rewards or independently written captions. The results are significant, with the proposed model achieving a 1.1-point improvement over the baseline RL model and a 3.5-point improvement over the MLE model.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed description of the proposed approach. The authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and experimental design, and the results are well-presented and easy to understand.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to address the credit assignment problem, which is a key challenge in reinforcement learning. The authors show that their approach can provide a clear and effective way to assign credit to the model's actions, allowing it to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the paper. One potential limitation is that the approach relies on human feedback, which can be time-consuming and expensive to collect. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future work could focus on developing more efficient methods for collecting and incorporating human feedback.\nAnother potential limitation is that the approach is limited to the problem of image captioning. While the authors suggest that their approach could be applied to other problems, such as robotics and natural language processing, it is not clear how well the approach would generalize to these domains.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and image captioning. The proposed approach is novel and effective, and the results are well-supported by experiments. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work and a detailed description of their methodology.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to incorporating human feedback into a reinforcement learning framework for image captioning.\n* The approach is well-supported by experiments on the MS-COCO dataset, which demonstrate its effectiveness.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed description of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The approach relies on human feedback, which can be time-consuming and expensive to collect.\n* The approach is limited to the problem of image captioning, and it is not clear how well it would generalize to other domains.\nRecommendation: Accept.
