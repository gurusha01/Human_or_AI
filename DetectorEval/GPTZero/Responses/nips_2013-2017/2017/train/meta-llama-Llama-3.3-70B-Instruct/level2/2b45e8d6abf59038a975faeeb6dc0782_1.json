            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions based on samples, called Population Matching Discrepancy (PMD). The authors define PMD as the minimum weight matching between two random populations from the distributions and prove that it is a strongly consistent estimator of the first Wasserstein metric. The paper also presents a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to learn parameters of the distributions using PMD.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) PMD is a strongly consistent estimator of the first Wasserstein metric, and (2) PMD outperforms the popular Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method in terms of performance and convergence speed in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks.\nThe support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The authors show that PMD has several advantages over MMD, including no kernel bandwidth hyper-parameter, stronger gradient, and smaller mini-batch size for gradient-based optimization. The empirical results demonstrate that PMD outperforms MMD in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks, and that PMD converges faster than MMD.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its advantages. The empirical results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nThe usefulness of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions that has several advantages over existing methods. The method has potential applications in various fields, including domain adaptation, generative modeling, and machine learning.\nThe field knowledge of the paper is good, as the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the relevant background and related work. The paper reflects common knowledge in the field and demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant literature.\nThe novelty of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions. The method is original and has not been proposed before, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its advantages and limitations.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, as the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its advantages. The empirical results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nThe limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the computation of minimum weight matching can be time-consuming for large population sizes. However, the authors propose an approximate matching algorithm that can be used to speed up the computation.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper proposes a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions that has several advantages over existing methods, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions that has several advantages over existing methods.\n* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its advantages.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The computation of minimum weight matching can be time-consuming for large population sizes.\n* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed method, such as its finite-sample error bounds and testing power."
