            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel robust submodular streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which addresses the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint and robustness requirement. The algorithm makes one pass over the data and retains a set of size O((k + m log k) log k) elements. The authors also propose a simple greedy algorithm, STAR-T-GREEDY, which runs on the obtained set and achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee after the removal of any m elements.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough and easy to follow. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two different data summarization tasks, outperforming existing greedy and streaming methods.\nThe main strengths of the paper are:\n* The proposed algorithm, STAR-T, is novel and addresses a important problem in submodular optimization.\n* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including a constant-factor approximation guarantee.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice.\nThe main weaknesses of the paper are:\n* The algorithm requires a parameter Ï , which is a function of an unknown value f(OPT(k, V \\ E)). The authors propose a parallel variant of STAR-T to approximate this value, but this increases the space complexity.\n* The algorithm has a high space complexity, O((k + m log k) log k), which may be a limitation in practice.\nOverall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The proposed algorithm is novel and addresses an important problem, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective algorithm for robust submodular streaming.\n* The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a constant-factor approximation guarantee.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The algorithm requires a parameter Ï , which is a function of an unknown value f(OPT(k, V \\ E)).\n* The algorithm has a high space complexity, O((k + m log k) log k).\nSuggestions for improvement:\n* The authors could explore ways to reduce the space complexity of the algorithm.\n* The authors could provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in different scenarios.\n* The authors could consider extending the algorithm to handle more general submodular functions."
