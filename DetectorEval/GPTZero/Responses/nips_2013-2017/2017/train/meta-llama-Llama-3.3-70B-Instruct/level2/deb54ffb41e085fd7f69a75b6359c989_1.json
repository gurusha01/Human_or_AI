            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors introduce the concept of hierarchical route distributions, which allows for the construction of tractable PSDDs over route distributions, enabling them to scale to larger maps. The paper provides a thorough explanation of the theoretical foundations of PSDDs and their application to route distributions.\nThe main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a route prediction task, showing that PSDDs can outperform Markov models and naive baselines in terms of accuracy. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the scalability and tractability of the proposed approach, including the use of hierarchical distributions and the compilation of PSDDs.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical concepts. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their findings.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using PSDDs\n* The provision of a thorough theoretical analysis of the approach, including the use of hierarchical distributions and the compilation of PSDDs\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach in a route prediction task, including a comparison with Markov models and naive baselines\n* The provision of a detailed analysis of the scalability and tractability of the proposed approach\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in PSDDs and probabilistic graphical models, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow\n* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset and task, and it would be beneficial to see the approach applied to other datasets and tasks\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and route planning. The approach proposed in the paper has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks and datasets, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical and practical implications of their findings.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using PSDDs\n* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the approach, including the use of hierarchical distributions and the compilation of PSDDs\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in a route prediction task, including a comparison with Markov models and naive baselines\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in PSDDs and probabilistic graphical models, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow\n* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset and task, and it would be beneficial to see the approach applied to other datasets and tasks\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and route planning. The authors should consider adding more background information and explanations to make the paper more accessible to non-experts, and provide more detailed discussions of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach."
