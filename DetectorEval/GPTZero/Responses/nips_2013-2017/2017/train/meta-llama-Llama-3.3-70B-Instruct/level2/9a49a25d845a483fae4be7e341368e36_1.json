            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel probabilistic formulation for reducing algorithmic discrimination in supervised learning by transforming the data through a randomized mapping. The main claims of the paper are: (1) the introduction of a probabilistic framework for discrimination-preventing preprocessing, (2) the formulation of an optimization problem that trades off discrimination control, data utility, and individual distortion, and (3) the demonstration of the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.\nThe support for these claims is strong, with a clear and well-motivated formulation of the optimization problem, and convincing experimental results on two datasets. The paper provides a thorough discussion of the theoretical properties of the optimization approach, including convexity, robustness to limited samples, and generalizability of discrimination control. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce discrimination while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy, and that it is competitive with other methods in the literature.\nThe paper is well-written, clearly organized, and easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the motivations and contributions of their approach. The use of probabilistic language and notation is consistent and clear, making it easy to understand the technical details of the paper.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they have the potential to contribute to the development of fair and unbiased machine learning models. The paper's focus on individual fairness and the explicit control of distortion through the design of the distortion metric are particularly noteworthy.\nThe paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, with references to relevant literature and a clear understanding of the key concepts and challenges in algorithmic fairness. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and provide suggestions for future work, demonstrating a commitment to ongoing research and improvement.\nThe novelty of the paper is significant, as it introduces a new probabilistic formulation for reducing algorithmic discrimination and demonstrates its effectiveness on real-world datasets. The paper's contributions are well-motivated and clearly explained, making it a valuable addition to the literature on algorithmic fairness.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper's strengths include its clear and well-motivated formulation, convincing experimental results, and thorough discussion of theoretical properties. The paper's weaknesses are minor, and the authors provide suggestions for future work to address these limitations.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel probabilistic formulation for reducing algorithmic discrimination.\n* The paper provides convincing experimental results on two datasets.\n* The paper demonstrates a thorough understanding of the field and relevant literature.\n* The paper's contributions are well-motivated and clearly explained.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper's experimental results are limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to see results on additional datasets.\n* The paper's discussion of the limitations of the approach could be more detailed, and the authors could provide more suggestions for future work to address these limitations."
