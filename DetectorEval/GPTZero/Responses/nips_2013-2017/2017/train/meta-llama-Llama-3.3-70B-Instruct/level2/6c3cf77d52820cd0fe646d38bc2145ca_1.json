            "inputText": "This paper presents a thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, specifically focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used to ensure network consistency. The authors model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties, both pre- and post-2015, when the community changed its flooding mechanism from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) Bitcoin's flooding protocols have poor anonymity properties, and (2) the community's shift from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading did not improve the situation. The authors support these claims through a detailed analysis of the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under both trickle and diffusion propagation.\nThe paper's strengths include its rigorous mathematical analysis, simulation results, and comparison to real-world data. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their models, assumptions, and results, making it easy to follow their reasoning. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the graph structure in estimating the source of a transaction, which can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimation.\nHowever, the paper has some limitations. The authors assume a regular tree-structured network, which may not accurately represent the real-world Bitcoin network topology. Additionally, the analysis focuses on a specific type of adversary, the eavesdropper adversary, which may not be the only type of attack the network is vulnerable to.\nIn terms of usefulness, the paper's results have significant implications for the design of more anonymous transaction-flooding protocols. The authors' findings suggest that increasing the degree of each node in the network can reduce the adversary's probability of detection, but this may come at the cost of increased network latency. The paper's analysis and results can inform the development of more secure and anonymous cryptocurrency protocols.\nThe paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, citing relevant literature and using established terminology. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of their contributions, which include modeling the Bitcoin P2P network, analyzing the probability of deanonymization, and evaluating the performance of different estimators.\nThe paper's novelty lies in its analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's transaction-flooding protocols, which has not been thoroughly studied before. The authors' use of epidemic source detection techniques and their development of new estimators, such as timestamp rumor centrality and reporting centrality, contribute to the advancement of the field.\nIn terms of completeness, the paper provides sufficient details for reproducibility, including simulation code and data. The authors also discuss the limitations of their analysis and suggest potential avenues for future work.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The paper's strengths outweigh its limitations, and it makes a significant contribution to the field of cryptocurrency security and anonymity.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their models, assumptions, and results.\n* The paper highlights the importance of considering the graph structure in estimating the source of a transaction.\n* The authors' findings have significant implications for the design of more anonymous transaction-flooding protocols.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a regular tree-structured network, which may not accurately represent the real-world Bitcoin network topology.\n* The analysis focuses on a specific type of adversary, the eavesdropper adversary, which may not be the only type of attack the network is vulnerable to.\n* The paper's results may not be directly applicable to other cryptocurrency protocols."
