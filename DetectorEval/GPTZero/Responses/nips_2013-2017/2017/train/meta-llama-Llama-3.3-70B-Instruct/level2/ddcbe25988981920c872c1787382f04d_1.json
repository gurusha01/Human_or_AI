The authors develop a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers and propose a statistical estimate of the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors provide a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers, which can be computed in O(m3) time; (2) they propose an efficient approximation scheme to estimate the number of k-mer pairs between two sequences that are at distance d; and (3) they design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for kernel computation with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the algorithm.\nThe support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm achieves significant speedups over existing solutions, with an order of magnitude gain in computational efficiency, while maintaining excellent approximation of kernel matrices and predictive accuracies.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors adequately discuss the limitations of existing approaches. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.\nThe strengths of the paper include: (1) the development of a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers, which is a significant contribution to the field; (2) the proposal of an efficient approximation scheme to estimate the number of k-mer pairs between two sequences that are at distance d; and (3) the design of a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for kernel computation with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the algorithm.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the time complexity of their algorithm; (2) the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, including more datasets and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods; and (3) the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of their approach beyond sequence classification tasks.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequence classification, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through thorough experimental evaluation. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to efficiently estimate the pairwise similarity score between two sequences.\n* The authors develop a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The proposed algorithm achieves significant speedups over existing solutions while maintaining excellent approximation of kernel matrices and predictive accuracies.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The authors could provide more detailed analysis of the time complexity of their algorithm.\n* The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, including more datasets and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of their approach beyond sequence classification tasks."
