The authors propose a fast and accurate model-based saliency detection method that can be applied to any differentiable image classifier. The main claim of the paper is that their approach outperforms other weakly supervised techniques at the ImageNet localisation task and produces high-quality saliency maps.\nThe paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis, experiments, and comparisons with existing methods. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the objective function, architecture, and training process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet localisation task and outperforming other popular saliency detectors.\nThe paper also introduces a new saliency metric, which is used to assess the quality of explanations produced by saliency detectors. This metric is shown to be effective in evaluating the interpretability of saliency maps and provides a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.\nThe strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate a deep understanding of the field. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors acknowledge that their approach may have biases of its own, which could influence the generated saliency masks. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on image classification tasks, and it is unclear how well the approach would generalize to other tasks or domains.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of saliency detection and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and computer vision. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the field and provide a well-supported and well-written paper.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to saliency detection.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate a deep understanding of the field.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet localisation task.\n* The paper introduces a new saliency metric, which provides a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper focuses primarily on image classification tasks, and it is unclear how well the approach would generalize to other tasks or domains.\n* The authors acknowledge that their approach may have biases of its own, which could influence the generated saliency masks.\n* The paper could benefit from additional analysis and discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the approach."
