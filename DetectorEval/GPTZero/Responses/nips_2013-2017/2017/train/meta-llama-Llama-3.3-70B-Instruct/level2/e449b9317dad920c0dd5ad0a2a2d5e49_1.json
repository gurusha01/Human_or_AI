            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to automated cell extraction in calcium imaging datasets using robust statistical estimation. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed method, EXTRACT, outperforms existing methods in terms of signal accuracy and robustness to contamination. The paper supports this claim through a series of experiments on both simulated and real datasets.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on the importance of calcium imaging in neuroscience research and the challenges of automated cell extraction. The authors also provide a clear overview of the existing methods and their limitations.\nThe technical sections of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of their proposed method, including the mathematical derivations and the optimization routine. The use of M-estimation and the one-sided Huber estimator is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how these techniques can be used to robustly estimate the cell signals.\nThe experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the superiority of EXTRACT over existing methods in a variety of scenarios, including simulated data with overlapping cells and neuropil contamination, as well as real data from microendoscopic single-photon imaging. The results are well-visualized, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the implications of their findings.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and readability. The authors have done an excellent job of making the technical content accessible to a broad audience, and the paper is well-suited for a conference like NIPS.\nIn terms of novelty, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of calcium imaging and automated cell extraction. The use of robust statistical estimation and M-estimation is a new approach to this problem, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of scenarios.\nThe paper also has significant implications for the field of neuroscience research. Automated cell extraction is a crucial step in the analysis of calcium imaging data, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of this process. This could lead to new insights into the functioning of the brain and the behavior of neurons, which could have significant implications for our understanding of neurological disorders and the development of new treatments.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication at NIPS. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and makes a significant contribution to the field of calcium imaging and automated cell extraction.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to automated cell extraction in calcium imaging datasets using robust statistical estimation.\n* The paper provides a thorough explanation of the technical details, including the mathematical derivations and the optimization routine.\n* The experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the superiority of EXTRACT over existing methods in a variety of scenarios.\n* The paper has significant implications for the field of neuroscience research, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of automated cell extraction.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper may be too long and could benefit from some editing to make it more concise.\n* Some of the technical details may be difficult for non-experts to follow, and the authors could provide more background or explanation to make the paper more accessible.\n* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research."
