The authors introduce SphereNet, a deep hyperspherical convolution network that adopts SphereConv as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by a generalized angular softmax loss. The paper claims that SphereNet can effectively encode discriminative representation and alleviate training difficulty, leading to easier optimization, faster convergence, and comparable or better classification accuracy over convolutional counterparts.\nThe main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a fundamental analysis of the cosine SphereConv operator, demonstrating that it can improve the conditioning of the problem and enhance the geometric structure, leading to improved convergence of optimization procedures. The experimental results show that SphereNets outperform CNN baselines on various image classification tasks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-2012.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method. The experimental results are thorough and well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results. The paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed method and provides suggestions for future work.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel learning framework that can effectively alleviate training difficulties and improve classification accuracy.\n* The provision of theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the claims.\n* The discussion of limitations and suggestions for future work.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The computation complexity of each neuron is slightly higher than CNNs.\n* The SphereConvs are still mostly prefixed, and designing or learning a better SphereConv is left for future work.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method shows promising results. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the method, and the experimental results are thorough and well-organized. The paper is a good contribution to the field of deep learning and neural networks.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel learning framework that can effectively alleviate training difficulties and improve classification accuracy.\n* The paper provides theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the claims.\n* The paper discusses limitations and suggestions for future work.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The computation complexity of each neuron is slightly higher than CNNs.\n* The SphereConvs are still mostly prefixed, and designing or learning a better SphereConv is left for future work.\nRecommendation: Accept.
