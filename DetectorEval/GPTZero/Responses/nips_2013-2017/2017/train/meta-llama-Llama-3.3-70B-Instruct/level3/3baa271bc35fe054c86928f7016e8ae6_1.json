            "inputText": "This paper studies the problem of maximizing a submodular function in a streaming setting with the additional constraint of robustness to element removals. The authors propose a two-stage algorithm, STAR-T, which first constructs a robust summary of the data in a single pass, and then uses a simple greedy algorithm to find a near-optimal solution after any set of elements is removed. The paper provides a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness in two data summarization tasks.\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem, algorithm, and theoretical results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a proof of the approximation guarantee and an analysis of the algorithm's space complexity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice, showing that it compares favorably to existing algorithms even when they are given the benefit of knowing which elements will be removed in advance.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its technical contribution, which includes a novel partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing algorithms.\nHowever, the paper could be improved in a few areas. First, the motivation and applications of the problem could be more clearly explained. While the authors provide some examples of applications, it is not entirely clear why robustness to element removals is important in these contexts. Additionally, the experimental results could be more comprehensive, including more datasets and comparison to more algorithms.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and algorithm. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and demonstrates its effectiveness in practice. However, the paper could be improved in terms of motivation and applications, and the experimental results could be more comprehensive.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper provides a novel and technically challenging solution to the problem of robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting.\n* The algorithm has a constant-factor approximation guarantee, which is a strong theoretical result.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice, showing that it compares favorably to existing algorithms.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The motivation and applications of the problem could be more clearly explained.\n* The experimental results could be more comprehensive, including more datasets and comparison to more algorithms.\n* The paper may not be of broad interest to the NIPS community, as it is a specialized topic in submodular optimization.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a significant technical contribution and demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing more motivation and applications, and by including more comprehensive experimental results. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and algorithm. The theoretical results are strong, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem, algorithm, and theoretical results.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe paper provides a novel solution to the problem of robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, including a novel partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule.\nSignificance: 7/10\nThe paper provides a significant technical contribution, but the motivation and applications of the problem could be more clearly explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice, but could be more comprehensive."
