            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to contextual linear bandits with a conservative constraint, which ensures that the cumulative reward is at least (1-alpha)-times larger than a given baseline policy. The authors consider two cases: known and unknown baseline rewards, and propose a UCB-type algorithm for each case with proven regret upper bounds. The algorithm is evaluated through simulations with known baseline rewards, confirming that it satisfies the conservative constraint.\nThe paper's conservative constraint, algorithms, and regret bounds are deemed natural and effective. The approach is well-motivated, and the theoretical analysis is sound. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in satisfying the conservative constraint.\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement. The visualization of the algorithm's performance, specifically Figure 1(a), needs improvement to better show the initial conservative phases. Additionally, more experiments should be conducted for CLUCB2 to demonstrate its effectiveness in more realistic settings.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.\nThe originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to contextual linear bandits with a conservative constraint. The combination of UCB-type algorithms with a conservative constraint is new and significant. The paper builds on existing work in bandits and online learning, but the specific approach and analysis are novel.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of online learning and decision-making under uncertainty. The conservative constraint is a natural and important consideration in many real-world applications, and the proposed algorithm provides a effective way to satisfy this constraint while still achieving good performance.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, technically sound, and makes a significant contribution to the field. The strengths of the paper include its novel approach, sound theoretical analysis, and effective algorithm. The weaknesses include the need for improved visualization and more experiments in realistic settings.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant approach to contextual linear bandits with a conservative constraint.\n* The theoretical analysis is sound, and the algorithm is effective in satisfying the conservative constraint.\n* The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and adequately informs the reader.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The visualization of the algorithm's performance could be improved.\n* More experiments should be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of CLUCB2 in realistic settings.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the visualization and experimentation issues."
