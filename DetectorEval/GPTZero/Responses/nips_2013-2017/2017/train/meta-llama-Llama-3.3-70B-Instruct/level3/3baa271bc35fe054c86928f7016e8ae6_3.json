            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, focusing on the transition from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading in 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under both trickle and diffusion propagation. They develop and analyze various estimators, including the first-timestamp estimator and maximum-likelihood estimators, to quantify the anonymity properties of the network.\nThe paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the problem, the development of new models and estimators, and the provision of theoretical and simulation results to support the claims. The authors demonstrate that both trickle and diffusion spreading have poor anonymity properties, and that the transition to diffusion did not significantly improve the situation. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the graph structure in designing estimators, as centrality-based estimators can achieve higher probabilities of detection than the first-timestamp estimator.\nHowever, the paper has some weaknesses. The writing and analysis could be improved, with clearer explanations of the innovative analysis and more convincing applications, particularly in influence maximization. Additionally, the paper lacks non-trivial lower bounds to complement the upper bound, which would provide a more complete understanding of the problem. The simulation results, while useful, are limited to regular trees and a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network, and may not generalize to other network topologies or time periods.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results. The paper is also original, as it presents new models and estimators for analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides new insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's network.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\n* The authors develop and analyze new models and estimators, providing a significant contribution to the field.\n* The paper highlights the importance of considering the graph structure in designing estimators.\n* The simulation results provide useful insights into the performance of the estimators.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The writing and analysis could be improved, with clearer explanations of the innovative analysis and more convincing applications.\n* The paper lacks non-trivial lower bounds to complement the upper bound.\n* The simulation results are limited to regular trees and a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network, and may not generalize to other network topologies or time periods.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and provides new insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's network. However, the authors should be encouraged to improve the writing and analysis, and to provide more comprehensive simulation results and lower bounds to complement the upper bound."
