The authors introduce a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings, and provide a theoretical analysis of the approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.\n* The introduction of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings.\n* The provision of a theoretical analysis of the approach, including the connection between the proposed proximity objective function and community detection.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses:\n* The paper builds on existing work, and the novelty of the approach is relatively thin, with only two main improvements: a double sampling strategy and new generalization bounds.\n* The prediction time of PRUNE is long compared to other approaches, which may be a limitation in practice.\n* The generalization bound presented in the paper is unclear and lacks comparison with other approaches.\n* The experimental comparison involves both batch and online learning algorithms, which have different memory usage requirements.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks.\n* The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approach, including the connection between the proposed proximity objective function and community detection.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The novelty of the approach is relatively thin, with only two main improvements: a double sampling strategy and new generalization bounds.\n* The prediction time of PRUNE is long compared to other approaches.\n* The generalization bound presented in the paper is unclear and lacks comparison with other approaches.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel approach to network embedding and demonstrates its effectiveness in various tasks. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the clarity of the generalization bound and the comparison with other approaches. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The experimental results are convincing, and the theoretical analysis is sound. However, the generalization bound could be clearer, and the comparison with other approaches could be more comprehensive.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The figures and tables are helpful in understanding the approach and the results.\nOriginality: 7/10\nThe paper builds on existing work, and the novelty of the approach is relatively thin. However, the proposal of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings is a significant contribution.\nSignificance: 8/10\nThe paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction. The approach has the potential to be applied in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and natural language processing."
