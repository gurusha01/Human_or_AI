            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The authors model the disease as an arbitrary finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate the possibility of external information that may trigger arrival of the patient to the clinician in advance of a scheduled screening appointment.\nThe paper's main strengths include its ability to handle complex disease models and external information processes, as well as its computational tractability. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a solution that is based on point-based value iteration, which is a well-established method in the field of decision theory. The experimental results on breast cancer data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant reductions in the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the model parameters are known, which may not be the case in practice. They do provide some discussion on the effect of estimation error, but more work is needed to fully address this issue. Additionally, the paper focuses on breast cancer, and it is not clear how well the approach will generalize to other diseases.\nIn terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies. The authors' approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve public health outcomes by reducing the number of unnecessary screenings while maintaining effective disease detection. The approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of diseases, and the authors' use of breast cancer as a case study demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.\nSome potential arguments for and against acceptance of the paper include:\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to personalized screening policies.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* The paper has the potential to improve public health outcomes.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the model parameters are known, which may not be the case in practice.\n* The approach may not generalize well to other diseases.\n* More work is needed to fully address the issue of estimation error.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies and has the potential to improve public health outcomes. While there are some limitations to the paper, I believe that it is a strong candidate for acceptance. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a well-motivated solution. However, there are some limitations to the paper, including the assumption that the model parameters are known and the focus on breast cancer.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results.\nOriginality: 9/10\nThe paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to personalized screening policies, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper has the potential to improve public health outcomes by reducing the number of unnecessary screenings while maintaining effective disease detection. The approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of diseases."
