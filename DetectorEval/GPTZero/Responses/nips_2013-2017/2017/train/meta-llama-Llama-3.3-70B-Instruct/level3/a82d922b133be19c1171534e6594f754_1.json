            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial learning scheme, specifically a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) framework. The authors introduce an intensity-free approach, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation of temporal point processes. Instead, they use a neural network-based model to transform a noise process into a point process, and train the model using the Wasserstein distance between the real and generated point processes.\nThe paper is well-written, polished, and technically sound, with no major issues found. The idea proposed in the paper appears to be novel and has significant potential. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed framework, including the definition of point processes, the Wasserstein distance, and the WGAN architecture. They also provide extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of their approach over conventional methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel intensity-free approach for modeling temporal point processes, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based models.\n* The use of a WGAN framework, which provides a more stable and efficient way of training generative models compared to traditional GANs.\n* The provision of extensive experiments on various datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The need for further clarification on the choice of the noise process and the prior knowledge about the problem domain.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes.\n* The need for further exploration of the connection between the WGAN framework and the optimal transport problem.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of temporal point processes and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. The proposed approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based models and provide a more accurate and efficient way of modeling complex point processes.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of temporal point processes.\n* The proposed approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based models.\n* The paper provides extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper may require further clarification on the choice of the noise process and the prior knowledge about the problem domain.\n* The paper may benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes.\n* The paper may require further exploration of the connection between the WGAN framework and the optimal transport problem."
