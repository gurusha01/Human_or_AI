            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of kernel methods on large datasets by introducing a preconditioning scheme called EigenPro. The authors identify a fundamental limitation in using gradient descent-based methods with smooth kernels, which leads to slow convergence and over-regularization. They demonstrate that the proposed EigenPro iteration can alleviate this issue by modifying the spectrum of the kernel matrix, allowing for faster convergence and improved accuracy.\nThe paper is well-structured and well-written, with a clear introduction to the problem and a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels and demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro through extensive experiments on various datasets.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution\n* A thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels\n* A well-designed and effective preconditioning scheme (EigenPro) that can be used with various kernel methods\n* Extensive experiments on various datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in kernel methods and optimization techniques, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between EigenPro and other related work in the field\n* Some of the experimental results could be improved with more detailed analysis and discussion\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a novel solution to a significant problem in the field. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the related work and provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective solution to a significant problem in the field\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro on various datasets\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in kernel methods and optimization techniques\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between EigenPro and other related work in the field\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of kernel methods and optimization techniques. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and propose an effective solution that can be used in practice. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a high-quality contribution to the conference."
