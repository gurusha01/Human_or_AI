The authors introduce the concept of adaptive testing, such as the multi-armed bandit problem, to tackle this issue. The paper is well-written, and the approach seems to solve the problems, making it a very interesting paper that could lead to a new avenue of research.\nThe paper's strengths include its ability to provide a general framework for obtaining `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators and its application to differential parameter estimation. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the concept of separability of loss functions and its connection to the sample complexity of the estimators.\nHowever, there are some minor concerns and areas for improvement. The paper lacks citations for well-known issues and relevant literature in biometrics, such as the survey by Villar, Bowden, and Wason. Additionally, the authors should describe how their concept differs from the concept of \"platform trials\" in biometrics.\nThere are also several minor errors, such as typos and grammatical mistakes, that need to be corrected. Furthermore, the paper lacks a clear explanation of the concept of \"truncation time\" and its introduction seems to have a significant impact on the results in Figure 2.\nThe motivation for the research is interesting, but its placement in the paper seems inappropriate and would be better suited in the introduction alongside other examples.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The approach is novel and differs from previous contributions, and the related work is adequately referenced.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the minor concerns and areas for improvement mentioned above.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to address the problem of continuous improvement using A/B tests while controlling the false discovery rate.\n* The approach seems to solve the problems, making it a very interesting paper that could lead to a new avenue of research.\n* The paper provides a general framework for obtaining `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators and its application to differential parameter estimation.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks citations for well-known issues and relevant literature in biometrics.\n* The authors should describe how their concept differs from the concept of \"platform trials\" in biometrics.\n* There are several minor errors, such as typos and grammatical mistakes, that need to be corrected.\n* The paper lacks a clear explanation of the concept of \"truncation time\" and its introduction seems to have a significant impact on the results in Figure 2."
