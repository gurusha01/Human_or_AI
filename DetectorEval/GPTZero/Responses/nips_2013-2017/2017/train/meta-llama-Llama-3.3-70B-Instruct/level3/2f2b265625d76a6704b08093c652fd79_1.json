            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN architecture consists of a lower hierarchical layer with multiple RNN cells that update their hidden states multiple times per time step, and a higher hierarchical layer with a single RNN cell that updates its hidden state only once per time step. The authors evaluate the FS-RNN on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, and achieve state-of-the-art results.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The introduction provides a good overview of the challenges of processing sequential data and the existing solutions. The related work section provides a thorough review of the relevant literature, and the authors clearly explain how their approach differs from previous work.\nThe technical contributions of the paper are significant. The authors propose a novel RNN architecture that incorporates the strengths of both multiscale and deep transition RNNs. They also provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics of the FS-RNN architecture and compare it to other RNN architectures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FS-RNN architecture in learning long-term dependencies and adapting to unexpected inputs.\nThe paper has several strengths. First, the proposed FS-RNN architecture is novel and has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in many applications. Second, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics of the FS-RNN architecture, which helps to understand how it works. Third, the experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the FS-RNN architecture in learning long-term dependencies and adapting to unexpected inputs.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in the paper. First, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other RNN architectures. While the authors compare the FS-RNN architecture with stacked-LSTM and sequential-LSTM architectures, more comparisons with other architectures, such as Clockwork RNNs and Recurrent Highway Networks, would be helpful. Second, the paper could benefit from more analysis of the computational complexity of the FS-RNN architecture. While the authors mention that the FS-RNN architecture is computationally efficient, more detailed analysis of the computational complexity would be helpful.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the main ideas and relate them to previous work. The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics of the FS-RNN architecture. The paper is also original, and the proposed FS-RNN architecture is novel. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other RNN architectures and more analysis of the computational complexity of the FS-RNN architecture.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel RNN architecture that incorporates the strengths of both multiscale and deep transition RNNs.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics of the FS-RNN architecture and compare it to other RNN architectures.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FS-RNN architecture in learning long-term dependencies and adapting to unexpected inputs.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other RNN architectures.\n* The paper could benefit from more analysis of the computational complexity of the FS-RNN architecture.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper.
