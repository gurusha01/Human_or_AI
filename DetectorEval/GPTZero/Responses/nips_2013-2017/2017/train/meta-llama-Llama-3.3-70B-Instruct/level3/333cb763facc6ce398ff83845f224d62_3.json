            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, where elements arrive in a streaming fashion and a subset of elements is removed after the stream is finished. The proposed algorithm, STAR-T, is based on a partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule, which allows it to retain a small but robust summary of the data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical analysis and experimental results on two data summarization tasks.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise description of their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed proof of their main result. The experimental results are also impressive, showing that the proposed algorithm compares favorably to existing methods, even when the latter are allowed to know the removed subset in advance.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance the trade-off between the size of the summary and the robustness of the algorithm. The authors show that their approach can achieve a constant-factor approximation guarantee while retaining a summary of size O((k + m log k) log k), which is a significant improvement over existing methods.\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. One potential issue is the lack of information on parameter learning and its potential challenges. The authors assume that the parameter √è is known, but in practice, this may not be the case. It would be interesting to see how the authors address this issue and provide a more detailed analysis of the parameter learning process.\nAnother potential area for improvement is the analysis of the algorithm's behavior with few training points. The authors assume that the number of training points is large, but in practice, this may not always be the case. It would be interesting to see how the authors analyze the algorithm's behavior in this setting and provide a more detailed analysis of its performance.\nMinor remarks include missing words in lines 74 and 140, and a request to specify the number of training points in the synthetic example in Section 4.1.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise description of their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental results are impressive. However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement, particularly with regards to parameter learning and the analysis of the algorithm's behavior with few training points.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting.\n* The proposed algorithm, STAR-T, is based on a partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule, which allows it to retain a small but robust summary of the data.\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical analysis and experimental results on two data summarization tasks.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise description of their approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The lack of information on parameter learning and its potential challenges.\n* The analysis of the algorithm's behavior with few training points is not provided.\n* Minor remarks include missing words in lines 74 and 140, and a request to specify the number of training points in the synthetic example in Section 4.1.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the potential weaknesses and areas for improvement."
