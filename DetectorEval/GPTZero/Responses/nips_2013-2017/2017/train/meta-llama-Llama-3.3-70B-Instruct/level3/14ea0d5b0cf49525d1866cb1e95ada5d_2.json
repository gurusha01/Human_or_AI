            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE), which aims to preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity in a network. The authors introduce a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that capture these two properties. The model is trained using a carefully designed objective function that combines the goals of preserving proximity and global node ranking.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow, with a good balance between mathematical derivations and intuitive explanations. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to network embedding that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking.\n* The introduction of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure that can jointly learn multiple objectives.\n* The provision of a clear and concise theoretical interpretation of the proposed objective function.\n* The thorough experimentation and evaluation of the proposed approach on various tasks and datasets.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.\n* The limited discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings.\n* The absence of a comparison with other state-of-the-art network embedding methods that preserve global node ranking.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods in various tasks. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and hyperparameter tuning process.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to network embedding that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking.\n* The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods in various tasks.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise theoretical interpretation of the proposed objective function.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.\n* The limited discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings.\n* The absence of a comparison with other state-of-the-art network embedding methods that preserve global node ranking.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
