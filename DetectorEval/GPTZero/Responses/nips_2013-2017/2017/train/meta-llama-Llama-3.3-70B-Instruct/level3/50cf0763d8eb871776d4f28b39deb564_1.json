            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the convergence rates of M-estimators for differential parameter estimation in generative and discriminative models. The authors introduce a novel concept of local separability, which measures how well a loss function behaves as separable, and use it to establish convergence rates for general M-estimators. The paper provides a thorough comparison of the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in both low and high-dimensional settings.\nThe strengths of the paper include its well-written and well-organized presentation, sound theoretical foundations, and instructive simulations. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and their notation is consistent throughout the paper. The theoretical results are rigorously derived, and the simulations effectively illustrate the theoretical findings.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper contains several minor errors and typos that need to be corrected. Additionally, some notation inconsistencies and undefined terms were noted, which may cause confusion for readers. The originality and implications of the results are not entirely clear, and the authors could provide more context and discussion on the significance of their findings.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, and their results are well-supported by theoretical and experimental evidence. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience. The significance of the results is evident, as they provide new insights into the convergence rates of M-estimators in generative and discriminative models.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and comprehensive analysis of the convergence rates of M-estimators in generative and discriminative models.\n* The authors introduce a new concept of local separability, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n* The paper provides a thorough comparison of the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in both low and high-dimensional settings.\n* The simulations effectively illustrate the theoretical findings and provide additional insights into the problem.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper contains several minor errors and typos that need to be corrected.\n* Some notation inconsistencies and undefined terms were noted, which may cause confusion for readers.\n* The originality and implications of the results are not entirely clear, and the authors could provide more context and discussion on the significance of their findings.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field.
