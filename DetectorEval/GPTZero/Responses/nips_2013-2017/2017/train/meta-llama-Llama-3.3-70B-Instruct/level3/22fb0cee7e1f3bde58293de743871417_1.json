The method is well-motivated, technically sound, and provides a thorough discussion of the mathematical basis of the algorithm. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DPSCREEN using a large breast cancer dataset, showing significant reductions in the number of screenings while maintaining the same delay in detection.\nThe paper's strengths include its ability to handle arbitrary finite state stochastic processes with an absorbing disease state, incorporating external information, and providing a computationally tractable solution.
