            "inputText": "This paper presents a thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent-based optimization methods when used in conjunction with smooth kernels, a common setting in machine learning. The authors identify a fundamental issue with the fast spectral decay of smooth kernels, which leads to slow convergence and over-regularization. They propose a novel approach, called EigenPro, which uses a preconditioned Richardson iteration to alleviate these issues. The preconditioner is computed efficiently from a subsample of the data and is compatible with stochastic gradient descent.\nThe paper is well-written and clear, with a detailed analysis of the limitations of gradient descent and the benefits of the proposed EigenPro approach. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro through extensive experiments on several large datasets. The results show that EigenPro can achieve significant acceleration and improved performance compared to state-of-the-art kernel methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and detailed analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels\n* A novel and effective approach to addressing these limitations, EigenPro\n* Extensive experiments demonstrating the benefits of EigenPro\n* A thorough discussion of related work and the advantages of EigenPro over existing methods\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach\n* Some of the notation and technical details may be challenging for non-experts to follow\n* The experimental results could be further strengthened by including more baselines and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the proposed EigenPro approach has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of kernel methods in a wide range of applications.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to addressing the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels\n* The analysis is thorough and well-supported by theoretical and experimental results\n* The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of kernel methods in a wide range of applications\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper may be challenging for non-experts to follow due to the technical notation and details\n* The experimental results could be further strengthened by including more baselines and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods\n* The potential applications and implications of the proposed approach could be further discussed and explored."
