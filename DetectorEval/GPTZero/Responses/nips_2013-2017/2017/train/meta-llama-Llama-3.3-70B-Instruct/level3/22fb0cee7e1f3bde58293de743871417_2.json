            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to personalized patient screening using a disease model as a finite state stochastic process. The goal is to minimize screening costs and delays while taking into account the patient's features and dynamic history. The proposed algorithm, DPSCREEN, is computationally efficient and shows promising results in reducing delays while keeping the same cost in experiments on simulated breast cancer data.\nThe paper is well-written, and the topic of personalized screening is important. The proposed algorithm is reasonable and well-developed, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. However, there are some limitations to the approach. One major limitation is that the algorithm assumes a known disease model, which is not practical. In reality, the disease model is often unknown and must be inferred from data, which is a significant obstacle.\nAnother limitation is that the methodological novelty of the paper is not significant, and the experiments are limited in scope. The paper only compares the proposed algorithm to a baseline and does not assess the robustness to inaccuracies in the disease model. Additionally, the paper's practical relevance is questionable due to the lack of consideration of uncertainties in the disease model and the assumption of a known model.\nThe paper's strengths include its ability to personalize screening policies to individual patients and its consideration of external information, such as self-examination or discovery of co-morbidities. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow. The significance of the paper is evident, as it addresses an important problem in personalized medicine.\nHowever, the paper could be improved by addressing the limitations mentioned above. Specifically, the authors could explore methods for inferring the disease model from data and assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm to inaccuracies in the disease model. Additionally, the authors could provide more comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in different scenarios.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to personalized patient screening.\n* The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and shows promising results in experiments.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The algorithm assumes a known disease model, which is not practical.\n* The methodological novelty of the paper is not significant.\n* The experiments are limited in scope and do not assess the robustness to inaccuracies in the disease model.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with revisions to address the limitations mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of personalized medicine, and with further development, it could have a significant impact on clinical practice."
