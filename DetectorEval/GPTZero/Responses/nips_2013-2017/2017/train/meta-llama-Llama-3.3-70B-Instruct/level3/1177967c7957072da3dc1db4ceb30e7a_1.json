            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the convergence of gradient descent-based optimization methods for shallow learning models, such as kernel methods. The authors identify a fundamental limitation of gradient descent when used with smooth kernels, which leads to slow convergence and over-regularization. To address this issue, they introduce EigenPro iteration, a preconditioned Richardson iteration that uses approximate second-order information to accelerate convergence.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent. The proposed EigenPro iteration is carefully motivated and described, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its convergence properties. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro in improving the convergence of gradient descent-based methods on several large-scale datasets.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution\n* A thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent and the benefits of EigenPro iteration\n* A detailed description of the EigenPro algorithm and its convergence properties\n* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of EigenPro on several large-scale datasets\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in machine learning and optimization, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow\n* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in optimization and linear algebra\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other related work in the area, such as other preconditioning methods or optimization algorithms\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and optimization, and I recommend accepting it for publication. However, I suggest that the authors address the minor errors and suggestions for improvement mentioned in the review, such as correcting the proof of Lemma 2.1 and adding a reference to a related paper.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to improving the convergence of gradient descent-based optimization methods\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent and the benefits of EigenPro iteration\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro on several large-scale datasets\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in machine learning and optimization, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other related work in the area\nQuality: 9/10\nClarity: 8.5/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nOverall score: 8.9/10\nI recommend accepting this paper for publication, pending minor revisions to address the errors and suggestions mentioned in the review."
