            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval. The key idea is to constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly, and use both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework. The authors derive an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, which keeps the discrete nature of the hash codes during the optimization process.\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear exposition of the theory and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work on hashing methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE, and the results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision (MAP).\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed method is novel and innovative, combining the strengths of deep learning and hashing methods.\n* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the method, including the derivation of the loss function and the optimization algorithm.\n* The experimental results are extensive and well-presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The method requires a large amount of training data to learn the hash function, which may be a limitation in some applications.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the method, which may be an important consideration in practice.\n* Some of the experimental results are based on a subset of the data, which may not be representative of the full dataset.\nOverall, the paper is of high quality and makes a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval. The proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted in practice, and the authors provide a clear and well-written presentation of the theory and experimental results.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative method that combines the strengths of deep learning and hashing methods.\n* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the method, including the derivation of the loss function and the optimization algorithm.\n* The experimental results are extensive and well-presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The method requires a large amount of training data to learn the hash function, which may be a limitation in some applications.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the method, which may be an important consideration in practice.\n* Some of the experimental results are based on a subset of the data, which may not be representative of the full dataset.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance.
