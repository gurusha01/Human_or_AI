            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), for solving the Quadratic Programming (QP) problem with doubly stochastic constraints, which is a fundamental problem in computer vision. The MPGM method provides a multiplicative update technique with a closed-form solution, guaranteeing convergence and directly integrating doubly stochastic constraints into the optimization process.\nThe paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence. The writing and organization of the paper are clear and neat, making it easy to follow and understand. The approach seems novel and offers a sufficient advance over the state-of-the-art in graph matching, a commonly known problem. The algorithm's guaranteed convergence is a significant advantage in solving the graph matching problem.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a new algorithm, MPGM, which provides a multiplicative update technique for the QP problem with doubly stochastic constraints.\n* Theoretical guarantees of convergence and KKT optimality, which are significant advantages in solving the graph matching problem.\n* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of MPGM on various matching tasks, including synthetic data, image sequence data, and real-world image data.\n* The ability of MPGM to generate sparse solutions, which approximately incorporates the discrete constraint in optimization naturally.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of theoretical analysis on the sparsity of MPGM solutions, which is an important aspect of the algorithm.\n* The need for further study on the adaptation of MPGM to solve other optimization problems with doubly stochastic constraints in machine learning and computer vision.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision, and the MPGM algorithm has the potential to be widely used in various applications. The paper is well-written, and the experimental results are convincing. However, further research is needed to fully understand the properties of the MPGM algorithm and its potential applications.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel algorithm with theoretical guarantees of convergence and KKT optimality.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MPGM on various matching tasks.\n* The algorithm has the potential to be widely used in various applications.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The lack of theoretical analysis on the sparsity of MPGM solutions.\n* The need for further study on the adaptation of MPGM to solve other optimization problems with doubly stochastic constraints.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
