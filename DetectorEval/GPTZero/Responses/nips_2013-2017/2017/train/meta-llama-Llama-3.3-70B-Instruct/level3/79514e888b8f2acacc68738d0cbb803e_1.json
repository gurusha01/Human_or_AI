The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based objective function to train the GAN, which is shown to be more effective in capturing the underlying distribution of the point process data.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The proposed framework, WGANTPP, is thoroughly explained, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in modeling various types of point processes, including synthetic and real-world data.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using a GAN framework, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based modeling.\n* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based objective function, which is shown to be more effective in capturing the underlying distribution of the point process data.\n* The thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, which demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling various types of point processes.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes.\n* The limited analysis of the proposed approach, which could be further explored to provide a deeper understanding of its strengths and limitations.\n* The potential for mode dropping, which is a common issue in GAN-based approaches, and the need for further investigation to mitigate this issue.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of temporal point process modeling, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using a GAN framework, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based modeling.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling various types of point processes.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The lack of a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes.\n* The limited analysis of the proposed approach, which could be further explored to provide a deeper understanding of its strengths and limitations.\n* The potential for mode dropping, which is a common issue in GAN-based approaches, and the need for further investigation to mitigate this issue.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 8/10\nSignificance: 8/10\nOverall, I would recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of temporal point process modeling, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. However, the authors should address the limitations and weaknesses of the paper, including the lack of a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and the potential for mode dropping."
