            "inputText": "This paper explores the effect of modifying the transaction-flooding protocol of the Bitcoin network to counter deanonymisation attacks. The authors model both the original and revised protocols, and claim that deanonymisation can be established with both protocols, supported by simulations. The representation of the transaction-flooding protocols is comprehensive, but the assumption that a supernode can connect to all active Bitcoin nodes may not be realistic in the future.\nThe paper's claim that both trickle and diffusion protocols perform equally well or badly at maintaining anonymity is not comprehensively answered, with simulations showing conflicting observations and discrepancies. The authors identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators, and find that despite having different maximum-likelihood estimators, trickle and diffusion exhibit roughly the same, poor anonymity properties.\nThe paper has some minor issues with incomplete sentences and unresolved references. However, the analysis of the protocols is thorough, and the use of simulations to validate the results is a strength. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work in the field of epidemic source detection.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The paper also presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the related work is adequately referenced.\nHowever, the paper could be improved by addressing the minor issues with incomplete sentences and unresolved references. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the protocols, including a discussion of the potential limitations and future work.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a thorough analysis of the transaction-flooding protocols in the Bitcoin network.\n* The paper identifies and analyzes near-optimal source estimators, and provides a good overview of the related work in the field of epidemic source detection.\n* The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper has some minor issues with incomplete sentences and unresolved references.\n* The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the protocols, including a discussion of the potential limitations and future work.\n* The simulations show conflicting observations and discrepancies, which could be clarified with additional analysis or experimentation."
