            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence classification using string kernels based on inexact matching of subsequences (k-mers). The authors derive a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers and develop a statistical estimate of the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences. The proposed algorithm efficiently approximates kernel matrices with probabilistic bounds on the accuracy, allowing for the use of larger values of k and m, which are known to yield better classification results.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical presentation is sound, although some parts of the proof, such as Lemma 7 and Theorem 8, could be clarified with more detailed explanations and notations. The numerical experiments are numerous and convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving state-of-the-art classification performance with significant speedups over existing solutions.\nHowever, there are some areas that require improvement. The authors should provide empirical evidence showing that the computational cost of their algorithm is of the same order of magnitude compared to competing methods. Additionally, the authors could benefit from providing a priori conditions to ensure that the sequence of iterates remains in a compact set and clarifying the meaning of certain equations and notations.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide sufficient background information and related work to make the paper accessible to a broad audience. The originality of the paper lies in the novel approach to sequence classification using string kernels and the development of a statistical estimate of the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences.\nThe significance of the paper is evident in its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in sequence classification, particularly in applications where large values of k and m are required. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and the results are likely to be of interest to practitioners and researchers in the field.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, pending minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence classification, and its publication would be a valuable addition to the conference proceedings.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence classification using string kernels.\n* The authors derive a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers.\n* The proposed algorithm efficiently approximates kernel matrices with probabilistic bounds on the accuracy.\n* The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving state-of-the-art classification performance.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some parts of the proof, such as Lemma 7 and Theorem 8, could be clarified with more detailed explanations and notations.\n* The authors should provide empirical evidence showing that the computational cost of their algorithm is of the same order of magnitude compared to competing methods.\n* The authors could benefit from providing a priori conditions to ensure that the sequence of iterates remains in a compact set and clarifying the meaning of certain equations and notations."
