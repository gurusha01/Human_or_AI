The authors provide a thorough analysis of the connection between the proposed proximity objective and link prediction, as well as community detection. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel objective function that combines global node ranking and community-aware proximity preservation, which is theoretically well-founded and empirically effective.\n* The use of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure, which allows for joint learning of multiple objectives and improves the performance of the model.\n* The provision of a thorough analysis of the connection between the proposed proximity objective and link prediction, as well as community detection, which sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of the model.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction, which shows the versatility and potential of the proposed approach.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of the theoretical foundations and empirical performance.\n* The choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers and the activation functions, could be further justified and explored.\n* The paper could provide more insights into the interpretability of the learned embeddings and the ranking scores, which would be useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the model.\n* The robustness of the model to noisy or missing data could be further evaluated and improved.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of network embedding and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. The proposed approach is well-founded, effective, and versatile, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the underlying mechanisms and empirical performance.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to network embedding that combines global node ranking and community-aware proximity preservation.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the connection between the proposed proximity objective and link prediction, as well as community detection.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The choice of hyperparameters could be further justified and explored.\n* The paper could provide more insights into the interpretability of the learned embeddings and the ranking scores.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 8/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions.
