            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, where elements arrive in a streaming fashion and a subset of elements is removed after the stream is finished. The authors propose a two-stage procedure, consisting of a streaming algorithm (STAR-T) that constructs a robust summary of the data, and a query stage algorithm (STAR-T-GREEDY) that runs on the remaining elements after removal. The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by providing a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the robust submodular function maximization problem.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the theoretical results. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two different data summarization tasks, including dominating set and personalized movie recommendation.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed algorithm (STAR-T) is novel and efficient, making one pass over the data and retaining a small set of elements in memory.\n* The theoretical analysis provides a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the robust submodular function maximization problem, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice, comparing favorably to existing algorithms that know in advance which elements will be removed.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the submodular function is normalized and monotone, which may not be the case in all applications.\n* The algorithm requires a parameter Ï , which depends on the unknown value f(OPT(k, V \\ E)), and the authors propose an approximation method to estimate this value.\n* The experimental evaluation is limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the algorithm on a wider range of datasets and applications.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization and streaming algorithms, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied in a wide range of applications.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm for robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting.\n* The theoretical analysis provides a constant-factor approximation guarantee, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the submodular function is normalized and monotone, which may not be the case in all applications.\n* The algorithm requires a parameter Ï , which depends on the unknown value f(OPT(k, V \\ E)), and the authors propose an approximation method to estimate this value.\n* The experimental evaluation is limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the algorithm on a wider range of datasets and applications.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
