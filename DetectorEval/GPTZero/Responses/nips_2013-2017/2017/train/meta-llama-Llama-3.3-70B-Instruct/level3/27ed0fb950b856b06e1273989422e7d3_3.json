            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, focusing on the transition from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading in 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under both trickle and diffusion propagation. The paper's technical contributions are significant, including the development of new estimators and the analysis of their performance on regular trees.\nThe paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the problem, its clear presentation of the results, and its discussion of the implications of the findings. The authors provide a detailed comparison of the performance of different estimators, including the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator, and they validate their results through simulations on a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. The writing is sometimes unclear, and there are several grammatical errors and typos throughout the text. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing work on epidemic source detection, as well as a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, although some sections could be improved for better readability. The paper's significance is high, as it addresses an important problem in the field of cryptocurrency and provides new insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem, including the development of new estimators and the analysis of their performance on regular trees.\n* The paper's results have significant implications for the design of more anonymous peer-to-peer networks.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper's writing could be improved for better clarity and readability.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing work on epidemic source detection.\n* The paper's discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach could be more thorough.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, as its technical contributions and significance outweigh its weaknesses. However, I suggest that the authors revise the paper to address the issues mentioned above, including improving the writing, adding more comparisons with existing work, and discussing the limitations of the proposed approach in more detail."
