            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors propose a hierarchical approximation of simple-route distributions, which allows for more scalable and tractable PSDDs. The key insight is to represent the distribution as a product of smaller distributions, each capturing routes within a region or across regions. This hierarchical representation enables the authors to control the size of the component PSDDs and guarantees a polynomial-size representation.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to PSDDs and their application to route distributions. The technical contributions are significant, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a route prediction task. The authors show that their PSDD-based approach outperforms both a naive baseline and a Markov model, especially when utilizing knowledge of the destination.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of representing and learning distributions over routes on a map\n* A novel and technically sound approach to hierarchical approximation of simple-route distributions\n* Strong experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach\n* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset, and it would be interesting to see how the approach performs on other datasets\n* The paper could provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned PSDDs and how they can be used to inform decision-making in real-world applications\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and machine learning, and I recommend it for acceptance. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides strong experimental results. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a lasting impact in the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\n* The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of probabilistic modeling and machine learning\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach\n* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset\n* The paper could provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned PSDDs and how they can be used to inform decision-making in real-world applications\nRating: 8/10\nConfidence: 0.8\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions."
