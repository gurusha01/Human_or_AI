            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to implicit probabilistic models, introducing hierarchical implicit models (HIMs) and likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI). The authors demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of their method through various applications, including a large-scale physical simulator, Bayesian generative adversarial networks, and a deep implicit model for sequence generation.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The authors provide a thorough introduction to implicit models, their limitations, and the motivation behind their work. The technical sections are detailed, and the notation is consistent throughout the paper.\nThe main contribution of the paper is the development of LFVI, which enables scalable and accurate inference in implicit models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments, showing that it outperforms traditional methods such as rejection ABC, MCMC-ABC, and SMC-ABC.\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to implicit models and their limitations, making the paper accessible to a broad audience. Secondly, the technical sections are well-organized, and the notation is consistent throughout the paper. Thirdly, the authors demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of their method through various applications, showcasing its potential impact on the field.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. Firstly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationship between HIMs and existing work on implicit models. While the authors mention some related work, a more thorough comparison with existing methods would strengthen the paper. Secondly, the experimental section could be more comprehensive, with more detailed comparisons with existing methods and a more thorough analysis of the results. Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed method, as well as potential avenues for future research.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the paper is well-organized. The paper presents a novel approach to implicit probabilistic models, and the authors demonstrate its potential impact on the field.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to implicit probabilistic models, introducing hierarchical implicit models (HIMs) and likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI).\n* The authors demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of their method through various applications, showcasing its potential impact on the field.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear, making it accessible to a broad audience.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationship between HIMs and existing work on implicit models.\n* The experimental section could be more comprehensive, with more detailed comparisons with existing methods and a more thorough analysis of the results.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed method, as well as potential avenues for future research.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a novel and impactful approach to implicit probabilistic models.
