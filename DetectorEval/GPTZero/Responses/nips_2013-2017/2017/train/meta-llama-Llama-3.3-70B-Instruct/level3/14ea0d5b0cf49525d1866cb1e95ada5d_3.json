The authors propose a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings, which is trained using a carefully designed objective function that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of network embedding and the motivations behind their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their model, including the objective function, the neural network architecture, and the training procedure.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors propose a novel approach to network embedding that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking, which is a unique contribution to the field.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of network embedding and the motivations behind the proposed approach.\n* The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their model, including the objective function, the neural network architecture, and the training procedure.\n* The authors provide an extensive evaluation of their model on several real-world datasets, including Hep-Ph, Webspam, and FB Wall Post, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction tasks.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the global node ranking is available, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to see how the authors' approach could be modified to handle cases where the global node ranking is not available.\n* The paper uses a simple neural network architecture, which may not be sufficient to capture complex relationships between nodes in large-scale networks. It would be interesting to see how the authors' approach could be extended to more complex neural network architectures.\n* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach, which is an important consideration in practice.\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to network embedding, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their model and its evaluation. The paper is well-suited for publication in a top-tier conference such as NIPS.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to network embedding that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of network embedding and the motivations behind the proposed approach.\n* The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their model, including the objective function, the neural network architecture, and the training procedure.\n* The authors provide an extensive evaluation of their model on several real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction tasks.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the global node ranking is available, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The paper uses a simple neural network architecture, which may not be sufficient to capture complex relationships between nodes in large-scale networks.\n* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach, which is an important consideration in practice."
