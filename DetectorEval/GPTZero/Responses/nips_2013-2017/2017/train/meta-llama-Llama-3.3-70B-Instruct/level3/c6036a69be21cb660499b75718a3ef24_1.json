            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), for solving the Quadratic Programming (QP) matching problem with doubly stochastic and discrete constraints. The authors propose a multiplicative update technique to solve the QP problem directly, which is shown to be theoretically sound and empirically effective. The algorithm is simple to implement and has a low computational complexity.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the ideas are well-explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPGM algorithm in various matching tasks, including synthetic data, image sequence data, and real-world image data. The results show that MPGM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective score and matching accuracy.\nHowever, there are some areas that need improvement. The introduction could be more concise and respectful, avoiding unnecessary and pretentious sentences. The authors should also acknowledge previous work on multi-step decoding, particularly in speech recognition, and discuss how their work differs from and builds upon existing research.\nThe technical details of the algorithm, such as the derivation of the update rule and the proof of convergence, are well-explained. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time complexity and the scalability of the algorithm.\nThe experimental results are thorough and well-presented, but it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other methods and to discuss the limitations of the MPGM algorithm. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and future directions of the research.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graph matching and QP optimization. The MPGM algorithm is a novel and effective approach that has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper could be even stronger.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel and effective algorithm for solving the QP matching problem.\n* The algorithm is simple to implement and has a low computational complexity.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPGM algorithm in various matching tasks.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the ideas are well-explained.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The introduction could be more concise and respectful.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time complexity and scalability of the algorithm.\n* The experimental results could be more comprehensive, with more comparisons with other methods.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and future directions of the research."
