            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to efficiently estimate the pairwise similarity score for sequence classification, enabling the use of larger values of k and m, and achieving higher predictive accuracy. The authors develop a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers and propose a statistical estimate of the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation. The use of a trie-based strategy to implicitly compute kernel values is a good approach, and the introduction of a (k,m)-mismatch tree is a useful concept.\nHowever, I have some concerns regarding the necessity of explicitly generating K posterior mean/variances in the encoder. The authors could explore directly generating them, which might be more efficient. Additionally, the use of VAE might be unnecessary for conditional caption generation, and a maximum-likelihood approach could be a simpler alternative.\nI would like to see more clarification on how the KL-divergence was computed for GMM-CVAE, as the specific method used is not clearly explained. Furthermore, it would be interesting to know if the authors experimented with different values for the standard deviations in the prior during training and if they used the same values for both training and testing.\nThere is a typo on line 36, where \"upper bound\" should be replaced with \"lower bound\" to correctly describe the maximization of the likelihood.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-structured explanation of the problem and the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation is thorough and well-presented.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to efficiently estimate the pairwise similarity score for sequence classification.\n* The authors provide a clear and well-structured explanation of the problem and the proposed solution.\n* The experimental evaluation is thorough and well-presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The necessity of explicitly generating K posterior mean/variances in the encoder is questionable.\n* The use of VAE might be unnecessary for conditional caption generation.\n* The computation of KL-divergence for GMM-CVAE is not clearly explained.\n* There is a typo on line 36.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a novel and effective approach to sequence classification, and the authors provide a clear and well-structured explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. However, the authors should address the concerns mentioned above to improve the paper."
