            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval. The key idea is to constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly and use both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework. The authors derive an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, which keeps the discrete nature of the hash codes during the optimization process.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized. The authors provide a thorough review of existing hashing methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches. The proposed method is motivated by the limitations of previous deep hashing methods, which do not fully exploit the semantic information.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed method is novel and has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in image retrieval.\n* The authors provide a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.\n* The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses:\n* The paper lacks a simple baseline to compare the performance of the proposed method with other deep hashing methods.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is an important consideration for large-scale image retrieval applications.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.\nThe clarity of the paper is good, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The authors provide sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.\nThe originality of the paper is high, as the proposed method is novel and has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in image retrieval. The paper provides a unique combination of pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework.\nThe significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in image retrieval and provides a novel solution that has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art. The paper provides a unique perspective on how to learn hash codes for image retrieval and has the potential to inspire future research in this area.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a novel and significant contribution to the field of image retrieval. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a simple baseline and a detailed analysis of the computational complexity, to further improve the paper. \nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of image retrieval.\n* The experimental evaluation is thorough and shows that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks a simple baseline to compare the performance of the proposed method with other deep hashing methods.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research."
