            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, where elements arrive in a streaming fashion and a subset of elements is removed after the stream is finished. The authors develop a two-stage procedure, consisting of a streaming algorithm STAR-T and a query-stage algorithm STAR-T-GREEDY, which achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the robust submodular function maximization problem.\nThe paper is technically sound, well-motivated, and builds on sound foundations. The authors provide a clear exposition of the problem, the proposed approach, and the theoretical analysis. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.\nThe approach has the potential benefit of task-based learning, as it can be used to solve a variety of data summarization tasks, such as image and document summarization, influence maximization, and personalized movie recommendation. However, it also raises concerns about model overfitting to the specific task and generalizability to different tasks.\nThe paper could be improved by referencing related work, such as meta-learning, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach and its connections to existing research. Additionally, the authors could provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting\n* A clear and concise exposition of the problem and the proposed approach\n* A thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed approach\n* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* Limited discussion of related work, such as meta-learning\n* Limited experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios\n* Concerns about model overfitting to the specific task and generalizability to different tasks\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting and provides a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting\n* The paper provides a clear and concise exposition of the problem and the proposed approach\n* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed approach\n* The paper provides experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios\nArguments against acceptance:\n* Limited discussion of related work, such as meta-learning\n* Limited experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios\n* Concerns about model overfitting to the specific task and generalizability to different tasks\nRating: 8/10\nConfidence: 0.8\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions."
