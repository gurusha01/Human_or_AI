            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The authors model the disease as an arbitrary finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate the possibility of external information that may trigger arrival of the patient to the clinician in advance of a scheduled screening appointment.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the work and explains the importance of personalized screening policies. The model and problem formulation are thoroughly described, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the construction of the exactly optimal policy and the approximately optimal policy using point-based value iteration.\nThe paper's strengths include its ability to handle arbitrary finite state stochastic processes and its incorporation of external information, which makes it more realistic and applicable to real-world scenarios. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the approximation error and robustness of the proposed approach, which is essential for evaluating its performance.\nOne of the weaknesses of the paper is that it relies on a number of assumptions, such as the independence of the current test result from past test results and external information, which may not always hold in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and more detailed analyses of the results.\nIn terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to personalized screening policy construction, which is distinct from existing methods in the literature. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from previous work and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental evaluations.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the effectiveness of screening policies and reduce the cost of screening while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their approach to breast cancer screening and provide promising results, which could have a significant impact on public health.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a well-written and well-organized contribution to the field of personalized screening policy construction. The paper's strengths, including its ability to handle arbitrary finite state stochastic processes and its incorporation of external information, make it a valuable addition to the literature.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to personalized screening policy construction.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the approximation error and robustness of the proposed approach.\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experimental evaluations.\n* The approach has the potential to improve the effectiveness of screening policies and reduce the cost of screening.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper relies on a number of assumptions that may not always hold in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The paper may require additional revisions to address minor issues with clarity and organization."
