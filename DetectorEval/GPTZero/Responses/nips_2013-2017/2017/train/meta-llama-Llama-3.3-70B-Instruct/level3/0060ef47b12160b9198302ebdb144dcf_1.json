            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to learning distributions over routes on a map using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors introduce the concept of hierarchical route distributions, which allows for a more tractable and scalable representation of route distributions. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in a route prediction task, showing significant improvements in accuracy compared to Markov models.\nThe strengths of the paper include its originality and significance. The proposed approach addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and the results have important implications for applications such as traffic prediction and route planning. The paper is also well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and limitations to the paper. One limitation is that the approach relies on a hierarchical representation of the map, which may not always be available or easy to obtain. Additionally, the paper assumes that the routes are simple and do not contain loops, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. The paper also lacks a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, which would be useful to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach and its underlying mathematics. The experimental results are also convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in a real-world scenario.\nThe clarity of the paper is also good, with clear and concise writing and well-organized sections. The authors provide a good introduction to the background and motivation of the paper, and the technical sections are well-explained and easy to follow.\nThe originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to learning distributions over routes on a map. The paper also builds on previous work in the area, demonstrating a good understanding of the existing literature and its limitations.\nThe significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results have important implications for applications such as traffic prediction and route planning, and the paper demonstrates the potential for significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field and demonstrates a high level of technical quality and originality. However, I would suggest that the authors address some of the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a more thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and discussing the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach in more detail.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to learning distributions over routes on a map.\n* The approach is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\n* The paper demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to Markov models.\n* The results have important implications for applications such as traffic prediction and route planning.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The approach relies on a hierarchical representation of the map, which may not always be available or easy to obtain.\n* The paper assumes that the routes are simple and do not contain loops, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios.\n* The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The potential applications and implications of the proposed approach are not fully discussed."
