            "inputText": "This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of kernel methods and gradient descent optimization. The authors identify a fundamental limitation in using gradient descent-based methods with smooth kernels, which can lead to slow convergence and over-regularization. To address this issue, they propose a novel preconditioning scheme called EigenPro, which modifies the gradient descent iteration to incorporate approximate second-order information.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels. Theoretical results are presented, including the characterization of the computational reach of kernel methods and the convergence properties of EigenPro. The authors also provide an extensive experimental evaluation of EigenPro, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the convergence rate and accuracy of kernel methods on various large-scale datasets.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n1. Novel contribution: The authors propose a new preconditioning scheme, EigenPro, which addresses a significant limitation in kernel methods.\n2. Theoretical analysis: The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels and the convergence properties of EigenPro.\n3. Experimental evaluation: The authors conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of EigenPro, demonstrating its effectiveness on various large-scale datasets.\n4. Comparison to state-of-the-art: The paper compares EigenPro to existing state-of-the-art methods, showing that it can improve or match their performance at a lower computational budget.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n1. Complexity: The paper assumes a strong background in machine learning, optimization, and linear algebra, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.\n2. Limited scope: The paper focuses primarily on kernel methods and gradient descent optimization, which may limit its applicability to other areas of machine learning.\n3. Computational cost: While EigenPro is designed to be efficient, its computational cost may still be significant for very large datasets.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and its results have the potential to impact the development of more efficient and effective kernel methods. The authors' use of theoretical analysis, experimental evaluation, and comparison to state-of-the-art methods demonstrates a thorough understanding of the subject matter and provides a strong foundation for their contributions.\nArguments for acceptance:\n1. The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of machine learning.\n2. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of their proposed method.\n3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EigenPro in improving the convergence rate and accuracy of kernel methods on various large-scale datasets.\nArguments against acceptance:\n1. The paper assumes a strong background in machine learning, optimization, and linear algebra, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts.\n2. The computational cost of EigenPro may still be significant for very large datasets.\n3. The paper's focus on kernel methods and gradient descent optimization may limit its applicability to other areas of machine learning.\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to improve clarity and accessibility for non-experts."
