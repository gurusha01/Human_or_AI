            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN architecture consists of a lower hierarchical layer with multiple sequentially connected RNN cells (Fast cells) and a higher hierarchical layer with a single RNN cell (Slow cell). The Fast cells update their hidden states multiple times per time step, while the Slow cell updates its hidden state only once per time step. This architecture allows the FS-RNN to learn complex transition functions from one time step to the next and to capture long-term dependencies efficiently.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the FS-RNN architecture, including its motivation, related work, and technical details. The authors also provide an empirical analysis of the FS-RNN's performance on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, the authors provide a comparison of the network dynamics of the FS-RNN with other RNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to learn long-term dependencies and adapt quickly to unexpected inputs.\nThe strengths of this paper include its clear and concise writing style, its well-organized structure, and its thorough evaluation of the proposed architecture. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the FS-RNN's performance and its comparison with other RNN architectures. The paper's contributions are significant, as it proposes a novel RNN architecture that improves state-of-the-art results on character-level language modeling tasks.\nHowever, there are some minor weaknesses in the paper. For example, some of the figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and readability. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed explanations of some of the technical details, such as the update rules of the FS-RNN architecture. Furthermore, the authors could consider running experiments with different confidence parameters to enhance the clarity and readability of the results.\nOverall, this paper is well-written, and its contributions are significant. The proposed FS-RNN architecture has the potential to improve performance in many different applications, and its flexibility in applying the architecture to different tasks is a major advantage. I would recommend accepting this paper, with some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel RNN architecture that combines the strengths of multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs.\n* The FS-RNN architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on character-level language modeling tasks.\n* The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the FS-RNN architecture and its technical details.\n* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed architecture and its comparison with other RNN architectures.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some of the figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and readability.\n* The authors could provide more detailed explanations of some of the technical details.\n* The authors could consider running experiments with different confidence parameters to enhance the clarity and readability of the results."
