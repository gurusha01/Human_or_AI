The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical foundations of their approach, demonstrating that deterministic feature maps can achieve better scaling in the desired accuracy compared to random Fourier features. The paper is well-written, and the authors have done an excellent job of explaining the key concepts and ideas.\nThe paper's main strengths lie in its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors have successfully established solid theoretical results for deterministic quadrature alternatives to random Fourier features, which is a notable achievement. The experimental results on MNIST and TIMIT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that deterministic feature maps can produce comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods based on random Fourier features.\nOne potential area for improvement is the assessment of Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods on page 2. The authors mention that QMC methods have an asymptotic error of O(D^{-1} (log(D))^d), which is better than random Fourier features. However, it would be interesting to investigate whether higher-order QMC methods could outperform the proposed approach.\nAdditionally, there are a few minor corrections that could be made to improve the paper's clarity. For example, the authors could use \"\\top\" for transpose in LaTeX and define the Cartesian basis e_i before it is used. Furthermore, the comparison to Random Fourier Features (RFF) on page 4 could be tempered, as more assumptions are made to get the novel result.\nFinally, it would be helpful to define \\tilde{\\Omega} in section 4 for clarity. Overall, however, the paper is excellent, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field of kernel methods.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of kernel methods.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical foundations of their approach.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors have done an excellent job of explaining the key concepts and ideas.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assessment of QMC methods could be more thorough.\n* There are a few minor corrections that could be made to improve the paper's clarity.\n* The comparison to RFF could be tempered, as more assumptions are made to get the novel result.\n* \\tilde{\\Omega} could be defined in section 4 for clarity."
