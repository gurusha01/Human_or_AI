            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to reducing the variance of gradient estimates in variational inference, specifically in the context of reparameterized gradient estimators. The authors propose a simple yet effective method to eliminate the score function term from the gradient estimate, which can significantly reduce the variance of the estimator. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including its theoretical foundations, implementation details, and empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its underlying principles. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the variance of gradient estimates. The paper also provides a detailed comparison with existing methods, including the standard reparameterized gradient estimator and other variance reduction techniques.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed method is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing variational inference frameworks.\n* The method is applicable to a wide range of variational distributions, including Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions.\n* The empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of gradient estimates, particularly in cases where the approximate posterior is complex.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The proposed method may not be effective in cases where the score function term is positively correlated with the remaining terms in the gradient estimate.\n* The method requires the use of automatic differentiation software packages, which may not be readily available in all programming environments.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with the proposed method, particularly in comparison to existing methods.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of variational inference, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gradient-based optimization algorithms in a wide range of applications.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective method for reducing the variance of gradient estimates in variational inference.\n* The method is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing frameworks.\n* The empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of gradient estimates.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The method may not be effective in cases where the score function term is positively correlated with the remaining terms in the gradient estimate.\n* The method requires the use of automatic differentiation software packages, which may not be readily available in all programming environments.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with the proposed method."
