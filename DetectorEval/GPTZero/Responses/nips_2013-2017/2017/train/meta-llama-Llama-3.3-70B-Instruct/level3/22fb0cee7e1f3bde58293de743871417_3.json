            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN architecture consists of a lower hierarchical layer with multiple RNN cells that update their hidden states multiple times per time step, and a higher hierarchical layer with a single RNN cell that updates its hidden state only once per time step. This architecture allows the model to learn complex transition functions from one time step to the next, while also capturing long-term dependencies.\nThe paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the FS-RNN architecture on two character-level language modeling tasks, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. The authors also provide an empirical analysis of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN, which shows that it incorporates the benefits of both deep transition RNNs and multiscale RNNs.\nThe strengths of this paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough evaluation of the proposed architecture, and its comparison to other related work in the field. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the network dynamics of the FS-RNN, which helps to understand how it works and why it is effective.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is that it does not provide a more detailed comparison to other related architectures, such as the Clockwork RNN or the Hierarchical Multiscale RNN. Additionally, the authors could have provided more insight into the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of RNNs and language modeling, and it has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in this area.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective RNN architecture that combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs.\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on two challenging language modeling tasks.\n* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed architecture, including a detailed analysis of the network dynamics.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other related architectures.\n* The authors could have provided more insight into the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings.\n* The paper may not be suitable for readers who are not familiar with RNNs and language modeling, as it assumes a certain level of background knowledge in these areas."
