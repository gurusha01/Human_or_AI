            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to nonparametric regression by introducing group-additive nonparametric regression models, where the regression function is additive between groups of variables. The authors develop a comprehensive method, including theoretical and empirical results, which is a potentially significant advance in fitting models between additive and nonparametric models. The key innovation of the paper is recognizing that the complexity of a group structure can be quantified in terms of covering numbers of the direct sum space, allowing for optimization over both group structure and regression estimate.\nThe paper presents two algorithms for approximately solving the compound optimization problem and provides theoretical results on the rate of convergence and consistency of the group structure estimate. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing its ability to handle complex data sets and providing a well-motivated and novel approach to nonparametric regression.\nThe strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their method, including a comprehensive introduction to the background and related work. The paper is well-written, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.\nHowever, the main issue with the method is the difficulty in solving the optimization problem over group structure when the number of variables is large. The paper could benefit from clearer writing and correction of typos. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more detailed comparisons with existing methods and exploring the applicability of their approach to other domains.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to nonparametric regression.\n* The method is technically sound and well-motivated.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n* The paper is well-written and clear.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The optimization problem over group structure can be challenging to solve when the number of variables is large.\n* The paper could benefit from clearer writing and correction of typos.\n* More detailed comparisons with existing methods would be beneficial.\n* The applicability of the approach to other domains is not fully explored.\nOverall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric regression, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the issues mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a high-quality publication."
