            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, focusing on the change from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading in 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under both trickle and diffusion propagation. The paper's main contributions are threefold: modeling the Bitcoin P2P network and an eavesdropper adversary, analyzing the probability of deanonymization under trickle propagation, and analyzing the probability of deanonymization under diffusion propagation.\nThe paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the problem, its use of theoretical tools such as nonlinear differential equations and generalized PÃ²lya urns, and its simulation results on regular trees and a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes a regular tree-structured network, which may not accurately represent the real Bitcoin network topology. The authors acknowledge this limitation and simulate their protocols on a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network, but more work could be done to analyze the effects of graph irregularity. Additionally, the paper focuses on the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator, but other estimators could be considered in future work.\nThe paper's quality is high, with a clear and well-organized presentation, thorough analysis, and simulation results that support the authors' claims. The paper is also original, as it proposes a new approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. The significance of the paper is also high, as it provides insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's network and highlights the need for further research in this area.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, making it original and significant.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem, using theoretical tools such as nonlinear differential equations and generalized PÃ²lya urns.\n* The paper includes simulation results on regular trees and a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network, which support the authors' claims.\n* The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a regular tree-structured network, which may not accurately represent the real Bitcoin network topology.\n* The paper focuses on the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator, but other estimators could be considered in future work.\n* The paper could benefit from more analysis of the effects of graph irregularity on the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's network."
