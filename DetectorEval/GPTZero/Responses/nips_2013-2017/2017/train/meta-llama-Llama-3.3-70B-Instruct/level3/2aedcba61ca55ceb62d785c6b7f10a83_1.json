The clarity of the paper is good, with well-organized sections and clear explanations of the proposed methods. However, the originality of the paper is difficult to assess due to the poor related work discussion. The significance of the paper is also limited by the lack of comprehensive experiments and comparisons to other methods.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel theoretical treatment of kernel regression in high-dimensional settings.\n* The authors provide a formal treatment of the setting and algorithms for finding optimal groupings.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The related work discussion is lacking, making it difficult to determine the novelty of the paper.\n* The experimental results are limited, lacking baselines and comparisons to other methods.\n* The optimization methods are disappointing due to the complexity measure not being easily optimizable.\nOverall, while the paper has some positive aspects, the limitations in related work discussion, experimental results, and optimization methods outweigh the benefits, making it a borderline paper. With improvements in these areas, the paper could be more competitive."
