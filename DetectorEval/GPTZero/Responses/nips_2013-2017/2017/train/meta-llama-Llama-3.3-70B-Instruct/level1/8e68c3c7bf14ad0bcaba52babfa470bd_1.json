            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating human feedback into reinforcement learning (RL) for image captioning tasks. The authors argue that natural language feedback can provide a stronger learning signal than numeric rewards, as it can point to specific mistakes and suggest corrections. The paper presents a hierarchical phrase-based RNN captioning model that can be integrated with human feedback, and a feedback network that provides rewards to the learner based on the feedback.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that it outperforms baseline RL models and achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO dataset.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to incorporating human feedback into RL, which has the potential to improve the performance of RL agents in a variety of tasks.\n* The design of a hierarchical phrase-based RNN captioning model that can be integrated with human feedback, which is a significant contribution to the field of image captioning.\n* The thorough evaluation of the proposed method, which demonstrates its effectiveness and provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The reliance on a large amount of human-annotated data, which may be time-consuming and expensive to collect.\n* The potential for annotator noise and bias in the feedback data, which may affect the performance of the proposed method.\n* The limited scope of the paper, which focuses on image captioning tasks and may not be directly applicable to other RL tasks.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of RL and image captioning. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of RL agents and provide a more natural and intuitive way of interacting with humans.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to incorporating human feedback into RL.\n* The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO dataset.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed explanation of the proposed approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The reliance on a large amount of human-annotated data may be a limitation of the proposed method.\n* The potential for annotator noise and bias in the feedback data may affect the performance of the proposed method.\n* The limited scope of the paper may limit its applicability to other RL tasks.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 8/10\nOverall score: 8.5/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of RL and image captioning. However, the authors should address the limitations of the proposed method and provide more insights into its potential applications and extensions."
