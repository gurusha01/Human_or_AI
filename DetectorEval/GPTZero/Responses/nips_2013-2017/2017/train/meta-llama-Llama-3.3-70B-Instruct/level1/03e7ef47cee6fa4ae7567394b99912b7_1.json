            "inputText": "This paper presents a rigorous theoretical study of interactive clustering with side information, where an oracle provides pair-wise queries to aid in clustering. The authors provide strong information-theoretic lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds on the query complexity of clustering with side information. The main contribution of the paper is to show that the presence of side information, in the form of a similarity matrix, can drastically reduce the query complexity of clustering from Î˜(nk) to O(k^2 logn H^2(f+ f )), where H^2(f+ f ) is the squared Hellinger divergence between the probability distributions f+ and f .\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the query complexity of clustering with side information. The paper also includes experimental results on a real-world dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the query complexity of clustering with side information, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The authors propose two computationally efficient algorithms that match the query complexity lower bound within a log n factor and are completely parameter-free.\n* The paper includes experimental results on a real-world dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the oracle always returns the correct answer, which may not be the case in practice.\n* The paper does not consider the case where the similarity matrix is noisy or incomplete.\n* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing algorithms for clustering with side information.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of related work. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of clustering with side information.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the query complexity of clustering with side information.\n* The authors propose two computationally efficient algorithms that match the query complexity lower bound within a log n factor and are completely parameter-free.\n* The paper includes experimental results on a real-world dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the oracle always returns the correct answer, which may not be the case in practice.\n* The paper does not consider the case where the similarity matrix is noisy or incomplete.\n* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing algorithms for clustering with side information.\nRecommendation: Accept.
