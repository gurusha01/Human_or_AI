The resulting Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between channels in terms of frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough background on MOGPs, spectral mixture kernels, and CramÃ©r's Theorem. The proposed MOSM kernel is carefully derived, and its properties are thoroughly analyzed. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including a synthetic example and two real-world datasets, and demonstrates the competitiveness of the MOSM kernel against existing MOGP models.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel and principled approach to modeling MOGPs, which provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between channels.\n* The thorough derivation and analysis of the MOSM kernel, which demonstrates its properties and advantages.\n* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the MOSM kernel against existing MOGP models.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it challenging to implement and compute, particularly for large datasets.\n* The limited comparison to other MOGP models, which may not provide a complete picture of the MOSM kernel's performance.\n* The lack of discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach, which may limit its impact and relevance to the broader research community.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and principled approach to modeling MOGPs, which provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between channels.\n* The experimental evaluation demonstrates the competitiveness of the MOSM kernel against existing MOGP models.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough background and analysis of the proposed approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The complexity of the proposed approach may make it challenging to implement and compute, particularly for large datasets.\n* The limited comparison to other MOGP models may not provide a complete picture of the MOSM kernel's performance.\n* The lack of discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach may limit its impact and relevance to the broader research community.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and principled approach to modeling MOGPs, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates its competitiveness against existing MOGP models. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and limitations of the paper, particularly the complexity of the proposed approach and the limited comparison to other MOGP models."
