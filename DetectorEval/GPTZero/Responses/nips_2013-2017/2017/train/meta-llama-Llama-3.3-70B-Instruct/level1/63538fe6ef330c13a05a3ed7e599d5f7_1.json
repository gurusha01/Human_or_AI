            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel formulation of non-negative matching pursuit (NNMP) algorithms for optimization over the convex cone, parametrized as the conic hull of a generic atom set. The authors provide a comprehensive convergence analysis, including sublinear and linear convergence rates, for the proposed algorithms. The paper also introduces corrective variants with linear convergence guarantees, which are verified through numerical applications.\nThe main ideas of the paper are related to previous work on matching pursuit (MP) and Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms, which have regained popularity in recent years due to their simplicity, effectiveness, and theoretical guarantees. The authors address the intermediate case of optimization over the convex cone, which is not covered by existing MP and FW algorithms.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel formulation of NNMP algorithms, which is the first principled definition of non-negative MP algorithms with explicit convergence rates.\n* The provision of a comprehensive convergence analysis, including sublinear and linear convergence rates, for the proposed algorithms.\n* The introduction of corrective variants with linear convergence guarantees, which are verified through numerical applications.\n* The demonstration of the excellent empirical performance of the proposed algorithms in various applications, including synthetic data, non-negative matrix factorization, and non-negative garrote.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption that the atom set is bounded, which may not be satisfied in all applications.\n* The use of approximate linear minimization oracles, which may not be efficient in practice.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as projected gradient descent with alternating minimization.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel formulation of NNMP algorithms with explicit convergence rates, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The comprehensive convergence analysis provides a thorough understanding of the proposed algorithms.\n* The introduction of corrective variants with linear convergence guarantees is a significant improvement over existing algorithms.\n* The numerical applications demonstrate the excellent empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption that the atom set is bounded may limit the applicability of the proposed algorithms.\n* The use of approximate linear minimization oracles may not be efficient in practice.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms may make it difficult to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of optimization over convex cones, and the proposed algorithms have the potential to be widely applicable in various fields, including signal processing and machine learning. However, the limitations of the paper, such as the assumption of bounded atom sets and the use of approximate linear minimization oracles, should be carefully considered."
