The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The paper provides a thorough review of the background and related work, and presents a clear and well-structured methodology.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a new and innovative approach for modeling temporal point processes, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.\n* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based metric, which provides a more robust and stable way to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes.\n* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it difficult to implement and interpret for practitioners without a strong background in GANs and point processes.\n* The lack of a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes, which makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.\n* The limited discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach, which may limit its impact and relevance to a broader audience.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach for modeling temporal point processes, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n* The paper provides a thorough review of the background and related work, and presents a clear and well-structured methodology.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The complexity of the proposed approach may make it difficult to implement and interpret for practitioners without a strong background in GANs and point processes.\n* The lack of a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes may limit the evaluation of the performance of the proposed approach.\n* The limited discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach may limit its impact and relevance to a broader audience.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and innovative approach for modeling temporal point processes, and demonstrates its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets. However, I would suggest that the authors provide a clearer comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, and discuss the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach in more detail."
