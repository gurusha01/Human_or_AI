            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization, by introducing a deliberation process into the encoder-decoder framework. The authors argue that the traditional one-pass decoding process lacks the ability to refine and polish the generated sequence, which is a common behavior in human cognition. To address this, they propose a deliberation network that consists of two decoders: a first-pass decoder that generates a raw sequence, and a second-pass decoder that refines and polishes the raw sequence.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and architecture of the deliberation network. The authors provide a detailed description of the model, including the encoder, first-pass decoder, and second-pass decoder, as well as the optimization algorithm used to train the model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network on two sequence generation tasks: neural machine translation and text summarization.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a novel approach to sequence generation tasks that addresses the limitation of traditional one-pass decoding processes.\n* The clear and detailed explanation of the deliberation network architecture and optimization algorithm.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network on two sequence generation tasks.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the encoder-decoder framework and sequence generation tasks, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the deliberation network.\n* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other related work, such as post-editing and review networks, which could help to better understand the contributions of the deliberation network.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks that addresses a significant limitation of traditional one-pass decoding processes.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network on two sequence generation tasks.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and architecture of the deliberation network.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the encoder-decoder framework and sequence generation tasks, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the deliberation network.\n* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other related work, such as post-editing and review networks, which could help to better understand the contributions of the deliberation network.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is well-written and proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network, and the paper is a good contribution to the field. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results and a clear comparison with other related work. I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address these issues."
