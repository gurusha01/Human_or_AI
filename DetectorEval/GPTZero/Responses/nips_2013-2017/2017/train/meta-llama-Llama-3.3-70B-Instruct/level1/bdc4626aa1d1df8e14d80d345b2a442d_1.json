            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to ensuring safety in contextual linear bandits, which is a crucial aspect of deploying learning algorithms in real-world decision-making problems. The authors formulate a conservative linear bandit problem, where the performance of the learning algorithm is constrained to be at least as good as a fraction of the performance of a baseline policy. They propose a conservative version of the linear UCB algorithm, called CLUCB, which satisfies the safety constraint with high probability while achieving a regret bound equivalent to that of LUCB up to an additive time-independent constant.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their approach. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and proofs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and provide insights into its behavior.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors address a critical issue in deploying learning algorithms in real-world applications, which is ensuring safety and reliability.\n* The proposed algorithm, CLUCB, is well-motivated and theoretically sound, with a clear and concise analysis of its regret bound.\n* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the baseline policy is known, which may not always be the case in practice. However, the authors do provide an extension to the case where the baseline policy is unknown.\n* The analysis of the regret bound is complex and may be difficult to follow for readers without a strong background in linear bandits and convex optimization.\n* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the proposed algorithm and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper addresses a critical issue in deploying learning algorithms in real-world applications.\n* The proposed algorithm is well-motivated and theoretically sound.\n* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the baseline policy is known, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The analysis of the regret bound is complex and may be difficult to follow for some readers.\n* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the proposed algorithm and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their approach. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and proofs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and provide insights into its behavior. I recommend accepting the paper, but suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the clarity and practical implications of their work."
