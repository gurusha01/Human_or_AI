            "inputText": "This paper proposes a new deep generative model called MMD GAN, which combines the ideas of Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The authors introduce adversarial kernel learning techniques to improve the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency. The new approach, MMD GAN, uses a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with learned kernels, which enjoys the advantage of weak* topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of MMD GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that MMD GAN outperforms GMMN and is competitive with other state-of-the-art GANs on multiple benchmark datasets.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work.\n* The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of MMD GAN.\n* The experimental results demonstrate that MMD GAN outperforms GMMN and is competitive with other state-of-the-art GANs on multiple benchmark datasets.\n* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the computational efficiency of MMD GAN and demonstrate that it can be trained with much smaller batch sizes than GMMN.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the technical details of GMMN and GAN, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of MMD GAN with other GAN variants, such as WGAN-GP or SN-GAN.\n* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the mode collapse problem in GANs and how MMD GAN addresses this issue.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of deep generative models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MMD GAN, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the model.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of deep generative models.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MMD GAN.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of MMD GAN.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the technical details of GMMN and GAN.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of MMD GAN with other GAN variants.\n* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the mode collapse problem in GANs and how MMD GAN addresses this issue.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison of MMD GAN with other GAN variants and address the mode collapse problem in GANs. Additionally, the authors should provide more explanations and examples to make the paper more accessible to non-experts."
