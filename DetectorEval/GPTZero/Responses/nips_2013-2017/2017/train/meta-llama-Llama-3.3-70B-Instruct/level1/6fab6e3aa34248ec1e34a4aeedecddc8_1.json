            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to fuse language and vision in visual question answering (VQA) tasks by modulating the entire visual processing pipeline using a linguistic input. The authors introduce Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN), a mechanism that conditions the batch normalization parameters of a pre-trained ResNet on a language embedding. This approach, called MODERN, is evaluated on two VQA datasets, VQAv1 and GuessWhat?!.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, discussing the limitations of current VQA models that process visual and linguistic inputs independently. The technical details of CBN and MODERN are well-explained, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including an ablation study and visualizations of the learned representations.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel fusion mechanism that modulates the visual processing pipeline using a linguistic input, which is a significant departure from current approaches.\n* The demonstration of significant improvements over strong baselines on two VQA datasets.\n* The provision of a thorough analysis of the results, including an ablation study and visualizations of the learned representations.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The reliance on a pre-trained ResNet, which may limit the applicability of the approach to other architectures.\n* The lack of a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art VQA models that use different fusion mechanisms.\n* The limited evaluation of the approach on other tasks beyond VQA, although the authors suggest that MODERN can be extended to other modalities and tasks.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of VQA.\n* The approach is well-motivated, and the technical details are well-explained.\n* The results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The reliance on a pre-trained ResNet may limit the applicability of the approach.\n* The lack of a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art VQA models may limit the understanding of the approach's strengths and weaknesses.\n* The limited evaluation of the approach on other tasks beyond VQA may limit its potential impact.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of VQA and deserves to be accepted. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly by providing a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art VQA models and evaluating the approach on other tasks beyond VQA."
