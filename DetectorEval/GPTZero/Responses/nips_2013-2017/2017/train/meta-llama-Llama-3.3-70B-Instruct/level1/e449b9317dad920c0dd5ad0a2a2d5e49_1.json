            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to automated cell extraction in calcium imaging datasets using robust statistical estimation. The authors introduce a mathematical abstraction of imaging datasets and derive a minimax optimal robust loss function using the theory of M-estimation. They also propose a fast fixed-point optimization routine for solving the robust estimation problem, which has provably fast convergence. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their robust estimation approach over existing methods on both simulated and real datasets.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning. The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors propose a novel and robust approach to automated cell extraction, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.\n* The paper provides a thorough and well-organized technical section, which makes it easy to follow the authors' reasoning.\n* The experiments are well-designed and thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in calcium imaging and robust statistical estimation, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research.\n* The paper could benefit from more visualizations and illustrations to help non-experts understand the concepts and results.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and robust approach to automated cell extraction, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.\n* The paper provides a thorough and well-organized technical section, which makes it easy to follow the authors' reasoning.\n* The experiments are well-designed and thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in calcium imaging and robust statistical estimation, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research.\n* The paper could benefit from more visualizations and illustrations to help non-experts understand the concepts and results.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of calcium imaging. The authors propose a novel and robust approach to automated cell extraction, and the experiments demonstrate the superiority of their approach over existing methods. While there are some weaknesses to the paper, I believe that they do not outweigh the strengths, and I recommend acceptance."
