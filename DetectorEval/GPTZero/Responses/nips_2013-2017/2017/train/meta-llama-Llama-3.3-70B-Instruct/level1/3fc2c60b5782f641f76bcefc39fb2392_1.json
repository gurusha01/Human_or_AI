            "inputText": "This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for learning probabilistic machine learning models that directly capture the objective of their ultimate task, specifically in the context of stochastic programming. The authors argue that traditional model learning approaches, which focus on minimizing the log-likelihood of observed data, may not always lead to optimal performance in the downstream task. Instead, they propose to train a probabilistic model to minimize the task-based loss, which is the loss incurred by the decisions made using the model's predictions.\nThe paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem and their approach. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the gradient of the task-based loss with respect to the model parameters. The experimental evaluations are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several real-world applications, including inventory stock management, load forecasting, and battery storage.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and well-motivated problem statement\n* A novel and technically sound approach to learning probabilistic models for stochastic programming\n* Thorough experimental evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\n* A detailed derivation of the gradient of the task-based loss with respect to the model parameters\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the stochastic programming problem has a unique solution, which may not always be the case in practice\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing approaches to stochastic programming and model learning\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and stochastic programming. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of probabilistic models in a wide range of applications, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness in several real-world settings.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and technically sound approach to learning probabilistic models for stochastic programming\n* The experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several real-world applications\n* The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of machine learning and stochastic programming\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the stochastic programming problem has a unique solution, which may not always be the case in practice\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing approaches to stochastic programming and model learning\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including providing a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach and a more detailed comparison with existing approaches to stochastic programming and model learning."
