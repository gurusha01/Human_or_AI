The authors model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties, both pre- and post-2015, when the community changed its flooding mechanism from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading.\nThe paper's main contribution is to show that Bitcoin's flooding protocols have poor anonymity properties, and the community's shift from trickle spreading to diffusion did not improve the situation. The authors identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators, including the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator, and demonstrate that both trickle and diffusion exhibit roughly the same, poor anonymity properties.\nThe paper's strengths include its rigorous modeling and analysis of the Bitcoin network, its consideration of different adversarial models, and its simulation results on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology. The authors also provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methods and results, making the paper easy to follow.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. The analysis is limited to regular tree-structured networks, which may not accurately represent the real Bitcoin network topology. Additionally, the authors assume that the adversary has a fixed number of connections to each server, which may not be realistic in practice.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides new insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. The authors also provide a clear motivation for their work and demonstrate its relevance to the field of cryptocurrency and anonymity.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.\n* The authors identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators, including the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator.\n* The paper provides simulation results on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.\n* The authors demonstrate that both trickle and diffusion exhibit roughly the same, poor anonymity properties.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The analysis is limited to regular tree-structured networks, which may not accurately represent the real Bitcoin network topology.\n* The authors assume that the adversary has a fixed number of connections to each server, which may not be realistic in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from additional analysis of the robustness of the results to different network topologies and adversarial models.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper to the conference, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of cryptocurrency and anonymity, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses."
