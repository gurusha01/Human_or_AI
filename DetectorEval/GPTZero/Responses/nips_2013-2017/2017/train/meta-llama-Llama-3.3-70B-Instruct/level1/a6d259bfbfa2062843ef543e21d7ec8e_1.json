The authors introduce a generic architecture, called BAI-MCTS, that combines a Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithm with an exploration of the tree based on confidence intervals on the node values. They propose two specific instances, UGapE-MCTS and LUCB-MCTS, which rely on confidence-based BAI algorithms.\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms, including a proof of their (ε, δ)-correctness and a high-probability upper bound on their sample complexity. The authors also provide an experimental validation of their algorithms, demonstrating their superiority over the state-of-the-art FindTopWinner algorithm in various settings.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the necessary background and related work. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms.\nHere are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper:\nStrengths:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to the best action identification problem in MCTS.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms, including a proof of their (ε, δ)-correctness and a high-probability upper bound on their sample complexity.\n* The experimental validation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms over the state-of-the-art FindTopWinner algorithm.\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper assumes a simplified model for MCTS, which may not capture all the complexities of real-world MCTS applications.\n* The authors do not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art MCTS algorithms, such as UCT.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and future directions of the proposed approach.\nArguments pro and con acceptance:\nPro:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of MCTS.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms, including a proof of their (ε, δ)-correctness and a high-probability upper bound on their sample complexity.\n* The experimental validation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms over the state-of-the-art FindTopWinner algorithm.\nCon:\n* The paper assumes a simplified model for MCTS, which may not capture all the complexities of real-world MCTS applications.\n* The authors do not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art MCTS algorithms, such as UCT.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and future directions of the proposed approach.\nOverall, I believe that the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of MCTS and deserves to be accepted. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the paper's quality and impact. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe paper presents a novel approach to the best action identification problem in MCTS, but it builds upon existing work in the field.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper presents a significant contribution to the field of MCTS, with potential applications in various areas, such as game-playing AI systems and decision-making under uncertainty."
