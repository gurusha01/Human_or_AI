The authors rigorously define the intrinsic group additive structure and develop a structure-penalized kernel method to simultaneously identify the intrinsic group additive structure and estimate the nonparametric functions. The method utilizes a novel complexity measure derived for group additive structures, which is based on the capacity measure of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method. The theoretical results, including the consistency of the estimated group additive structure, are well-established. The simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to identify the intrinsic group additive structure, which can mitigate the curse of dimensionality and improve the efficiency and interpretability of high-dimensional nonparametric regression.\n* The development of a structure-penalized kernel method, which can simultaneously identify the intrinsic group additive structure and estimate the nonparametric functions.\n* The derivation of a novel complexity measure for group additive structures, which is based on the capacity measure of RKHSs.\n* The establishment of theoretical results, including the consistency of the estimated group additive structure.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The proposed method may not be computationally efficient for large datasets, as it requires an exhaustive search over all possible group additive structures.\n* The choice of tuning parameters, such as 位 and 碌, may require careful selection, and the authors do not provide a clear guideline for selecting these parameters.\n* The method may not be robust to outliers or noisy data, and the authors do not provide any discussion on the robustness of the method.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and effective. However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement, such as computational efficiency and robustness.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to identify the intrinsic group additive structure, which can mitigate the curse of dimensionality and improve the efficiency and interpretability of high-dimensional nonparametric regression.\n* The method is well-established theoretically, and the consistency of the estimated group additive structure is proven.\n* The simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The proposed method may not be computationally efficient for large datasets.\n* The choice of tuning parameters, such as 位 and 碌, may require careful selection, and the authors do not provide a clear guideline for selecting these parameters.\n* The method may not be robust to outliers or noisy data, and the authors do not provide any discussion on the robustness of the method.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the limitations of the proposed method, such as computational efficiency and robustness, and provide a clear guideline for selecting the tuning parameters. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed method and its comparison with other existing methods."
