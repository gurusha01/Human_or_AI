            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to error detection and correction in 3D reconstruction of neurons from electron microscopic imagery. The authors define two tasks: error detection, which identifies split and merge errors in a candidate object, and error correction, which prunes away irrelevant parts from the candidate mask to produce the true object. They implement both tasks using 3D multiscale convolutional networks and demonstrate high accuracy in error detection and significant improvements in error correction when using the \"advice\" from the error detector.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the architecture of their networks and the training procedures. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with precision and recall exceeding 90% in error detection and significant improvements in error correction when using the \"advice\" from the error detector.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The novelty of the approach, which decomposes the neuron segmentation problem into two strictly easier pieces: error detection and error correction.\n* The high accuracy of the error detection network, which can detect both split and merge errors with high precision and recall.\n* The significant improvements in error correction when using the \"advice\" from the error detector, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* The thorough experiments and evaluation, which provide a clear understanding of the performance of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The complexity of the approach, which requires multiple networks and training procedures, which may be challenging to implement and optimize.\n* The reliance on a high-quality baseline segmentation, which may not always be available.\n* The limited evaluation of the approach, which is only demonstrated on a single dataset and may not generalize to other datasets or applications.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and the approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of neuron segmentation.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to error detection and correction in 3D reconstruction of neurons.\n* The approach is well-motivated and clearly explained, with thorough experiments and evaluation.\n* The results are impressive, with high accuracy in error detection and significant improvements in error correction.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The approach is complex and may be challenging to implement and optimize.\n* The reliance on a high-quality baseline segmentation may limit the applicability of the approach.\n* The evaluation is limited to a single dataset and may not generalize to other datasets or applications.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 8/10\nOverall score: 8.5/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The authors should address the weaknesses of the paper, including the complexity of the approach and the limited evaluation, to improve the clarity and significance of the paper."
