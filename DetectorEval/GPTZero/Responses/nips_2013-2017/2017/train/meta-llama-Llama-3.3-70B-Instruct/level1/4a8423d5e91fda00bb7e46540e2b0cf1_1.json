            "inputText": "This paper proposes a method for constructing a selective classifier given a trained neural network, allowing for a desired risk level to be set and guaranteed with high probability. The authors introduce a selection function that rejects instances as needed to achieve the desired risk, and demonstrate the viability of their method on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem setting, the proposed algorithm, and the empirical results.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors address a significant problem in deep learning, which is the need for selective classification in mission-critical applications.\n* The proposed algorithm is simple and efficient, and can be easily implemented using existing deep learning frameworks.\n* The empirical results are impressive, demonstrating that the method can achieve high accuracy with guaranteed risk control.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The authors assume that the neural network classifier is already trained, and do not consider the problem of simultaneously training the classifier and the selection function.\n* The paper only considers the 0/1 loss function, and does not explore other loss functions or regression tasks.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of deep learning, addressing a critical problem in selective classification.\n* The proposed algorithm is efficient and easy to implement, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.\n* The empirical results are strong, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method on challenging datasets.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper has some limitations, including the assumption that the neural network classifier is already trained, and the lack of exploration of other loss functions or regression tasks.\n* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is not thoroughly analyzed, which could be a concern for large-scale applications.\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing methods for selective classification, to better understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the proposed algorithm is well-motivated and efficient. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement, including the assumption that the neural network classifier is already trained, and the lack of exploration of other loss functions or regression tasks.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem setting, the proposed algorithm, and the empirical results. The authors provide a good introduction to the topic, and the paper is easy to follow.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of deep learning, addressing a critical problem in selective classification. However, the proposed algorithm is not entirely new, and builds on existing work in the field.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of deep learning, particularly in mission-critical applications where selective classification is crucial. The proposed algorithm is efficient and easy to implement, making it a practical solution for real-world applications."
