The authors analyze the behavior of this gradient estimator theoretically and empirically, and generalize it to more complex variational distributions such as mixtures and importance-weighted posteriors.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and derivation of the proposed estimator. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the estimator's properties and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results on MNIST and Omniglot datasets.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed estimator is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing variational inference frameworks.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise derivation of the estimator, making it easy to understand and follow.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator in reducing variance and improving performance.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the variational approximation is exact, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other existing variance reduction techniques, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed estimator.\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties, such as its convergence rate and robustness to hyperparameter choices.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective variance reduction technique for variational inference.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator in improving performance.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and derivation of the proposed estimator.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the variational approximation is exact, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other existing variance reduction techniques.\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of variational inference and deserves to be accepted. However, I would like to see more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties and a thorough comparison with other existing variance reduction techniques. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise derivation of the proposed estimator.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe paper proposes a novel variance reduction technique for variational inference, but the idea of using control variates to reduce variance is not new.\nSignificance: 8/10\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of variational inference, but the impact of the proposed estimator on the broader field of machine learning is not entirely clear."
