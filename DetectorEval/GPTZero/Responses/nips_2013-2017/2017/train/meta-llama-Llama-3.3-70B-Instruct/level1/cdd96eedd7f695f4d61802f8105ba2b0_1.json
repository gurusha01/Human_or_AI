            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel unsupervised generative approach for network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE). The authors formulate a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to connect embedding vectors and preserve the global node ranking and local proximity of nodes. The paper provides a deeper analysis to connect the proposed proximity objective to link prediction and community detection in the network.\nThe strengths of this paper include:\n* The authors propose a novel objective function that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that only preserve one of these properties.\n* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function, including its connection to link prediction and community detection.\n* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various supervised learning tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.\n* The authors also provide a robustness analysis to show that their method is robust to missing edges in the network.\nThe weaknesses of this paper include:\n* The paper assumes that the network is directed and homogeneous, which may not be the case in many real-world networks.\n* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers and the activation functions.\n* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in network embedding, such as GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Network.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.\n* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various supervised learning tasks.\n* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a directed and homogeneous network, which may not be the case in many real-world networks.\n* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters.\n* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in network embedding.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network embedding and should be accepted. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters and comparing their method with other state-of-the-art methods. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written and provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function. However, the authors could improve the clarity of the paper by providing more explanations of the hyperparameters and the experimental setup.\nClarity: 8/10\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow. However, some sections, such as the experimental setup, could be improved with more explanations.\nOriginality: 9/10\nThe paper proposes a novel and effective method for network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network embedding and has the potential to impact various applications, such as link prediction and community detection."
