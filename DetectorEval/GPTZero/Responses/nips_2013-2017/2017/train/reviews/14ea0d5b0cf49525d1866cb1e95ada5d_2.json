More specifically, they suppose they have a feature transformation phi that maps (input,class) pairs to a p-dimensional feature space, and they learn a mapping from R^p to scores. \n Their reduction extends the work of Joshi et al.

Given that the transformed dataset contains correlated training examples, many standard generalization bounds cannot be applied. The first contribution of this paper is an improved generalization analysis over Joshi et al. (2015) using new bounds on the fractional Rademacher complexity in this setting. The second main contribution is showing that it is possible to employ sampling techniques during the reduction to balance the class distributions and to decrease the training set size. In particular, they sample each class (with replacement) in order to ensure that each class has roughly equal representation in the transformed training data, and rather than including transformed points for all K-1 possible class comparisons, they use only a random sample of classes.
