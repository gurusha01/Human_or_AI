Digit 8 appears frequently there.\nMinor typos:\n- Line 141: s/usally/usually/\nUpdate:\nI have read the rebuttal. Thanks for the extra experiments.\nThe authors should clarity the limitation of PMD and MMD.\nMMD is OK with batch_size=2.\nMMD can be trained with SGD, \nif using the unbiased estimator of MMD from the original \"A Kernel Two-Sample Test\" paper.\nSo MMD can converge to the right distribution if using small minibatches.\nOn the other hand, PMD does not have a known unbiased estimator of the gradient."
