In contrast to previous works on dynamic PF, this paper uses a simplified version of a recurrent neural network to allow for long-term dependencies. Inference is carried out via variational inference, with an extra step to maximize over the neural network parameters. The paper reports experiments on 5 real-world datasets.\nOverall, I found the idea potentially interesting, but I still think the paper needs some improvements in its execution before it can be accepted in a conference like NIPS. Please find my comments below.\n+The formulation in Eq. 4 doesn't correspond to a RNN structure, because h_t^{(n)} depends only on the top-layer memory vectors, and it does not depend on previous time steps for the same layer, as in the RNN setup. Is there any reason for this simplified structure?\n+In Section 2, some of the model equations are missing (e.g., it is not clear how to parameterize the Gamma in Eq. 4, or what's the distribution that generates theta_t in Eq. 3).\n+I disagree with the discussion in lines 110-118 regarding \"implicit distributions\". Eqs. 9 and 10 are actually explicit: they are Gammas with given shapes and rates. Since the distribution of theta_tk (Eq. 9) can be computed in closed form conditioned on h^{(0)}, it cannot be called implicit. The same comment applies to h in Eq. 10.\n+Lines 30-31: The sentence \"This method may have weak points in analyzing other data with different pattern long-time dependence, such as fanatical data and disaster data\" wasn't clear to me; can you elaborate?\n+The subsection in lines 133-155 isn't clear to me. What is exactly the \"loss function\" in Eq. 15?\n+MSE/PMSE is typically not a good metric for PF-like models. The results should additionally include at least predictive log-likelihood.\n+The value of K in the experiments (line 207) seems too small to me. I suggest the authors use larger values, such as K=100 (at least).\n+I couldn't connect the discussion in lines 224-232 with Fig. 3: it is not clear.\n+The update equations for the variational inference procedure (Eqs. 11-14) can safely be moved to the supplement.\n+The caption in Fig. 4 cannot be read clearly.\n+I strongly recommend to follow general writing advice about the use of the passive voice (specially for the abstract).\n+The writing quality is poor, and the paper contains many typos. Here are some examples: \n -Line 15, \"high-dimensional\"\n -Line 22, \"factorize\"\n -Line 24, \"property of the\"\n -Lines 29, 34, \"Dirichlet\"\n -Line 34, \"nested\"\n -Fig. 1, \"visual representation\"\n -Fig.1, \"transmission\" (not sure if that's an appropriate word anyways)\n -Incomplete sentences (e.g., line 49)\n -Many missing articles (e.g., \"Although Dirichlet distribution is often used as prior distribution\")"
