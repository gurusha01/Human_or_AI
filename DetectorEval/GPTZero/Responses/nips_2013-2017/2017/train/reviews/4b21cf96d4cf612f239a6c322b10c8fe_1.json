            "inputText": "This paper investigated the task of image-conditioned caption generation using deep generative models. Compared to existing methods with pure LSTM pipeline, the proposed approach augments the representation with an additional data dependent latent variable. This paper formulated the problem under variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework by maximizing the variational lowerbound as objective during training. A data-dependent additive Gaussian prior was introduced to address the issue of limited representation power when applying VAEs to caption generation. Empirical results demonstrate the proposed method is able to generate diverse and accurate sentences compared to pure LSTM baseline. \n== Qualitative Assessment ==\nI like the motivation that adding stochastic latent variable to the caption generation framework. Augmenting the prior of VAE is not a novel contribution but I see the novelty applied to caption generation task. Performance-wise, the proposed AG-CVAE achieved more accurate performance compared to both LSTM baseline and other CVAE baselines (see Table 2). The paper also analyzed the diversity of the generated captions in comparison with the pure LSTM based approach (see Figure 5). Overall, the paper is generally well-written with sufficient experimental details.\nConsidering the additive Gaussian prior as major contribution, the current version does not seem to be very convincing to me. I am happy to raise score if my concerns can be addressed in the rebuttal.\n* Any strong evidence showing the advantages of AG-CVAE over CVAE/GMM-CVAE?\nThe improvements in Table 2 are not very significant. For qualitative results (Figure 5 and other figures in supplementary materials), side-by-side comparisons between AG-CVAE and CVAE/GMM-CVAE are missing. It is not crystal clear to me whether AG-CVAE actually adds more representation power compared to CVAE/GMM-CVAE. Please comment on this in the rebuttal and include such comparisons in the final version of the paper (or supplementary materials).\n* Diversity evaluation: it is not clear why does AG-CVAE perform worse than CVAE. Also, there is no explanation about performance gap from different variations of AG-CVAE. Since CVAE is a stochastic generative model, I wonder whether top 10 sentences are sufficient for diversity evaluations? The results will be much more convincing if the authors provide a curve (y-axis is the diversity measure and x-axis is the number of sentences).\nAdditional comments:\n* Pre-defined means of clusters for GMM-CVAE and AG-CVAE (Line 183)\nIt is not surprising that the authors failed to obtain better results when means of clusters uk are free variables. In principle, it is possible to learn duplicate representations without any constraints (e.g., sparsity or orthogonality) on uk or c_k. I would encourage the authors to explore this direction a bit in the future. Hopefully, learnable data-dependent prior can boost the performance to some extent."
