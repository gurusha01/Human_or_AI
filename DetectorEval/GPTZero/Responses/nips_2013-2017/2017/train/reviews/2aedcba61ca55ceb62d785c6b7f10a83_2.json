Specifically, the paper studies the problem where the group structure is not known in advance and must be learned from the data. To do this, the paper proposes a novel penalty function, based on the covering numbers of RKHS balls, which is then added to the kernel ridge regression objective. This results in an objective that can be optimized over both the group structure (which, together with the kernel determines a function space via direct sum of RKHSs over each group of variables) and the regression estimate within each group. Two algorithms are presented for approximately solving this compound optimization problem, and then theoretical results are presented showing (a) the rate at which the empirical risk of the estimate approaches the true risk of the true optimum, and (b) consistency of the group structure estimate, in that the probability it matches the true group structure approaches 1 as n -> infinity. Finally, experimental results are presented on both synthetic and real data.\nMain Comments:\nThe key innovation of the paper appears to be recognizing that the complexity of a particular group structure can be quantified in terms of covering numbers of the direct sum space. The paper is comprehensive, including a well-motivated and novel method, and reasonably solid theoretical and empirical results. I'm not too familiar with other approaches to fitting models between the additive and nonparametric models, but, assuming the discussion in Lines 31-50 is fairly, complete, this paper seems like a potentially significant advance. As noted in the Discussion section, the main issue with the method appears to be difficulty solving the optimization problem over group structure when the number of variables in large. The paper is also fairly clearly written, aside from a lot of typos.\nMinor Comments/Questions:\nJust curious: is there any simple characterization of \"interaction\" between two variables that doesn't rely on writing the whole model in Equation (1)?\nLine 169: I don't quite understand the use of almost surely here. Is this meant as n -> infinity?\nEquation (3) is missing a summation (over i).\nLine 205: Perhaps \"translation invariant kernel\" is a more common term for this than \"convolutional kernel\"\nTypos:\nLine 145: \"on RHS\" should be \"on the RHS\"\nLine 152: \"not only can the bias of \\hat f{\\lambda,G} reduces\" should be \"not only can the bias of \\hat f{\\lambda,G} reduce\"\nLine 160: \"G^ exists and unique\" should be \"G^ exists and is unique\"\nLine 247: \"turning parameters\" should be \"tuning parameters\"\nAlgorithm 2: Line 1: \"State with\" should be \"start with\"\nLine 251: \"by compare\" should be \"by comparing\"."
