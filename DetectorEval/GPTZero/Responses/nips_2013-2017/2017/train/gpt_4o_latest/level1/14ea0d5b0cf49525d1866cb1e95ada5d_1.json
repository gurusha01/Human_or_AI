            "inputText": "The paper addresses the challenging problem of large-scale multi-class classification with an innovative approach that combines a multi-class-to-binary reduction strategy with a double sampling mechanism. The authors propose a (π, κ)-double sampling strategy to address the issues of class imbalance and computational inefficiency inherent in extreme classification tasks. The method is validated on large-scale datasets such as DMOZ and Wikipedia, demonstrating competitive performance in terms of training and prediction time, memory usage, and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty: The proposed double sampling strategy is a significant contribution to the field of extreme multi-class classification. By balancing class distributions and reducing the number of dyadic examples, the method effectively mitigates the curse of long-tailed distributions—a common challenge in large-scale classification.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees, including generalization error bounds using local fractional Rademacher complexity. This adds credibility to the proposed method and demonstrates its consistency under the empirical risk minimization principle.\n3. Scalability: The (π, κ)-DS algorithm is computationally efficient, as evidenced by its ability to handle datasets with up to 100,000 classes while maintaining competitive predictive performance. The memory and runtime improvements over baseline methods are particularly noteworthy.\n4. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, comparing the proposed method against several state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., OVA, PD-Sparse, FastXML). The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of runtime, memory usage, and predictive performance, especially on large datasets.\n5. Practical Relevance: The method's focus on real-world datasets like Wikipedia and DMOZ highlights its applicability to practical problems such as text classification, tagging, and recommendation systems.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the theoretical contributions are substantial, the paper's presentation is dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with advanced concepts like fractional Rademacher complexity. Simplifying the exposition or providing more intuitive explanations would improve accessibility.\n2. Limited Scope of Datasets: The experiments are restricted to text classification datasets. While the authors mention potential applications in recommendation and image classification, no experiments are conducted in these domains. This limits the generalizability of the results.\n3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The performance of the (π, κ)-DS algorithm depends on the choice of π and κ. While the authors provide practical heuristics, a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity to these hyperparameters would strengthen the paper.\n4. Comparison with Recent Methods: Although the authors compare their method with several baselines, some recent approaches (e.g., SLEEC, LEML) are excluded, citing prior work. Including these methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound approach to a critical problem in machine learning.\n- The method demonstrates strong empirical performance, particularly in large-scale settings.\n- The theoretical contributions, including generalization bounds, are significant and advance the state of the art.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in the theoretical sections.\n- The experimental scope is limited to text classification, leaving other potential applications unexplored.\n- Hyperparameter sensitivity is not thoroughly analyzed.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as its strengths in novelty, theoretical rigor, and empirical validation outweigh its weaknesses. However, the authors should address the clarity issues and explore broader applications in future work."
