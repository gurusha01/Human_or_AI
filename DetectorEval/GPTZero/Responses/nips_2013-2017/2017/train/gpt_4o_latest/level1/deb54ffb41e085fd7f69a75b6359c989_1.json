            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel approach to scaling Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) for representing and learning distributions over routes on maps. The authors propose a hierarchical framework for route distributions, leveraging hierarchical maps to construct tractable PSDDs that maintain polynomial size while approximating simple-route distributions. This hierarchical approach addresses scalability challenges inherent in prior PSDD applications to structured spaces, such as routes, and demonstrates improved performance in a route prediction task compared to Markov models and naive baselines. The paper also provides theoretical guarantees on the correctness and complexity of the hierarchical representation and presents empirical results using real-world GPS data from San Francisco.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing hierarchical PSDDs, which enable scalable modeling of route distributions. The hierarchical decomposition is well-motivated and theoretically grounded, with clear complexity guarantees and practical implications.\n2. Empirical Validation: The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach in a route prediction task, achieving a substantial improvement in accuracy (93.1%) over Markov models (82%) and naive baselines (73.6%). The use of real-world GPS data adds credibility to the empirical results.\n3. Novelty: The hierarchical approach to PSDDs is a novel extension of prior work on structured spaces, advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling and learning distributions over combinatorial objects.\n4. Clarity of Theoretical Results: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including proofs of correctness and complexity bounds for hierarchical PSDDs. The discussion of trade-offs between scalability and exactness is particularly insightful.\n5. Relevance: The work addresses a practical and challenging problem\"\"scalable modeling of route distributions\"\"which has applications in traffic prediction, navigation, and urban planning.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, such as the encoding and compilation of hierarchical routes, are dense and could benefit from additional examples or diagrams to improve accessibility for a broader audience.\n2. Evaluation Scope: The empirical evaluation focuses on a single dataset (San Francisco GPS data). It would strengthen the paper to include results on additional datasets or synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.\n3. Approximation Limitations: The hierarchical approximation introduces a loss of exactness for certain queries, which is acknowledged but not thoroughly quantified in practical scenarios. A deeper exploration of the trade-offs between approximation accuracy and scalability would be valuable.\n4. Baseline Comparisons: While the PSDD outperforms Markov models and naive baselines, comparisons to more advanced probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models or Bayesian Networks) are absent. This omission limits the scope of the evaluation.\nRecommendation:\nPros for Acceptance:\n- The paper presents a novel and technically rigorous method for scaling PSDDs, with strong empirical results and theoretical guarantees.\n- The hierarchical framework is a meaningful advancement with potential applications beyond route distributions, such as other structured spaces.\nCons for Acceptance:\n- Limited evaluation scope and lack of comparisons to more sophisticated baselines.\n- Dense presentation in some sections, which may hinder accessibility.\nOverall, the paper represents a solid scientific contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and structured spaces. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and expand the discussion of baseline comparisons in the final version."
