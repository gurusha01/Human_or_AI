            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to decoding neural signals for intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs), introducing a multiscale semi-Markov (MSSM) model and a flexible likelihood function for cursor control. The authors address key limitations of the widely used Kalman filter, including its inability to model multiscale dynamics and its reliance on unimodal cosine tuning curves. By explicitly incorporating goal positions as latent states and leveraging semi-Markov dynamics, the MSSM model integrates information over longer time horizons, enabling smoother and more accurate cursor trajectories. The flexible likelihood function further improves decoding accuracy by accommodating multimodal and narrower neural tuning curves. The authors validate their approach through offline experiments with recorded neural data and demonstrate its efficacy in real-time clinical trials, showing significant improvements in cursor trajectory smoothness and accuracy compared to the Kalman filter.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Innovation: The MSSM model represents a significant advancement over the Kalman filter by explicitly modeling goal positions and incorporating semi-Markov dynamics. This is a novel and well-motivated approach to addressing the multiscale nature of iBCI decoding.\n2. Improved Decoding Accuracy: Both offline and real-time evaluations demonstrate that the MSSM model outperforms the Kalman filter in terms of trajectory smoothness, accuracy, and responsiveness. The results are robust and statistically significant.\n3. Clinical Relevance: The authors emphasize the practical applicability of their method, including efficient online inference and rapid calibration, which are crucial for clinical use. The real-time experiments with a clinical trial participant further highlight the translational potential of the work.\n4. Thorough Evaluation: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model, including ablation studies, comparisons to baseline methods, and detailed analyses of trajectory metrics.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Generalization: The real-time experiments were conducted with a single clinical trial participant, which limits the generalizability of the results. Additional trials with more participants are necessary to validate the broader applicability of the MSSM model.\n2. Complexity of Implementation: While the authors derive an efficient online inference algorithm, the MSSM model introduces additional complexity compared to the Kalman filter. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational trade-offs and potential challenges in deploying the model in real-world clinical settings.\n3. Comparison Scope: The paper primarily compares the MSSM model to the Kalman filter. Including comparisons to other state-of-the-art iBCI decoding methods, such as deep learning-based approaches, would strengthen the evaluation.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPro:\n- The paper addresses a critical problem in iBCI research with a novel and well-justified approach.\n- The results demonstrate significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, with clear clinical relevance.\n- The work is technically rigorous, with detailed derivations and comprehensive evaluations.\nCon:\n- The limited sample size in real-time experiments raises questions about the generalizability of the findings.\n- The increased model complexity may pose challenges for practical deployment, which are not fully addressed in the paper.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of iBCIs by introducing a novel decoding framework that significantly improves upon the Kalman filter. While additional validation with more participants and a broader comparison to other methods would strengthen the work, the technical innovation and demonstrated improvements warrant acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses."
