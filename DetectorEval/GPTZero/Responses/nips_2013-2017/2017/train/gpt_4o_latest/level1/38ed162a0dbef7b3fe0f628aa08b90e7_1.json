            "inputText": "This paper presents a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the stability and invariance properties of deep signal representations, particularly convolutional architectures, through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). By generalizing convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) to continuous domains and studying their stability under diffeomorphisms and group transformations, the authors aim to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The work builds on prior research, notably the scattering transform by Mallat [17], and extends its principles to more general architectures, offering a kernel-based perspective that unifies data representation and predictive modeling.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding the stability of CNNs and CKNs, addressing a critical gap in the literature. The stability results, particularly under diffeomorphisms, are well-grounded and extend prior work on scattering transforms.\n2. Novelty: The kernel-based framework is a significant contribution, offering a unified perspective that connects classical kernel methods with modern deep learning architectures. The generalization to RKHSs and the explicit connection to CNNs with smooth homogeneous activations are particularly compelling.\n3. Clarity of Mathematical Framework: The mathematical rigor and detailed proofs (though relegated to appendices) demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem. The use of RKHS norms to control stability and generalization is insightful and aligns well with recent trends in understanding deep learning through functional spaces.\n4. Practical Implications: The discussion on discretization and kernel approximations bridges the theoretical results with practical implementations, such as CKNs, making the work relevant to both theorists and practitioners.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the mathematical exposition is thorough, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers without a strong background in harmonic analysis or kernel methods. Some sections, such as the derivation of stability bounds, could benefit from additional intuition or visual aids.\n2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the theoretical claims. While the focus is theoretical, demonstrating the practical benefits of the proposed framework on real-world tasks would strengthen the paper's impact.\n3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The authors acknowledge that pooling layers may reduce signal energy, but the implications of this for practical architectures are not fully explored. Additionally, the reliance on smooth activations excludes popular non-smooth functions like ReLU, which may limit the applicability of the results.\n4. Connection to Broader Literature: While the related work section is comprehensive, the paper could better contextualize its contributions within the broader landscape of deep learning theory, particularly recent efforts to understand generalization and robustness in CNNs.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending the scattering transform framework to general convolutional architectures and providing stability guarantees.\n- The kernel-based perspective is novel and has the potential to inspire further research at the intersection of kernel methods and deep learning.\n- The mathematical rigor and depth of analysis are commendable.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of experimental validation limits the practical relevance of the work.\n- The dense mathematical presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.\n- The exclusion of non-smooth activations like ReLU may reduce the generality of the results.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. While the paper is primarily theoretical, its contributions are significant and relevant to the NIPS community. However, the authors should consider adding empirical results or more intuitive explanations to enhance accessibility and demonstrate the practical utility of their framework."
