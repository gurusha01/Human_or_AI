            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel framework for error detection and correction in 3D neuronal segmentation using multiscale 3D convolutional networks. The authors define two tasks: error detection, which identifies split and merge errors in a candidate object mask, and error correction, which prunes the mask to produce the true object. A key innovation is the integration of these tasks, where the error-detecting network provides \"advice\" to the error-correcting network, improving segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper demonstrates significant improvements over baseline segmentation and highlights the utility of the proposed approach in reducing the labor-intensive process of neuronal reconstruction.\nThe work builds on prior research in neuronal boundary detection and segmentation using convolutional networks [10, 29, 15, 6], extending it by focusing on error detection and correction as distinct tasks. While previous studies addressed merge errors [18, 24], this paper uniquely incorporates both split and merge errors into the error detection task. Additionally, the use of metric learning for error correction and the interpretation of the network as a feedback recurrent convolutional net offer novel contributions to the field.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with well-supported claims through theoretical explanations and experimental results. The iterative refinement procedure and the integration of error detection and correction are particularly compelling.\n2. Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with detailed descriptions of the tasks, architectures, and experimental procedures. The inclusion of figures and quantitative results enhances understanding.\n3. Originality: The decomposition of segmentation into error detection and correction tasks, along with the \"advice\" mechanism, is novel. The use of vector fields for error correction and the feedback recurrent interpretation of the network further contribute to its originality.\n4. Significance: The framework addresses a critical bottleneck in connectomics by reducing human proofreading effort and computational cost. The results demonstrate meaningful improvements in segmentation accuracy, making the approach valuable for both researchers and practitioners.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Generality: While the method is tailored for neuronal segmentation, its applicability to other domains of image segmentation is not thoroughly explored. A discussion on generalization would strengthen the paper.\n2. Error Analysis: The paper mentions false positives in error detection (e.g., dendritic spine misclassifications) but does not delve deeply into their impact on downstream tasks or propose mitigation strategies.\n3. Computational Cost: Although the authors highlight computational savings, the iterative nature of the error correction process may still be resource-intensive for large-scale datasets. A more detailed cost-benefit analysis would be helpful.\n4. Baseline Comparisons: The paper could benefit from comparisons with more recent segmentation methods beyond the provided baseline to contextualize the improvements.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to a significant problem in connectomics.\n- The integration of error detection and correction is innovative and demonstrates clear improvements over the baseline.\n- The work is technically rigorous, clearly written, and provides insights that could inspire further research.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The method's generalizability to other segmentation tasks is not fully addressed.\n- The computational cost, while reduced, remains significant, and scalability could be a concern.\n- The analysis of failure cases and their implications is limited.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of neuronal segmentation and error correction. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address generalization, error analysis, and computational cost discussions."
