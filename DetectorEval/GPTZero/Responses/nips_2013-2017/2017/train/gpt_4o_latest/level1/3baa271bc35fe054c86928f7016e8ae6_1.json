            "inputText": "The paper addresses the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint in a streaming setting, with the added complexity of ensuring robustness against the removal of up to \\( m \\) elements from the selected summary. The authors propose a novel two-stage algorithm, STAR-T, which constructs a robust summary in a single pass over the data using a partitioning structure and exponentially decreasing thresholds. In the second stage, a simple greedy algorithm (STAR-T-GREEDY) is applied to the remaining elements after arbitrary removals, achieving a constant-factor approximation guarantee. The authors provide theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that STAR-T outperforms or matches existing methods like SIEVE-STREAMING, even when the latter has prior knowledge of the removed elements.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Originality: The proposed algorithm introduces a new partitioning structure and thresholding mechanism tailored for robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting. This is a significant extension of prior work, such as SIEVE-STREAMING, to handle robustness.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors rigorously prove that STAR-T achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee while using memory proportional to \\( O((k + m \\log k) \\log^2 k) \\). This is a meaningful improvement over existing robust streaming algorithms in terms of memory efficiency and robustness guarantees.\n3. Practical Relevance: The paper addresses real-world applications like influence maximization and personalized movie recommendation, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed method.\n4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough, comparing STAR-T against strong baselines (e.g., SIEVE-STREAMING) across multiple datasets and scenarios. The results demonstrate that STAR-T performs robustly even when the number of removed elements exceeds the theoretical bound.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the theoretical results are well-supported, the presentation of the algorithm and proofs is dense and may be difficult for non-experts to follow. Simplifying the exposition or providing more intuitive explanations could improve accessibility.\n2. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper references prior work on robust submodular maximization, the distinction between STAR-T and other robust methods (e.g., PRO) could be elaborated further, especially in terms of practical trade-offs.\n3. Empirical Limitations: The experiments focus on specific applications and datasets. While the results are promising, additional benchmarks on larger datasets or other domains could strengthen the empirical claims.\n4. Parameter Sensitivity: The algorithm relies on parameters like \\( \\tau \\) and \\( w \\), and while theoretical guidance is provided, the practical impact of these parameters on performance is not fully explored.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robust submodular maximization, addressing an important and practical problem.\n- The theoretical results are strong and well-supported, advancing the state of the art in robust streaming algorithms.\n- The experimental results demonstrate the practical utility and robustness of the proposed approach.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The clarity of the presentation, particularly in the theoretical sections, could be improved to make the paper more accessible.\n- The empirical evaluation, while solid, could be expanded to include more diverse datasets and scenarios.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a novel and impactful contribution to the field of robust submodular optimization in streaming settings. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and empirical breadth, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses."
