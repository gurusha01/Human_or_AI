            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel deep supervised discrete hashing (DSDH) algorithm for image retrieval, addressing limitations in prior deep hashing methods by fully leveraging semantic information. The authors propose a one-stream framework that integrates both pairwise label information and classification information to directly generate binary hash codes in the final layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike prior approaches that relax binary constraints or use two-stream frameworks, this method preserves the discrete nature of hash codes during optimization, employing an alternating minimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art hashing techniques on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.\nStrengths\n1. Technical Contribution: The paper introduces a novel approach by directly constraining the outputs of the final CNN layer to binary codes, which is rarely explored in deep hashing. This avoids the quantization error commonly seen in methods that relax binary constraints.\n2. Unified Framework: By integrating classification and pairwise label information into a single-stream framework, the method ensures that the learned binary codes are optimal for both similarity preservation and classification tasks.\n3. Optimization Strategy: The alternating minimization approach effectively handles the discrete nature of hash codes, which is a challenging aspect of hashing-based methods.\n4. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, using multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., MAP, precision-recall curves). The results consistently show that the proposed method outperforms traditional and deep hashing methods, particularly under settings with sufficient training data.\n5. Relevance: The work aligns well with recent trends in deep learning-based hashing and directly addresses limitations in prior methods, such as two-stream frameworks and quantization errors.\nWeaknesses\n1. Clarity: While the technical contributions are significant, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations of key concepts, particularly in the optimization section. For example, the introduction of auxiliary variables and the alternating minimization process is difficult to follow without prior familiarity with the topic.\n2. Limited Dataset Diversity: The experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE, which are standard benchmarks but may not fully represent the diversity of real-world image retrieval tasks. Additional datasets, such as ImageNet or MS COCO, could strengthen the evaluation.\n3. Scalability: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of the proposed method, particularly for large-scale datasets. The alternating minimization approach may introduce overhead compared to simpler relaxation techniques.\n4. Comparative Analysis: While the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, the improvements on NUS-WIDE are relatively modest. The authors attribute this to the multi-label nature of the dataset, but further analysis or ablation studies could clarify this limitation.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach that addresses key limitations in deep hashing methods.\n- The experimental results are strong and demonstrate clear improvements over prior work.\n- The contributions are significant and advance the state of the art in image retrieval.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly in the optimization and technical sections.\n- The evaluation could be more comprehensive, including additional datasets and scalability analysis.\nRecommendation\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of deep hashing for image retrieval. While there are some weaknesses in clarity and evaluation breadth, the technical novelty and performance improvements justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the discussion on scalability and dataset diversity."
