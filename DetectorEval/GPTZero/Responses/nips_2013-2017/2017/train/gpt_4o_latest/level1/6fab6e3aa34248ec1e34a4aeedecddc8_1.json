            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to fusing language and vision modalities by introducing Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN), which modulates the entire visual processing pipeline of a pre-trained ResNet using linguistic input. The resulting architecture, MODulatEd ResNet (MODERN), is evaluated on two visual question answering (VQA) tasks, VQAv1 and GuessWhat?!, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. The authors argue that their approach is inspired by neuroscience findings that suggest language influences early visual processing stages, and they provide an ablation study to confirm the benefits of modulating all stages of the visual pipeline.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty: The paper introduces a unique fusion mechanism that modulates visual processing from the earliest stages, diverging from the dominant paradigm of processing visual and linguistic inputs independently. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of multi-modal learning.\n2. Technical Soundness: The proposed method is well-motivated, and the authors carefully design CBN to predict changes in batch normalization parameters rather than replacing them outright, reducing the risk of poor initialization and overfitting.\n3. Empirical Results: MODERN achieves notable improvements on both VQAv1 and GuessWhat?! datasets, outperforming fine-tuning baselines and even state-of-the-art models like MCB and MUTAN. The ablation study convincingly demonstrates the importance of modulating all ResNet stages.\n4. Broader Applicability: The authors highlight that CBN is a general mechanism that can be applied to other multi-modal tasks or even beyond vision-language tasks, such as reinforcement learning or adversarial training.\n5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides sufficient technical detail, including ablation studies, visualizations, and comparisons to baselines, making it easy to follow and reproduce.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Scope of Evaluation: While the results on VQA and GuessWhat?! are strong, the paper could benefit from additional experiments on other multi-modal tasks (e.g., image captioning or video question answering) to demonstrate broader applicability.\n2. Computational Cost: The authors acknowledge that backpropagating through all ResNet layers requires significantly more GPU memory, which may limit the scalability of MODERN to larger datasets or higher-resolution images.\n3. Comparison to Related Work: While the paper references prior work on attention mechanisms and bilinear pooling, it does not provide a direct empirical comparison to these methods in terms of computational efficiency or robustness.\n4. Neuroscience Motivation: Although the authors cite neuroscience studies to justify early-stage modulation, the connection between these findings and the proposed method could be explored in greater depth to strengthen the argument.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach to multi-modal fusion that advances the state of the art in VQA tasks.\n- The empirical results are strong and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The method is generalizable and has potential applications beyond the specific tasks studied in the paper.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The evaluation is limited to two datasets, and the broader applicability of the method is not empirically demonstrated.\n- The computational cost of the approach may hinder its adoption in resource-constrained settings.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of multi-modal learning with a novel and effective fusion mechanism. While additional experiments on other tasks and a deeper exploration of the neuroscience motivation would strengthen the paper, its strengths outweigh these limitations."
