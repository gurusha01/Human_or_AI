            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to automated cell extraction in calcium imaging datasets using robust statistical estimation. The authors propose a minimax optimal M-estimator tailored to the unique contamination characteristics of calcium imaging data, such as non-Gaussian noise and non-cell background activity. They integrate this estimator into a matrix factorization framework, enabling simultaneous extraction of neurons' spatial and temporal activity. A key contribution is the development of a fast fixed-point optimization routine with provable local linear convergence, which is computationally efficient and amenable to GPU implementation. The proposed algorithm, EXTRACT, is validated on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in terms of signal fidelity and robustness to contamination, such as overlapping cells and neuropil activity.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is grounded in robust statistical theory, leveraging M-estimation to address contamination in calcium imaging datasets. The derivation of the one-sided Huber estimator and its minimax optimality is rigorous and well-supported.\n2. Practical Relevance: Calcium imaging is a critical tool in neuroscience, and the proposed method addresses a significant challenge in automating cell extraction. The algorithm's robustness to contamination and ability to handle low-SNR data make it highly relevant to real-world applications.\n3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, comparing EXTRACT with state-of-the-art methods (e.g., CNMF and ICA). The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of EXTRACT in terms of accuracy and robustness.\n4. Computational Efficiency: The fast fixed-point solver and GPU implementation make the method scalable to large datasets, a crucial feature for practical deployment in neuroscience research.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the technical content is strong, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the derivation of the one-sided Huber estimator and the fixed-point optimization routine. Non-expert readers may struggle to follow the mathematical details.\n2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The authors briefly mention that the robust estimator may underperform in extremely low-SNR regimes, but this limitation is not thoroughly explored. Additional experiments or discussion on failure cases would strengthen the paper.\n3. Comparison with Broader Methods: While the paper compares EXTRACT with CNMF and ICA, it would be valuable to include comparisons with other recent methods in the field, particularly those that also incorporate robustness or deep learning approaches.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a robust statistical framework for cell extraction, addressing a well-recognized challenge in calcium imaging.\n- The experimental results are compelling, showing clear advantages over existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.\n- The computational efficiency of the proposed method makes it highly practical for large-scale neuroscience studies.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in the theoretical sections, to make it more accessible to a broader audience.\n- The discussion of limitations and comparison with a wider range of methods is somewhat limited.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a substantial and well-validated contribution to the field of automated cell extraction in calcium imaging. However, I encourage the authors to improve the clarity of the presentation and provide a more thorough discussion of limitations and broader comparisons in the final version."
