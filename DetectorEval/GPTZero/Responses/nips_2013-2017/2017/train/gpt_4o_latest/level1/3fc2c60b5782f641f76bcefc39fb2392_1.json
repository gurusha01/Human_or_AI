            "inputText": "This paper proposes an innovative end-to-end approach for training probabilistic machine learning models that directly optimize task-based objectives within the context of stochastic programming. The authors argue that traditional methods, which train models based on generic loss functions like log-likelihood, often fail to align with the ultimate task objectives. Instead, they suggest a framework that propagates task-specific loss through the stochastic programming process to update the model parameters. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through three experimental evaluations: a synthetic inventory stock problem, a real-world electrical grid scheduling task, and an energy storage arbitrage task. Across these applications, the proposed method outperforms both traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approaches and black-box policy optimization techniques.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a critical gap in machine learning by focusing on task-specific optimization rather than generic loss functions. This is a significant contribution to the growing body of work on end-to-end learning and stochastic programming.\n2. Technical Soundness: The methodology is rigorously defined, with clear mathematical formulations and derivations. The authors also provide a detailed explanation of how gradients are computed through the stochastic programming process, which is a non-trivial technical challenge.\n3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed and span a range of applications, from synthetic to real-world tasks. The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, including substantial performance improvements in grid scheduling (38.6%) and reduced variability in energy storage tasks.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and logically organized. The authors provide sufficient background on stochastic programming, end-to-end learning, and alternative loss optimization, making the work accessible to a broad audience.\nWeaknesses\n1. Generality of Results: While the experiments are compelling, the generalizability of the approach to other domains or more complex stochastic programming settings (e.g., multi-round decision-making) is not fully explored. The authors acknowledge this as future work, but additional discussion would strengthen the paper.\n2. Computational Complexity: Differentiating through the \"argmin\" operator in stochastic programming is computationally intensive, and the scalability of the approach to larger or more complex problems is unclear.\n3. Comparison Baselines: While the paper compares its approach to MLE and policy optimization, additional baselines, such as recent advancements in task-specific optimization or hybrid methods, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n4. Limited Statistical Significance: In the energy storage task, the performance improvements are not statistically significant, which weakens the claim of consistent superiority.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper introduces a novel and impactful idea that bridges machine learning and stochastic programming.\n- The methodology is technically sound and supported by detailed experiments that show substantial performance gains.\n- The work is well-positioned within the existing literature and addresses a practical and underexplored problem.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The scalability and generalizability of the approach are not fully demonstrated.\n- The computational overhead of the method may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n- Some experimental results lack statistical significance, particularly in the energy storage task.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel framework for task-based model learning in stochastic programming. While there are some limitations, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and the work has the potential to inspire further research in this area."
