            "inputText": "The paper introduces FSUCRL, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that addresses the limitations of prior work on learning with options in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors combine the semi-MDP (SMDP) framework with the intrinsic Markov structure of options to remove the need for prior knowledge about the distributions of cumulative rewards and durations of options, which was a major drawback of existing algorithms like SUCRL. By transforming options into irreducible Markov chains, the proposed algorithm estimates stationary distributions to compute optimistic policies without requiring explicit parameterization. Theoretical regret bounds are derived, showing that FSUCRL matches SUCRL's performance up to an additive term. Preliminary empirical results demonstrate that FSUCRL retains the benefits of temporal abstraction while being robust to missing prior knowledge.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a significant limitation in prior work by proposing a parameter-free approach to learning with options. The transformation of options into irreducible Markov chains is a novel contribution that combines SMDP and MDP perspectives.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The regret analysis is thorough, and the authors provide detailed bounds that account for the additional complexity introduced by the lack of prior knowledge. The inclusion of pseudo-diameter and condition numbers in the analysis adds depth to the theoretical insights.\n3. Practical Relevance: The algorithm's parameter-free nature makes it more applicable to real-world scenarios where prior knowledge about options is unavailable or unreliable. This is particularly relevant for automatically generated options in deep RL.\n4. Empirical Validation: The experiments demonstrate that FSUCRL performs competitively with SUCRL and UCRL, preserving the advantages of temporal abstraction. The results highlight the robustness of FSUCRL in scenarios with overlapping options.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Empirical Results: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the empirical evaluation is limited to toy domains and grid-world environments. More diverse and complex benchmarks, such as those used in deep RL, would strengthen the paper's claims.\n2. Clarity: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. Simplifying some of the mathematical exposition and providing more intuitive explanations for key concepts (e.g., irreducible Markov chains) would improve clarity.\n3. Practical Implications of Regret Bounds: The regret bound includes terms that depend on the pseudo-diameter and condition numbers, which may be loose in practice. While the authors acknowledge this, a deeper discussion of the practical implications and potential mitigation strategies would be beneficial.\n4. Comparison to UCRL: Although the paper highlights the advantages of temporal abstraction, the comparison to UCRL could be expanded to include scenarios where options are poorly designed or suboptimal.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by removing the need for prior knowledge in learning with options, a key limitation in prior work.\n- The proposed algorithm is novel, well-motivated, and supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.\n- The empirical results, though limited, demonstrate the practical viability of the approach.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The empirical evaluation is narrow in scope and does not fully explore the algorithm's performance in more challenging or realistic environments.\n- The paper's clarity could be improved to make it more accessible to a wider audience.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of RL with options and addresses a critical limitation of prior work. While the empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive, the novelty and rigor of the proposed approach make it a valuable addition to the literature. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the empirical evaluation."
