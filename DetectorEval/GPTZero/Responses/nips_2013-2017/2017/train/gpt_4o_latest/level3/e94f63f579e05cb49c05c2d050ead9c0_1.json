            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel deep supervised discrete hashing (DSDH) algorithm aimed at improving image retrieval by leveraging class-annotated training data. The key contribution lies in directly learning binary hash codes without relaxation, using an alternating minimization optimization approach. The method integrates both pairwise similarity and classification information within a single-stream framework, which is a departure from prior two-stream approaches. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE, and provide extensive experimental analyses.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contribution: The paper addresses a critical limitation in existing deep hashing methods by directly handling the discrete nature of binary codes during optimization. This approach reduces quantization errors, which is a notable improvement over prior relaxation-based methods.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experimental results are robust, with comparisons against both traditional and deep hashing baselines. The proposed method consistently achieves superior performance, particularly on CIFAR-10, where it improves MAP scores by 3\"\"7% over the best-performing baseline.\n3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and experimental setup. The inclusion of ablation studies and comparisons with algorithm variants (e.g., DSDH-A, DSDH-B) strengthens the empirical analysis.\n4. Significance: The integration of classification information directly into the hash learning process is a meaningful contribution, as it aligns the learned binary codes with downstream tasks like classification, potentially broadening the applicability of the method.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Novelty Concerns: While the paper claims novelty in directly optimizing binary hash codes, the approach bears similarities to prior work ([9, 17, 21]). The use of alternating minimization and pairwise similarity is not entirely new, and the novelty may be incremental rather than groundbreaking.\n2. Complexity and Scalability: The proposed method appears computationally intensive due to the alternating minimization process and the need to iteratively update binary codes, classifier weights, and network parameters. The paper does not provide sufficient clarity on training speed or scalability to larger datasets, which could be a practical limitation.\n3. Limited Multi-Label Performance: On the NUS-WIDE dataset, which involves multi-label classification, the performance improvement is less pronounced. This suggests that the method may not fully exploit multi-label semantic relationships, which could be an area for further refinement.\n4. Related Work: The related work section could better differentiate the proposed method from existing approaches. While the authors cite relevant prior work, the distinctions are not always emphasized, which weakens the case for originality.\nRecommendation:\nPro Acceptance:\n- Strong empirical results and thorough evaluation.\n- Clear writing and methodological rigor.\n- Advances the state of the art in deep hashing by addressing discrete optimization challenges.\nCon Acceptance:\n- Incremental novelty compared to prior work.\n- Potential scalability issues and lack of clarity on computational efficiency.\nOverall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field of deep hashing, particularly in terms of technical rigor and empirical validation. However, the concerns about novelty and scalability warrant further clarification. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to address the novelty concerns and provide more details on the training efficiency and scalability."
