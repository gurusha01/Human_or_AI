            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThis paper proposes a novel task-based training approach for probabilistic machine learning models, where the model is optimized directly for an external task objective rather than traditional likelihood-based objectives. The authors frame this within the context of stochastic programming, where the goal is to minimize task-specific costs by propagating gradients through the optimization process. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks, including inventory stock management, electrical grid scheduling, and energy storage arbitrage.\nStrengths:\n1. Well-Motivated Problem: The paper addresses a critical gap in machine learning, where models are often trained on surrogate objectives (e.g., likelihood) that do not align with the ultimate task-based evaluation criteria. The introduction is clear and provides compelling real-world examples to motivate the need for task-based learning.\n \n2. Technical Soundness: The proposed method builds on established techniques, such as differentiation through optimization ([Amos 2016]), and adapts them effectively to the stochastic programming setting. The mathematical formulation is rigorous, and the derivation of gradients through the argmin operator is well-explained.\n3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are diverse and demonstrate the practical utility of the approach. Notably, the method achieves significant improvements over traditional likelihood-based models and black-box policy optimization in real-world tasks like grid scheduling (38.6% improvement in task loss) and battery storage.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The authors provide sufficient background and related work to contextualize their contributions. The inclusion of code availability enhances reproducibility.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Dependence on Task-Specific Objectives: A potential limitation is the model's reliance on the specific task objective for optimization. This raises concerns about overfitting to a narrowly defined task and the model's ability to generalize to slightly different tasks or distributions. The authors could address this by discussing strategies for improving robustness, such as regularization or multi-task learning.\n2. Missing Related Work: While the paper references relevant work on differentiation through optimization, it overlooks connections to meta-learning approaches like \"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning\" (MAML) by Finn et al., which also involves optimization through task-specific objectives. Including this discussion would strengthen the positioning of the paper within the broader literature.\n3. Scalability: The computational complexity of differentiating through the optimization process, particularly for large-scale or non-convex problems, is not thoroughly discussed. While the experiments are convincing, it would be helpful to explore the method's scalability to more complex tasks or higher-dimensional decision spaces.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in machine learning.\n- The proposed method is technically sound, novel, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.\n- The work has practical significance, particularly in domains like energy and resource management, where task-based objectives are critical.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The reliance on task-specific objectives may limit generalization.\n- The omission of related work on meta-learning is a notable gap.\n- Scalability concerns are not fully addressed, which could impact the method's applicability to larger problems.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions are significant and well-supported by theoretical and experimental results. However, the authors should address the concerns about generalization, scalability, and related work in the final version. Including a discussion of meta-learning and strategies to mitigate overfitting would further strengthen the paper."
