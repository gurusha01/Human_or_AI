            "inputText": "This paper addresses the query complexity of clustering using noiseless pairwise comparisons with random side information, providing both upper and lower bounds. The authors propose a theoretical framework for interactive clustering, demonstrating the impact of side information (e.g., a similarity matrix) on reducing query complexity. They introduce parameter-free Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms that achieve query complexity bounds close to the theoretical lower limit. Additionally, the paper explores connections to the stochastic block model (SBM), extending its applicability to more general settings. While the contributions are significant, several issues hinder the paper's overall quality.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles an important problem in interactive clustering, providing a rigorous theoretical foundation that bridges gaps between heuristics and theory. The parameter-free algorithms are particularly noteworthy for their practical relevance.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The derivation of information-theoretic lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds is a valuable addition to the literature. The use of Hellinger divergence as a key metric is well-motivated and insightful.\n3. Connections to SBM: The generalization of the stochastic block model and the exploration of its recovery threshold under query-based settings are compelling directions for future research.\n4. Algorithm Design: The iterative-update method for the Monte Carlo algorithm is a promising framework for developing parameter-free algorithms.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Writing Quality: The paper is densely written, with numerous grammar issues, typos, and unclear sentences. This significantly detracts from readability and comprehension. For example, the abstract is overly long and takes too long to introduce the main contributions.\n2. Model Presentation: The problem and model are not clearly presented. The minimax bounds lack explicit mention of cluster size restrictions, and terms like \"Monte Carlo\" and \"Las Vegas\" are used inconsistently.\n3. Uncited Relevant Work: The paper fails to cite key related works, such as generalizations of SBM and active learning for community detection. This omission weakens the contextualization of its contributions.\n4. Overstated Claims: Statements like \"we initiate a rigorous theoretical study\" and \"this is the first work that...\" are exaggerated, given the existence of prior work in related areas.\n5. Theorem 2 Issues: Theorem 2 appears incorrect for small values of \\(k\\), and its assumptions (e.g., \\(k \\to \\infty\\)) need clarification. This undermines the theoretical rigor of the lower bound.\n6. Numerical Section: The experimental results lack depth. Comparisons with existing methods are absent, and the reliance on trivial baselines limits the value of the evaluation.\n7. Abstract Length: The abstract is overly verbose and could be condensed to focus on the key contributions and results.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper makes important theoretical contributions, its presentation and clarity need significant improvement. The authors should:\n- Address grammar and writing issues through thorough proofreading.\n- Clearly present the problem, model, and assumptions.\n- Revise overstated claims and provide proper citations to related work.\n- Clarify Theorem 2 and ensure its correctness.\n- Strengthen the experimental section with meaningful comparisons to existing methods.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for interactive clustering with side information.\n- The proposed algorithms are novel, parameter-free, and computationally efficient.\n- The connections to SBM and the use of Hellinger divergence are insightful and open up new research directions.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The writing quality and clarity are poor, making the paper difficult to follow.\n- The omission of relevant prior work and overstated claims reduce the paper's credibility.\n- Theorem 2 requires further clarification and validation.\n- The experimental section is underdeveloped and lacks meaningful comparisons.\nFinal Recommendation:\nAfter considering the authors' clarifications during the rebuttal phase, I recommend acceptance, contingent on substantial revisions to address the issues outlined above. The paper's contributions are significant, but careful revision is necessary to ensure its impact and accessibility to the broader community."
