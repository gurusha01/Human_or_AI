            "inputText": "The paper addresses the problem of robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, proposing a novel algorithm, STAR-T, which constructs a robust summary of size \\( O((m \\log k + k) \\log^2 k) \\). The robustness ensures that even after the removal of up to \\( m \\) elements, a subset of size \\( k \\) can still achieve a constant-factor approximation of the optimal solution. This problem is both technically challenging and practically relevant in applications like personalized recommendations and influence maximization, where post-selection element removal is common.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contributions: The paper introduces a novel partitioning structure and exponentially decreasing thresholding rule, which are innovative and well-motivated. The theoretical guarantees, including the constant-factor approximation, are rigorously derived and supported by detailed proofs.\n2. Practical Relevance: The robust streaming model is highly relevant for large-scale machine learning tasks, especially in scenarios where data is dynamic or incomplete. The applications in personalized movie recommendations and dominating set problems demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, comparing STAR-T against strong baselines like SIEVE-STREAMING. The results show that STAR-T performs comparably or better, even when the baselines are given an unfair advantage (e.g., prior knowledge of removed elements).\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The theoretical and experimental sections are well-separated, aiding readability.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Motivation and Scope: While the technical contributions are strong, the motivation for the specific problem formulation could be better articulated. For instance, the practical scenarios described (e.g., movie recommendations) are compelling but somewhat narrow. Expanding on other potential applications could enhance the paper's appeal.\n2. Comparison with Related Work: Although the paper discusses related work, the novelty of STAR-T compared to existing robust submodular algorithms (e.g., PRO or other streaming methods) could be more explicitly highlighted. For example, a deeper discussion of the trade-offs between memory usage and approximation guarantees would strengthen the paper.\n3. Significance of Results: The constant-factor approximation achieved (0.149) is relatively low compared to some existing methods, which might limit the practical impact of the algorithm in certain applications. While the authors acknowledge this, further discussion on how this limitation could be addressed in future work would be beneficial.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper tackles a technically challenging problem and provides a novel algorithm with rigorous theoretical guarantees.\n- The proposed method is applicable to real-world scenarios and demonstrates strong empirical performance.\n- The clarity and organization of the paper make it accessible to a broad audience.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The practical motivation and broader impact of the problem formulation are not as compelling as they could be.\n- The approximation factor achieved is relatively low, which might limit the algorithm's utility in some applications.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a solid technical contribution to the field of robust submodular maximization in streaming settings. While the practical motivation and broader impact could be improved, the novelty and rigor of the approach warrant acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on strengthening the motivation and discussing the trade-offs of the proposed method in greater detail."
