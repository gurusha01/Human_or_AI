            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel two-step decoding model, referred to as deliberation networks, for neural machine translation (NMT) and text summarization. The model incorporates a second-pass decoder to refine the output of the first-pass decoder, mimicking human cognitive processes of drafting and polishing. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, including a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.5 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task and notable gains in ROUGE scores for text summarization. The approach is well-motivated and addresses a key limitation of traditional encoder-decoder frameworks by leveraging global information during decoding.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contribution: The introduction of a second-pass decoder is a meaningful extension to the encoder-decoder framework, and the use of Monte Carlo-based optimization to handle the discrete nature of intermediate outputs is innovative.\n2. Empirical Results: The paper provides strong experimental evidence of the model's effectiveness, with improvements across multiple datasets and tasks. The results are robust and include comparisons with relevant baselines such as stacked decoders and review networks.\n3. Generality: The proposed framework is applicable to multiple sequence generation tasks, demonstrating its versatility.\n4. Clarity of Methodology: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics, making it easier for researchers to reproduce the results.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Related Work and Novelty: The paper's introduction is overly dismissive of prior work, particularly in speech recognition and multi-step decoding. Claims of novelty (e.g., Line 78) are misleading as multi-step decoding has a long history in related fields. The authors should better acknowledge and contextualize their contributions within existing literature.\n2. Monte Carlo Details: While Monte Carlo methods are used for marginalization, the paper lacks clarity on key implementation details, such as sample size, the impact of hyperparameters, and the role of beam search. These omissions hinder reproducibility and a deeper understanding of the method.\n3. Writing Style: Certain phrases (e.g., Line 277) are unnecessarily pretentious and detract from the scientific tone of the paper. Additionally, Line 73 is redundant and could be removed without loss of meaning.\n4. Scope of Evaluation: While the results are impressive, the paper could benefit from broader evaluations, such as comparisons with more recent NMT models or applications beyond NMT and summarization.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a significant limitation in sequence generation and demonstrates clear empirical gains.\n- The proposed method is well-motivated, technically sound, and broadly applicable.\n- The results advance the state of the art in NMT and text summarization, making the work impactful.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of proper acknowledgment of prior work undermines the novelty claims.\n- Missing details on Monte Carlo implementation and hyperparameter tuning reduce the clarity and reproducibility of the method.\n- The tone and style of the paper could be improved to align with academic standards.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong contribution to sequence generation tasks, but the authors should address the issues related to prior work acknowledgment, provide additional details on Monte Carlo methods, and revise the writing to improve clarity and tone."
