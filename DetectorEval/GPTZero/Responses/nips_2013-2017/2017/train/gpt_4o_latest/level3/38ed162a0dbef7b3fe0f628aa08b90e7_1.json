            "inputText": "The paper presents a theoretical exploration of deep convolutional kernel networks (CKNs), focusing on their near invariance to transformations and stability to diffeomorphisms. By leveraging carefully designed operators, the authors demonstrate that these properties can be extended to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under certain assumptions. The work builds on prior research on scattering transforms and convolutional kernel networks, contributing a kernel-based framework to analyze the geometry of functional spaces where CNNs operate. This approach provides theoretical insights into the stability and invariance properties of signal representations, which are crucial for robust learning models.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is mathematically rigorous, with detailed proofs and well-founded assumptions. The authors extend existing results on scattering transforms to a broader class of CNNs and CKNs, providing a unified theoretical framework.\n2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it accessible to readers familiar with the mathematical foundations of machine learning. The inclusion of related work contextualizes the contribution effectively.\n3. Originality: The kernel-based perspective on CNNs is novel and provides a fresh lens to analyze their stability and invariance properties. The connection between kernel methods and deep learning architectures is an important theoretical contribution.\n4. Significance: The results have the potential to influence future research on the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning, particularly in understanding the stability and invariance of neural networks.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lack of Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the absence of empirical experiments limits the practical impact of the work. Demonstrating the invariance and stability properties of CKNs on real-world datasets would strengthen the paper.\n2. Feasibility of Kernel Approximation: The use of random projection or explicit kernel mapping with finite Fourier series for kernel approximation is mentioned but not explored in depth. The practical implications and computational feasibility of these methods remain unclear.\n3. Limited Discussion on Generalization: Although the paper touches on the relationship between RKHS norms and generalization, a more detailed discussion with concrete examples or experiments would enhance its applicability.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Include experimental results to validate the theoretical claims, particularly the invariance to transformations and stability to diffeomorphisms. This would bridge the gap between theory and practice.\n2. Provide a deeper analysis of the computational trade-offs and feasibility of kernel approximation techniques, such as random projections or finite Fourier series.\n3. Expand the discussion on generalization and its connection to stability, possibly with illustrative examples or synthetic experiments.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the lack of empirical validation is a significant limitation. If the authors can address this through experiments or simulations, the work would be a valuable addition to the conference. As it stands, I recommend acceptance with the condition that the authors incorporate empirical results or provide a more detailed discussion on the practical aspects of their framework."
