            "inputText": "The paper presents PRUNE, a novel unsupervised network embedding framework that integrates community-aware proximity and global node ranking preservation through a multi-task Siamese neural network. The authors propose a matrix tri-factorization-based objective function to preserve first- and second-order proximity, while also incorporating global node ranking using an upper-bound approximation of PageRank. The framework is evaluated on three real-world datasets across multiple tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.\nStrengths:\nThe paper is built on strong theoretical foundations, with detailed derivations for the proposed objective function. The authors effectively connect proximity preservation with link prediction and community detection, providing a deeper theoretical understanding of these relationships. The inclusion of global node ranking as a secondary objective is a novel contribution, and the multi-task learning approach enriches the interaction between the two objectives, leading to superior performance. Empirical results across diverse datasets and tasks consistently show that PRUNE outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DeepWalk, LINE, and node2vec. The framework also demonstrates scalability, asymmetry handling, and robustness to noisy data, which are critical for real-world applications.\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper places excessive emphasis on theoretical derivations, including some trivial lemmas (e.g., Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3), which could be condensed to improve readability. Certain sections, such as Lines 169-184, appear tangential and do not directly contribute to the main objective function, detracting from the paper's focus. While the incorporation of node ranking is novel, its integration into the framework is relatively straightforward. The authors could explore more sophisticated ways to unify proximity and ranking objectives. Additionally, the experimental presentation could be improved by reporting separate metric results for each dataset and including a broader range of baselines, such as GCN. The writing, while clear in parts, could benefit from better organization and polishing.\nEvaluation:\n- Quality: The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the overemphasis on theoretical derivations could be streamlined.\n- Clarity: The paper is generally clear but could benefit from better organization and removal of irrelevant sections. The experimental results could be presented more comprehensively.\n- Originality: The work is original in its integration of global node ranking into network embedding and its use of a multi-task Siamese neural network. The theoretical connections to community detection and link prediction are novel.\n- Significance: The results are significant, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across tasks. The framework addresses important challenges in network embedding, such as scalability and robustness.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of network embedding, with strong theoretical underpinnings and robust empirical validation. However, the authors should streamline the theoretical sections, improve the writing, and include additional baselines to strengthen the paper further."
