            "inputText": "Review\nThe paper introduces Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN) as a novel mechanism to modulate visual processing using linguistic input, applied to pre-trained ResNet architectures. This approach, termed MODERN, is motivated by neuroscience findings suggesting that language influences early visual processing. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CBN on two visual question answering (VQA) tasks, showing improvements over baseline and state-of-the-art models. The paper also provides ablation studies and insightful visualizations of feature representations, illustrating the impact of language-conditioned modulation.\nStrengths:\n1. Neurological Motivation: The paper is grounded in neuroscience findings, which provide a compelling rationale for early-stage fusion of language and vision. This interdisciplinary perspective strengthens the novelty of the work.\n2. Simplicity and Scalability: CBN is computationally efficient, requiring minimal additional parameters (<1% of ResNet parameters), making it scalable and less prone to overfitting.\n3. Experimental Rigor: The ablation studies are thorough, comparing CBN with fine-tuning strategies and demonstrating significant performance gains. The inclusion of tSNE visualizations effectively illustrates the disentangling of visual features based on linguistic input.\n4. Reproducibility: The promise of public code is commendable, ensuring transparency and enabling further exploration by the research community.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Writing and Organization: The paper is dense and could benefit from improved clarity. Section 2.1 on Batch Normalization, for instance, is overly detailed and detracts from the focus on CBN. Replacing it with a more intuitive explanation of CBN would enhance readability.\n2. Limited Generalization: While the results on VQA tasks are promising, the paper primarily focuses on vision + language tasks. Broader experiments across different modalities (e.g., sound, video) or diverse architectures would better demonstrate the generalizability of CBN.\n3. Contradictory Findings: The claim that early-stage modulation is beneficial is somewhat undermined by the observation that most performance gains are achieved at the highest stage (Stage 4). This discrepancy warrants further discussion.\n4. Redundant Figures: Figures 2 and 3 provide overlapping information and could be consolidated to streamline the presentation.\nMinor Issues:\n- The paper lacks an analysis of how different questions affect feature representations for a single image, which could provide deeper insights into the mechanism of CBN.\n- Formatting inconsistencies (e.g., citation spacing, bolding of baseline models) and minor typos detract from the overall polish of the manuscript.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\n- Pro: The paper presents a novel and efficient fusion mechanism with strong empirical results, interdisciplinary motivation, and potential applicability beyond VQA tasks.\n- Con: The scope is narrow, and the writing could be significantly improved to enhance clarity and accessibility.\nRecommendation: While the paper has some weaknesses in writing and generalization, its contributions are significant and well-supported by experiments. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and expand the discussion on generalizability and contradictory findings."
