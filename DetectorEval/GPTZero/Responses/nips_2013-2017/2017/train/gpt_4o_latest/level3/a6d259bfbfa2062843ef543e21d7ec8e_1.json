            "inputText": "The paper presents a significant contribution to the intersection of Best Arm Identification (BAI) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) by proposing novel algorithms tailored for two-player, turn-based, zero-sum games with stochastic payoffs. The authors leverage confidence intervals to propagate bounds from leaves to the root, enabling efficient identification of the best action for player A with high confidence (\\(1-\\delta\\)) and precision (\\(\\epsilon\\)). The work builds upon fixed-confidence BAI literature and introduces two specific algorithms, UGapE-MCTS and LUCB-MCTS, which adapt existing BAI techniques to arbitrary-depth game trees. The theoretical guarantees, including a new sample complexity theorem, demonstrate clear improvements over prior algorithms like FindTopWinner, while experimental results validate these claims with significant performance gains.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The algorithms are rigorously grounded in BAI theory, with clear derivations of confidence intervals and their propagation through the tree. The sample complexity analysis is detailed and demonstrates improved efficiency over existing methods.\n2. Novelty: The paper extends BAI techniques to arbitrary-depth game trees, a non-trivial generalization of prior work on depth-two trees. The integration of confidence intervals for MAX and MIN nodes is particularly innovative.\n3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, comparing the proposed algorithms against state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks. The 15-fold reduction in sample complexity in some cases is compelling evidence of the algorithms' efficacy.\n4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the algorithms, theoretical contributions, and experimental setup. The contextualization within the broader BAI and MCTS literature is thorough.\nWeaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Figure Referencing: Figure 1 should be referenced earlier in the text to aid understanding of the confidence interval construction.\n2. Notation Clarity: The need for two candidates (\\(at\\) and \\(bt\\)) at time \\(t+1\\) is not immediately intuitive and should be clarified in the algorithm descriptions.\n3. Experimental Choices: The choice of \\(\\delta = 0.1 \"\\mathcal{L}\"\\) in experiments is unconventional and could confuse readers. A simpler, standard \\(\\delta\\) value should be considered.\n4. Readability of Lemma 7: While the example aids comprehension, the lemma itself is dense and could benefit from additional explanation or a simplified presentation.\n5. Figures: Figures 3 and 4 are difficult to interpret. Figure 3 should include a line for optimal proportions, and Figure 4 should be redesigned for better readability. Additionally, displaying proportions instead of raw numbers and adding columns for algorithm names and total samples would enhance clarity.\nOverall Assessment:\nThe paper is a strong contribution to the field, advancing the state-of-the-art in MCTS with well-founded algorithms and significant empirical improvements. The theoretical and practical insights provided are likely to inspire further research in both BAI and game tree search. Despite minor issues with clarity and presentation, the paper meets the quality, originality, and significance standards of the conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the suggestions outlined above."
