            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel reduction method for multi-class classification to binary classification, particularly effective for scenarios with a large number of classes. Building on the work of Joshi et al. (2015), the authors improve the generalization analysis by leveraging fractional Rademacher complexity and propose a double sampling strategy to address class imbalance and reduce computational overhead. The method demonstrates competitive performance on large-scale datasets such as DMOZ and Wikipedia, with up to 100,000 classes, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of runtime, memory efficiency, and predictive performance.\nStrengths:\n1. Scalability and Efficiency: The proposed double sampling strategy effectively addresses the computational challenges posed by large class numbers. By balancing class distributions and reducing the size of the training set, the method achieves significant improvements in runtime and memory usage compared to traditional approaches like OVA and M-SVM.\n \n2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees, including generalization bounds using local fractional Rademacher complexity, ensuring the consistency of the empirical risk minimization principle despite the introduced sampling and inter-dependencies.\n3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the method's practical utility. The approach achieves competitive accuracy and macro F1 scores while maintaining low computational costs, making it a strong candidate for real-world applications.\n4. Comparison with Baselines: The paper benchmarks its method against a variety of baselines, including tree-based methods (FastXML, PfastReXML), embedding-based methods (PD-Sparse), and traditional approaches (OVA, M-SVM). The results highlight the proposed method's superior trade-off between performance, runtime, and memory usage.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Theoretical Analysis of Prediction Algorithm: While the paper introduces a nearest-centroid-based candidate selection strategy for prediction, it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis of its impact on performance. This omission leaves a gap in understanding the trade-offs introduced by this heuristic.\n2. Sample Complexity Discussion: The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion on sample complexity bounds and how the proposed reduction compares to non-transformed multi-class problems in terms of theoretical guarantees.\n3. Incremental Novelty: While the double sampling strategy is novel, the core reduction approach builds heavily on prior work. The paper could better emphasize its unique contributions beyond the sampling techniques.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPro:\n- The method addresses a critical challenge in large-scale multi-class classification with strong empirical and theoretical results.\n- The proposed approach is practical, scalable, and competitive with state-of-the-art methods.\n- The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including new generalization bounds.\nCon:\n- Missing theoretical analysis of the prediction algorithm limits the completeness of the work.\n- The novelty is somewhat incremental, as the reduction framework is based on prior methods.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of large-scale multi-class classification. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in theoretical analysis and novelty, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the missing theoretical discussions and better highlight the method's unique contributions."
