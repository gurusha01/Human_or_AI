            "inputText": "The paper presents a rigorous theoretical study of the query complexity for clustering with and without side information, specifically in the form of a similarity matrix \\( W \\). It establishes that without side information, \\( \\Theta(nk) \\) queries are required, while with side information, the query complexity reduces to \\( O\\left(\\frac{k^2 \\log n}{H^2(f^+ \\\" f^-)}\\right) \\), where \\( H \\) is the Hellinger distance. The results are tight up to a \\( \\log n \\) factor. The authors also propose efficient, parameter-free algorithms for clustering and provide a general framework for proving information-theoretic lower bounds in interactive clustering. The work connects to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), extending its scope to arbitrary distributions \\( f^+ \\) and \\( f^- \\), and explores how side information affects clustering thresholds.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides strong information-theoretic lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds for query complexity, which is a significant advancement in interactive clustering.\n2. Novelty: The work generalizes the SBM by allowing arbitrary distributions \\( f^+ \\) and \\( f^- \\), making it applicable to a broader range of clustering problems. The parameter-free nature of the algorithms is particularly noteworthy.\n3. Practical Relevance: The study highlights the dramatic reduction in query complexity achievable with side information, which is highly relevant for real-world applications like entity resolution and crowdsourcing.\n4. Algorithm Design: The iterative-update method for the Monte Carlo algorithm is elegant and provides a general recipe for designing parameter-free algorithms.\n5. Experimental Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed algorithms, showing their robustness even with approximate distributions.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the theoretical results are impressive, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer exposition, particularly in the proofs and algorithm descriptions. For instance, the iterative-update process could be explained more intuitively for readers unfamiliar with Sanov's theorem.\n2. Empirical Evaluation: The experimental section, though promising, is limited in scope. It would be beneficial to test the algorithms on more diverse datasets and compare them against state-of-the-art heuristic methods.\n3. Logarithmic Gap: The gap of \\( \\log n \\) between the lower and upper bounds remains unresolved, and while the authors acknowledge this, it would strengthen the paper to provide insights or conjectures on how to close this gap.\n4. Assumptions: The assumption of an error-free oracle may limit the applicability of the results in noisy real-world scenarios. While the authors mention this limitation, a discussion of potential extensions to noisy settings would be valuable.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in interactive clustering and provides significant theoretical advancements.\n- The connection to SBM and the generalization to arbitrary distributions make the work broadly applicable.\n- The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient and parameter-free, which is critical for practical applications.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The clarity of presentation could be improved, particularly for readers less familiar with the theoretical tools used.\n- The empirical evaluation is somewhat limited and does not fully explore the practical implications of the theoretical results.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of interactive clustering and query complexity. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and empirical validation, the theoretical results and algorithmic innovations are compelling. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and expand the discussion on practical implications and future directions."
