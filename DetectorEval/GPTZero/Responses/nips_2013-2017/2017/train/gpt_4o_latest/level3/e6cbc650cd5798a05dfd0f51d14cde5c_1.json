            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to sparse estimation by leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) inspired by Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). The authors draw insightful parallels between the iterative structure of SBL and the architecture of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, proposing a gated-feedback recurrent network that improves upon traditional optimization-based methods. The key idea is to unfold SBL's multi-loop majorization-minimization process into a learnable RNN structure, enabling efficient sparse estimation in challenging scenarios, such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and 3D geometry recovery.\nStrengths:\n1. Impact and Originality: The paper introduces a significant conceptual leap by demonstrating that recurrent architectures can emulate and enhance SBL. This connection between Bayesian optimization and neural networks is novel and has the potential to inspire further research in algorithmic learning and optimization.\n2. Performance: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in both synthetic and practical applications, outperforming existing optimization-based approaches and deep learning models. The empirical results, particularly for DOA estimation and photometric stereo, highlight the method's robustness and efficiency.\n3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with clear motivation and detailed numerical experiments. The authors effectively communicate the theoretical underpinnings of their approach and its practical implications.\n4. Significance: By addressing the limitations of traditional sparse estimation methods in handling correlated dictionaries, the proposed approach advances the state of the art in sparse signal recovery. The use of gated feedback networks to adaptively model multi-scale optimization trajectories is particularly impactful.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Implementation Details: While the paper is conceptually clear, key implementation details are relegated to the supplementary material. This makes it difficult for readers to fully understand or reproduce the results without consulting additional resources. Including more details in the main text would enhance the paper's accessibility.\n2. Generality: Although the proposed method is demonstrated on sparse estimation problems, its applicability to other domains with multi-loop optimization remains speculative. A broader evaluation across diverse problem settings would strengthen the paper's claims.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant contribution by bridging the gap between SBL and RNNs, offering a novel perspective on sparse estimation.\n- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both synthetic and real-world tasks, showcasing its practical utility.\n- The work is well-motivated, methodologically sound, and clearly presented.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The reliance on supplementary material for critical implementation details may hinder reproducibility.\n- The scope of the evaluation is somewhat narrow, focusing primarily on sparse estimation without exploring broader applications.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper represents a high-quality scientific contribution that is both original and impactful. While the lack of detailed implementation in the main text is a drawback, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to include more implementation details in the final version to improve reproducibility and accessibility."
