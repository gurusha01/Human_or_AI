            "inputText": "The paper investigates the impact of modifying Bitcoin's transaction-flooding protocol from the \"trickle\" method (pre-2015) to the \"diffusion\" method (post-2015) in response to deanonymization attacks. The authors claim that both protocols exhibit similar vulnerabilities to deanonymization, supported by theoretical modeling and simulations. The study is framed as an epidemic source inference problem over graphs, with a focus on maximum-likelihood estimators and their performance under both protocols.\nStrengths: \nThe paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive background on Bitcoin's P2P network, deanonymization attacks, and epidemic source detection. The modeling of Bitcoin's networking stack and adversarial capabilities is thorough, with clearly stated assumptions. A key assumption\"\"that a supernode can connect to all active Bitcoin nodes\"\"is addressed convincingly by referencing botnet capabilities. The authors also contribute novel analytical tools, such as timestamp rumor centrality, and extend existing epidemic source detection literature to Bitcoin-specific protocols. The use of both theoretical analysis and simulations on real-world Bitcoin network snapshots strengthens the validity of the results. Furthermore, the work highlights the practical implications of graph structure and adversarial resources on anonymity.\nWeaknesses: \nWhile the authors claim that both protocols perform equally in maintaining anonymity, this assertion is not fully supported by the results. Simulation data reveals notable differences: diffusion performs worse than trickle in simulations but better in real networks. This discrepancy is not adequately explained, leaving a gap in the analysis. Additionally, the definition of \"similar probabilities of detection\" is vague and requires further precision to reconcile theoretical and empirical findings. Minor issues, such as incomplete sentences and unresolved references, detract from the paper's overall clarity. Lastly, while the authors analyze regular-tree graphs as a first-order approximation of the Bitcoin network, the impact of irregularities in the real-world topology is not fully explored.\nArguments for Acceptance: \n- The paper addresses a critical and timely problem in cryptocurrency privacy. \n- It provides a novel application of epidemic source detection to Bitcoin's P2P network. \n- The modeling and simulation efforts are rigorous and grounded in real-world data. \n- The work has potential implications for improving Bitcoin's anonymity protocols.\nArguments Against Acceptance: \n- The claim of equal performance between trickle and diffusion is not conclusively demonstrated. \n- Discrepancies between simulated and real network results are insufficiently clarified. \n- Minor writing issues and unresolved references reduce the paper's polish. \nRecommendation: \nThe paper makes a valuable contribution to understanding Bitcoin's anonymity vulnerabilities but requires further clarification of its claims and results. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on addressing the discrepancies in findings, refining definitions, and improving the manuscript's clarity."
