            "inputText": "This paper presents DPSCREEN, a novel framework for determining personalized screening policies for disease detection. The method leverages patient-specific clinical history and disease-specific features, optimizing the trade-off between screening frequency and delay in disease detection. The authors model disease progression as a finite-state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state, incorporating external information (e.g., self-examinations) that can trigger unscheduled screenings. The computational challenges of solving for an exactly optimal policy are addressed through an approximately optimal policy construction using point-based value iteration (PBVI) techniques. Validation on a 45,000-patient dataset from the Athena Health Network demonstrates significant reductions in screening frequency (28-68%) without compromising detection timeliness, highlighting the practical impact of personalization.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is well-grounded in theory, with a rigorous mathematical formulation of the problem and detailed derivations of the proposed solution. The use of Bayesian updating, Bellman equations, and PBVI is appropriate and well-executed.\n2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is clearly written and logically structured, with sufficient detail to allow expert readers to reproduce the results. The inclusion of supplementary materials further enhances transparency.\n3. Originality: The work addresses a significant gap in the literature by generalizing personalized screening to a broader class of disease models, beyond the restrictive assumptions of prior works (e.g., Markovian or stationary processes). The incorporation of external information is a novel and impactful addition.\n4. Significance: The results are highly relevant to both research and clinical practice. The demonstrated reductions in screening frequency without increasing detection delays suggest substantial cost savings and improved patient outcomes. Moreover, the framework's adaptability to different diseases enhances its potential for widespread adoption.\n5. Validation: The use of a large real-world dataset and experiments across different disease types (e.g., linear vs. quadratic delay costs) provides strong empirical support for the framework's effectiveness and versatility.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Computational Complexity: While the authors address the intractability of exact solutions, the computational cost of the approximate method remains high, particularly for large state spaces or extended time horizons. Scalability to larger datasets or more complex diseases could be a concern.\n2. Assumptions: The model assumes no false positives or negatives in test outcomes, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the reliance on accurate disease progression models could limit applicability if these models are poorly estimated.\n3. Limited Comparison: While the paper compares DPSCREEN to current clinical practices, it does not benchmark against other advanced computational methods for personalized screening, such as Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning approaches.\n4. External Information Modeling: The external information process (e.g., self-examinations) is modeled simplistically and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world patient behavior.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of personalized healthcare and decision-making under uncertainty. Its methodological rigor, practical relevance, and strong empirical validation make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, addressing the scalability and robustness of the approach in future work would further strengthen its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the limitations noted above.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- Novel and generalizable framework for personalized screening.\n- Strong theoretical foundation and empirical validation.\n- Clear writing and thorough discussion of computational trade-offs.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- High computational cost and scalability concerns.\n- Simplistic modeling assumptions for external information and test outcomes.\nOverall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it represents a meaningful advancement in the field."
