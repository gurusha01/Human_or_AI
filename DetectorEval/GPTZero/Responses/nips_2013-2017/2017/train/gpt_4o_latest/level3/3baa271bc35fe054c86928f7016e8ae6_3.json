            "inputText": "The paper addresses the challenging problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint in a streaming and robust setting, where elements can be removed post-stream. This dual challenge is novel, as it combines the complexities of streaming algorithms with robustness against adversarial or random element removal. The proposed STAR-T algorithm introduces a partitioning structure and exponentially decreasing thresholding, achieving a constant-factor approximation guarantee (0.149) while retaining a compact summary of size \\(O((m \\log k + k) \\log^2 k)\\). This is a significant theoretical contribution, as achieving constant-factor approximations in such a setting is non-trivial.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the practical utility of STAR-T in influence maximization and movie recommendation tasks. Notably, it performs comparably to or better than SIEVE-STREAMING, even when the latter has prior knowledge of removed elements. This highlights the robustness of the proposed method in real-world scenarios. The ability to reuse the precomputed summary for different removal scenarios further underscores its practical value.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty: This is the first work to jointly address streaming and robust submodular maximization, filling an important gap in the literature.\n2. Theoretical Contribution: Achieving a constant-factor approximation in this setting is a notable accomplishment.\n3. Algorithm Design: The use of partitioning and thresholding techniques is innovative and well-motivated.\n4. Practical Relevance: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's applicability to real-world problems, such as influence maximization and movie recommendation.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lower Bounds: The paper does not provide non-trivial lower bounds, which would complement the upper bound results and strengthen the theoretical contribution.\n2. Analysis Clarity: The theoretical analysis is dense and poorly explained, making it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the innovation in the proofs.\n3. Simplified Objectives: The influence maximization application uses an oversimplified objective, which may limit its real-world applicability.\n4. Streaming Framework: The paper does not adequately clarify how traditional influence maximization objectives fit into the streaming framework, leaving a gap in understanding its broader applicability.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a novel and important problem, making a significant theoretical contribution.\n- The algorithm is well-designed and performs robustly in practical scenarios.\n- The results advance the state of the art in robust submodular maximization.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of lower bounds and unclear analysis weaken the theoretical rigor.\n- The oversimplified influence maximization objective limits the practical impact of the results.\nRecommendation: Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of submodular optimization and is likely to inspire future work. However, the authors should address the clarity of the analysis and provide stronger theoretical guarantees in a revised version. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
