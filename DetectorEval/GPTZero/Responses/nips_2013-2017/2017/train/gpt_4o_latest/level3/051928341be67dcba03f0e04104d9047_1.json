            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel attention mechanism for multimodal tasks, specifically targeting high-order correlations between data modalities. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, achieving state-of-the-art results on the standard VQA dataset. The proposed method introduces a probabilistic model for attention, leveraging unary, pairwise, and ternary potentials to compute attention probabilities. The paper also explores decision-making modules, comparing Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) and Multimodal Compact Trilinear Pooling (MCT) for combining attended features.\nStrengths:\nThe proposed model is well-motivated and achieves strong results, demonstrating the utility of high-order attention mechanisms. The experiments are thorough, covering both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The inclusion of unary and pairwise attention mechanisms, along with the shift to ternary potentials, is an impressive contribution that highlights the model's ability to handle multimodal data effectively. The qualitative visualizations of attention maps provide insight into the model's interpretability, and the comparison with existing methods (e.g., [7], [15]) is well-executed. The results, particularly the improvement in 3-modality models over 2-modality baselines, underscore the significance of high-order correlations.\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper suffers from clarity and organization issues, which hinder comprehension. The writing is often jumbled, and key concepts, such as the probabilistic grounding of the attention mechanism, are not formalized rigorously. The novelty of the approach is somewhat limited, as it extends existing intuitions from prior work rather than introducing fundamentally new ideas. Figures 2 and 3 are problematic: Figure 2 lacks sufficient detail to explain the system architecture, while Figure 3 is not referenced in the text, leaving its purpose unclear. Additionally, the absence of explicit trinary attention maps raises questions about the completeness of the experimental analysis. The paper would also benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work, particularly in distinguishing its contributions from prior high-order attention mechanisms.\nQuestions and Suggestions:\n1. The learned values for the linear coefficients in the marginalized potentials are not discussed. Do different modalities leverage different potential orders, and how do these coefficients influence the model's performance?\n2. The underperformance of the 2-Modalities Unary+Pairwise model compared to MCB [7] is not adequately explained. What is the intuition behind this result?\n3. Observations on using sequential MCB layers versus a single MCT layer for the decision head are missing. Including these would provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between these approaches.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper demonstrates strong results and proposes an interesting extension to attention mechanisms, the limited novelty, unclear writing, and incomplete analysis detract from its overall impact. If the authors address the clarity issues, formalize the probabilistic connections, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation (e.g., trinary attention maps), the paper could make a stronger contribution to the field. For now, I recommend a weak accept."
