            "inputText": "The paper proposes a robust statistical estimator for analyzing calcium imaging data, aiming to extract temporal activity and spatial footprints of neurons. The authors leverage M-estimation theory to derive a minimax optimal robust loss function and integrate it into a matrix factorization framework. Their algorithm, EXTRACT, is designed to address contamination issues in calcium imaging datasets, such as neuropil activity and overlapping cells, which are common challenges in neuroscience research. The authors claim that EXTRACT outperforms existing methods like CNMF and ICA in terms of signal fidelity and crosstalk reduction, as demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Relevance and Practicality: The paper addresses a critical problem in neuroscience\"\"automated cell extraction from calcium imaging datasets. The proposed robust framework could significantly improve the reliability of downstream analyses, particularly in challenging scenarios like low SNR or overlapping cells.\n2. Robustness: The use of a one-sided Huber loss function is a novel approach for handling gross contamination in calcium imaging data. The theoretical foundation of the estimator, including its minimax optimality, is well-articulated.\n3. Algorithm Efficiency: The fast fixed-point optimization routine and GPU implementation make the method computationally efficient, which is crucial for large-scale datasets.\n4. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental results, including comparisons with CNMF and ICA, showcasing the advantages of EXTRACT in terms of signal fidelity, crosstalk reduction, and robustness to neuropil contamination.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Novelty Concerns: While the robust loss function is an interesting addition, the overall framework is similar to CNMF. The novelty of the statistical framework and its contribution beyond existing methods are not entirely clear.\n2. Initialization Dependency: A major limitation is the reliance on ground truth cell locations for initialization in some experiments, as shown in Fig. 2d. This unrealistic setup undermines the practical applicability of the method and raises questions about its robustness in real-world scenarios.\n3. Evaluation Ambiguity: The claim that EXTRACT outperforms CNMF and ICA is difficult to evaluate comprehensively. The experiments lack a detailed discussion of parameter tuning and baseline fairness, which could influence the reported performance gains.\n4. Biological Misinterpretation: Line 47 incorrectly attributes non-negativity in calcium signals to photons rather than calcium regulation in neurons. This misstatement could confuse readers unfamiliar with the domain.\n5. Noise Modeling: The authors could strengthen their approach by simulating data with a Poisson distribution to better model photon shot noise, which is a key characteristic of fluorescence imaging.\nPro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:\n- Pro: The paper addresses a significant problem, provides a theoretically sound robust estimator, and demonstrates promising results on challenging datasets.\n- Con: Concerns about novelty, initialization dependency, and evaluation rigor limit the impact and generalizability of the proposed method.\nRecommendation: While the paper has notable strengths, the concerns about novelty, initialization, and evaluation need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on clarifying these issues and improving the experimental setup to reflect realistic conditions."
