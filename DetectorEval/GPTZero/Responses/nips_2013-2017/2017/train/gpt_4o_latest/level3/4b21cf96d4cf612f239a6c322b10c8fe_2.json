            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to image caption generation using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), focusing on enhancing diversity and accuracy through structured latent spaces. The authors propose two models: GMM-CVAE, which employs a Gaussian Mixture Model prior, and AG-CVAE, which introduces a novel Additive Gaussian prior that linearly combines component means. Both models aim to address the limitations of standard CVAEs with fixed Gaussian priors, which often yield captions with limited variability. The work is well-motivated, building on prior research in generative modeling for image captioning and extending it with innovative latent space structuring techniques.\nStrengths:\nThe paper is well-written and provides a clear motivation for the proposed methods. The introduction of the AG-CVAE model is particularly compelling, as it offers an interpretable mechanism for controlling caption generation based on image content. The experimental results on the MSCOCO dataset demonstrate significant improvements in diversity and accuracy over baseline methods, including LSTMs and vanilla CVAEs. The qualitative results further highlight the ability of AG-CVAE to generate diverse and contextually relevant captions. Additionally, the paper situates its contributions within the broader literature, contrasting its approach with GAN-based methods and other generative models.\nWeaknesses:\nWhile the paper is technically sound, some design choices require further clarification. For instance, the necessity of explicitly generating \\(K\\) posterior mean/variances in the encoder is not fully justified. Could directly generating these parameters yield comparable results? Additionally, the reliance on the VAE framework raises questions about whether maximum-likelihood training for the decoder, incorporating \\(z\\), might outperform the current approach. The computation of KL-divergence for GMM-CVAE is briefly described but could benefit from a more detailed explanation. Another concern is the potential inconsistency in varying \\(\\sigma_k\\) during training and testing; maintaining consistency might yield more robust results. Lastly, there is a minor typo in the text: \"maximize (an upper bound on) the likelihood\" should be corrected to \"lower bound.\"\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- Novel and well-motivated approach to structuring latent spaces in CVAEs.\n- Demonstrated improvements in diversity and accuracy over baselines.\n- Clear writing and strong experimental validation.\n- Introduces an interpretable mechanism for controlling caption generation.\nCons:\n- Some technical decisions, such as the explicit generation of \\(K\\) posterior parameters, lack sufficient justification.\n- Overuse of the VAE framework without exploring alternative training objectives.\n- Limited discussion on the impact of varying \\(\\sigma_k\\) and its consistency.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of image captioning and generative modeling. While some aspects of the methodology could be clarified or explored further, the strengths of the proposed approach outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the raised concerns in the final version."
