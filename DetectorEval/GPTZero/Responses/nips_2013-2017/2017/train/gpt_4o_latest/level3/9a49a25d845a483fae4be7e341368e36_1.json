            "inputText": "The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for pre-processing datasets to reduce algorithmic discrimination while balancing group fairness, individual fairness, and utility. The authors formulate this as a convex optimization problem and provide theoretical guarantees, including generalization error bounds. They validate the framework on two datasets, demonstrating its ability to reduce discrimination when training classifiers. While the paper addresses an important problem in algorithmic fairness and offers a novel probabilistic approach, several issues limit its impact and clarity.\nStrengths: \n1. Novelty: The proposed framework is innovative in its explicit incorporation of individual fairness through distortion constraints, alongside group fairness and utility preservation. This is a meaningful contribution to fairness-aware machine learning, particularly in pre-processing methods. \n2. Theoretical Analysis: The authors provide theoretical guarantees, including conditions for convexity (Proposition 1) and generalization error bounds (Proposition 2). These analyses strengthen the paper's technical rigor. \n3. Flexibility: The framework supports multivariate, non-binary protected variables, which is a significant advancement over existing methods like Learning Fair Representations (LFR). \n4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets (COMPAS and UCI Adult) demonstrate the framework's ability to reduce discrimination while preserving utility to some extent. \nWeaknesses: \n1. Clarity of Contributions: The introduction does not clearly articulate the paper's key contributions. The novelty of the probabilistic framework and its advantages over prior work (e.g., LFR) should be emphasized more explicitly. \n2. Convexity Discussion: While Proposition 1 establishes convexity, this result is relatively straightforward given the problem formulation. The authors fail to discuss how convexity impacts the trade-offs between utility, group fairness, and individual fairness, which would provide deeper insights. \n3. Proposition 2 Proof: The proof of Proposition 2 is confusing and appears to omit the dependence on the term \\(m\\), which is critical for understanding the sample complexity. This omission undermines the framework's learnability guarantees. \n4. Experimental Design: The empirical comparisons with LFR are unfair, as LFR's tunable parameters are not appropriately optimized. Additionally, the experiments lack fine-grained analysis, such as sensitivity to distortion constraints or discrimination parameters. Claims about controlling trade-offs between utility and fairness are not well-supported by the results. \n5. Individual Fairness: The paper does not provide evidence that the framework ensures individual fairness compared to LFR. This is a significant gap, given the emphasis on distortion constraints in the optimization. \n6. Significance: While the framework is novel, its practical impact is limited in its current form. The theoretical results are not particularly strong, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the framework's superiority over existing methods. \nRecommendation: \nThe paper addresses an important problem and proposes a novel framework with theoretical and empirical components. However, the unclear contributions, incomplete proofs, and insufficient experimental validation weaken its overall impact. I recommend acceptance only if the authors address the clarity of contributions, improve the proof of Proposition 2, and provide more robust experimental comparisons. \nPros: Novel probabilistic framework, theoretical rigor, flexibility in handling multivariate protected variables. \nCons: Unclear contributions, incomplete proofs, unfair experimental comparisons, limited practical impact. \nFinal Score: 6/10 (Marginally above acceptance threshold)."
