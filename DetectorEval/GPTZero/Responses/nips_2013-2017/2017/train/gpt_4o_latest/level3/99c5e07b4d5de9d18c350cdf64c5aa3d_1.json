            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel approach to improving intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) decoding by leveraging a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with multiscale semi-Markov (MSSM) dynamics. The authors address key limitations of the widely used Kalman filter by incorporating longer signal histories and explicitly modeling goal positions as latent states. This approach enables smoother and more accurate cursor control for individuals with tetraplegia. The paper also introduces a flexible multimodal likelihood model based on von Mises distributions, which better captures complex neural activity patterns compared to traditional cosine tuning curves. The proposed methods are validated through both offline analyses and real-time clinical trials, demonstrating significant improvements in decoding accuracy and cursor trajectory smoothness.\nStrengths: \n1. Technical Innovation: The MSSM framework is a substantial advancement over the Kalman filter, addressing its inability to model multiscale dynamics and goal-directed behavior. The flexible likelihood model further enhances the decoder's robustness by accommodating multimodal neural activity. \n2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide rigorous offline and online evaluations, showing consistent improvements in decoding accuracy, trajectory smoothness, and responsiveness. The real-time clinical trial results are particularly compelling, as they demonstrate practical applicability. \n3. Relevance and Impact: The work addresses a critical challenge in iBCI systems, with direct implications for improving the quality of life for individuals with severe motor impairments. The proposed methods could serve as a foundation for future advancements in neural decoding. \n4. Clarity of Results: The paper is well-organized, with detailed experimental results and clear comparisons to baseline models, including the Kalman filter. The inclusion of videos and supplementary material enhances reproducibility and transparency.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Initialization Requirements: The paper does not clearly specify the minimum neural recording time required to initialize the tuning curve and decoder. This omission raises questions about the practicality of deploying the system in clinical settings. \n2. Supervised Learning Dependency: The approach appears to rely on prior knowledge of goal positions during training, which may limit its applicability in unsupervised or less structured environments. The authors should clarify whether this dependency can be mitigated. \n3. Generality of Results: The real-time evaluation is limited to a single participant (T10), which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. Additional trials with a diverse participant pool would strengthen the conclusions.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance: \nPro: The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of iBCIs by addressing fundamental limitations of existing decoders. The combination of MSSM dynamics and flexible likelihood models is both novel and impactful, with strong empirical support. \nCon: The lack of clarity on initialization requirements and the reliance on supervised learning may hinder broader adoption. Additionally, the limited participant pool in clinical trials reduces confidence in the generalizability of the results.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a strong scientific contribution with high potential impact. Addressing the concerns about initialization requirements and supervised learning dependencies would further enhance its value."
