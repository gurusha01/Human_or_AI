            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel methodology for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening with the delay in disease detection. The authors propose a computationally tractable framework for approximating optimal screening policies, leveraging patient-specific medical history and external information. The methodology is applied to breast cancer screening, demonstrating significant reductions (28-68%) in the number of screenings required while maintaining comparable delays in disease detection. This work advances the state of the art in personalized healthcare by addressing limitations in existing models and offering a scalable solution applicable to a wide range of diseases.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with a rigorous formulation of the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and a detailed derivation of the Bellman equations. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the approximation error and robustness to model estimation errors, which enhances the credibility of their approach.\n2. Originality: The proposed framework generalizes existing screening models by accommodating non-Markovian disease progression, external information processes, and dynamic patient histories. This flexibility is a significant improvement over prior works that rely on restrictive assumptions about disease and test outcome models.\n3. Significance: The results are highly impactful, particularly in the context of breast cancer screening. The ability to reduce screening frequency without compromising detection delays has substantial implications for healthcare cost reduction and patient well-being. The framework's adaptability to other diseases further underscores its broader relevance.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the methodology, theoretical contributions, and experimental results. The use of real-world breast cancer data strengthens the practical applicability of the proposed approach.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Computational Complexity: While the authors address the computational intractability of exact solutions through point-based value iteration (PBVI), the proposed algorithm may still face scalability challenges for diseases with high-dimensional state spaces or longer time horizons. More discussion on computational efficiency in real-world deployment would be beneficial.\n2. Evaluation Limitations: The experimental evaluation focuses primarily on breast cancer. While the authors claim generalizability, additional experiments on other diseases with different progression dynamics and cost structures would strengthen the paper's claims.\n3. External Information Modeling: The paper assumes a specific model for external information (e.g., lump size for breast cancer). It would be helpful to discuss how the framework could adapt to other types of external information or diseases where such signals are less well-defined.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a critical problem in personalized medicine with a novel and technically robust solution.\n- It demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods in terms of both cost and delay metrics.\n- The methodology is generalizable and has the potential to influence future research in healthcare decision-making.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The computational feasibility of the approach for more complex diseases or larger datasets remains somewhat unclear.\n- The evaluation is limited to a single disease, leaving questions about the framework's adaptability to other contexts.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution by advancing personalized screening methodologies and demonstrating their practical benefits. While there are minor limitations in evaluation breadth and computational scalability, these do not detract significantly from the paper's overall quality and impact. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to expand the discussion on generalizability and computational considerations in the final version."
