The results are strong, and the attention maps suggest that the observed improvements are likely attributable to enhanced attention mechanisms rather than merely an increase in model capacity. However, I found the writing to be somewhat unclear and occasionally confusing. With additional effort, I believe the authors could refine the submission to address these issues effectively.\nStrengths:\n- The proposed model is innovative and delivers strong results. \n- The paper includes comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. \n- I am particularly impressed by the transition between unary/pairwise attentions and the final attention mechanism. That said, I would have appreciated seeing marginalized trinary attention maps included somewhere. Did I overlook these in the main text or supplementary materials? \nWeaknesses:\n- As mentioned earlier, the writing and overall presentation feel somewhat disorganized at times. \n- The novelty of the work appears somewhat limited. While the architecture is undoubtedly more sophisticated and performs better than the MCB for VQA model [7], much of the added complexity seems to involve extending the intuition of [7] to higher (trinary) and lower (unary) orders. While this is not necessarily a significant issue, I recommend that the authors more clearly articulate their contributions (including any I may have missed). \n- The probabilistic connection is not well-developed. It does not appear to be formalized enough to serve as more than a motivational framework. This is acceptable, but I suggest that the authors either formalize this connection more rigorously or revise the language to better reflect its role. \n- Figure 2 strikes an awkward balance between abstraction and detail. It is not detailed enough to fully explain the network's functionality, yet not abstract enough to clearly convey the overall approach. I recommend simplifying this figure to better highlight the generation of unary, pairwise, and trinary potentials. \n- Figure 3 is not referenced in the text, unless I missed it. \nPoints of Curiosity:\n- What values were learned for the linear coefficients used to combine the marginalized potentials in Equation (1)? It would be intriguing to see whether different modalities leveraged different potential orders. \n- I find it notable that the 2-Modalities Unary+Pairwise model underperforms MCB [7], despite their similar architectures. I was disappointed that this result was not discussed in detail. Do the authors have any intuition about this outcome? Could it be related to the shift from MCB to MCT decision computation modules? \n- The discussion regarding the use of sequential MCB layers versus a single MCT layer for the decision head was quite interesting, but no corresponding results were provided. Could the authors elaborate on their observations in this regard?"
