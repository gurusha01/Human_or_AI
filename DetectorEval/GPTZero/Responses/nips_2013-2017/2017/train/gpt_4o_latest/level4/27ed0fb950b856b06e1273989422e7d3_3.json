            "inputText": "The paper addresses the integration of long-range temporal dependencies into a Poisson factorization model with a deep architecture. Unlike prior works on dynamic Poisson factorization, this study leverages a recurrent neural network-like structure to capture long-term dependencies. Variational inference, combined with specific optimization routines, is used for parameter estimation in the neural network. While the paper demonstrates strong technical contributions, it suffers from several grammatical and factual inaccuracies, which are detailed below:\n1. The claim regarding the modeling of nonnegative numbers on lines 86-87 is incorrect. It is the Poisson Randomized Gamma distribution that is used for this purpose. \n2. The best results in Table 2 should be highlighted in bold for clarity. \n3. Although MSE/PMSE metrics are acceptable, held-out perplexity would have been a more robust indicator in the experiments presented in Section 4.2. \n4. The paper effectively addresses the limitations of prior works (references 1, 2) in modeling long-range dependencies. However, to better demonstrate the utility of the proposed method with multiple hierarchical levels, a comparison with a dynamic Poisson factorization model featuring a single-level deep architecture would have been beneficial. While the comparison with LSTM is informative, the differing learning algorithms make it insufficient to fully justify the necessity of multiple hierarchical levels in the proposed approach. \n5. The paper contains numerous grammatical errors and typographical issues that hinder readability. These include: \n -- \"unit the data\" \n -- \"Noticing the lack of capturing ..\" \n -- \"PFA factorized a count matrix\" (the tense is inconsistent with the rest of the paragraph) \n -- \"other data with different pattern long-time dependence ..\" \n -- \"Examples for this including ..\" \n -- \"shows excellent results on predict and ..\" \n -- \"However, it is rough for them ..\" \n -- \"V-dimesnion sequentially ..\" \n -- \"K-dimension latent variable ..\" \n -- \"due to the including of feature-wise\" \n -- \"recommend systems\" etc."
