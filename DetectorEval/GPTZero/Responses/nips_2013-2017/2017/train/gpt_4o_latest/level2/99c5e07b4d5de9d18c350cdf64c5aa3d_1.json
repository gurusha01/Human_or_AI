            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to improving intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) decoding by introducing a flexible tuning likelihood model and multiscale semi-Markov (MSSM) dynamics. The authors aim to address limitations in the current state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based decoders, particularly their inability to model long-term goal positions and their reliance on unimodal cosine tuning curves. The proposed MSSM model explicitly incorporates goal positions into the decoding process and leverages semi-Markov dynamics to better capture multiscale temporal dependencies. Offline experiments demonstrate significant improvements in decoding accuracy, and preliminary clinical trials show that the MSSM decoder enables smoother and more direct cursor control compared to the Kalman filter.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Innovation: The paper introduces a significant advancement over existing iBCI decoders by integrating goal positions into the latent state and employing semi-Markov dynamics. The flexible likelihood model, which accommodates multimodal and narrower tuning curves, is a notable improvement over the traditional cosine tuning model.\n2. Technical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical foundation, including derivations of the MSSM model and efficient online inference via a variant of the junction tree algorithm. The bounded approximation error guarantees add credibility to the proposed method.\n3. Experimental Validation: The paper includes both offline and real-time evaluations, demonstrating the superiority of the MSSM decoder in terms of accuracy, smoothness, and trajectory efficiency. The use of clinical trial data strengthens the practical relevance of the findings.\n4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the limitations of existing methods and how the proposed approach addresses them. Figures and experimental results are effectively used to support the claims.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Clinical Evaluation: While the offline results are robust, the real-time evaluation is limited to two sessions with a single participant. Broader testing across more participants and diverse conditions would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.\n2. Comparison Scope: The paper primarily compares the MSSM decoder to the Kalman filter. While this is the current standard, additional comparisons to other advanced decoding methods could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n3. Reproducibility: Although the theoretical details are thorough, the paper lacks sufficient implementation details (e.g., parameter settings, preprocessing steps) to ensure reproducibility. Supplementary materials are referenced but not included in the main text.\n4. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The authors do not sufficiently discuss potential challenges in deploying the MSSM decoder in real-world clinical settings, such as computational complexity or user adaptation to the new decoding paradigm.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of iBCIs by addressing critical limitations of existing decoders and demonstrating promising results. The novelty, technical rigor, and potential clinical impact outweigh the limitations, though further clinical validation and broader comparisons are needed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address reproducibility concerns and to include a more detailed discussion of limitations and future work.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- Significant improvement over the state-of-the-art Kalman filter in decoding accuracy and trajectory smoothness.\n- Novel integration of goal positions and multiscale dynamics into the decoding process.\n- Strong theoretical foundation and promising preliminary clinical results.\nCons:\n- Limited real-time evaluation with a single participant.\n- Insufficient discussion of deployment challenges and broader applicability.\nThis paper is a valuable contribution to the iBCI field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing neural information processing systems."
