            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel adaptive importance sampling scheme for coordinate descent (CD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms, addressing the computational inefficiency of gradient-based sampling in large-scale optimization problems. The authors propose a safe approximation of gradient-based sampling using upper and lower bounds on the gradient, which is provably better than uniform or fixed importance sampling. The paper makes four key contributions: (1) theoretical justification for gradient-based sampling in CD, (2) a generic and efficient adaptive sampling strategy, (3) integration of the scheme into CD and SGD for structured optimization problems, and (4) extensive numerical evidence demonstrating the scheme's efficiency.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees for the proposed sampling scheme, including proofs that it is always better than fixed importance sampling and achieves near-optimal performance under limited gradient information.\n2. Practical Efficiency: The proposed method introduces minimal computational overhead (O(n log n) per iteration), making it feasible for large-scale applications. This is a significant improvement over traditional gradient-based sampling, which requires full gradient computation.\n3. Generality: The scheme is generic and can be easily integrated into existing CD and SGD algorithms, broadening its applicability across various machine learning tasks.\n4. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed method, including faster convergence and reduced computational cost compared to fixed sampling.\n5. Constructive Use of Gradient Bounds: The novel approach of leveraging safe gradient bounds to compute an adaptive sampling distribution is innovative and addresses a key limitation of prior work.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Impact on SGD: While the method shows significant improvements for CD, its impact on SGD is less pronounced. This may limit its appeal for practitioners focused on SGD-based optimization.\n2. Dependence on Gradient Bounds: The method relies on the availability of safe upper and lower bounds for the gradient, which may not always be straightforward to compute for more complex models.\n3. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. Simplifying some of the mathematical derivations or providing more intuitive explanations could improve clarity.\n4. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the paper demonstrates improvements over fixed sampling, it does not thoroughly compare the proposed method with other recent adaptive sampling strategies, leaving its relative performance unclear.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization by addressing a critical limitation of adaptive importance sampling. Its theoretical rigor, practical efficiency, and empirical validation make it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, the authors should consider clarifying the presentation and providing a more comprehensive comparison with related work. Additionally, discussing potential extensions to more complex models or addressing the limited impact on SGD would strengthen the paper further.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- Strong theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.\n- Demonstrated improvements in convergence and computational cost for CD.\n- Generic applicability to existing optimization algorithms.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Limited empirical impact on SGD.\n- Reliance on safe gradient bounds, which may not generalize to all models.\n- Dense presentation that could be more accessible.\nOverall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the aforementioned weaknesses."
