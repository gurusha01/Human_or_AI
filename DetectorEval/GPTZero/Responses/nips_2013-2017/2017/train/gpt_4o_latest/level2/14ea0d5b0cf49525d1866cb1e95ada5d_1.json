            "inputText": "The paper addresses the challenging problem of large-scale multi-class classification by proposing a novel double sampling strategy combined with a multi-class-to-binary reduction approach. The key contribution is a (Ï€, Îº)-double sampling method that mitigates the computational and memory overhead associated with long-tailed class distributions and the expansion of training data in dyadic space. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the consistency of their approach using local fractional Rademacher complexity and validate it empirically on large datasets such as DMOZ and Wikipedia collections with up to 100,000 classes.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Rigor: The paper introduces a unique double sampling strategy that balances class distributions and reduces computational complexity. The theoretical analysis, including generalization bounds derived using local Rademacher complexities, is robust and well-grounded.\n2. Scalability: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in runtime and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it highly suitable for extreme classification tasks.\n3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets validate the approach, showing competitive predictive performance (accuracy and macro F1) while maintaining low computational costs. The method outperforms tree-based approaches and is competitive with other baselines like PD-Sparse.\n4. Practical Relevance: The use of class centroids for candidate selection during prediction is a practical and efficient solution for large-scale scenarios.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations of key concepts, such as the dyadic transformation and the intuition behind the double sampling strategy. A more detailed discussion of the algorithm's hyperparameters and their impact on performance would also be helpful.\n2. Limited Comparison: Although the paper compares its method with several baselines, it excludes some recent approaches (e.g., SLEEC, LEML) that might provide additional insights into the relative performance of the proposed method.\n3. Generality: The focus on text classification datasets raises questions about the generalizability of the approach to other domains, such as image or recommendation systems. While the authors briefly mention this, empirical evidence is lacking.\n4. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss potential limitations, such as the sensitivity of the method to the choice of sampling probabilities (Ï€) and the number of adversarial classes (Îº).\nRecommendation:\nThe paper makes a strong contribution to the field of extreme multi-class classification, particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency. The theoretical guarantees and empirical results are compelling, and the approach is likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners. However, the clarity of presentation and the scope of comparisons could be improved. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and include a more detailed discussion of the method's limitations and generalizability.\nPro Arguments:\n- Novel and theoretically sound approach.\n- Significant improvements in runtime and memory usage.\n- Strong empirical results on large-scale datasets.\nCon Arguments:\n- Dense and complex presentation.\n- Limited comparison with some recent methods.\n- Lack of empirical evidence for generalizability across domains.\nOverall Rating: 8/10"
