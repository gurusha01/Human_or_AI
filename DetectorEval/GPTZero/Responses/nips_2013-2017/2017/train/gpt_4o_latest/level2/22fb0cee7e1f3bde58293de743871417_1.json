            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the delay in disease detection. The authors model disease progression as a finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate external information, such as patient self-examinations, into the decision-making process. The proposed methodology is computationally efficient, providing an approximately optimal policy through a point-based value iteration (PBVI) approach. The framework is demonstrated using a large breast cancer dataset, achieving significant reductions (28-68%) in the number of screenings compared to existing clinical policies while maintaining similar delays in disease detection.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in personalized healthcare. Unlike prior works, it generalizes across various disease models and incorporates external information, making it applicable to a wide range of diseases.\n2. Technical Rigor: The authors provide a detailed mathematical formulation of the problem, including Bayesian belief updates and Bellman equations, and derive theoretical guarantees for the approximation error of their method.\n3. Practical Impact: The experimental results on breast cancer screening demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed approach, with substantial reductions in screenings while maintaining detection delays. The inclusion of both low- and high-risk patient groups highlights the framework's ability to personalize policies effectively.\n4. Robustness: The paper accounts for model estimation errors and demonstrates that the proposed approach is robust to such inaccuracies, which is crucial for real-world deployment.\n5. Comparison with Benchmarks: The authors provide a thorough comparison with existing clinical policies and demonstrate clear advantages in terms of efficiency and personalization.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the technical content is strong, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations of key concepts, especially for readers unfamiliar with POMDPs or Bayesian belief updates. For instance, the description of the approximation algorithm (PBVI) could be simplified for better accessibility.\n2. Evaluation Scope: The experimental evaluation focuses primarily on breast cancer. While the authors discuss generalizability, additional experiments on other diseases (e.g., cardiovascular or colon cancer) would strengthen the claim of broad applicability.\n3. Assumptions: The model assumes no false positives or negatives in test outcomes, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. A discussion of how the framework could handle imperfect test accuracy would improve the paper's practical relevance.\n4. Computational Complexity: Although the authors propose a tractable approximation, the computational requirements for large-scale implementation are not fully addressed. Scalability to larger datasets or longer time horizons remains unclear.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of personalized healthcare and computational decision-making. Its novel methodology, strong theoretical foundation, and practical demonstration on breast cancer screening make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, improving clarity and expanding the evaluation to other diseases would further enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- Novel and generalizable framework for personalized screening.\n- Strong experimental results with significant practical implications.\n- Rigorous theoretical analysis and robustness to estimation errors.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Limited evaluation scope (focus on breast cancer only).\n- Dense presentation that may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.\nFinal Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions."
