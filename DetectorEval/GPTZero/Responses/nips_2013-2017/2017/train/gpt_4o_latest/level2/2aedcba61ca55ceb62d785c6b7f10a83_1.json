            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to high-dimensional nonparametric regression by addressing the limitations of traditional additive models, which neglect interactions between predictor variables. The authors propose a method to identify intrinsic group additive structures and estimate nonparametric functions using a structure-penalized kernel method. The key contributions include the rigorous definition of intrinsic group additive structures, a complexity measure for group additive structures, and algorithms for structure identification. The method demonstrates consistency in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure and is validated through simulations and real-world applications.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Rigor: The paper introduces a unique framework for group additive modeling, bridging the gap between traditional additive models and higher-order interaction models. The rigorous definition of intrinsic group additive structures and the theoretical guarantees of consistency are significant contributions.\n2. Practical Relevance: The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in high-dimensional regression—balancing interpretability and flexibility—making it a valuable tool for practitioners.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors validate their method through extensive simulations and real-world applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying true group structures and providing interpretable results.\n4. Algorithmic Development: The paper presents both exhaustive search and stepwise algorithms, catering to scenarios with varying computational constraints. The backward stepwise algorithm is particularly useful for large-scale problems.\n5. Connection to Existing Work: The authors situate their work well within the literature, highlighting connections to graphical models and kernel methods while addressing gaps in prior approaches.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Computational Complexity: The exhaustive search algorithm is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional data. While the stepwise algorithm mitigates this issue, its greedy nature may fail to identify the true group structure in some cases, as seen in the simulations.\n2. Limited Real-World Applications: The paper provides only two real-world examples, which may not fully capture the method's robustness across diverse domains. Additional applications would strengthen its practical appeal.\n3. Parameter Tuning: The method relies on multiple tuning parameters (e.g., λ, µ, α), and the selection process, while addressed, could be more thoroughly explored. The impact of these parameters on performance warrants further discussion.\n4. Interpretability of Complexity Measure: While the complexity measure based on covering numbers is theoretically sound, its practical interpretation and implications for model selection could be better articulated.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Develop more efficient algorithms to address the computational challenges of exhaustive search and improve the robustness of the stepwise approach.\n2. Include more real-world datasets to demonstrate the method's generalizability and practical utility.\n3. Provide a more detailed discussion on the sensitivity of the method to tuning parameters and explore automated strategies for parameter selection.\n4. Investigate alternative complexity measures or penalty functions that may enhance the method's performance.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional nonparametric regression by introducing a novel framework for group additive modeling. Despite some limitations, the theoretical rigor, practical relevance, and promising results make it a strong candidate for acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on addressing computational efficiency and expanding real-world applications."
