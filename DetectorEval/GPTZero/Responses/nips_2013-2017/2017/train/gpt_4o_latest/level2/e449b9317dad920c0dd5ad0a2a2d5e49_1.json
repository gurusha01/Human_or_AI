            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach for automated cell extraction in calcium imaging datasets using robust statistical estimation. The authors propose a minimax optimal M-estimator, termed the \"one-sided Huber estimator,\" to address contamination issues inherent in calcium imaging data, such as non-Gaussian noise, neuropil activity, and overlapping cells. The paper introduces a fast fixed-point optimization routine for the proposed loss function, enabling efficient large-scale implementation. The method, named EXTRACT, is validated on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods like CNMF and ICA in terms of signal fidelity, crosstalk reduction, and robustness to contamination.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a robust estimation framework tailored to the unique characteristics of calcium imaging data. The use of the one-sided Huber estimator is a novel contribution, and its theoretical properties, including minimax optimality, are rigorously established.\n2. Technical Soundness: The proposed method is well-supported by theoretical analysis, including proofs of convergence and robustness. The fast fixed-point solver is a practical innovation that balances computational efficiency with accuracy.\n3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, showcasing the superiority of EXTRACT over existing methods. The inclusion of challenging scenarios, such as neuropil contamination and low SNR, strengthens the claims.\n4. Practical Relevance: The method addresses a critical bottleneck in neuroscience research by improving the accuracy and robustness of cell extraction, a foundational step in calcium imaging analysis. The GPU implementation further enhances its utility for large-scale datasets.\nWeaknesses\n1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, some sections, particularly the mathematical derivations, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with robust estimation. Simplifying or summarizing key equations could improve accessibility.\n2. Comparison with Related Work: Although the paper references prior methods like CNMF and ICA, the discussion of related work could be expanded to provide a clearer context for the novelty of the one-sided Huber estimator.\n3. Limitations and Generalizability: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of EXTRACT, such as its performance in extremely low SNR regimes or its sensitivity to parameter tuning (e.g., รยบ). Acknowledging these limitations would provide a more balanced perspective.\n4. Reproducibility: While the algorithm is described in detail, the paper does not provide access to code or implementation details, which could hinder reproducibility.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper addresses a significant problem in neuroscience with a novel and well-supported approach.\n- The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods, making the contribution impactful.\n- The theoretical rigor and practical implementation (e.g., GPU compatibility) highlight the robustness and scalability of the method.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The dense presentation of mathematical details may limit accessibility to a broader audience.\n- The lack of explicit discussion on limitations and reproducibility could raise concerns about the generalizability of the method.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a significant and well-validated contribution to the field of calcium imaging analysis. However, the authors are encouraged to improve the clarity of the presentation, expand the discussion of related work, and explicitly address limitations in a future revision."
