            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel deep supervised discrete hashing (DSDH) algorithm aimed at improving image retrieval by addressing limitations in existing deep hashing methods. The primary contributions include: (1) constraining the last layer of the CNN to output binary codes directly, leveraging both pairwise label information and classification information within a unified framework; (2) reducing quantization error by maintaining the discrete nature of hash codes during optimization; and (3) demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets through extensive experiments.\nStrengths:\n1. Innovative Framework: The integration of pairwise label information and classification information in a single-stream framework is a significant improvement over prior two-stream approaches. This design ensures that the classification stream directly impacts the hash function, enhancing retrieval performance.\n2. Optimization Approach: The use of an alternating minimization method to optimize the discrete nature of hash codes is well-justified and addresses the quantization loss often seen in other methods.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE) under different settings. The proposed method consistently outperforms both traditional and deep hashing methods, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.\n4. Practical Significance: The algorithm achieves notable improvements in Mean Average Precision (MAP) scores, which are critical for real-world image retrieval tasks. The results highlight its practical utility for large-scale image datasets.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge challenges in multi-label datasets like NUS-WIDE, the paper lacks a detailed discussion of other potential limitations, such as scalability to extremely large datasets or computational overhead during training.\n2. Comparison Scope: Although the paper compares its method against several traditional and deep hashing methods, it does not benchmark against more recent or advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., transformer-based models) that could potentially influence retrieval performance.\n3. Reproducibility: While the optimization process is described in detail, the paper does not provide sufficient implementation details (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, training time, hardware specifications) to ensure full reproducibility.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Include a more thorough discussion of the method's limitations, particularly in terms of computational complexity and scalability.\n2. Expand the comparison to include more recent deep learning-based retrieval methods to better contextualize the contributions.\n3. Provide implementation details or release the code to enhance reproducibility and encourage adoption by the research community.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper is technically sound, well-organized, and presents a novel contribution to the field of deep hashing for image retrieval. Its strengths in methodology and experimental validation outweigh the minor weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the reproducibility and limitation discussions. This work is likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners in the field of image retrieval."
