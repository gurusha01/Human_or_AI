            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into Gaussian process (GP) regression models. The authors propose a method for designing the covariance function of a multivariate GP that guarantees any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points. The paper is well-written, and the contribution is significant, as it addresses a challenging problem in GP regression.\nThe strengths of the paper include its clear and concise presentation, effective use of examples to illustrate the method, and thorough experimental validation. The authors demonstrate the benefits of their approach through simulations and real-data experiments, showing improved performance compared to alternative methods. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the novelty and significance of the proposed method.\nOne weakness of the paper is the lack of clarity in Section 2, where the term \"performance\" is mentioned without specifying the evaluation metrics, except for a reference to mean average precision. Additionally, the paper could benefit from further proofreading to correct a few typos that were overlooked.\nThe paper's originality and significance are evident in its contribution to the field of GP regression. The proposed method is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and its ability to incorporate linear operator constraints into the covariance function is a unique feature. The paper's results are important, as they demonstrate the potential of GP regression in modeling complex relationships between variables while enforcing physical or other constraints.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear presentation of the methodology. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper's clarity is generally good, although some minor improvements could be made to enhance readability.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a notable contribution to the field of GP regression and demonstrates significant potential for applications in various domains. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and its originality, significance, and quality make it a valuable addition to the conference program.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of GP regression.\n* The proposed method is well-motivated, and its benefits are demonstrated through thorough experimental validation.\n* The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the novelty and significance of the proposed method.\n* The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks clarity in Section 2, where the term \"performance\" is mentioned without specifying the evaluation metrics.\n* The paper could benefit from further proofreading to correct a few typos that were overlooked."
