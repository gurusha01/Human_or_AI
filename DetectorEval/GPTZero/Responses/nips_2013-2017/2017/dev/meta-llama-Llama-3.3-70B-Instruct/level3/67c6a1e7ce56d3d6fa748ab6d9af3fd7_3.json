            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate Gaussian process (GP). The authors demonstrate that by transforming the target function using a linear operator, they can guarantee that any sample drawn from the resulting GP will obey the constraints in all points. The method is shown to outperform alternative approaches, including the use of artificial observations, in both simulated and real-data experiments.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and methodology behind the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature on GP regression and constraint handling. The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle multivariate problems with linear constraints, which is a challenging task due to the correlation between output components. The authors propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and demonstrate its effectiveness in various experiments.\nHowever, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement. The authors assume that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function, which may not always be the case. It would be desirable to describe the requirements on the transformation operator more rigorously and to explore the existence of such a potential function. Additionally, the method relies on a parametric ansatz, which may require iteration and may not always converge to the optimal solution.\nIn terms of novelty, the paper builds upon existing work on GP regression and constraint handling, but the proposed approach is distinct and offers a new perspective on the problem. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature and provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from and improves upon existing methods.\nOverall, I would rate the quality of the paper as high, with a clear and well-motivated methodology, convincing experimental results, and a good understanding of the existing literature. The paper demonstrates a significant contribution to the field of GP regression and constraint handling, and I believe it has the potential to be a valuable addition to the conference program.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate GP.\n* The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature and provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from and improves upon existing methods.\n* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The method relies on a parametric ansatz, which may require iteration and may not always converge to the optimal solution.\n* The authors assume that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function, which may not always be the case.\n* The paper could benefit from a more rigorous description of the requirements on the transformation operator and exploration of the existence of such a potential function."
