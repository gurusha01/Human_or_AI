            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed methodology, called Yet Another Spike Sorter (YASS), improves upon existing approaches by introducing a \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach, which enables more robust and scalable spike sorting.\nThe paper's strengths include its technical soundness, with a clear and well-organized presentation of the methodology and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, comparing it to several state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. The results demonstrate that YASS outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.\nThe paper's originality lies in its novel combination of techniques, including a neural network-based detection method, a coreset construction approach for efficient clustering, and a divide-and-conquer strategy for parallel processing. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs and scalability of their approach, making it a significant contribution to the field.\nHowever, the paper's dense writing style and lack of discussion on certain parameters and theoretical bounds are notable weaknesses. The authors could benefit from providing more intuitive explanations of their methodology and results, as well as more detailed comparisons to existing work.\nIn terms of significance, the paper addresses a critical problem in neuroscience research, and the proposed methodology has the potential to make a major practical and scientific impact. The authors' plan to continue iteratively updating their pipeline to better handle template drift, refractory violations, and dense collisions is a promising direction for future work.\nOverall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, citing its technical soundness, originality, and significance. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it makes a valuable contribution to the field of neuroscience research.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* Technical soundness: The paper presents a clear and well-organized methodology and experimental results.\n* Originality: The proposed approach combines novel techniques, including neural network-based detection and coreset construction.\n* Significance: The paper addresses a critical problem in neuroscience research and has the potential to make a major practical and scientific impact.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Dense writing style: The paper's writing style is dense and may be difficult to follow for non-experts.\n* Lack of discussion: The authors could benefit from providing more detailed comparisons to existing work and discussing certain parameters and theoretical bounds."
