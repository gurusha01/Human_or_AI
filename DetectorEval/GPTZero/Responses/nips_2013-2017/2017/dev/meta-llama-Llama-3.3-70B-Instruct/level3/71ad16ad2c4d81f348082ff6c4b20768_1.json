            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to encoding linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a Gaussian process (GP) for multivariate regression problems. The method ensures that any sample drawn from the resulting GP will satisfy the constraints in the entire domain. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical simulations and a real-data experiment, showing improved performance compared to alternative methods.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their proposed solution. The technical details are thoroughly explained, and the notation is consistent throughout the paper. The experimental results are convincing, and the comparison to other methods is fair and informative.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to incorporate linear constraints into the GP framework in a continuous manner, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on approximations or finite representations. The authors also provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator, which is a crucial component of their approach.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the method. The proposed approach is not general and lacks theory to support its effectiveness beyond special cases. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that further research is needed to develop a more rigorous framework. Additionally, the paper contains an error in claiming that the prior for f inherits properties from the prior for g, which is not the case due to the differential operator.\nThe equation \"fi = \\Phii \\xi f\" is an ansatz and should be clearly labeled as such, rather than presented as being without loss of generality. The limited generality of the method should also be acknowledged, potentially with an example of where it fails to demonstrate its limitations.\nIn terms of related work, the authors provide a comprehensive review of existing methods for incorporating constraints into GP regression. However, they should discuss their work in relation to \"Learning with Algebraic Invariances, and the Invariant Kernel Trick\" to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their approach.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is interesting and worthy of inclusion in NIPS proceedings. However, the authors should address the limitations and errors mentioned above to strengthen their contribution.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to encoding linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a GP.\n* The method ensures that any sample drawn from the resulting GP will satisfy the constraints in the entire domain.\n* The experimental results are convincing, and the comparison to other methods is fair and informative.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The proposed approach is not general and lacks theory to support its effectiveness beyond special cases.\n* The paper contains an error in claiming that the prior for f inherits properties from the prior for g.\n* The limited generality of the method should be acknowledged, potentially with an example of where it fails to demonstrate its limitations."
