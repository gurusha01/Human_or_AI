The authors extend the matrix-based LiFE model to a tensor-based LiFE_sd model, reducing the size of the LiFE model while maintaining approximation accuracy. They apply tensor decomposition methods to estimate the brain connectome, a crucial aspect of neuroscience that can handle big data.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-organized analysis of the results, including accuracy and size compression, when comparing the LiFE_sd model with the matrix-based model. The writing is concise and easy to understand, making it accessible to a broad audience. The methodology aspect of the paper has limited novelty, as the ENCODE part has already been proposed, and the incremental contribution is minor.\nHowever, the experiment is missing a comparison of the optimized connectome with the LiFE model, which is necessary to see the performance differences and effectiveness of the tensor-based LiFE_sd model. Despite this limitation, the paper demonstrates the potential of the proposed technique in improving the state-of-the-art in imperfect-information games.\nThe significance of this work lies in its ability to advance the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in applications such as negotiation, auctions, cybersecurity, and physical security. The results show that the proposed technique can lead to far lower exploitability, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper is excellent, making it easy to follow and understand the concepts and ideas presented.\nThe originality of the paper is evident in its novel combination of familiar techniques, and the related work is adequately referenced. The significance of the results is substantial, as they address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel subgame-solving technique that outperforms prior methods in both theory and practice.\n* The authors demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique in improving the state-of-the-art in imperfect-information games.\n* The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\n* The clarity of the paper is excellent, making it easy to follow and understand the concepts and ideas presented.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The methodology aspect of the paper has limited novelty, as the ENCODE part has already been proposed, and the incremental contribution is minor.\n* The experiment is missing a comparison of the optimized connectome with the LiFE model, which is necessary to see the performance differences and effectiveness of the tensor-based LiFE_sd model."
