The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in various experiments, including heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, and showcase its potential in developing AI systems that can defeat top human professionals.\nThe paper's strengths lie in its thorough analysis of the limitations of existing subgame-solving techniques and its introduction of a new method, Reach subgame solving, which considers the opponent's potential actions and their impact on the game's outcome. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical formulations and algorithmic details, making it easier to understand and replicate their results.\nHowever, the paper's writing style is sometimes opaque, and the authors could benefit from clarifying their presentation by including more critical mathematical and algorithmic details in the main paper. Additionally, the comparisons made between the proposed method, YASS, and other approaches are not always clear, particularly with regards to the use of hand-labeled data, which is required for YASS but not for all comparison methods.\nThe novelty of the YASS pipeline is also questionable, as many of its components are derivative of previous work. To address this concern, the authors should provide a performance breakdown to demonstrate the impact of their novel contributions. Furthermore, the method's design choice to discard signals that appear on multiple electrodes may be disadvantageous and affects the comparison with other methods, such as Kilosort.\nDespite these limitations, the paper's results are impressive, and the authors' commitment to including a performance breakdown is commendable. The introduction of Reach subgame solving and its application to nested subgame solving in response to opponent off-tree actions is a significant advancement in the field. The paper's significance lies in its potential to improve the state-of-the-art in imperfect-information games and its potential applications in various domains, such as negotiation, auctions, and cybersecurity.\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of imperfect-information games, and its results have significant implications for the development of AI systems that can compete with top human professionals. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a worthwhile read for researchers and practitioners in the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel subgame-solving technique that outperforms prior methods in both theory and practice.\n* The authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including mathematical formulations and algorithmic details.\n* The paper's results are impressive, and the authors' commitment to including a performance breakdown is commendable.\n* The introduction of Reach subgame solving and its application to nested subgame solving in response to opponent off-tree actions is a significant advancement in the field.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper's writing style is sometimes opaque, and the authors could benefit from clarifying their presentation.\n* The comparisons made between YASS and other approaches are not always clear, particularly with regards to the use of hand-labeled data.\n* The novelty of the YASS pipeline is questionable, as many of its components are derivative of previous work.\n* The method's design choice to discard signals that appear on multiple electrodes may be disadvantageous and affects the comparison with other methods."
