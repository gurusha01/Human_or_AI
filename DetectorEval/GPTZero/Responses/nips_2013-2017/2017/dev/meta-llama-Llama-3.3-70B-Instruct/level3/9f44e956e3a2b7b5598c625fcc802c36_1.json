            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a new learning algorithm that achieves O(âˆšT) expected regret and constraint violations, and O(âˆšT log(T)) high probability regret and constraint violations. The algorithm is based on a drift-plus-penalty approach, which minimizes an upper bound of the drift-plus-penalty expression at each round.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem setting and the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and thorough, with a detailed proof of the expected and high probability performance bounds. The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application, namely online job scheduling in distributed data centers.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed algorithm is novel and addresses a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting.\n* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides a clear understanding of the algorithm's performance.\n* The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The algorithm's computational complexity is not explicitly discussed, which may be a concern for large-scale applications.\n* The experiment section is limited to a single application, and it would be beneficial to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in other domains.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in a real-world application.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel algorithm for OCO with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting.\n* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides a clear understanding of the algorithm's performance.\n* The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The algorithm's computational complexity is not explicitly discussed, which may be a concern for large-scale applications.\n* The experiment section is limited to a single application, and it would be beneficial to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in other domains.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to address the computational complexity and experiment section limitations."
