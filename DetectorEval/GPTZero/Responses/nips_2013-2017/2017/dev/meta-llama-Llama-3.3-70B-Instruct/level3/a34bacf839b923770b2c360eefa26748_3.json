            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel framework, HYBRID, for estimating the probability mass function of point processes, which is a crucial problem in modeling user activities in social sciences. The authors reformulate the prediction problem and derive a differential-difference equation, known as the mass transport equation, to compute the conditional probability mass function. This equation is then solved using a scalable algorithm, which efficiently transports the initial mass to the mass at time t.\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed framework is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks with an arbitrary function f, making it a significant improvement over existing methods that are problem-specific or rely on specific parameterizations of intensity functions. Secondly, the authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the framework, including the derivation of the mass transport equation and the proof of its properties. Thirdly, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HYBRID over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\nHowever, there are some aspects that require clarification. For instance, it is not clear whether the intensity function is pre-defined or learned from the data. The generation of history samples suggests that the intensity function might be pre-defined, but this needs to be explicitly stated. Additionally, the conclusion about the running time of HYBRID compared to Monte Carlo methods may not hold when the target is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the probability mass function itself, rather than just the MAPE on Î¼.\nIn terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques, including the use of mass transport equations and scalable algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide an efficient and accurate estimator of the probability mass function of point processes, which has numerous applications in social sciences, such as predicting user activities and inferring the popularity of items in recommender systems. The experimental results demonstrate the practical importance of the proposed framework, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work advances the state of the art in this area.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their framework and its properties. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of HYBRID over state-of-the-art methods. However, some aspects require clarification, and the authors should address these in their final version.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel framework for estimating the probability mass function of point processes.\n* The framework is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks with an arbitrary function f.\n* The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the framework.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HYBRID over state-of-the-art methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper lacks clarity on whether the intensity function is pre-defined or learned from the data.\n* The conclusion about the running time of HYBRID compared to Monte Carlo methods may not hold when the target is the MAPE of the probability mass function itself.\n* Some aspects of the paper require further clarification and explanation."
