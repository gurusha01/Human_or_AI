            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate Gaussian process (GP). The method, based on transforming the target function using a linear operator, guarantees that any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical simulations and real-data experiments, showing improved performance compared to alternative methods.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning. The introduction provides a concise overview of the problem and the proposed solution, while the subsequent sections delve into the technical details of the method. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, providing a convincing demonstration of the approach's benefits.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to incorporate linear constraints into the GP framework in a continuous manner, rather than relying on approximations or finite representations. This is a significant advantage over existing methods, which may only satisfy constraints approximately or in a limited set of points. The authors also provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator, making it easier to apply the method in practice.\nHowever, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more detailed analysis or comparison with prior work, particularly in terms of computational complexity. While the method is shown to be effective, it is not clear how it compares to other approaches in terms of efficiency or scalability. Additionally, the authors could explore the potential advantages of using different loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss, to further improve the empirical strength of the results.\nIn terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques, leveraging the transformation property of GPs to incorporate linear constraints into the covariance function. The approach is well-motivated and clearly explained, making it easy to understand the authors' contributions. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences between the proposed method and existing approaches.\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Gaussian processes, providing a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function. The authors demonstrate the method's benefits through thorough experiments and provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their work. With some additional analysis and comparison to prior work, this paper has the potential to make a lasting impact in the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a GP.\n* The method guarantees that any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points, providing a significant advantage over existing methods.\n* The authors demonstrate the approach's benefits through thorough numerical simulations and real-data experiments.\n* The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis or comparison with prior work, particularly in terms of computational complexity.\n* The authors could explore the potential advantages of using different loss functions to further improve the empirical strength of the results.\n* The method relies on the requirement that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function, which may not always be the case."
