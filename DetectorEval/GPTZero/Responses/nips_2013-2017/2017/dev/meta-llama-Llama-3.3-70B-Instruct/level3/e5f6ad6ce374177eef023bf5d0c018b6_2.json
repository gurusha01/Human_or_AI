            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into Gaussian processes (GPs), which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors propose a method for designing the covariance function of a multivariate GP subject to known linear operator constraints on the target function, ensuring that any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem formulation, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The use of a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and the illustration of the result on both simulated and real-data examples are particularly noteworthy.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into GPs, which has the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of GP models in various applications.\n* The provision of a clear and concise explanation of the problem formulation and the proposed approach, making it easy to follow and understand.\n* The use of simulated and real-data examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which helps to build confidence in the results.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for incorporating constraints into GPs, such as the use of artificial observations or finite-dimensional GP-approximations.\n* The experimental section could be stronger with more datasets and comparisons, particularly in terms of evaluating the performance of the proposed approach in different scenarios and applications.\n* The loss function used is not explicitly formulated, and it is assumed to be a mean squared error (MSE) loss, which may not be suitable for multimodal future distributions.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a novel contribution to the field. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into GPs, which has the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of GP models.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the problem formulation and the proposed approach.\n* The use of simulated and real-data examples demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for incorporating constraints into GPs.\n* The experimental section could be stronger with more datasets and comparisons.\n* The loss function used is not explicitly formulated, and it may not be suitable for multimodal future distributions.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of GP models in various applications. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to further strengthen the paper."
