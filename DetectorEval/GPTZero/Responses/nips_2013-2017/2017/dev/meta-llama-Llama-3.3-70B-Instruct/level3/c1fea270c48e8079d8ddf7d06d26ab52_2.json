            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), which is a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed pipeline, called YASS, is based on a multistage \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach that combines efficient detection, clustering, and deconvolution techniques to improve the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of spike sorting.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough background on the importance of spike sorting and the challenges associated with it, particularly in the context of dense MEAs. The methods section is detailed and well-structured, with each stage of the pipeline explained clearly and concisely.\nThe results section presents a comprehensive evaluation of YASS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of YASS, and discuss the implications of their findings.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors have done an excellent job of presenting their methodology and results in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for readers to understand and follow their arguments. The paper is also well-motivated, with a clear explanation of the importance of spike sorting and the challenges associated with it.\nHowever, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors claim that their pipeline improves on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability, but it would be helpful to provide more context on the current state-of-the-art results to signify the importance of their contribution. Additionally, the bounds in the paper should specify whether they apply to integer-valued functions and whether the algorithms are weakly or strongly polynomial.\nFurthermore, the relationship between C_i and r should be clarified, and the results should be compared to the state-of-the-art submodular minimization running time. The definition of epsilon-approximate in Corollary 3.4 needs to be provided for better understanding. The algorithms should be presented using \\algorithm environments instead of plain text for clearer representation.\nIn terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, including neural network-based detection, coreset construction, and Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering. The authors have also made significant contributions to the field by providing a highly scalable and efficient pipeline for spike sorting.\nOverall, this is a strong paper that presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be even stronger and more impactful. \nArguments pro acceptance:\n- The paper presents a novel and efficient pipeline for spike sorting on dense MEAs.\n- The pipeline is highly scalable and efficient, making it suitable for large-scale neuroscience applications.\n- The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their pipeline on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nArguments con acceptance:\n- The paper could benefit from more context on the current state-of-the-art results to signify the importance of their contribution.\n- The bounds in the paper should specify whether they apply to integer-valued functions and whether the algorithms are weakly or strongly polynomial.\n- The relationship between C_i and r should be clarified, and the results should be compared to the state-of-the-art submodular minimization running time."
