            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate Gaussian process (GP). The method ensures that any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points, making it a significant contribution to the field. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical simulations and real-data experiments, showcasing its benefits over alternative methods.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the introduction provides a clear motivation for the research. The problem formulation is concise, and the notation is well-defined. The proposed approach is based on transforming the target function using a linear operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints into the covariance function. The authors provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle multivariate problems with linear constraints, which is a challenging task due to the correlation between output components. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the comparison with alternative approaches is informative.\nHowever, there are some areas that require improvement. The introduction of the deconvolution operator is unclear, and its connection to the rest of the paper is not well-established. The authors should provide more context and explanation for this operator. Additionally, the paper lacks references for the applications of video prediction in numerous domains, and the authors should provide citations or rephrase the claims.\nThe paper also contains minor errors, including grammatical mistakes, missing commas, and inconsistent referencing. The authors should proofread the manuscript carefully to ensure that these errors are corrected.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and concise summary of the main ideas, and the paper is well-organized. The approach is novel and significant, and the results are important and relevant to the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and significant approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate GP.\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical simulations and real-data experiments.\n* The paper is well-structured, and the introduction provides a clear motivation for the research.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The introduction of the deconvolution operator is unclear, and its connection to the rest of the paper is not well-established.\n* The paper lacks references for the applications of video prediction in numerous domains.\n* The paper contains minor errors, including grammatical mistakes, missing commas, and inconsistent referencing.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, but the authors should address the minor errors and provide more context and explanation for the deconvolution operator. Additionally, the authors should provide references for the applications of video prediction in numerous domains."
