            "inputText": "This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization (OCO) by introducing a novel framework that handles stochastic constraints. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves optimal bounds on regret and constraint violation, improving upon existing results. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and thorough analysis of their contributions.\nThe problem addressed in the paper is relevant and offers a new perspective on online linear optimization with constraints. The setup of the feedback could be better motivated, but the authors provide a convincing argument for the importance of their work. The paper's idea of analyzing long-term constraint violation is interesting and motivated.\nThe technical analysis is sound, and the authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their algorithm's performance. The use of a drift lemma to analyze the stochastic process is innovative and effective. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with existing work, highlighting the advantages of their approach.\nThe experiment on online job scheduling in distributed data centers demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the algorithm performs closely to the best fixed decision in hindsight, both in terms of electricity cost and constraint violations.\nThe paper's strengths include:\n* A novel and well-motivated problem formulation\n* A sound and comprehensive technical analysis\n* A thorough comparison with existing work\n* A convincing experimental evaluation\nThe paper's weaknesses include:\n* The setup of the feedback could be better motivated\n* Some notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts\nOverall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of OCO and provides a valuable insight into the handling of stochastic constraints. The authors' work has the potential to impact various applications, including online job scheduling, portfolio optimization, and resource allocation.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated problem formulation\n* The technical analysis is sound and comprehensive\n* The experimental evaluation is convincing and demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm\n* The paper provides a thorough comparison with existing work and highlights the advantages of the proposed approach\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The setup of the feedback could be better motivated\n* Some notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts\n* The paper may benefit from additional discussions on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach."
