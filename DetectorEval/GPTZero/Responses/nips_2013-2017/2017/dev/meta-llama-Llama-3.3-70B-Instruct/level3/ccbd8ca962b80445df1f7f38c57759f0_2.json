            "inputText": "This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games, introducing a novel subgame-solving technique that outperforms prior methods in both theory and practice. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, a benchmark challenge for AI in imperfect-information games.\nThe paper is well-written, clear, and provides a thorough explanation of the concepts and techniques used. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, as well as a comparison with existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed technique, Reach subgame solving, achieves lower exploitability than previous safe methods and even outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, action translation, in nested subgame solving.\nOne of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical guarantees with practical performance. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of their approach, including a proof of the exploitability reduction, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale experiments.\nThe paper also raises some interesting questions and directions for future research. For example, the authors note that the gifts used in the Reach subgame solving algorithm may not always be efficiently divided among subgames, and that more aggressive scaling of gifts can sometimes lead to better performance. This suggests that there may be opportunities for further optimization and improvement of the algorithm.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution. The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-supported presentation of the ideas and results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, and demonstrate its significance and impact on the field. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The contributions are significant, the presentation is clear and well-organized, and the results are compelling. The paper has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field of imperfect-information games and AI research more broadly.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games.\n* The approach is well-motivated and thoroughly analyzed, with a clear presentation of the theoretical guarantees and practical performance.\n* The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed technique in large-scale experiments.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper may benefit from additional analysis and optimization of the Reach subgame solving algorithm, particularly with regards to the division of gifts among subgames.\n* The authors could provide more discussion and comparison with other related work in the field, particularly in the area of nested subgame solving.\n* The paper may benefit from additional experimental results and evaluation, particularly in other domains and applications beyond heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker."
