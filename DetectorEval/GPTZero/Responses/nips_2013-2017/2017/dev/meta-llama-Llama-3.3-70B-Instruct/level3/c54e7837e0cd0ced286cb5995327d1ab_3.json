The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in various experiments, including heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, and showcase its potential in developing AI systems that can defeat top human professionals.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the concepts and techniques used. The introduction effectively sets the stage for the rest of the paper, highlighting the challenges of imperfect-information games and the limitations of existing approaches. The notation and background section provides a thorough overview of the relevant concepts, making it easier for readers to follow the subsequent sections.\nThe authors' approach, Reach subgame solving, is a significant improvement over prior techniques, as it considers the potential gifts that can be obtained by playing suboptimally in other subgames. This allows for a more nuanced and effective strategy, as demonstrated in the experiments. The use of lower bounds on gifts is a clever technique, as it provides a safe and efficient way to estimate the potential benefits of subgame solving.\nThe experiments are well-designed and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the authors' approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reach subgame solving in reducing exploitability and improving performance, especially when combined with other techniques such as Maxmargin and Estimate+Distributional. The comparison with action translation is also insightful, highlighting the benefits of nested subgame solving in response to opponent off-tree actions.\nThe paper's strengths include:\n* A clear and concise explanation of the concepts and techniques used\n* A thorough evaluation of the authors' approach through experiments\n* A significant improvement over prior techniques in terms of theoretical guarantees and practical performance\n* A well-organized and easy-to-follow structure\nThe paper's weaknesses include:\n* Some sections, such as the notation and background, may be challenging for readers without a strong background in game theory and imperfect-information games\n* The experiments, while comprehensive, may not cover all possible scenarios or game types\n* Some of the techniques, such as the use of lower bounds on gifts, may require further explanation or justification\nOverall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games and has the potential to impact the development of AI systems in various domains. The authors' approach is well-motivated, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving performance and reducing exploitability.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games\n* The authors' approach is well-motivated and effectively addresses the challenges of imperfect-information games\n* The experiments provide a comprehensive evaluation of the authors' approach and demonstrate its effectiveness\n* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some sections may be challenging for readers without a strong background in game theory and imperfect-information games\n* The experiments may not cover all possible scenarios or game types\n* Some of the techniques may require further explanation or justification\nQuality: 9/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nOverall, I highly recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors' approach is a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving performance and reducing exploitability. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the concepts and techniques used."
