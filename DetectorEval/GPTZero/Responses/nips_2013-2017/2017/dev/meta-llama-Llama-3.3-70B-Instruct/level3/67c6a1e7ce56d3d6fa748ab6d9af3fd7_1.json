            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate Gaussian process (GP). The authors propose a method to design the covariance function such that any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points. The approach is based on transforming the target function using a linear operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints into the prior.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem formulation, the proposed method, and the experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the benefits of their approach through numerical simulations and real-data experiments.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed method is novel and addresses a significant problem in GP regression, which is the incorporation of linear operator constraints.\n* The approach is based on a solid theoretical foundation, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the accuracy of GP regression.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly in comparison to other approaches.\n* The authors assume that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function g, which may not always be the case. A more rigorous analysis of the requirements on Gx would be desirable.\n* The extension to constraints including nonlinear operators is an interesting topic for future research, and the authors could provide more discussion on the potential challenges and opportunities in this area.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of GP regression and provides a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through thorough experimental evaluations, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of GP regression.\n* The approach is based on a solid theoretical foundation, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the accuracy of GP regression.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.\n* The authors assume that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function g, which may not always be the case.\n* The extension to constraints including nonlinear operators is an interesting topic for future research, and the authors could provide more discussion on the potential challenges and opportunities in this area.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions.
