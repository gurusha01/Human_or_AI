            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), which is a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed pipeline, called YASS, is based on a multistage \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach that combines efficient detection, clustering, and deconvolution techniques to improve the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of spike sorting.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology and results. The authors provide a thorough overview of the pipeline, including the detection, feature extraction, clustering, and deconvolution stages. They also present a detailed evaluation of the pipeline's performance on both synthetic and real datasets, comparing it to other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of spike sorting and the limitations of existing methods. They also provide a detailed description of the pipeline and its components, making it easy to follow and understand.\nHowever, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the neural network detection method and its training process. Additionally, the authors could provide more justification for the use of the regularizer \"\"Î¸\"\"^2 in equation (10). Furthermore, the application of the algorithm to LP boosting using entropy regularization could be discussed in more detail and compared to existing methods.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. It is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough evaluation of the pipeline's performance. However, it could benefit from more discussion of the related work and how it differs from previous contributions. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the significance of the results and how they advance the state of the art in the field.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and spike sorting, and with some revisions, it could be even stronger.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and efficient pipeline for spike sorting on dense MEAs.\n* The pipeline is well-evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, and its performance is compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.\n* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology and results.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of some of the components, such as the neural network detection method.\n* The authors could provide more justification for the use of the regularizer \"\"Î¸\"\"^2 in equation (10).\n* The application of the algorithm to LP boosting using entropy regularization could be discussed in more detail and compared to existing methods."
