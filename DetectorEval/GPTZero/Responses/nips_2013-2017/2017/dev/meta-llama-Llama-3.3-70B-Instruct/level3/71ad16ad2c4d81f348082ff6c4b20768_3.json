The approach involves finding an operator that spans the nullspace of a given function, which can be challenging. The paper provides a constructive procedure for designing this operator and demonstrates its effectiveness on both simulated and real-data examples.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem formulation, the proposed method, and the experimental results. The writing is clear, and the notation is well-defined. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed method, the thorough experimental evaluation, and the clear presentation. The method has the potential to improve the accuracy of GP models in applications where linear equality constraints are present.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The approach requires finding an operator that spans the nullspace of a given function, which can be a non-trivial task. The authors provide a constructive procedure for designing this operator, but it may not always be possible to find a suitable operator. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the interpretation of certain functions as matrices and matrix-vector multiplications.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the paper is well-organized. The method is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.\nThe significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a challenging problem in GP modeling and provides a new approach for incorporating linear equality constraints. The results have the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel method for incorporating linear equality constraints into GPs.\n* The approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of GP models in applications where linear equality constraints are present.\n* The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation and a clear presentation.\n* The method is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The approach requires finding an operator that spans the nullspace of a given function, which can be a non-trivial task.\n* The paper could benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the interpretation of certain functions as matrices and matrix-vector multiplications.\n* The method may not always be possible to find a suitable operator, which could limit its applicability.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality, and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to further strengthen the paper."
