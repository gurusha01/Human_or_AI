            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate Gaussian process (GP). The authors propose a method to design the covariance function such that any sample drawn from the resulting process will obey the constraints in all points. The approach is based on transforming the target function using a linear operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints into the GP prior.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improved performance compared to alternative methods. The use of real-world data, such as magnetic field measurements, adds to the paper's credibility and demonstrates the practical applicability of the method.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to guarantee that the constraints are fulfilled in the entire domain, rather than just at a set of discrete points. This is a significant advantage over other methods that rely on approximations or finite representations. The authors also provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator, which makes the method more accessible to practitioners.\nHowever, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more detailed explanations of the algorithm for constructing the transformation operator, particularly in the case where the nullspace of the operator is empty. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the method, such as the incorporation of nonlinear operators or non-zero right-hand sides.\nIn terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, specifically the use of linear transformations to incorporate constraints into the GP prior. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the related work in the field and provide a thorough review of existing methods for incorporating constraints into GPs.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a rigorous and efficient method for incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate GP. This has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of GP models in a wide range of applications, from physics and engineering to computer vision and robotics.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of Gaussian processes and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. However, I would suggest that the authors address some of the minor comments and suggestions provided above to improve the clarity and completeness of the paper.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and rigorous method for incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate GP.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improved performance compared to alternative methods.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the methodology, making it accessible to practitioners.\n* The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the related work in the field and provide a thorough review of existing methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the algorithm for constructing the transformation operator.\n* The discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the method could be more thorough.\n* Some minor errors and typos were found in the text, which should be corrected before publication."
