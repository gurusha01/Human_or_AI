The proposed pipeline, called Yet Another Spike Sorter (YASS), addresses the limitations of previous methods by incorporating a \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach, which improves robustness, scalability, and accuracy. The pipeline consists of several stages, including detection, feature extraction, collision screening, clustering, and template merging, each of which is designed to efficiently handle large datasets.\nThe paper is well-written, but some sections, such as Section 3, are complex and may benefit from additional explanations or simplifications to make them more accessible to readers. The experimental evidence presented in the paper is convincing, with YASS outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency, making YASS a valuable tool for large-scale neuroscience research.\nThe strengths of the paper include its thorough evaluation of the proposed pipeline, the use of multiple datasets, and the comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors also provide a detailed description of the pipeline's components and their implementation, making it easier for readers to understand and replicate the results. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of scalability and robustness in spike sorting algorithms, which is crucial for handling large-scale datasets.\nHowever, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed pipeline and potential avenues for future research. Additionally, some of the sections, such as the description of the coreset construction algorithm, could be clarified or simplified to make them more accessible to readers.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of spike sorting and neuroscience research. The proposed pipeline, YASS, has the potential to become a widely used tool for large-scale neuroscience research, and the paper provides a thorough evaluation of its performance and limitations.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of spike sorting and neuroscience research.\n* The proposed pipeline, YASS, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.\n* The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed pipeline, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art algorithms and multiple datasets.\n* The authors provide a detailed description of the pipeline's components and their implementation, making it easier for readers to understand and replicate the results.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some sections of the paper, such as Section 3, are complex and may benefit from additional explanations or simplifications.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed pipeline and potential avenues for future research.\n* Some of the sections, such as the description of the coreset construction algorithm, could be clarified or simplified to make them more accessible to readers."
