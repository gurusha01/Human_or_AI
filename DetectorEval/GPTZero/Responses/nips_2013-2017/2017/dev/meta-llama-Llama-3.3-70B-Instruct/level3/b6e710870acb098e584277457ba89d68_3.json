            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed methodology, dubbed Yet Another Spike Sorter (YASS), is a multistage procedure that combines a neural network-based detection method, efficient outlier triaging, and a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering approach. The pipeline is designed to be modular, scalable, and robust, with a focus on leveraging prior information and efficient data summarizations to improve performance.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and a detailed description of the methodology. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the pipeline, including the detection, feature extraction, collision screening, coreset construction, and clustering stages. The use of pseudocode and supplementary sections provides additional details and clarity.\nThe experimental evaluation of YASS is thorough and well-designed, with comparisons to several recently proposed approaches for dense MEA spike sorting. The results demonstrate that YASS outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency, particularly in low SNR settings. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the pipeline's computational costs and demonstrate that it can be run in nearly linear time.\nThe strengths of the paper include its novel combination of techniques, its focus on scalability and robustness, and its thorough experimental evaluation. The authors also provide a clear and detailed description of the methodology, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of supplementary sections and pseudocode adds to the paper's clarity and provides additional details for interested readers.\nThe weaknesses of the paper are minor and primarily related to presentation. Some sections, such as the introduction and conclusion, could be tightened up for better readability. Additionally, some of the figures and tables could be improved for clarity and ease of understanding.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of spike sorting and demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and limitations of current approaches. The authors' focus on scalability, robustness, and efficiency makes YASS a promising tool for large-scale neuroscience research. The paper is well-written, well-structured, and provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of spike sorting.\n* The methodology is well-designed, scalable, and robust.\n* The experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed.\n* The paper is well-written and provides a clear and detailed description of the methodology.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some sections could be tightened up for better readability.\n* Some figures and tables could be improved for clarity and ease of understanding.\n* The paper could benefit from additional discussion of the limitations and potential applications of YASS.\nQuality: 9/10\nClarity: 8.5/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of spike sorting and demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and limitations of current approaches."
