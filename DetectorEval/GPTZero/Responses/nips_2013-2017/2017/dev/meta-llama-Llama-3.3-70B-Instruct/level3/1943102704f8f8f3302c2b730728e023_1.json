            "inputText": "This paper presents a well-engineered pipeline, called YASS, for sorting multi-electrode array recordings. The approach combines state-of-the-art methods in a sound way, making it a significant contribution to the field. The pipeline's performance is impressive, outperforming other methods in terms of accuracy and stability on both synthetic and real datasets.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its clear and well-organized structure, making it easy to follow and understand the methodology. The use of a \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach is innovative and effective in handling collisions and noisy waveforms. The incorporation of a neural network detection method and efficient outlier triaging further improves the pipeline's robustness and scalability.\nHowever, there are some concerns that need to be addressed. The lack of publicly available code is a major issue, as it limits the value of the paper and makes it difficult to reproduce the results. The description of the neural network detection method is also poor, particularly with regards to how the training data was generated and which method was used. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to understand the methodology and its limitations.\nAdditionally, the pipeline's applicability to cortical data is uncertain due to issues such as waveform drift and limited availability of good training data. The paper also has some minor issues, including a strange y-axis label in Figure 3 and a lack of description of the spatial whitening procedure.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The methodology is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to understand and follow. The results are significant, and the pipeline has the potential to make a major impact in the field of neuroscience.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The pipeline's performance is impressive, outperforming other methods in terms of accuracy and stability.\n* The approach is innovative and effective in handling collisions and noisy waveforms.\n* The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to understand and follow.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The lack of publicly available code is a major issue, limiting the value of the paper and making it difficult to reproduce the results.\n* The description of the neural network detection method is poor, particularly with regards to how the training data was generated and which method was used.\n* The pipeline's applicability to cortical data is uncertain due to issues such as waveform drift and limited availability of good training data.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field. However, the lack of publicly available code and poor description of the neural network detection method are major concerns that need to be addressed. With some revisions to address these issues, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference."
