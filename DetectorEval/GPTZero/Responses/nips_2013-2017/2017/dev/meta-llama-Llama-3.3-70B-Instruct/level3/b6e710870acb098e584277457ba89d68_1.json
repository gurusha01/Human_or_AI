            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to spike sorting for dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed pipeline, dubbed YASS, is a multistage procedure that combines a neural network-based detection method, efficient outlier triaging, and a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering approach. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets.\nThe key strengths of this paper are its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their methodology, including pseudocode and detailed explanations of each stage. The use of a neural network-based detection method and a DP-GMM clustering approach is novel and effective, and the authors demonstrate the advantages of their approach through extensive experiments. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed pipeline, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods and an analysis of the computational efficiency.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is the lack of discussion on the applicability of the proposed pipeline to other types of neural data or experimental settings. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a specific dataset, it is unclear how well the pipeline would perform on other types of data or in different experimental contexts. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed pipeline.\nIn terms of significance, this paper has the potential to make a major impact in the field of neuroscience, particularly in the analysis of large-scale neural data. The proposed pipeline is highly efficient and scalable, making it suitable for use on large datasets, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness on a real-world dataset. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed pipeline, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, which will be useful for researchers in the field.\nOverall, I believe that this paper is technically correct, interesting, and significant, and I recommend it for acceptance. The strengths of the paper, including its technical soundness, clarity, and originality, outweigh its weaknesses, and the paper has the potential to make a major impact in the field of neuroscience.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to spike sorting for dense MEAs.\n* The proposed pipeline is highly efficient and scalable, making it suitable for use on large datasets.\n* The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed pipeline, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a real-world dataset.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed pipeline.\n* The applicability of the proposed pipeline to other types of neural data or experimental settings is unclear.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential impact of the proposed pipeline on the field of neuroscience."
