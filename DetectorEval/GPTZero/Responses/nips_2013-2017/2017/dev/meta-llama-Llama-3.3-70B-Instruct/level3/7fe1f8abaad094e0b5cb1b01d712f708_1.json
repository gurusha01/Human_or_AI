            "inputText": "This paper proposes two novel techniques, \"Reach\" and \"Nested\", to improve the performance of algorithms in solving two-player zero-sum games of imperfect information, such as poker. The \"Reach\" technique allows the algorithm to leverage mistakes made by the opponent in prior steps to improve its performance in certain subgames. The \"Nested\" approach involves re-solving subgames using more detailed information to improve the accuracy of the solution.\nThe paper's contributions are significant, particularly with the recent achievement of defeating top human players in no-limit hold-'em, marking a landmark for AI research. The techniques presented in this paper were a key component of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top humans in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.\nThe paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand the concepts and techniques presented. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the background and notation, as well as a detailed description of the prior approaches to subgame solving.\nThe strengths of the paper include its ability to improve upon the blueprint strategy by changing the strategy only in a subgame, and its ability to adapt to opponent actions that are outside the original action abstraction. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the techniques, including experiments on heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em and other smaller-scale poker games.\nHowever, the paper's weakness lies in its limited explanation and discussion of the new techniques at a non-technical level, making it challenging for non-experts to evaluate the contributions. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques and a more thorough analysis of the results.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of AI research, and its techniques have the potential to be applied to a wide range of imperfect-information games. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of AI research, with the potential to be applied to a wide range of imperfect-information games.\n* The techniques presented in the paper have been successfully applied to defeat top human players in no-limit hold-'em, marking a landmark for AI research.\n* The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand the concepts and techniques presented.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper's limited explanation and discussion of the new techniques at a non-technical level may make it challenging for non-experts to evaluate the contributions.\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques and a more thorough analysis of the results.\n* The paper's focus on poker may limit its applicability to other imperfect-information games."
