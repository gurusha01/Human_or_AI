            "inputText": "This paper introduces a new algorithm for online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a novel learning algorithm that achieves O(칙틙코T) expected regret and constraint violations, and O(칙틙코T log(T)) high probability regret and constraint violations. The algorithm is based on a drift-plus-penalty approach, which minimizes an upper bound of the drift-plus-penalty expression.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem setting and the proposed algorithm. The technical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed proof of the main results. The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application, namely online job scheduling in distributed data centers.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel algorithm for OCO with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting.\n* The provision of a thorough technical analysis, including a detailed proof of the main results.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper is dense and difficult to read in some places, requiring improvements in clarity and presentation.\n* The authors do not provide a conclusion discussing the potential for the proposed algorithm to find applications beyond the specific problem setting considered in the paper.\n* There are several technical errors and suggestions for improvement, including formatting issues, missing symbols, and requests for additional derivations or explanations.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization and stochastic optimization. The proposed algorithm has the potential to find applications in a wide range of fields, including operations research, machine learning, and control theory. However, the authors need to address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the clarity and presentation of the paper.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel algorithm for OCO with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting.\n* The technical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed proof of the main results.\n* The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper is dense and difficult to read in some places, requiring improvements in clarity and presentation.\n* The authors do not provide a conclusion discussing the potential for the proposed algorithm to find applications beyond the specific problem setting considered in the paper.\n* There are several technical errors and suggestions for improvement, including formatting issues, missing symbols, and requests for additional derivations or explanations.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors need to address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the clarity and presentation of the paper. Specifically, they need to:\n* Improve the clarity and presentation of the paper, including formatting issues and missing symbols.\n* Provide a conclusion discussing the potential for the proposed algorithm to find applications beyond the specific problem setting considered in the paper.\n* Address the technical errors and suggestions for improvement, including requests for additional derivations or explanations."
