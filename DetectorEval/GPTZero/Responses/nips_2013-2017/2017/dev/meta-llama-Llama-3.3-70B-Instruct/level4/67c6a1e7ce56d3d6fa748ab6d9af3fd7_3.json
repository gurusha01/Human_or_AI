However, they fail to discuss how their approach would generalize to instance-specific action recognition, where an image may contain multiple individuals performing different actions, and action labels are assigned at the instance level rather than the frame level. The authors should address how their approach can handle this more general setup of instance-level labels, which is currently a limitation of their method.\nThe authors also fail to provide a fair comparison with competing approaches. They use a ResNet101 or Inception-V2 architecture as their base network and demonstrate improvement over their own non-attentive baseline using the same architecture. However, competing approaches, such as R*CNN or Mallya & Lazebnik, employ a VGG16 network, making the comparison unfair and inconclusive on the MPII and HICO datasets. On the HMDB dataset, the improvement over the TSN BN-Inception method is marginal, and comparisons with other methods are unclear due to the varying underlying base architectures."
