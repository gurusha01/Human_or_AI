The primary objective of this transformation is to ensure that samples drawn from the Gaussian process posterior distribution adhere to the specified constraints, which can take the form of partial derivatives or other linear operators, such as integration. Unlike traditional methods that incorporate constraints by adding extra observations, this proposed framework offers a more flexible and efficient solution. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through both synthetic and real-world problem evaluations, showcasing its advantages over data augmentation strategies.\nDetailed comments:\nQuality:\nThe overall quality of the manuscript is commendable, characterized by clear and concise writing, thorough descriptions of key concepts, and a robust related work section. However, the experimental section is somewhat limited, relying on only one synthetic and one real dataset for evaluation.\nClarity:\nThe manuscript exhibits high clarity, making it easily understandable for readers.\nOriginality:\nTo the best of my knowledge, the work presented appears to be original, distinguishing itself from existing methods that rely on augmenting observed data with virtual instances to enforce constraints.\nSignificance:\nThe problem addressed by the authors is indeed relevant and significant within the machine learning community. Nevertheless, the authors could more effectively highlight the importance and broader implications of their work. The examples provided, including only a single real-world instance and focusing solely on the linear operator of derivatives, seem somewhat simplistic. The potential applications of this research, particularly in probabilistic numeric methods where Gaussian processes are commonly utilized, are not fully explored.\nIn conclusion, while this is a well-crafted paper, the experimental section's limitations and the lack of demonstrated practical applications within the machine learning community raise questions about its overall significance. As such, I would categorize it as a borderline paper, meriting further development to fully realize its potential impact."
