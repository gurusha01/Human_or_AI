            "inputText": "In my assessment, this paper is of high quality, although I must acknowledge that my expertise in point processes is limited, and this should be considered when evaluating my review. I would rank this paper among the top 50% of NIPS submissions, with the caveat that my lack of in-depth knowledge in this area may prevent me from fully appreciating its nuances. To ensure a thorough evaluation, I have requested that the committee assign at least one reviewer with sufficient expertise in point processes to assess the paper's technical aspects, and they have agreed to do so. I hope that this paper will be accepted for publication, as I am interested in exploring its potential applications.\nWithin the scope of my expertise, I have identified several key contributions that comprise the proposed framework: the reformulation of the prediction problem using conditional expectation, which incorporates historical data and reduces variance in the new estimator; the derivation of a differential-difference equation to compute the conditional estimator; and the theoretical and empirical evaluations of the framework on both synthetic and real-world data. Overall, the paper appears to be well-structured, well-supported, and clearly written.\nRegarding prior art, I noticed that the references are dominated by a single cluster of authors (5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 31). While these citations are necessary, I suggest that the authors also cite the original contributors of the datasets used in the paper, such as Demetris Antoniades and Constantine Dovrolis (2015) and Yehia Elkhatib, Mu Mu, and Nicholas Race (2014). This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research landscape.\nIn the Solution Overview (Section 3), I would appreciate an example of a point process that is not covered by prior art, such as a process that cannot be represented by a reinforced Poisson process or a Hawkes process. This would help me better understand the impact of this work. The authors' contribution of a more general framework that preserves stochasticity while requiring fewer samples than Monte Carlo methods is well-presented.\nI found the concept of a conditional intensity function, conditioned on the history of the intensity function, to be interesting, although not entirely new. The use of this concept as a random variable for prediction may be novel, but I am not familiar enough with the area to confirm this. I did find a related paper, \"Marked Temporal Dynamics Modeling based on Recurrent Neural Network\" by Yongqing Wang et al. (2017), which may be relevant to the authors' work.\nThe proof in Appendix C appears to be sound, and I appreciate the authors' use of clear and concise language. I had to look up some concepts, such as taking the expectation of a conditional random variable, but the explanation was helpful. I am hoping that supplemental materials will be included in the proceedings.\nThe formulation of the novel transport equation seems novel and useful, and I could not find any similar work. The closest match I found was \"Probability approximation of point processes with Papangelou conditional intensity\" by Giovanni Luca Torrisi (forthcoming), which may be of interest to the authors.\nThe mass transport equation is an intriguing idea, and I understand that the intensity process generates events that contribute to the mass, which decreases over time in the absence of new events. The authors' use of numerical methods to approximate the integration of the probability mass function and solve the equation using ode45 from Matlab seems appropriate.\nI found Figure 2 helpful in understanding the equations, and the section on event information was compelling in explaining why the authors can reduce the samples used for estimation. However, I would like to know more about the experimental setup, such as whether the authors used a train-test-holdout set or a simple train-test split.\nOverall, this paper presents a promising and solid idea, and I would recommend its inclusion in NIPS based on my understanding of the content.\nIn terms of writing, I noticed a few typos:\n* 10: \"state-of-arts\" should be \"the state of the art\"\n* 36: \"adversely influence\" should be \"adversely influences\"\n* 64: \"the phenomena of interests\" should be \"the phenomena of interest\"\n* 75: \"The root mean square error (RMSE) is defines as\" should be \"The root mean square error (RMSE) is defined as\""
