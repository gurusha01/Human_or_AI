            "inputText": "This paper proposes Batch Renormalization, an extension to Batch Normalization (batchnorm) that addresses the issue of batchnorm's effectiveness diminishing when training with small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. The main claim of the paper is that Batch Renormalization improves the training of deep models by ensuring that the activations computed during training are identical to those computed during inference.\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the limitations of batchnorm and proposes a simple yet effective solution. The authors demonstrate that Batch Renormalization outperforms batchnorm on small and non-i.i.d. minibatches, while retaining the benefits of batchnorm such as insensitivity to initialization and training efficiency.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise explanation of the problem and the proposed solution\n* A thorough analysis of the limitations of batchnorm and the benefits of Batch Renormalization\n* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Renormalization on small and non-i.i.d. minibatches\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The introduction of extra hyperparameters, such as the update rate Î± and the schedules for correction limits dmax, rmax, which may require careful tuning\n* The lack of a more extensive investigation of the effect of these hyperparameters on the performance of Batch Renormalization\nOverall, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches and has the potential to benefit a wide range of applications, including Residual Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and recurrent networks.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a clear and concise explanation of the problem and the proposed solution\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Renormalization on small and non-i.i.d. minibatches\n* The paper has the potential to benefit a wide range of applications\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The introduction of extra hyperparameters may require careful tuning\n* The lack of a more extensive investigation of the effect of these hyperparameters on the performance of Batch Renormalization\nRecommendation: Accept, with minor revisions to address the concerns regarding the introduction of extra hyperparameters and the lack of a more extensive investigation of their effect on the performance of Batch Renormalization."
