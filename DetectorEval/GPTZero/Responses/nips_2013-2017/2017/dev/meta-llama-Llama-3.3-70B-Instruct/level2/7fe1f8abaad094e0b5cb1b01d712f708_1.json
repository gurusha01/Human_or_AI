The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in various experiments, including heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, and showcase its potential in developing AI systems that can defeat top human professionals.\nThe paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the challenges in imperfect-information games and the limitations of existing subgame-solving techniques. They then introduce their new approach, Reach subgame solving, which considers the potential gifts that an opponent could have received from other subgames. This technique is shown to have stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance than prior methods.\nThe experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Reach subgame solving in various settings, including information abstraction and nested subgame solving. The results show that the new technique outperforms prior methods, including Unsafe subgame solving and action translation. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\nThe paper reflects a deep understanding of the field and its challenges. The authors provide a comprehensive review of prior work and demonstrate a clear understanding of the relevant literature. The writing is clear and concise, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in imperfect-information games. The authors' approach has far-reaching implications for the development of AI systems that can compete with humans in complex strategic environments. The paper's results are likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the field, and the techniques presented have the potential to be applied in a wide range of domains.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the challenges and limitations of existing subgame-solving techniques.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach in various settings.\n* The paper reflects a deep understanding of the field and its challenges.\n* The techniques presented have the potential to be applied in a wide range of domains.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in game theory and imperfect-information games, which may limit its accessibility to some readers.\n* Some of the experimental results may be specific to the domain of poker and may not generalize to other domains.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the new approach.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique, and the paper reflects a deep understanding of the field and its challenges. I recommend accepting the paper."
