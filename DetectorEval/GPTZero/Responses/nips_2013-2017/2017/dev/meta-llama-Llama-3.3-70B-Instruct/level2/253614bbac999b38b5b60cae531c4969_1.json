            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms for repeated collection of counter data, which is a crucial problem in telemetry applications. The authors propose a framework that combines 1-bit LDP mechanisms with memoization and output perturbation to provide strong privacy guarantees even after an arbitrarily long period of data collection.\nThe paper's main claims are threefold: (1) the authors develop new LDP mechanisms for mean and histogram estimation that provide comparable or even better accuracy than existing single-round LDP mechanisms; (2) they introduce a rounding technique called Î±-point rounding that allows memoization to be applied in the context of private collection of counters; and (3) they demonstrate the effectiveness of their mechanisms through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets and deployment by Microsoft.\nThe support for these claims is strong, with theoretical analysis and empirical results that demonstrate the accuracy and privacy guarantees of the proposed mechanisms. The authors provide a rigorous definition of privacy guarantees and prove that their mechanisms satisfy these guarantees. They also conduct experiments on real-world datasets to show that their mechanisms are comparable to or even outperform existing state-of-the-art LDP mechanisms.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results. The use of Î±-point rounding and memoization is a novel contribution that addresses the limitations of existing LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection. The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the deployment by Microsoft demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed mechanisms.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they address a critical problem in telemetry applications and provide a robust solution that balances privacy and accuracy. The paper's contributions are significant, and the results have the potential to impact the field of differential privacy and telemetry data collection.\nThe paper's limitations are minor, and the authors acknowledge the potential vulnerabilities of their approach to attacks based on auxiliary information. However, they also propose output perturbation as a mitigation technique, which helps to protect against such attacks.\nIn terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches, particularly in the context of repeated data collection. The use of Î±-point rounding and memoization is a new contribution that addresses the limitations of existing LDP mechanisms.\nThe paper's completeness is good, with a clear and concise explanation of the approach, theoretical analysis, and empirical results. The authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility, and the deployment by Microsoft demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed mechanisms.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of differential privacy and telemetry data collection. The paper's strengths outweigh its minor limitations, and the results have the potential to impact the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to LDP algorithms for repeated collection of counter data.\n* The authors provide a rigorous definition of privacy guarantees and prove that their mechanisms satisfy these guarantees.\n* The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the deployment by Microsoft demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed mechanisms.\n* The paper's contributions are significant, and the results have the potential to impact the field of differential privacy and telemetry data collection.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper's approach may be vulnerable to attacks based on auxiliary information.\n* The use of output perturbation as a mitigation technique may not be sufficient to protect against all types of attacks.\n* The paper's limitations are minor, but they may impact the applicability of the proposed mechanisms in certain scenarios."
