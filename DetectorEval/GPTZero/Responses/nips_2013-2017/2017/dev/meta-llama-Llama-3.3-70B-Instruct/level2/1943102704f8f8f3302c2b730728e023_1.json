            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), which is a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The authors propose a multistage approach, consisting of detection, triage, clustering, and pursuit stages, to improve the robustness and scalability of spike sorting. The pipeline is based on a combination of techniques, including neural network-based detection, outlier triaging, nonparametric Bayesian clustering, and matching-pursuit deconvolution.\nThe main claims of the paper are that the proposed pipeline outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency, and that it can handle large-scale datasets with high-dimensional feature spaces. The authors support these claims with extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the superiority of their approach over other state-of-the-art methods.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their methodology and results. The use of pseudocode and supplementary materials helps to clarify the technical details of the pipeline. The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle large-scale datasets with high-dimensional feature spaces. The authors demonstrate that their pipeline can process datasets with thousands of electrodes and millions of spikes, making it a valuable tool for large-scale neuroscience research. The pipeline's modularity and flexibility are also notable, as they allow for easy integration of new techniques and updates to existing stages.\nHowever, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors acknowledge that their pipeline may not perform well on datasets with significant non-stationarity or template drift, and that further work is needed to address these issues. Additionally, the pipeline's reliance on prior training data may limit its applicability to datasets where such data is not available.\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of spike sorting and neural signal processing. The proposed pipeline has the potential to enable large-scale neuroscience research and advance our understanding of brain function and behavior. With some further development and refinement, this pipeline could become a widely-used tool in the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective pipeline for spike sorting on dense MEAs.\n* The authors provide extensive experiments and analysis to support their claims.\n* The pipeline has the potential to enable large-scale neuroscience research and advance our understanding of brain function and behavior.\n* The paper is well-written and clear, with a good balance of technical detail and high-level overview.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The pipeline may not perform well on datasets with significant non-stationarity or template drift.\n* The pipeline's reliance on prior training data may limit its applicability to datasets where such data is not available.\n* Further work is needed to address the limitations of the pipeline and improve its performance on a wider range of datasets."
