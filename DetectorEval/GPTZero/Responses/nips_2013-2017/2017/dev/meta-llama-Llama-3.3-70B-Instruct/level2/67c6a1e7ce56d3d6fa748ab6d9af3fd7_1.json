            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel attention module for action recognition and human object interaction tasks, which can be trained with or without extra supervision. The proposed attention module is a simple yet powerful extension of state-of-the-art base architectures, providing a significant boost in accuracy while keeping the network size and computational cost nearly the same. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three standard action recognition benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MPII dataset with a 12.5% relative improvement.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including a novel derivation of bottom-up and top-down attention as low-rank approximations of bilinear pooling methods. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed attention module on different datasets and architectures.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed attention module is simple to implement and requires few additional parameters, making it an attractive alternative to standard pooling operations.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their approach on different datasets and architectures, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.\n* The paper highlights the importance of attention in action recognition tasks and provides a novel perspective on the relationship between attention and second-order pooling.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The authors could provide more insight into the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research.\n* Some of the experimental results, such as the comparison with full-rank pooling, could be more thoroughly explored and discussed.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the proposed attention module for other computer vision tasks and applications.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed attention module is a significant contribution to the field of action recognition. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through thorough experimental results and provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective attention module for action recognition tasks.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their approach on different datasets and architectures.\n* The paper highlights the importance of attention in action recognition tasks and provides a novel perspective on the relationship between attention and second-order pooling.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper could provide more insight into the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research.\n* Some of the experimental results could be more thoroughly explored and discussed.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the proposed attention module for other computer vision tasks and applications.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, providing more insight into the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research, and discussing the implications of their proposed attention module for other computer vision tasks and applications."
