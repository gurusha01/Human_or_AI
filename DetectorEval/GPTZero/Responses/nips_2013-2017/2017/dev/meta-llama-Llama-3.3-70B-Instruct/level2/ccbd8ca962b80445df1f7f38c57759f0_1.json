            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel method for encoding brain connectomes in multidimensional arrays and approximating the Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) model using a sparse tensor decomposition. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed method, called LiFESD, can accurately approximate the LiFE model while reducing the size of the model significantly, with measured compression factors up to 40x.\nThe paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the sparse decomposed model and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on high-resolution in vivo datasets. The authors show that the model error decreases as a function of the parameter L, which describes the number of fascicles orientations encoded in the dictionary D, and that the compression factor achieved by the tensor decomposition approach is significant.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for improving future generations of models of connectomics, tractography evaluation, and microstructure.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel method for encoding brain connectomes in multidimensional arrays and approximating the LiFE model using a sparse tensor decomposition.\n* A thorough theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the sparse decomposed model.\n* Convincing experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n* A clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in neuroscience and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The authors could provide more details on the computational resources required to implement the proposed method and its potential scalability to larger datasets.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods for connectome evaluation and tractography.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of neuroscience and machine learning. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying theory and provide convincing experimental results. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel method for encoding brain connectomes in multidimensional arrays and approximating the LiFE model using a sparse tensor decomposition.\n* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the sparse decomposed model.\n* The experimental results are convincing, and the authors demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for improving future generations of models of connectomics, tractography evaluation, and microstructure.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in neuroscience and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The authors could provide more details on the computational resources required to implement the proposed method and its potential scalability to larger datasets.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods for connectome evaluation and tractography."
