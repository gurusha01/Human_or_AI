            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to active sequential hypothesis testing with limited knowledge of the outcome distributions. The authors propose the Incomplete-Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) policy, which combines an Incomplete-Bayesian update rule with an Adaptive Gradient action selection rule. The IBAG policy is shown to be competitive with existing algorithms, such as Chernoff's algorithm, and in many cases outperforms them.\nThe paper's main claims are: (1) the derivation of a lower bound on the sample size for the system under limited knowledge, and (2) the design of the IBAG policy, which matches this lower bound and outperforms similar known algorithms. The authors support these claims through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.\nThe paper's strengths include: (1) a clear and well-motivated problem formulation, (2) a thorough analysis of the IBAG policy, including a lower bound on the sample size and an upper bound on the expected number of samples, and (3) a comprehensive numerical evaluation, including comparisons with existing algorithms.\nThe paper's weaknesses include: (1) the assumption of a binary outcome for each action, which may not be realistic in all scenarios, and (2) the lack of a formal analysis of the tradeoff between caution and cost, although this is partially addressed in the supplementary material.\nThe paper's contributions are significant, as it addresses a novel and important problem in active sequential hypothesis testing. The IBAG policy is a valuable addition to the existing literature, and the paper's analysis and numerical evaluations provide a thorough understanding of its performance.\nIn terms of usefulness, the paper's results have potential applications in various domains, such as medical diagnostics, crowdsourcing, and content search. The IBAG policy can be used to design more efficient and effective active learning systems, which can lead to improved performance and reduced costs.\nThe paper's novelty lies in its ability to handle limited knowledge of the outcome distributions, which is a common challenge in real-world applications. The authors' approach is innovative, and the paper's results contribute to the advancement of the field.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their results. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a valuable contribution to the field of active sequential hypothesis testing.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and important problem in active sequential hypothesis testing.\n* The IBAG policy is a valuable addition to the existing literature.\n* The paper's analysis and numerical evaluations provide a thorough understanding of the IBAG policy's performance.\n* The paper's results have potential applications in various domains.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption of a binary outcome for each action may not be realistic in all scenarios.\n* The lack of a formal analysis of the tradeoff between caution and cost may be a limitation.\n* The paper's results may not be directly applicable to all scenarios, and further research may be needed to extend the results to more general settings."
