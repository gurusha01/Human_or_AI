            "inputText": "This paper introduces a new measure of sample complexity, referred to as the split-sample growth rate, which is used to bound the expected generalization error in the context of optimal auction design. The authors show that this measure can greatly simplify the analysis of sample complexity for many auction classes, and they provide several examples to demonstrate its applicability.\nThe main claim of the paper is that the expected generalization error is upper bounded by O ( log(τ̂H(2m)) m ), where τ̂H(m) is the split-sample growth rate of the hypothesis space H at value m. This claim is supported by a strengthening of the Rademacher complexity analysis of the expected generalization error.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of optimal auction design and the concept of sample complexity, and they carefully explain the intuition behind the split-sample growth rate.\nThe paper's strengths include its ability to provide a simple and intuitive analysis of sample complexity for many auction classes, and its potential to be applicable to general statistical learning theory. The authors also provide several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including single-item auctions, multiple-item auctions, and auctions with player-specific reserves.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is that it assumes that the revenue of any auction lies in the range [0, 1], which may not be realistic in all scenarios. However, the authors note that this assumption can be relaxed by re-scaling the equations, which would lead to a blow-up in the sample complexity of the order of an extra (β α) multiplicative factor.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimal auction design and sample complexity analysis. The split-sample growth rate is a useful tool for bounding the expected generalization error, and the authors' approach has the potential to be widely applicable.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a new and useful measure of sample complexity, the split-sample growth rate, which can simplify the analysis of sample complexity for many auction classes.\n* The authors provide a thorough and well-organized introduction to the problem of optimal auction design and the concept of sample complexity.\n* The paper includes several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors' approach, including single-item auctions, multiple-item auctions, and auctions with player-specific reserves.\n* The authors' approach has the potential to be widely applicable to general statistical learning theory.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the revenue of any auction lies in the range [0, 1], which may not be realistic in all scenarios.\n* The authors' approach may not be directly comparable to existing approaches, such as the pseudo-dimension, which may make it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness.\nOverall, I believe that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance."
