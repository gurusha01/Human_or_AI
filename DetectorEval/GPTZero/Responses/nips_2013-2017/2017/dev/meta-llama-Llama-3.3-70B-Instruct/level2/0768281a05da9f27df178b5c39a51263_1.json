            "inputText": "This paper proposes Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), a novel approach for functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI analysis. The main claim of the paper is that DHA can handle fMRI datasets with nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and a large number of subjects, and achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art Hyperalignment (HA) algorithms.\nThe support for this claim comes from extensive experimental studies on five fMRI datasets, which demonstrate that DHA outperforms other HA methods, including standard HA, Regularized Hyperalignment (RHA), Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA), Singular Value Decomposition Hyperalignment (SVDHA), Shared Response Model (SRM), and SearchLight (SL). The results show that DHA achieves higher classification accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in percentage, indicating its effectiveness in functional alignment.\nThe paper also evaluates the usefulness of DHA in post-alignment classification, demonstrating its ability to provide accurate functional alignment and improve the performance of classification models. The use of rank-m SVD and stochastic gradient descent for optimization enables DHA to generate low runtime on large datasets, making it a scalable and efficient approach.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with a clear understanding of the limitations of previous HA methods and the need for a more flexible and scalable approach. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature, citing key papers and techniques in the field.\nThe novelty of DHA lies in its use of a deep network as a kernel function, which allows it to learn nonlinear transformations and adapt to different subjects. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the DHA method, including its optimization algorithm and implementation details.\nThe completeness of the paper is evident in its thorough evaluation of DHA on multiple datasets and its comparison with other state-of-the-art HA methods. The authors also discuss the limitations of DHA, including its computational complexity and the need for careful selection of hyperparameters.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of fMRI analysis, providing a novel and effective approach for functional alignment that can handle complex and large-scale datasets. The strengths of the paper include its clear and detailed explanation of the DHA method, its thorough evaluation on multiple datasets, and its comparison with other state-of-the-art HA methods.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and effective approach for functional alignment in fMRI analysis.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DHA over other state-of-the-art HA methods.\n* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the DHA method and its optimization algorithm.\n* The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature and the limitations of previous HA methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper may benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of DHA and its scalability to very large datasets.\n* The authors could provide more insight into the selection of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of DHA to different settings.\n* The paper may benefit from a more detailed comparison with other deep learning-based approaches for functional alignment in fMRI analysis."
