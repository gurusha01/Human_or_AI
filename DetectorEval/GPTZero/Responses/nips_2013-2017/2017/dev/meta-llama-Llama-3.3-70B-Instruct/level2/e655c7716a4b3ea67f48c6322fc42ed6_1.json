            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to multitask learning for weighted finite automata (WFAs), which are finite state machines that can succinctly represent functions mapping sequences of observations to real numbers. The authors introduce the concept of vector-valued WFAs (vv-WFAs), which generalize WFAs to vector-valued functions, and propose a spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs to tackle the multitask learning problem.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the introduction of vv-WFAs as a natural framework to formalize the multitask learning problem, (2) the design of a spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs, and (3) the demonstration of the benefits of the proposed multitask approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nThe support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that the rank of a vv-WFA captures the notion of relatedness between tasks and propose a measure of relatedness based on the rank of the vv-WFA. They also provide a spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs and demonstrate its effectiveness in learning multiple related tasks simultaneously.\nThe usefulness of the proposed approach is evident in the experimental results, which show that the multitask learning algorithm outperforms the single-task learning algorithm, especially when the tasks are closely related. The authors also demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach in a real-world setting, using a dataset of 33 languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank.\nThe paper reflects a good understanding of the field, with correct use of terms and evidence of understanding of relevant literature. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of vv-WFAs and the design of a spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of their approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of settings.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The authors provide a clear and concise description of the algorithms and experiments, and the supplementary material provides additional details and results.\nThe limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the approach may not be effective when the tasks are not closely related. They also discuss the potential benefits and limitations of using a weighted approach, such as the one presented in [19], to handle the case where the amount of available training data differs greatly between tasks.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their approach and results. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field and provides a novel and effective approach to multitask learning for WFAs.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel and effective approach to multitask learning for WFAs.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of their approach.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a variety of settings.\n* The paper reflects a good understanding of the field, with correct use of terms and evidence of understanding of relevant literature.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The approach may not be effective when the tasks are not closely related.\n* The paper could benefit from additional experiments and analysis to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of their approach in different domains."
