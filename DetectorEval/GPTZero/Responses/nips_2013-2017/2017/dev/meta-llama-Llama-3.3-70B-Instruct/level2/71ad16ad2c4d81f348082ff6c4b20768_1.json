The main claim of the paper is that by modeling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function, the constraints can be explicitly incorporated into the model, ensuring that any sample drawn or prediction made fulfills the constraints. The authors provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on both simulated and real-data examples.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology. The use of linear operator constraints is a significant improvement over existing approaches, which often rely on approximations or finite representations. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel and effective approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate GP.\n* The provision of a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach on both simulated and real-data examples.\n* A comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the differences between the proposed approach and existing methods.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The reliance on a parametric ansatz for constructing the transformation operator, which may not always be straightforward.\n* The lack of a rigorous mathematical guarantee for the existence of an underlying potential function g.\n* The limitation to linear operator constraints, which may not be sufficient for all applications.\nTo improve the paper, the authors could:\n* Provide a more rigorous mathematical guarantee for the existence of an underlying potential function g.\n* Explore alternative approaches for constructing the transformation operator that do not rely on a parametric ansatz.\n* Investigate the extension of the approach to nonlinear operator constraints.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Gaussian processes and provides a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on both simulated and real-data examples, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into the covariance function of a multivariate GP.\n* The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on both simulated and real-data examples.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The reliance on a parametric ansatz for constructing the transformation operator may not always be straightforward.\n* The lack of a rigorous mathematical guarantee for the existence of an underlying potential function g.\n* The limitation to linear operator constraints may not be sufficient for all applications."
