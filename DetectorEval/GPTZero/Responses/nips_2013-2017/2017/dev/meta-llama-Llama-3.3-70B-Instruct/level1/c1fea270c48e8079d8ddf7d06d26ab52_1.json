            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the connections between discrete and continuous approaches for decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM). The authors provide improved running time estimates for state-of-the-art continuous algorithms using combinatorial arguments and conduct a systematic experimental comparison of discrete and continuous methods.\nThe paper is well-structured, and the authors clearly explain the problem setting, previous work, and their contributions. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the experimental results are thorough and well-presented. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and provide a clear comparison of the trade-offs between discrete and continuous methods.\nThe paper's main strengths are:\n1. Improved running time estimates: The authors provide improved worst-case complexity bounds for continuous optimization methods, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Systematic experimental comparison: The authors conduct a thorough experimental comparison of discrete and continuous methods, which provides valuable insights into the trade-offs between these approaches.\n3. Clear presentation: The paper is well-written, and the authors clearly explain the technical details, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the topic.\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement:\n1. Limited scope: The paper focuses on DSFM, which might limit its appeal to a broader audience. While the authors provide some background on submodular functions, readers without prior knowledge of the topic might find it challenging to understand the context.\n2. Experimental evaluation: While the experimental results are thorough, the authors could provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the specific hardware and software used, to make the results more reproducible.\n3. Future work: The authors could provide more discussion on potential future directions, such as applying their techniques to other optimization problems or exploring the use of other continuous optimization methods.\nIn terms of the review criteria, I would rate the paper as follows:\n* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is technically sound, but some minor issues with clarity and presentation)\n* Clarity: 9/10 (the paper is well-written, but some readers might find the technical details challenging to follow)\n* Originality: 8/10 (the paper provides new insights and improvements, but builds upon existing work)\n* Significance: 8/10 (the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of DSFM, but its impact might be limited to a specific area)\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a valuable contribution to the field of DSFM and demonstrates a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. \nArguments pro acceptance:\n- The paper provides improved running time estimates for state-of-the-art continuous algorithms.\n- The authors conduct a thorough experimental comparison of discrete and continuous methods.\n- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.\nArguments con acceptance:\n- The paper's scope might be limited to a specific area of optimization.\n- The experimental evaluation could be more detailed and reproducible.\n- The authors could provide more discussion on potential future directions."
