            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into Gaussian processes (GPs) for multivariate regression problems. The authors introduce a modification of the covariance function to ensure that the constraints are fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. The method is based on transforming the target function using a linear operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints in a continuous manner.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-structured, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, both on simulated and real-data examples.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel and elegant approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into GPs.\n* The provision of a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator.\n* The demonstration of the method's effectiveness on various examples, including a real-data experiment.\n* The clear and concise writing style, making the paper easy to follow.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function g, which might not always be the case.\n* The reliance on a parametric ansatz for constructing the transformation operator Gx, which might not be the most efficient or robust approach.\n* The lack of a rigorous analysis of the requirements on Gx, which could lead to a more straightforward construction algorithm.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into GPs.\n* The method has been demonstrated to work well on various examples, including a real-data experiment.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function g might not always be valid.\n* The reliance on a parametric ansatz for constructing Gx might not be the most efficient or robust approach.\n* The lack of a rigorous analysis of the requirements on Gx could lead to limitations in the method's applicability.\nOverall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Gaussian processes and multivariate regression, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the assumption about the target function and the reliance on a parametric ansatz, to further improve the paper."
