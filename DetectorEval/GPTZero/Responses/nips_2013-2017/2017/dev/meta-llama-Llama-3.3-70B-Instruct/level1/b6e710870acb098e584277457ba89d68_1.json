The algorithm extends the stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) method to accommodate Bregman divergences, allowing for more flexibility in adapting to the underlying geometry of the problem. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Breg-SVRG on two example applications: adversarial prediction and LPboosting.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of saddle-point optimization and the motivation behind their work. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, with a clear explanation of the algorithm and its convergence guarantees. The experimental results are also well-presented and demonstrate the superiority of Breg-SVRG over existing methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel algorithm, Breg-SVRG, which extends the SVRG method to accommodate Bregman divergences.\n* The provision of a clear and concise introduction to the problem of saddle-point optimization and the motivation behind the work.\n* The thorough and well-organized technical sections, with a clear explanation of the algorithm and its convergence guarantees.\n* The well-presented experimental results, which demonstrate the superiority of Breg-SVRG over existing methods.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with saddle-point optimization and Bregman divergences, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The algorithm and its convergence guarantees are presented in a general form, which may make it difficult to understand the specific applications and examples presented in the paper.\n* The experimental results are limited to two example applications, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments and comparisons with other methods.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The proposal of Breg-SVRG and its application to adversarial prediction and LPboosting demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for solving complex optimization problems.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel algorithm, Breg-SVRG, which extends the SVRG method to accommodate Bregman divergences.\n* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of saddle-point optimization and the motivation behind the work.\n* The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, with a clear explanation of the algorithm and its convergence guarantees.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Breg-SVRG over existing methods.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with saddle-point optimization and Bregman divergences, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* The algorithm and its convergence guarantees are presented in a general form, which may make it difficult to understand the specific applications and examples presented in the paper.\n* The experimental results are limited to two example applications, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments and comparisons with other methods.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 8/10\nOriginality: 9/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and demonstrates the potential of Breg-SVRG for solving complex optimization problems. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more extensive experiments and comparisons with other methods to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm."
