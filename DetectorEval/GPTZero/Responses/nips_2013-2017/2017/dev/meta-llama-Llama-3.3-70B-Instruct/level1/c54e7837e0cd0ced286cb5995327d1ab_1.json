The authors argue that the dependence of BatchNorm on the entire minibatch is the source of its drawbacks, and propose a per-dimension correction to ensure that the activations match between the training and inference networks.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the motivation behind Batch Renormalization. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a good overview of the existing methods that address the limitations of BatchNorm. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithm and its components.\nThe experimental results are impressive, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Renormalization in improving the training of deep models on small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. The authors evaluate their method on the task of image classification, and show that it outperforms BatchNorm on both small and non-i.i.d. minibatches. The results are significant, and demonstrate the potential of Batch Renormalization to improve the performance of deep models in a variety of applications.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise explanation of the motivation behind Batch Renormalization\n* A thorough overview of the related work\n* A simple and easy-to-implement proposed method\n* Impressive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Renormalization\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The method has extra hyperparameters that need to be tuned, which can be a limitation in some applications\n* The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost of Batch Renormalization, which can be an important consideration in some applications\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of deep models in a variety of applications. The experimental results are impressive, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Renormalization in addressing the limitations of BatchNorm.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for addressing the limitations of BatchNorm\n* The experimental results are impressive, and demonstrate the potential of Batch Renormalization to improve the performance of deep models\n* The method is simple and easy to implement, and can be easily integrated into existing deep learning frameworks\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The method has extra hyperparameters that need to be tuned, which can be a limitation in some applications\n* The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost of Batch Renormalization, which can be an important consideration in some applications\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field of deep learning, and that the proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of deep models in a variety of applications.
