            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel attention module for action recognition and human object interaction tasks, which can be trained with or without extra supervision. The proposed attention module is a simple yet powerful extension of state-of-the-art base architectures, providing a significant boost in accuracy while keeping the network size and computational cost nearly the same. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three standard action recognition benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MPII dataset with a 12.5% relative improvement.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including a novel derivation of bottom-up and top-down attention as low-rank approximations of bilinear pooling methods. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with the proposed attention module outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a novel characterization of action recognition as a fine-grained recognition problem. The authors also provide an extensive analysis of their attention module, including a comparison with other attention-based methods and an analysis of the effect of using human pose keypoints as an intermediate supervision.\nThe paper has several strengths, including:\n* The proposed attention module is simple to implement and requires few additional parameters, making it an attractive alternative to standard pooling.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including a novel derivation of bottom-up and top-down attention.\n* The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with the proposed attention module outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses, including:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of attention and its application in computer vision, which may not be the case for all readers.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other attention-based methods, which would be helpful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the effect of using human pose keypoints as an intermediate supervision, including an analysis of the impact on performance and the potential limitations of this approach.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, making this a strong paper.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel attention module that provides a significant boost in accuracy while keeping the network size and computational cost nearly the same.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including a novel derivation of bottom-up and top-down attention.\n* The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with the proposed attention module outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of attention and its application in computer vision, which may not be the case for all readers.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other attention-based methods, which would be helpful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the effect of using human pose keypoints as an intermediate supervision, including an analysis of the impact on performance and the potential limitations of this approach.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 8/10\nSignificance: 9/10\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it introduces a novel attention module that provides a significant boost in accuracy while keeping the network size and computational cost nearly the same. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, and the experiments are thorough, with impressive results. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the effect of using human pose keypoints as an intermediate supervision and a comparison with other attention-based methods."
