            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel and efficient method for integrating attention modeling into CNN-based action recognition networks, offering a significant contribution to the field of computer vision. The authors propose an attention module that can be trained with or without additional supervision, providing substantial performance improvements on action recognition tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. The method is evaluated on three standard benchmarks (MPII, HICO, and HMDB-51), achieving state-of-the-art results on MPII and competitive performance on the others. The paper also provides a mathematical analysis, framing attention as a low-rank approximation of second-order pooling, which offers a fresh perspective on action recognition as a fine-grained recognition problem.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with a well-justified formulation of attention as low-rank second-order pooling. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showing consistent improvements across multiple datasets and baselines.\n2. Clarity: The writing is clear and well-structured, making the methodology accessible to readers. The derivation of the attention module and its integration into CNNs are explained in detail, supported by visualizations and ablation studies.\n3. Originality: The work introduces a novel perspective by connecting attention mechanisms with second-order pooling, a concept not widely explored in the action recognition domain. This connection could inspire further research in both attention modeling and fine-grained recognition.\n4. Significance: The proposed method is practical and easy to implement, requiring minimal additional parameters. Its applicability to both image and video-based action recognition tasks enhances its relevance to the broader research community.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity in Evaluation Metrics: Section 2 lacks clarity regarding the evaluation metrics used, particularly the definition of mean Average Precision (mAP). This could hinder reproducibility and understanding for readers unfamiliar with the datasets.\n2. Proofreading: A few typos remain in the manuscript, which detract slightly from its overall polish. Additional proofreading is recommended.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a significant problem in action recognition with a simple yet effective solution.\n- It provides strong experimental evidence, including state-of-the-art results on a benchmark dataset.\n- The theoretical insights linking attention and second-order pooling are novel and valuable.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Minor issues with clarity in the description of evaluation metrics could confuse readers.\n- The presence of typos suggests a need for more careful proofreading.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a meaningful scientific contribution and meets the quality standards of the conference. The minor issues identified do not detract significantly from the work's value. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity of evaluation metrics and correct typographical errors."
