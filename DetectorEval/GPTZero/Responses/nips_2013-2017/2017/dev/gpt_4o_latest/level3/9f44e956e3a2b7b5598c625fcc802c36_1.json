            "inputText": "This paper introduces the Incomplete-Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) algorithm for active sequential hypothesis testing, addressing a challenging scenario where the decision maker has limited knowledge of the statistical parameters governing the actions. The authors position their work as an extension to Chernoff's algorithm and related approaches, emphasizing its novelty in handling incomplete information and asymmetric, label-dependent noise. The paper makes significant contributions to the hypothesis testing and active learning literature by deriving theoretical lower bounds on sample size, proposing a novel belief update rule (Incomplete-Bayesian), and designing an adaptive action selection policy. The authors demonstrate that IBAG matches the derived lower bounds and outperforms Chernoff's algorithm and other benchmarks in most cases.\nStrengths:\n1. Quality: The paper is technically sound, with strong theoretical contributions. The derivation of lower bounds on sample size and the proof of IBAG's asymptotic optimality are rigorous and well-supported. The authors also provide extensive numerical experiments to validate their claims, demonstrating IBAG's robustness and superior performance across various scenarios.\n2. Originality: The paper addresses a novel problem setting by relaxing the assumption of full knowledge of action distributions. This is a meaningful departure from prior work, such as Chernoff's algorithm and generalized binary search (GBS), and fills a gap in the literature. The introduction of the Incomplete-Bayesian update rule and the Adaptive Gradient selection policy are innovative contributions.\n3. Significance: The results are impactful, particularly for real-world applications like crowdsourcing, medical diagnostics, and content search, where decision makers often operate under incomplete information. The robustness of IBAG to perturbations in worker quality and its ability to balance exploration and exploitation make it a practical and scalable solution.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The theoretical results are presented systematically, and the numerical experiments are well-explained. The authors effectively position their work within the context of prior research, citing relevant literature and highlighting key differences.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Scope of Evaluation: While the numerical results are compelling, the evaluation could benefit from additional real-world datasets or scenarios to further validate IBAG's practical utility.\n2. Assumptions on Principal Sets: The assumption that the principal sets of actions are known with certainty may limit the applicability of the approach in highly uncertain environments. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide empirical insights into its impact.\n3. Heterogeneous Costs: Although the authors briefly mention extending IBAG to handle heterogeneous action costs, this aspect is not explored in depth. A more detailed analysis or experimental validation of this extension would strengthen the paper.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper is a strong contribution to the field of active learning and hypothesis testing, addressing a novel and practical problem setting with rigorous theoretical and empirical support. While there are minor limitations in the scope of evaluation and assumptions, these do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the work. I recommend acceptance, as the paper advances the state of the art and provides a solid foundation for future research in scenarios with incomplete information.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- Novel contributions to active learning under incomplete information.\n- Rigorous theoretical analysis and matching empirical results.\n- Practical relevance to real-world applications.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Limited exploration of real-world datasets.\n- Assumptions on principal sets may restrict applicability in uncertain environments.\nOverall, the paper is well-suited for presentation at NIPS and will likely stimulate further research in this area."
