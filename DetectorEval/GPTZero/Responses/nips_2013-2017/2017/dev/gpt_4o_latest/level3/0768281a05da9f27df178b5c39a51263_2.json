            "inputText": "This paper introduces Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), a novel extension of the Hyperalignment (HA) method, addressing key challenges in multi-subject fMRI analysis, including nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and scalability. DHA leverages a deep network with stacked nonlinear transformations as a flexible kernel function, overcoming the limitations of fixed kernel approaches like Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA). By employing rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, DHA achieves computational efficiency, making it suitable for large datasets. The method also eliminates the need for training data during the functional alignment of new subjects, a significant advantage over prior methods.\nThe experimental evaluation is robust, involving five task-based and two movie-based fMRI datasets. The results demonstrate that DHA outperforms state-of-the-art HA methods, including Regularized Hyperalignment (RHA), Singular Value Decomposition Hyperalignment (SVDHA), and Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA), in both classification accuracy and runtime efficiency. The inclusion of feature selection experiments further highlights DHA's ability to provide superior feature representations, enhancing classification performance. The runtime analysis shows that DHA achieves a favorable balance between computational efficiency and alignment accuracy, outperforming computationally intensive methods like Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE).\nThe paper is technically sound, with a well-structured experimental setup and convincing empirical results. However, Section 3, which details the DHA formulation and optimization, is dense and mathematically intricate, potentially limiting accessibility for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. Simplifying or providing additional explanatory material for this section would enhance clarity. While the mathematical derivations appear rigorous, the reviewer is not an expert in this domain and cannot fully verify their correctness.\nIn terms of originality, DHA represents a significant advancement by integrating deep learning into HA, offering a novel approach to functional alignment. The use of a multi-layer kernel function and the reformulation of the HA objective function are innovative contributions. The paper also provides a thorough comparison with related work, situating DHA within the broader context of fMRI analysis.\nThe significance of this work is evident, as DHA addresses critical limitations of existing HA methods and demonstrates superior performance across diverse datasets. Its scalability and flexibility make it a valuable tool for neuroscience research, with potential applications in brain decoding and multi-subject analysis.\nPros:\n1. Innovative extension of HA using deep learning.\n2. Strong empirical evidence of superior performance.\n3. Scalable and computationally efficient approach.\n4. Thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods.\nCons:\n1. Section 3 is overly complex and could benefit from simplification.\n2. Limited accessibility for readers without a strong mathematical background.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to improve the clarity of Section 3."
