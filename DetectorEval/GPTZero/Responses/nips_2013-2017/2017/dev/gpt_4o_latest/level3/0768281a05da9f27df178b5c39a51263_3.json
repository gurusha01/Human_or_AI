            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel method, Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), to address the challenging problem of functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI datasets. DHA extends traditional hyperalignment (HA) techniques by leveraging deep neural networks as flexible, parametric kernels, enabling it to handle nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and large subject cohorts more effectively. Unlike prior methods, DHA does not rely on fixed kernel functions and employs rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, leading to scalable and efficient performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DHA outperforms state-of-the-art HA methods across multiple open fMRI datasets, making it a promising contribution to the field.\nStrengths: \nThe paper tackles a significant problem in neuroscience and machine learning, as functional alignment is critical for multi-subject fMRI analysis. The proposed method is well-motivated, combining elements of existing approaches (e.g., kernel methods, SVD, and deep learning) in a novel way. The experiments are thorough, utilizing diverse datasets and competitive baselines, and the results consistently show DHA's superiority in classification accuracy and runtime. The authors also provide detailed parameter settings and ablation studies, which enhance reproducibility and demonstrate the robustness of the method. Additionally, the paper highlights the scalability of DHA, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches like Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA) and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE).\nWeaknesses: \nWhile the mathematical formulation of DHA is comprehensive, the methods section is dense and could benefit from a clearer summary or illustrative figures to aid reader comprehension. The lack of preprocessing details for the datasets is a notable omission, as preprocessing can significantly impact fMRI analysis outcomes. Furthermore, the validation strategy raises concerns, as the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation might not fully capture generalization performance. Including comparisons with literature-reported results, rather than relying solely on author-generated baselines, would strengthen the evaluation. Finally, while the English quality is generally good, minor issues with clarity and repetition detract from the overall readability.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance: \nPros: \n1. Addresses a critical and challenging problem in fMRI analysis. \n2. Combines existing techniques innovatively to propose a scalable and effective method. \n3. Demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets and metrics. \n4. Provides detailed experimental setups and parameter reporting, enhancing reproducibility. \nCons: \n1. Dense methods section lacking visual aids or summaries. \n2. Limited preprocessing details and dataset-specific information. \n3. Validation strategy and reliance on author-generated baselines could be improved. \n4. Minor language issues that require proofreading.\nRecommendation: \nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to functional alignment in fMRI analysis and demonstrates clear advancements over existing methods. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and evaluation, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the concerns regarding clarity, preprocessing details, and validation in the final version."
