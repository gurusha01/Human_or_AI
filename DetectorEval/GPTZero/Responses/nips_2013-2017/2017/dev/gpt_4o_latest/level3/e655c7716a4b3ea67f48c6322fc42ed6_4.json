            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel multitask learning framework for Weighted Finite Automata (WFAs) by extending spectral methods to a multitask setting. The authors propose the concept of vector-valued WFAs (vv-WFAs), which allow multiple WFAs to share a common latent forward feature space while maintaining task-specific output vectors. This shared representation is theoretically motivated by a natural notion of relatedness between tasks, which is formalized using the rank of a joint Hankel tensor. The paper also provides a spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs, demonstrating its utility in multitask scenarios. The authors validate their approach with both theoretical insights and empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper presents a novel extension of spectral methods to multitask learning for WFAs, which has not been explored before. The introduction of vv-WFAs as a computational model is a significant contribution, offering a principled way to capture task relatedness.\n2. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is well-written, self-contained, and easy to follow. The theoretical foundations are clearly explained, and the algorithm is presented in a structured manner.\n3. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, including a generalization of the Fliess theorem to vector-valued functions and an asymmetric perturbation bound for singular subspace estimation. These results strengthen the paper's scientific contribution.\n4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets convincingly demonstrate the benefits of multitask spectral learning, particularly in low-data regimes. The comparison with baseline methods (e.g., single-task learning and naive bagging) highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.\n5. Significance: The work addresses an important problem in multitask learning for sequence data, with potential applications in natural language processing, computational biology, and reinforcement learning.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Assumption of Strong Relatedness: A potential limitation is the assumption of a strong notion of relatedness between tasks, as captured by the shared latent space. While this is theoretically sound, it may not always hold in real-world scenarios where tasks are only weakly related. Suggestions for relaxing this assumption or handling varying degrees of relatedness would improve the work.\n2. Scalability: The computational complexity of the proposed method grows with the number of tasks and the size of the shared feature space. While this is addressed theoretically, practical scalability for large-scale multitask problems could be further explored.\n3. Limited Exploration of Task Selection: The paper briefly discusses task selection (e.g., selecting the closest tasks), but a more detailed analysis of how task selection impacts performance would be valuable.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper presents a novel and theoretically grounded approach to multitask learning for WFAs, filling a gap in the literature.\n- The empirical results demonstrate clear benefits over baseline methods, particularly in low-data settings.\n- The work is well-written, accessible, and provides a strong theoretical foundation.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The assumption of strong task relatedness may limit the applicability of the method to diverse real-world problems.\n- Practical scalability for large task sets and larger alphabets could be further addressed.\nConclusion:\nOverall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to multitask learning and spectral methods for WFAs. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the work is likely to inspire further research in this area. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the practical applicability and scalability concerns."
