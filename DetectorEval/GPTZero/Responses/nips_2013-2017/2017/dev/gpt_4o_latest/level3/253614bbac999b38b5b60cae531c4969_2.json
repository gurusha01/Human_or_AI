            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to locally differentially private (LDP) mechanisms for repeated telemetry data collection, focusing on mean and histogram estimation. The authors address a critical limitation of existing LDP algorithms, which degrade in privacy guarantees when applied to continuous data collection. Their contributions include a 1-bit mechanism for mean estimation, a d-bit mechanism for histogram estimation, and the introduction of Î±-point rounding and memoization techniques to preserve privacy over repeated data collection. The proposed methods are deployed at scale by Microsoft, marking a significant milestone in industrial applications of differential privacy.\nStrengths:\n1. Practical Relevance: The paper tackles a pressing issue in telemetry data collection, where privacy guarantees must hold over time. The proposed mechanisms are tailored to real-world challenges, such as app usage statistics, making the work highly relevant to both academia and industry.\n2. Communication Efficiency: The 1-bit and d-bit mechanisms significantly reduce communication costs, enabling large-scale deployment. This is a key advancement over prior work, which often struggles with scalability.\n3. Industrial Deployment: The deployment of the proposed algorithms by Microsoft across millions of devices is a strong testament to the practicality and robustness of the methods. This claim of the largest industrial deployment of differential privacy to date is noteworthy.\n4. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on real-world datasets are convincing, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed mechanisms. The inclusion of synthetic data experiments further strengthens the generalizability of the findings.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity and Organization: The supplementary material overlaps significantly with the main paper, which can hinder clarity and readability. A clearer separation of content between the main text and supplementary material is recommended.\n2. Alpha-Rounding Guarantees: The Î±-point rounding technique is a key component of the proposed framework, but its guarantees and implications are not fully elaborated. Further clarification and theoretical analysis would enhance the paper's rigor.\n3. Reproducibility Concerns: The reliance on proprietary real-world data limits reproducibility. Including experiments on open-source simulated datasets would address this concern and allow for broader validation.\n4. Output Perturbation Trade-offs: While output perturbation is introduced to mitigate privacy leakage, its impact on accuracy and privacy guarantees could be explored in greater detail.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a critical and underexplored problem in differential privacy for continuous data collection.\n- The proposed mechanisms are novel, practical, and scalable, with demonstrated success in real-world deployment.\n- The work advances the state of the art in communication-efficient LDP mechanisms.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The clarity of the paper is hindered by overlapping content and insufficient elaboration on key concepts like Î±-point rounding.\n- Reproducibility is limited due to the use of proprietary data, which could restrict independent verification of results.\nConclusion:\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of differential privacy, particularly in the context of continuous data collection. While some areas require further clarification and improvement, the practical relevance, scalability, and industrial deployment of the proposed methods make it a strong candidate for acceptance."
