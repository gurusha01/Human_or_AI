The authors demonstrate that the proposed model significantly reduces memory requirements while maintaining high approximation accuracy. Theoretical analyses of approximation error and compression factors are presented, alongside experimental validation using high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) datasets. The paper also outlines algorithms for optimizing the tensor representation and compares the performance of LiFEsd with the original LiFE model in terms of size reduction and computational efficiency.\nStrengths: \n1. Novelty and Impact: The application of tensor decomposition to brain connectome estimation is a novel and impactful contribution, particularly for handling the computational challenges posed by large-scale neuroscience datasets. This work has the potential to influence future research in connectomics and neuroimaging. \n2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides comprehensive experimental results, validating the theoretical bounds on approximation accuracy and compression. The demonstrated 40x reduction in memory requirements without significant loss of accuracy is a compelling result. \n3. Clarity: The paper is well-written, with a clear structure and detailed explanations of the methods, theoretical results, and experimental findings. This makes it accessible to readers from both machine learning and neuroscience communities. \n4. Comparative Analysis: The inclusion of comparative results between the tensor-based LiFE_sd and the matrix-based LiFE model highlights the practical advantages of the proposed approach in terms of size compression and computational efficiency.\nWeaknesses: \n1. Limited Methodological Novelty: While the application of tensor decomposition is novel in this context, the ENCODE framework itself is not new. The primary contribution lies in adapting existing tensor decomposition techniques to the connectome evaluation problem, which may limit the methodological originality. \n2. Lack of Performance Comparison: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of the optimized connectome's performance (e.g., predictive accuracy or biological interpretability) between LiFE_sd and the original LiFE model. Such a comparison would strengthen the case for the practical utility of the tensor-based approach. \n3. Broader Applicability: While the paper focuses on connectomics, it would benefit from a discussion of how the proposed tensor decomposition framework could generalize to other domains within neuroscience or machine learning.\nArguments for Acceptance: \n- The paper addresses a significant computational bottleneck in connectome evaluation, making it highly relevant for large-scale neuroscience datasets. \n- The proposed approach is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, demonstrating both its feasibility and practical advantages. \n- The clarity and organization of the paper make it accessible to a broad audience, enhancing its potential impact.\nArguments for Rejection: \n- The methodological novelty is somewhat limited, as the primary contribution lies in applying existing tensor decomposition techniques. \n- The lack of direct performance comparisons with the original LiFE model leaves questions about the practical implications of the optimized connectome.\nRecommendation: \nOverall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field by introducing a computationally efficient framework for connectome evaluation. While the methodological novelty is limited, the demonstrated impact on memory reduction and computational efficiency is significant. Addressing the lack of performance comparisons in a future revision would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
