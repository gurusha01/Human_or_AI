            "inputText": "The paper addresses the problem of active sequential hypothesis testing under limited information, a novel extension of Chernoff's classic model. Unlike prior work, the authors assume only partial knowledge of the statistical parameters governing actions, introducing a binary outcome framework with a lower bound (\\(\\alpha(w)\\)) on action quality. The authors propose the Incomplete-Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) algorithm, which combines an approximate belief update rule and a gradient-based action selection policy. They derive theoretical guarantees, including a lower bound on sample complexity (\\(O(\\log(1/\\delta))\\)) and show that IBAG achieves order-wise optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate IBAG's robustness and superior performance compared to Chernoff's algorithm and Soft-Decision GBS in various scenarios.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new setting for active hypothesis testing with incomplete information, which has not been previously explored. This extension is relevant for real-world applications like crowdsourcing and medical diagnostics, where exact statistical parameters are often unavailable.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The derivation of a lower bound on sample complexity under limited information and the proof that IBAG matches this bound are significant contributions. The analysis bridges gaps in the literature by addressing the trade-off between caution and performance.\n3. Algorithm Design: IBAG is intuitive and computationally efficient. Its gradient-based policy effectively balances exploration and exploitation, outperforming existing algorithms in scenarios with varying action qualities.\n4. Empirical Validation: The simulations are thorough, demonstrating IBAG's robustness to slack (\\(q(w,j) - \\alpha(w)\\)) and its superior performance in both generalist-specialist and noisy environments.\nWeaknesses\n1. Upper Bound Analysis: The paper does not clearly address how the upper bound guarantees hold when \\(q(w,j)\\) and \\(\\alpha(w)\\) differ significantly. This could limit the practical applicability of the theoretical results.\n2. Lower Bound Recovery: It is unclear whether the derived lower bound recovers known results for the complete information scenario. Explicitly addressing this would strengthen the theoretical contribution.\n3. Simulation Comparisons: While the simulations are insightful, the paper does not directly compare the derived bounds on \\(E[T]\\) with empirical results. Including such comparisons would validate the theoretical claims more rigorously.\n4. Clarity: The technical sections, particularly the derivations of the IB update rule and the gradient-based policy, are dense and may be challenging for non-expert readers. Additional explanations or visual aids could improve clarity.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper tackles a novel and practically relevant problem, advancing the state of the art in active hypothesis testing.\n- Theoretical results are robust and well-supported by empirical evidence.\n- The IBAG algorithm is both effective and computationally feasible, with potential applications in real-world systems.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The lack of clarity in some technical sections may hinder accessibility.\n- The paper does not fully address how its results generalize to the complete information scenario or how the upper bound behaves under significant slack.\nRecommendation\nOverall, the paper makes a strong scientific contribution and is well-suited for the conference. Addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly the upper bound guarantees and simulation-theory comparisons, would further enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
