            "inputText": "The paper introduces a memory-efficient, approximate implementation of the Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) method for diffusion MRI tractography evaluation, leveraging a sparse tensor decomposition approach. By approximating the design matrix with discrete atoms linked to fiber orientations, the authors significantly reduce the memory footprint of the Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) optimization problem inherent in LiFE. Experimental results on human brain data validate the method's performance and demonstrate substantial memory savings, achieving compression factors of up to 40x with minimal approximation error. This work represents a meaningful contribution to the field of diffusion MRI, particularly in addressing computational challenges associated with high-resolution datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Significant Contribution: The proposed method addresses a critical bottleneck in diffusion MRI analysis\"\"memory inefficiency\"\"by introducing a novel sparse tensor decomposition approach. This is particularly relevant for modern high-resolution datasets, such as those from the Human Connectome Project.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including bounds on approximation error and compression factors, which are validated experimentally.\n3. Practical Impact: The memory reduction from 40GB to 1GB without significant loss in accuracy makes the method highly practical for large-scale connectome studies.\n4. Clear Presentation: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The inclusion of algorithms and theoretical propositions enhances reproducibility.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Terminology: The use of terms like \"decomposition\" and \"factorization\" may be misleading, as the method relies on precomputed inputs rather than simultaneously estimating unknown factors. Clarifying this distinction would improve the paper's precision.\n2. Model Assumptions: The reliance on the stick model for diffusion, which ignores hindered extracellular diffusion and free water compartments, is a limitation. Additionally, the fixed axial diffusivity parameter may not generalize well across datasets with varying diffusion properties.\n3. Broader Applicability: While the method is validated on specific datasets, its generalizability to other tractography algorithms or datasets with different acquisition parameters is not thoroughly explored.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPro:\n- The method is innovative and addresses a pressing computational challenge in diffusion MRI.\n- Theoretical and experimental results are robust and well-documented.\n- The paper is well-written and accessible to readers in the field.\nCon:\n- The terminology could lead to confusion about the nature of the method.\n- The assumptions of the stick model and fixed diffusivity may limit the method's applicability in diverse scenarios.\nRecommendation:\nThis paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of diffusion MRI tractography by advancing the state of the art in memory-efficient connectome evaluation. While there are minor limitations in terminology and model assumptions, these do not detract significantly from the overall quality and impact of the work. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the clarity of terminology and discuss the implications of the model assumptions more thoroughly."
