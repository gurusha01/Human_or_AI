            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel and efficient sparse approximation of the Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) model for tractography using a Tucker tensor decomposition framework, termed LiFESD. This approach addresses the computational inefficiencies of the original LiFE model, which is memory-intensive and computationally prohibitive for high-resolution datasets. By leveraging sparse tensor decomposition, the authors achieve significant compression (up to 40x), reducing memory requirements from approximately 40GB to 1GB, while maintaining a model approximation error of less than 1%. The theoretical bounds for accuracy and compression are rigorously derived and validated experimentally on real-world datasets, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed method.\nStrengths: \nThe paper makes a strong technical contribution by introducing a novel application of tensor decomposition to a critical problem in neuroscience. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental results convincingly validate the proposed method. The authors demonstrate the scalability of LiFESD across varying numbers of gradient directions and fascicles, highlighting its practical utility for modern high-resolution datasets. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and intuitive figures that enhance accessibility for readers, including those unfamiliar with tensor decomposition or tractography. Additionally, the method's potential to advance connectomics and related fields is well-articulated, making it a significant contribution to both neuroscience and computational modeling.\nWeaknesses: \nThe primary limitation lies in the superficial evaluation of the model's application to tractography. While the authors acknowledge this as a result of space constraints, a more detailed analysis of the biological or neuroscientific implications of the results would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the argument regarding convex models lacks sufficient depth and could be made more convincing. Minor issues include a sentence structure problem in line 195 and a typographical error (\"aproach\" Ã¢ ' \"approach\") in line 202, which should be corrected for clarity.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance: \nPro: \n- The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in connectome evaluation with a novel and efficient solution. \n- Theoretical and experimental validations are robust, demonstrating both accuracy and scalability. \n- The writing and presentation are clear, making the work accessible to a broad audience. \n- The method has significant potential for advancing neuroscience and related computational fields. \nCon: \n- Limited evaluation of the model's biological relevance in tractography. \n- Minor issues with clarity in specific arguments and typographical errors. \nRecommendation: \nDespite the noted weaknesses, the paper makes a substantial scientific contribution by advancing the state of the art in connectome evaluation through an innovative application of tensor decomposition. The theoretical rigor, experimental validation, and practical implications outweigh the limitations. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the identified issues."
