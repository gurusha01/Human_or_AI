            "inputText": "The paper introduces YASS, a novel and well-engineered pipeline for spike sorting in dense multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, which represents a significant contribution to the field. By combining state-of-the-art techniques, such as neural network-based spike detection, Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering, and a modular \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach, YASS advances the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of spike sorting, particularly for retinal MEA data. The pipeline demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods like Kilosort, Spyking Circus, and MountainSort, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings and with fewer low-stability clusters. This work addresses a critical bottleneck in neuroscience research and has the potential for significant practical and scientific impact.\nHowever, there are several limitations that reduce the overall reproducibility and generalizability of the work. The lack of publicly available code is a major drawback, as it prevents independent validation and wider adoption of the pipeline. The neural network-based spike detection method, while innovative, is insufficiently described, particularly regarding the generation and validation of training data. This lack of clarity raises concerns about the robustness of the method, especially for labs without access to dense MEA training data. Furthermore, the pipeline's applicability to cortical data remains questionable. Challenges such as waveform drift and the lack of realistic cortical training data are not adequately addressed, limiting the broader utility of YASS beyond retinal recordings.\nThe use of synthetic training data also warrants scrutiny. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence that the synthetic data accurately represents real electrophysiological recordings, which could impact the validity of the results. Additionally, minor issues such as the unclear Y-axis labeling in Figure 3 and the insufficient description of the spatial whitening procedure detract from the clarity of the manuscript.\nStrengths:\n- Significant improvement in spike sorting accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.\n- Modular and scalable pipeline design, enabling future updates and parallelization.\n- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated on retinal MEA data.\nWeaknesses:\n- Lack of publicly available code limits reproducibility.\n- Insufficient description of neural network training and validation processes.\n- Limited generalization to cortical data due to unaddressed waveform drift and training data challenges.\n- Ambiguities in the use of synthetic training data and minor clarity issues in the manuscript.\nRecommendation:\nWhile YASS represents a strong contribution to retinal MEA spike sorting, the lack of code availability and insufficient generalization to cortical data are significant concerns. If the authors address these issues, particularly by releasing the code and providing more clarity on neural network training and synthetic data representativeness, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance. For now, I recommend acceptance with major revisions."
