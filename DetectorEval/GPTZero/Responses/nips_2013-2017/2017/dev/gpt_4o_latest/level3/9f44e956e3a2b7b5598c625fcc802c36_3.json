            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThis paper addresses the problem of active sequential hypothesis testing under incomplete information, proposing the Incomplete-Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) algorithm. The authors introduce a novel model where the decision maker has limited knowledge of the statistical parameters governing the outcomes of actions, relying only on binary responses and a lower bound on action quality. The IBAG algorithm combines an incomplete Bayesian update rule with a greedy action selection strategy to maximize the growth of the belief vector's true hypothesis component. The paper derives matching upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity with respect to the confidence parameter, Î´, and demonstrates the algorithm's performance through numerical experiments.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new model that relaxes the assumption of full knowledge of outcome distributions, which is a significant departure from traditional active hypothesis testing frameworks. This extension is relevant to real-world applications where such information is often unavailable.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors derive both upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity, showing that the IBAG algorithm asymptotically matches the lower bound. This theoretical rigor strengthens the paper's claims.\n3. Practical Relevance: The proposed model has clear applications in domains like crowdsourcing, medical diagnostics, and content search, as outlined in the introduction.\n4. Numerical Results: The simulations demonstrate the robustness of the IBAG algorithm to incomplete knowledge and its superior performance compared to Chernoff's algorithm and Soft-Decision GBS under various scenarios.\nWeaknesses\n1. Motivation and Positioning: The paper lacks a compelling justification for the proposed model. The example applications provided feel somewhat contrived and could be better integrated into the introduction to motivate the work.\n2. Limited Analysis: The theoretical bounds focus solely on Î´, with no discussion of dependencies on other key parameters, such as the number of hypotheses (\"J\") or actions (\"W\"). This omission limits the generalizability of the results.\n3. Comparative Analysis: While numerical comparisons are provided, the paper does not include theoretical comparisons with existing methods like Chernoff's algorithm or Generalized Binary Search (GBS). This would have strengthened the claims of IBAG's superiority.\n4. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written, but some sections, particularly those describing the IB update rule and the derivation of bounds, are dense and could benefit from additional explanation or examples.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem, introducing a novel model and algorithm.\n- Theoretical contributions are significant, with matching upper and lower bounds on sample complexity.\n- Numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance and robustness of the proposed approach.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The lack of strong motivation and natural examples weakens the paper's impact.\n- Theoretical analysis is incomplete, as it does not consider dependencies on parameters like \"J\" or \"W\".\n- The absence of theoretical comparisons with existing methods limits the paper's contribution to the broader literature.\nRecommendation\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of active hypothesis testing, particularly in scenarios with incomplete information. However, the lack of strong motivation, limited theoretical analysis, and absence of theoretical comparisons with prior work are significant drawbacks. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving the motivation, providing a broader theoretical analysis, and clarifying dense sections."
