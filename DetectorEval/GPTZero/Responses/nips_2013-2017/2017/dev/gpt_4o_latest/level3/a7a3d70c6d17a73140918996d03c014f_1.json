            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel measure of sample complexity, termed the split-sample growth rate, and demonstrates its utility in analyzing the sample complexity of revenue-optimal auctions. This concept measures the growth rate of hypotheses generated by empirical risk minimization (ERM) on subsets of a given sample. The authors show that the expected generalization error can be bounded by a function of the split-sample growth rate, leading to tighter and more interpretable sample complexity bounds for various auction classes. The paper builds on prior work by Morgenstern and Roughgarden, among others, and strengthens existing results by offering a more structural and simplified analysis framework. Notably, the authors apply their framework to auction scenarios such as bundle pricing, item pricing, and player-specific reserves, achieving improved or comparable sample complexity bounds.\nStrengths:\n1. Novel Contribution: The introduction of the split-sample growth rate is a significant theoretical advancement. It provides a fresh perspective on bounding generalization error, which could have implications beyond auction design in broader statistical learning theory.\n2. Simplified Analysis: The proposed framework simplifies the derivation of sample complexity bounds for auction classes, avoiding the need for more intricate tools like pseudo-dimension or compression bounds.\n3. Improved Results: The paper achieves tighter sample complexity bounds in certain auction settings, such as multi-item pricing with additive buyers, compared to prior work.\n4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with clear definitions, theorems, and proofs. The authors provide intuitive explanations alongside formal results, making the work accessible to a broad audience.\n5. Broader Applicability: While the focus is on auctions, the split-sample growth rate is positioned as a general tool for analyzing sample complexity in PAC learning, potentially sparking further research in other domains.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Empirical Validation: The paper focuses exclusively on theoretical results and does not include empirical experiments to validate the practical utility of the split-sample growth rate in real-world auction scenarios.\n2. Dependence on Assumptions: The results rely on specific assumptions, such as bounded revenue or regularity conditions, which may limit the applicability of the framework to certain auction settings.\n3. High-Probability Bounds: The use of Markov's inequality for high-probability bounds leads to a dependence on \\(1/\\delta\\), which is weaker than the logarithmic dependence achieved via McDiarmid's inequality in standard Rademacher complexity analysis. This limitation is acknowledged but not resolved.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a clear and significant theoretical contribution by introducing a novel complexity measure that simplifies and strengthens existing results.\n- It addresses an important problem in auction design, advancing the state of the art in sample complexity analysis.\n- The work is well-written, rigorous, and likely to inspire follow-up research in both auction theory and statistical learning.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of empirical validation leaves open questions about the practical impact of the proposed framework.\n- The reliance on specific assumptions and the weaker high-probability bounds may limit the generality and robustness of the results.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of auction design and statistical learning theory. While the lack of empirical results is a drawback, the novelty and rigor of the proposed framework outweigh this limitation. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to include discussions on potential empirical applications and extensions in future work."
