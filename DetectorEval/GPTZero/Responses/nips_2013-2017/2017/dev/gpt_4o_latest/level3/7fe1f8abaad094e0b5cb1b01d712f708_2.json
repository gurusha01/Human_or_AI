            "inputText": "This paper introduces \"reach subgame solving,\" a novel approach for decision-making in imperfect-information, two-player zero-sum games, with a focus on subgame-solving techniques. The authors address the challenge of solving subgames in isolation by considering payoff differences in paths leading into and away from an information set. They extend this method to handle multiple independent subgames and adapt it to respond to off-tree opponent actions, outperforming prior action translation methods. The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness through empirical results, showing reduced exploitability and alignment with Nash equilibrium values. Notably, the techniques were a key component of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top human players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.\nStrengths\n1. Technical Innovation: The proposed reach subgame-solving method advances the state of the art by incorporating opponent payoffs from alternative paths, which improves both theoretical guarantees and practical performance compared to prior techniques like unsafe subgame solving and resolving.\n2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results, demonstrating significant gains in exploitability reduction over existing methods. The nested subgame-solving approach also outperforms action translation, a widely used baseline.\n3. Real-World Impact: The application of these techniques in Libratus, which decisively defeated top human players in no-limit poker, is a landmark achievement for AI in imperfect-information games.\n4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of prior work, theoretical contributions, and experimental results. The inclusion of illustrative examples such as the \"Coin Toss\" game aids understanding.\nWeaknesses\n1. Baseline Limitations: While the paper claims improvements over existing methods, the baseline methods, such as unsafe subgame solving, lack theoretical guarantees. This raises questions about the robustness of the comparisons.\n2. Generality: The method's applicability to other game-theoretic solution concepts, such as (coarse) correlated equilibria or non-zero-sum games, is not explored. This limits the broader impact of the work.\n3. Scalability: While the method performs well in poker, the scalability to other large-scale imperfect-information games with different structures is not thoroughly discussed.\n4. Gift Division Heuristic: The heuristic for dividing \"gifts\" among subgames, while effective in practice, weakens the theoretical guarantees. The paper does not fully explore the trade-offs between theoretical safety and practical performance.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in imperfect-information game solving and provides both theoretical and practical advancements.\n- It demonstrates real-world impact by achieving a major milestone in AI through Libratus.\n- The empirical results are compelling, showing consistent improvements over prior methods.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The reliance on baselines without strong theoretical guarantees could weaken the significance of the results.\n- The method's generalizability to other game-theoretic settings and scalability to diverse domains remains unclear.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to subgame solving in imperfect-information games are significant, and the demonstrated success in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker is a major milestone for the field. However, future work should address the applicability to broader classes of games and refine the theoretical guarantees of the proposed heuristics."
