            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel multitask spectral learning approach for estimating shared representations across multiple weighted finite automata (WFAs). By leveraging a vector-valued WFA (vv-WFA) formulation, the authors propose a spectral learning algorithm that extracts a joint feature space for related tasks. This multitask approach demonstrates superior performance compared to single-task learning on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including experiments on 33 languages. The paper is a pioneering attempt to apply multitask learning to WFAs, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nStrengths:\n1. Originality and Novelty: The introduction of vector-valued WFAs and their application to multitask learning is innovative. This work extends spectral learning to a multitask setting, filling a gap in the literature.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including guarantees on the rank of shared representations, computational complexity analysis, and robustness in subspace estimation. The use of recent results on asymmetric perturbation bounds further strengthens the theoretical rigor.\n3. Empirical Validation: The multitask approach is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its practical utility. The results demonstrate clear improvements in perplexity and word error rate (WER) for related tasks, particularly in low-data regimes.\n4. Clarity of Methodology: The algorithm is well-detailed, with clear steps for estimating vv-WFAs and projecting scalar WFAs to their minimal dimensions.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Insufficient Context and Motivation: The paper does not adequately discuss the broader context and motivation for spectral learning of WFAs. A more detailed comparison with competing methods, such as recurrent neural networks or Bayesian approaches, would strengthen the paper.\n2. Limited Baseline Comparisons: While the evaluation compares single-task and multitask WFAs, it lacks comparisons with alternative multitask learning methods or other sequence modeling approaches, such as neural architectures.\n3. Clarity of Related Work: Although the paper claims to be the first to apply multitask learning to WFAs, the related work section could better position this contribution within the broader multitask learning literature, including recent advances in neural multitask models.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound approach to multitask learning for WFAs, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n- The empirical results are compelling and demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed method.\n- The methodology is well-detailed and reproducible, with clear theoretical guarantees.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of sufficient context and motivation for spectral learning of WFAs may limit the accessibility of the paper to a broader audience.\n- The absence of comparisons with alternative multitask learning methods or neural approaches leaves open questions about the relative performance of the proposed method.\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. While the paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution, addressing the weaknesses in context, motivation, and baseline comparisons would significantly enhance its impact."
