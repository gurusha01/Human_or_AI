In the present work, the authors approximate the design matrix using discrete atoms linked to fibre orientation, enabling the NNLS problem to be reformulated as a memory-efficient, sparse tensor representation. The performance of this approximation, along with the memory efficiency of the tensor encoding, is demonstrated on human brain data.\nThe manuscript is well-written and easy to follow. The conclusions are well-supported by the presented data. This work represents a significant contribution that will be of interest to the diffusion MRI tractography community. However, I have two main points of criticism:\n1. I find the use of the terms \"decomposition\" and \"factorization\" in the title and throughout the text to be misleading. These terms are typically associated with methods like singular value decomposition or nonnegative matrix factorization, where a single matrix or tensor is expressed as a linear combination of unknown components that are computed simultaneously under specific constraints. In this work, the matrix M and its sparse tensor representation (D and Phi) are precomputed and provided as inputs to the method.
