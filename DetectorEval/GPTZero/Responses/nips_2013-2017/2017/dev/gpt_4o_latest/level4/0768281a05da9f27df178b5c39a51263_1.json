The proposed method is evaluated on several real fMRI datasets, demonstrating improved classification accuracy and reduced computational time compared to an alternative deep learning architecture.\nComment \n1. The novelty of the proposed method is not well-established. Based on the description, the approach appears to combine elements from prior work. Does replacing basis functions with neural networks significantly increase the complexity of the optimization problem? Additionally, the optimization procedure seems heavily influenced by earlier studies.\n2. The paper should include citations to the work of Georg Lang on functional alignment.\n3. The primary goal of alignment is to establish subject correspondence to account for inter-subject variability. The most effective way to validate improved correspondence is by visually demonstrating better alignment of subjects' activation patterns. However, the use of a classification task for evaluation in this study makes it difficult to discern whether the improved performance is due to better alignment or simply a superior functional representation. Furthermore, it is unclear how the aligned data can be mapped back to the original anatomical space for interpretability.\n4. Given that G is not unique, could this significantly affect the results?\n5. The reported results may suffer from overfitting or bias, as the best performance across a range of parameter values is presented instead of employing proper nested cross-validation. Models with greater flexibility are likely to perform better under such conditions. Additionally, the choice of parameter ranges could substantially influence the outcomes.\n6. Functional hyperalignment is generally assumed to bypass the need for pre-anatomical alignment. Does the observed performance improvement persist if spatial normalization is omitted?"
