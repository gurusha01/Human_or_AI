            "inputText": "Review - Summary:\nRademacher complexity is a widely-used tool for deriving generalization guarantees. It measures the expected maximum difference between training and test performance for a class \\( H \\) on a sample \\( S \\), assuming \\( S \\) is randomly split into training and test sets, and the maximum is taken over all \\( h \\in H \\) (Equation 11). This paper observes that the key steps in the standard generalization bound proof remain valid if, instead of taking the maximum over all \\( h \\in H \\), one considers only the \\( h \\)'s that the learning procedure could output when given half of a double sample (Lemma 1). While the usual high-probability step in this argument does not directly apply, the authors demonstrate (Theorem 2) that a meaningful generalization bound can still be achieved using alternative techniques. The paper further shows that this generalization bound leads to strong sample complexity guarantees for several natural auction classes. In some cases, these results improve upon the best known prior guarantees while also simplifying the analysis.\nEvaluation:\nAlthough the core idea is primarily an observation, I find the paper appealing because it introduces a clever and teachable concept. Moreover, it enables a more straightforward sample complexity analysis for auctions, which is a significant contribution. The approach may also have broader applications. On the downside, the paper leaves open the question of whether the linear dependence on \\( 1/\\delta \\) in Theorem 2 is truly necessary (see below), and addressing this would have made the work feel more complete. Nevertheless, I am generally positive about the paper.\nQuestions:\n1. Is the linear dependence on \\( \\delta \\) in Theorem 2 unavoidable? I understand why it arises in your proof (due to the use of Markov's inequality), and you provide a clear explanation of why the usual application of McDiarmid's inequality to obtain an \\( O(\\log(1/\\delta)) \\) bound does not work. However, this leaves open two possibilities: (a) whether there exists an alternative approach to achieve an \\( O(\\log(1/\\delta)) \\) bound, or (b) whether there are distributions \\( D \\) and hypothesis classes \\( H \\) where the failure probability indeed exhibits heavier tails. Resolving this question would make the paper feel more complete.\n2. Can you derive a bound similar to Theorem 2 in terms of the maximum number of hypotheses that can be produced from half of the actual sample \\( S \\)? Specifically, could you replace the supremum over all samples \\( S \\) of size \\( m \\) in the definition of \\( \\hat{\\tau} \\) with the actual training sample \\( S \\)?\nSuggestions:\n- If I understand correctly, the proof of Lemma 1 essentially follows the textbook Rademacher bound proof, with modifications to replace \\( H \\) with \\( \\hat{H}_{S \\cup S'} \\) where necessary. This is perfectly fine, but it would be helpful to explicitly inform the reader upfront that this is the case. This way, they can clearly distinguish between what is standard and what is novel. For example, your discussion of Theorem 2, where you highlight how it differs from the usual argument, is quite effective and could serve as a model for Lemma 1.\n- In Section 4, you analyze several interesting scenarios (e.g., single bidder, multiple i.i.d. regular bidders), and for each case, you state, \"In this case, the space of hypotheses \\( H \\) is ...\". I believe what you mean to convey is that \"In this case, it is known that an optimal auction belongs to the hypothesis class \\( H \\) of ...\". In other words, the generalization guarantees apply to any \\( H \\), but you are specifying the relevant \\( H \\) for each scenario. Making this explicit would help avoid confusion, as readers might otherwise wonder why \\( H \\) changes in each case.\n- Finally, I would like to point out that the idea of counting the number of possible outputs of an auction mechanism to derive a sample complexity bound has been explored in the auction literature before. The earliest instance I am aware of is the FOCS 2005 paper \"Mechanism Design via Machine Learning\" by Balcan, Blum, Hartline, and Mansour. However, that work operates in a transductive setting, where such arguments are easier to make. It might be worth acknowledging this connection."
