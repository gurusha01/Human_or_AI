            "inputText": "The authors propose algorithms and present experimental results for addressing zero-sum imperfect information extensive-form games, using heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em poker as the primary motivating application.\nThe paper begins by distinguishing between \"unsafe\" and \"safe\" subgame solving. In unsafe subgame solving, the opponent's strategy outside the subgame\"\"and consequently the distribution of the player's state within the initial information set\"\"is held constant. In contrast, safe subgame solving allows the opponent's strategy in the subgame's head to adapt, making the distribution of true states responsive to the player's strategy.\nThe authors then introduce \"reach\" subgame solving, which involves computing a \"gift\" (the additional value the opponent could have gained by selecting an alternative subgame) for each path leading to the subgame. These computed gifts are incorporated into the margin for each information set.\nSubsequently, the authors propose nested subgame solving as a technique to address large action spaces. Here, the trunk strategy is computed for an abstracted version of the game, but whenever the opponent selects an action outside the abstraction, a new subgame is dynamically generated and solved to include that action.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that combining these two methods yields highly effective practical performance.\nOverall, I found the paper to be well-structured and easy to follow, with the algorithm's performance appearing impressive. My comments are minor and pertain to the presentation:\n1. Gifts are described as \"allowing P2 to be less concerned with P1 reaching the subgame along that path\" (L.173-174). I infer that the gift can be added to the margin because it quantifies how unappealing a branch is to the opponent, aligning with the goal of maxmargin solving to make the subgame as unattractive as possible to the opponent. However, a more concrete explanation or additional clarification would enhance understanding.\n2. At L.297-303, the authors observe that no-split variants consistently outperform split variants, despite the latter having stronger theoretical guarantees. They mention that this might not hold if gifts are scaled too aggressively, but this observation seems tangential, as the experimental results do not appear to involve scaling\"\"only the absence of division. \n - If the full gift is awarded to every subgame without division or scaling, does exploitability ever worsen in practice? If so, could the authors provide an example? If not, do the authors have an intuition for why this might be the case? \n - At L.210, the authors state that any split suffices for theoretical guarantees, but it seems evident that some splits are more effective than others. For instance, assigning the entire gift to the lowest-probability subgame could leave significant value untapped, potentially resembling a scenario close to not using Reach at all. A brief discussion of this would be valuable.\n3. At L.88, \"Figure 4a\" appears to be a typographical error and should likely be corrected to \"Figure 1.\""
