By approximating the solution to this ODE, the expectation of \\( f \\) can subsequently be computed.\nAs this paper falls outside my primary area of expertise, I recommend that the committee give significant weight to other reviewers' assessments of this work.\nFrom my perspective as a non-expert, the paper would benefit from a clearer exposition. In particular, it is easy to \"miss the bigger picture\" amidst the technical details. While the paper offers a strong high-level introduction to the problem, it transitions too quickly into the mathematical formalism. Adding an intermediate level of explanation\"\"perhaps a paragraph or two\"\"would bridge this gap effectively. For example, the authors could provide a concrete example that makes the variables \\( \\lambda, \\phi, f, N, H_t, \\) etc., more tangible in the context of a specific application. This might include a clear statement of the input and output data. For instance, a few sentences along the lines of: \"As an example, suppose we aim to predict \\( X \\) from \\( Y \\). We are given \\( Z \\) (denoted as \\( W \\) in the paper) and wish to predict \\( A \\) (denoted as \\( B \\) in the paper).\" Such an explanation would greatly aid in contextualizing the mathematical framework and equations, which I could follow formally but found challenging to interpret in terms of practical applications.\nAdditional observations:\n- Given the rising interest in \"optimal transport\" within the machine learning community, it may be worth clarifying that the term \"mass transport\" here refers to the ODE/PDE formulation for moving mass, rather than concepts like Wasserstein distances.\n- Theorem 2 is intuitive, but it would be helpful to provide a brief explanation before diving into the proof sketch. Essentially, the equation describes how \\( \\phi(x,t) \\) evolves due to two factors: (1) an event occurring in a regime that hasn't yet reached \\( \\phi(x,t) \\), which increases \\( \\phi(x-1,t) \\) (the second term), or (2) an additional event occurring, which increases \\( \\phi(x+1,t) \\) (the first term).\n- Line 153: Why is it assumed that the upper bound for \\( x \\) is known a priori?\n- Line 190(ii): The phrase \"compute the intensity function\" feels vague\"\"could this be clarified further?\n- Paragraph starting at line 207: What does \\( u \\) represent in this context? This is not immediately clear."
