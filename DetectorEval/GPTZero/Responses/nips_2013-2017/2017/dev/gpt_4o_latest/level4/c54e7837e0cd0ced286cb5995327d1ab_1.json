The proposed method is both straightforward to understand and easy to implement. Experimental results demonstrate that Batch Renormalization performs effectively with non-i.i.d. minibatches and enhances the performance of small minibatches compared to batchnorm.\nThe authors begin by providing a concise review of batchnorm, highlighting its key limitations: the inconsistency of mean and variance between training and inference, and its instability when applied to small minibatches. While using moving averages for normalization might seem like an intuitive solution, this approach can cause the model to diverge. To address this, the authors propose a simple Batch Renormalization method that combines the minibatch mean and variance with moving averages. In my view, Batch Renormalization essentially transitions from the original batchnorm (which normalizes using the minibatch mean and variance) to a version of batchnorm that relies almost entirely on moving averages.
