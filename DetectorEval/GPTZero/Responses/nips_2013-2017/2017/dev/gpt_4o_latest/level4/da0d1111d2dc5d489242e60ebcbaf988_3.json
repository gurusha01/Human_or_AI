            "inputText": "Summary \nThis paper introduces an algorithm designed to tackle a mixed online/stochastic scenario, where the objective function consists of a sequence of arbitrary convex functions (with bounded subgradients) under stochastic convex constraints (also with bounded subgradients). The authors provide a static regret analysis, both in expectation and with high probability. Additionally, a real-world experiment focused on job allocation across servers (aiming to minimize electricity costs) demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach.\nAssessment \n+ The structure and presentation are clear and well-organized. \n+ The work is technically robust and appears novel. \n+ The regret guarantees are strong. \n- The connection to \"Deterministic constrained convex optimization\" is unclear. \n- There is ambiguity regarding unreferenced prior work [A]. \n- The experimental section requires more details. \nFurther elaboration is provided below.\nFurther Comments \n- In Section 2.2, the algorithm's rationale is outlined, particularly the choice of \\( x(t+1) \\) to minimize the \"drift-plus-penalty\" term. Could the authors provide some intuition on how the drift and penalty terms are balanced (e.g., why a simple sum without a tuning weight suffices)? \n- Regarding Lemma 5, I lack the expertise to confidently evaluate whether it constitutes \"a new drift analysis lemma for stochastic processes.\" My familiarity with the stochastic process literature is limited. \n- Could the performance be improved by allowing \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( V \\) to vary with \\( t \\)? \n- For Lemma 9, it seems possible that the authors could leverage results from Proposition 34 in [B]. \n- Comparison with \"OCO with long-term constraints\": It seems that [A] (which is not cited) already provides \\( O(\\sqrt{T}) \\) guarantees for both regret and constraint violations using a similar algorithmic approach. This related work should be discussed. \n- Comparison with \"Stochastic constrained convex optimization\": Is [16] the only relevant reference in this context? \n- Clarification regarding \"Deterministic constrained convex optimization\": In deterministic constrained settings, optimization algorithms are typically expected to produce feasible solutions. Why is it acceptable here to allow constraint violations (e.g., \\( O(1/\\sqrt{T}) \\))? Could the authors clarify why this makes sense in the stochastic setting? \n- Experiments: \n - Additional details about the baselines and implementation (e.g., starting points) should be included in the main paper to ensure reproducibility. \n - Is the set \\( \\mathcal{X}0 = [x1^{\\text{min}}, x1^{\\text{max}}] \\times \\dots \\times [x{100}^{\\text{min}}, x_{100}^{\\text{max}}] \\)? If so, this implies that problem (2) involves box constraints. More details would be helpful. \n - Using a log scale for unserved jobs in Figure (d) might improve clarity. \n - Enlarging the figures would enhance readability. \n - An assessment of result variability is missing. Repeated experiments with standard errors and means would help establish the significance of the findings. \n - To allocate more space for the experimental section, Section 4 could be condensed and moved to the supplementary material. \n- Could the analysis be extended to the dynamic regret setting? \nMinor Comments \n- Line 52: Typo \"\" \"min\" should be \"argmin.\" Additionally, under what assumptions does the argmin reduce to a unique \\( x^* \\)? \n- Line 204 (a): Should this be an inequality rather than an equality? \n[A] Yu, H. & Neely, M.

After reviewing the other evaluations, I stand by my initial score. However, I strongly encourage the authors to clarify the discussion regarding the stochastic versus deterministic constrained convex optimization case, as outlined in their rebuttal."
