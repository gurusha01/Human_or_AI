            "inputText": "In my view, this paper is of high quality, though I must note that I am not an expert in point processes, which should be considered when interpreting this review. I would place it in the top 50% of NIPS submissions as a conservative estimate, acknowledging my limited expertise in fully assessing its contributions. I have requested the committee to ensure that at least one reviewer with sufficient expertise in evaluating the proofs is assigned to this paper, and they have assured me this will be done. I hope this paper is accepted, as I am interested in exploring its applications. My primary critique is that the content would be more appropriately presented in a longer format, around 20 pages.\nHere are my detailed comments within the scope of my expertise:\nFrom my background in modeling user activity and analyzing time series data (e.g., heart rate and accelerometer data), this paper was not what I initially expected based on the title. I believe the paper might be better titled \"HYBRID: A Framework for Unbiased Estimation of the Probability Mass Function of Point Processes,\" though I understand the rationale behind the current title after reading the paper.\nThe paper offers several contributions to the proposed framework: reformulating the prediction problem using a conditional expectation that incorporates historical data, achieving sample efficiency through reduced variance in the new estimator, deriving a differential-difference equation for computing the conditional estimator, and providing both theoretical evaluations on synthetic data and experimental validations on real-world datasets. Overall, the paper is well-supported, well-written, and presents a strong contribution.\nPrior Art:\nOne observation regarding prior work is that a single cluster of authors (referenced in citations 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 31) dominates the references. While these citations are necessary, as the authors must reference this foundational material, it would be more appropriate to directly cite the original authors of the datasets used. For example:\n- For the Twitter dataset, the following citation seems more appropriate: \n Demetris Antoniades and Constantine Dovrolis. \"Co-evolutionary dynamics in social networks: A case study of Twitter.\" Computational Social Networks, 2(1):14, 2015.\n- For the P2P IPTV dataset used in Section 6.1.2, this citation would be more suitable: \n Yehia Elkhatib, Mu Mu, and Nicholas Race. \"Dataset on usage of a live & VoD P2P IPTV service.\" P2P, London, UK, 2014.\nIt appears that space limitations may have influenced the decision to rely on secondary references like [12] and [24], but citing the original sources would be more appropriate. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify whether this area of research is primarily dominated by this single group or if other research groups are actively contributing. This feedback might be more relevant for a journal version of the paper.\nSolution Overview (Section 3):\nRegarding the claim of generalizability, could the authors provide an example of a point process not covered by prior work (e.g., not represented by a reinforced Poisson process or a Hawkes process)? As someone less familiar with point processes, such an example would help clarify the broader impact of this work. This was effectively done in lines 31–32 to explain the importance of generalizing the function.\nThe paper is well-presented overall, with the primary contribution being a more general framework that preserves the stochasticity of the function while requiring fewer samples than Monte Carlo methods.\nRegarding the claim of introducing a new random variable, \\( g(H_{t-}) \\), the concept of a conditional intensity function conditioned on the history of the process is not new, based on my brief research. I assume the novelty lies in using this as a random variable for prediction, which could be clarified further.\nThe closest related work I found is: \nYongqing Wang, Shenghua Liu, Huawei Shen, and Xueqi Cheng. \"Marked Temporal Dynamics Modeling based on Recurrent Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03918.pdf). \nIf this work is relevant, the authors might consider citing it; otherwise, it can be disregarded. My expertise in this area is limited, so this is merely a suggestion based on a quick search.\nProofs and Theoretical Contributions:\n- Appendix C: The proof appears sound to me. I reviewed the concept of taking the expectation of a conditional random variable (e.g., http://www.baskent.edu.tr/~mudogan/eem611/ConditionalExpectation.pdf) and the conditions under which variance could be negative. Based on this, the authors seem to have demonstrated their point effectively. The variance cannot be negative or zero because the process is right-continuous and non-constant due to the impulse at \\( t(0) \\). I hope the supplemental material will be included in the proceedings.\n- Novel Transport Equation: The formulation of the transport equation appears both novel and useful. I could not find anything closely resembling it. The closest related work I identified is: \n Giovanni Luca Torris. \"Probability approximation of point processes with Papangelou conditional intensity.\" Bernoulli Journal (forthcoming). \n This is based on a web search and not my expertise, so it is offered as a potential reference rather than a challenge to the novelty of the contribution.\n- Mass Transport Equation: This idea is compelling. My understanding is that as the intensity process generates events, these contribute to the mass, which decreases over time in the absence of new events. The authors used numerical methods to approximate the integration of the probability mass function and solved their equation using MATLAB's `ode45`. The description aligns with MATLAB's documentation on `ode45`, which employs a 4th- and 5th-order Runge-Kutta method for higher accuracy.\n- Appendix A: While I grasp the general idea of the proof, I am not deeply familiar with numerical methods and cannot guarantee I followed every detail. The use of the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations seems appropriate, and the proof appears plausible.\nExperiments:\n- Figure 2: This figure was very helpful in providing an intuitive understanding of the equations. \n- Event Information: The section on event information was compelling in explaining the increased sample efficiency achieved by the framework. \n- Figure 3: Could the authors clarify whether they used a 70/30 train-test split or a 70/15/15 train-test-holdout split?\nWriting:\nThe paper is generally well-written, but I noticed the following typos: \n- Line 10: \"state-of-arts\" \"the state of the art\" \n- Line 36: \"adversely influence\" \"adversely influences\" \n- Line 64: \"the phenomena of interests\" \"the phenomena of interest\" \n- Line 75: \"is defines as\" \"is defined as\"\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper presents a promising and solid framework. Based on my understanding of the content, I recommend its inclusion at NIPS."
