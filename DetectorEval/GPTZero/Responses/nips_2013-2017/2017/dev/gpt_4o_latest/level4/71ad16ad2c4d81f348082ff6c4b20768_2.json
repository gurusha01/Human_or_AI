            "inputText": "Review - Summary of the Paper:\nThis paper presents a mechanism to enforce linear operator constraints within the framework of Gaussian process (GP) regression. To achieve this, the authors modify both the mean and covariance functions of the Gaussian processes. The purpose of this transformation is to ensure that samples drawn from the GP posterior distribution adhere to the specified constraints. These constraints are typically expressed in terms of partial derivatives, although in practice, any linear operator, such as integration, can also be accommodated. Traditional approaches address such constraints by introducing additional observations, but this has the drawback of being computationally expensive and limited to the specific observations provided. The proposed framework is evaluated on both a synthetic problem and a real-world problem, demonstrating advantages over the data augmentation approach.\nDetailed Comments:\nQuality:\nOverall, the quality of the paper is good. It is well-written, with all key concepts clearly explained. Additionally, the related work section is comprehensive and robust. However, the experimental section is a notable weakness, as it only includes evaluations on a synthetic dataset and a single real-world dataset.\nClarity:\nThe paper is highly clear and easy to follow.\nOriginality:\nTo the best of my knowledge, the paper appears to be original. While there are related methods in the literature, they primarily rely on augmenting the observed data with virtual instances to enforce the desired constraints.\nSignificance:\nThe problem tackled by the authors is both relevant and important for the machine learning community. However, the authors seem to have fallen short in emphasizing this significance. The examples provided are somewhat simplistic, as they only include one real-world example and focus solely on the linear operator of derivatives. I believe this work could have potential applications in probabilistic numerical methods, where GPs are frequently employed.\nIn conclusion, this is a solid paper, but its weak experimental section raises questions about its overall significance. Moreover, it is challenging to identify clear practical applications for this work within the broader machine learning community. The authors should have made a stronger effort to address these aspects. As a result, I would classify this paper as borderline."
