This new model factorizes the 3rd-order encoded candidate connectome tensor into a coefficient core tensor (Î¦), a factor dictionary (D), and a weight vector (w). \nThrough this compact multi-linear representation, the LiFE_sd model achieves a significant reduction in the size of the LiFE model while preserving approximation accuracy.\nStrengths: \n1. The paper leverages tensor decomposition techniques for a novel application in estimating the brain connectome, enhancing its scalability for large datasets, which holds considerable importance in neuroscience. \n2. Comparative analysis results, such as accuracy and size compression, are provided, demonstrating the advantages over the matrix-based model. \n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nWeaknesses: \n1. From a methodological perspective, the novelty of the paper appears somewhat limited. The ENCODE component has already been introduced in [10], and the primary contribution lies in the decomposition step, which merely factorizes Mv into the factor dictionary (D) and slices of Î¦v. \n2. Regarding the experiments, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of the optimized connectome with that of the original LiFE model.
