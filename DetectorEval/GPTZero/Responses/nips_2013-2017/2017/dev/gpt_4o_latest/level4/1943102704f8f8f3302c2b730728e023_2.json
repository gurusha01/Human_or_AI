This change is primarily due to the authors' assurance that they will include a performance breakdown in the paper if it is accepted. Additionally, I strongly recommend that the authors explicitly state that their method includes supervised stages, whereas some of the comparison methods (e.g., Kilosort) are entirely unsupervised. While I agree with the authors' response that leveraging prior information is beneficial when available, this is a critical methodological distinction that directly impacts the interpretation of the comparisons presented. It is essential to make this explicit to aid the community in accurately understanding the results.\n[ORIGINAL REVIEW]\nThe authors present a multistage spike sorting framework, aptly named YASS, which adheres to the traditional pipeline of spike detection, feature extraction, and clustering. The standout feature of this work is that YASS demonstrates superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. However, despite its strong performance, this work raises several concerns, as outlined below.\nMajor Concerns:\n1. YASS achieves its impressive performance by relying on hand-labeled data for the detection step, a requirement not shared by all the methods to which it is compared. This discrepancy makes the comparisons less direct, as they are not strictly apples-to-apples. Moreover, requiring experimenters to provide hand-labeled data imposes an additional burden that is not present in fully unsupervised methods.\n2. Several components of the YASS pipeline are adapted from prior work. While the paper does include novel elements (potentially sufficient for publication at NIPS), the authors do not provide a performance breakdown to demonstrate the necessity of these novel contributions for achieving the reported performance. For instance, it is possible that the observed performance gains are primarily due to the specific combination of pre-existing components rather than the newly developed ones.\nMinor Concerns:\n3. Based on my interpretation, the proposed method discards signals detected on multiple electrodes, retaining only the waveform with the largest amplitude (lines 138-140). This contrasts with methods like Kilosort, which handle overlapping signals differently. This design choice could be a disadvantage and raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison with Kilosort. For example, if the experimental data lack overlapping signals across channels, YASS would not be penalized for this design choice, and Kilosort's strengths in handling such signals would not be showcased. If my interpretation is incorrect, the authors should clarify this point. Regardless, the application setting with respect to overlapping signals across channels should be explicitly described.\n4. The writing style is somewhat opaque. I encourage the authors to improve the clarity of their presentation by distilling the critical mathematical and algorithmic details (whether in textual or equation form) and including them in the main paper. Currently, most of these essential details are relegated to the supplementary material, which places an undue burden on readers and reviewers."
