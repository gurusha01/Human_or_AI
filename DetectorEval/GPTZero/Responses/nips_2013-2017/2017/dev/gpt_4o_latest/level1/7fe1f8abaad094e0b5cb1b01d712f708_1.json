            "inputText": "This paper addresses the challenge of subgame solving in imperfect-information games, introducing novel techniques that outperform prior methods both theoretically and practically. The authors propose Reach subgame solving, which accounts for the dependencies between subgames by incorporating opponent strategies and potential outcomes from other parts of the game tree. They also extend subgame-solving methods to handle off-tree opponent actions through nested subgame solving, which outperforms the traditional action translation approach. These techniques were instrumental in the development of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top human players in heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em poker, a significant milestone in AI research.\nThe paper builds on prior work in subgame solving, such as Unsafe subgame solving and Resolving, by addressing their limitations. Unsafe subgame solving lacks theoretical guarantees, while Resolving, though safe, often misses opportunities for improvement. The Reach subgame-solving approach improves upon these by considering \"gifts\" (potential value differences) from alternative actions and ensuring exploitability is reduced across all subgames. The nested subgame-solving technique further advances the field by enabling real-time responses to off-tree actions, a critical capability for games with large or continuous action spaces. The authors also provide extensive experimental results, demonstrating the superior performance of their methods in poker variants and highlighting their practical utility.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is rigorous, providing theoretical guarantees for Reach subgame solving and demonstrating its safety and effectiveness in reducing exploitability.\n2. Practical Impact: The techniques have been successfully applied in a high-profile real-world setting (Libratus), showcasing their significance and applicability.\n3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors present detailed experiments comparing their methods to prior approaches, with clear metrics (e.g., exploitability in milli big blinds per hand) and robust results.\n4. Novelty: The introduction of Reach subgame solving and nested subgame solving represents a significant advancement over prior methods, addressing key limitations in the field.\n5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient background, making the contributions accessible to readers familiar with game theory and imperfect-information games.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Complexity of Implementation: While the techniques are theoretically sound, their practical implementation, especially in large-scale games, may be computationally intensive and require significant resources.\n2. Limited Generalization: Although the methods are demonstrated in poker, their applicability to other imperfect-information domains (e.g., cybersecurity or auctions) is not explicitly explored.\n3. Gift Splitting Heuristic: The paper mentions that the division of gifts among subgames is not always optimal, and the heuristic used may impact performance in certain cases. This could be further refined or analyzed.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper presents a clear and significant advancement in subgame-solving techniques for imperfect-information games.\n- The methods are rigorously evaluated and have demonstrated both theoretical and practical success, including a landmark achievement in AI research.\n- The work is highly relevant to the NeurIPS community, addressing core topics in game theory, reinforcement learning, and AI.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The computational demands of the proposed methods may limit their accessibility to researchers without significant resources.\n- The focus on poker, while impactful, may narrow the perceived scope of the contributions.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are both novel and impactful, advancing the state of the art in imperfect-information game solving and demonstrating real-world success. While there are some limitations, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality and importance of the work."
