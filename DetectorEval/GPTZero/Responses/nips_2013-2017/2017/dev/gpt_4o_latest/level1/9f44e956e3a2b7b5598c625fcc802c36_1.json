            "inputText": "The paper addresses the problem of active sequential hypothesis testing under limited knowledge of system parameters, proposing the Incomplete-Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) algorithm. Unlike prior work, which assumes full knowledge of the noise distributions governing actions, this paper considers a more constrained setting where only binary outcomes and lower bounds on action quality are known. The authors derive a theoretical lower bound on the sample size required for inference and show that IBAG matches this bound asymptotically. They also demonstrate through simulations that IBAG outperforms Chernoff's algorithm and Soft-Decision Generalized Binary Search (Soft-GBS) in various scenarios, particularly when action qualities differ or are imperfectly known.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a new setting for active hypothesis testing by relaxing the assumption of complete knowledge of noise distributions. This is a meaningful extension with potential real-world applications, such as crowdsourcing and medical diagnostics, where exact system parameters are often unavailable.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The derivation of a lower bound on sample size and the proof that IBAG matches this bound are significant theoretical contributions. The analysis is rigorous and well-supported.\n3. Algorithm Design: The IBAG algorithm is intuitive and balances exploration (querying generalists) and exploitation (querying specialists) effectively. Its robustness to incomplete knowledge of action quality is a notable strength.\n4. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments are comprehensive, covering various scenarios that highlight the algorithm's strengths. The comparison with Chernoff's algorithm and Soft-GBS is well-executed and demonstrates IBAG's superior performance in realistic settings.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the theoretical sections are detailed, they may be difficult to follow for non-experts. The notation is dense, and some key ideas (e.g., the IB update rule) could benefit from more intuitive explanations or examples.\n2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments focus primarily on synthetic data. While the scenarios are plausible, real-world datasets (e.g., crowdsourcing platforms or medical diagnostics) would strengthen the empirical validation.\n3. Assumptions on Principal Sets: The assumption that the principal sets of actions are known with certainty may limit the applicability of the method. The authors briefly mention this limitation in the discussion but do not explore its practical implications in depth.\n4. Comparison with Other Methods: While the comparison with Chernoff and Soft-GBS is thorough, additional benchmarks (e.g., reinforcement learning-based approaches) could provide a broader perspective on IBAG's performance.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a relevant and underexplored problem in active hypothesis testing.\n- The theoretical contributions are significant and advance the state of the art.\n- The IBAG algorithm is practical, robust, and outperforms existing methods in key scenarios.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The clarity of the presentation could be improved, particularly for non-specialist readers.\n- The reliance on synthetic data limits the generalizability of the results.\n- The assumption of known principal sets may reduce the method's applicability in real-world settings.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of active learning and hypothesis testing. While there are some limitations in clarity and empirical validation, the novelty, theoretical rigor, and practical relevance of the IBAG algorithm outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the limitations discussed."
