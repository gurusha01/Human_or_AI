            "inputText": "This paper introduces Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), a novel deep learning-based approach for functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI analysis. DHA addresses key challenges in existing Hyperalignment (HA) methods, including nonlinearity, high dimensionality, and scalability to large datasets. Unlike prior methods such as Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE), DHA employs a parametric deep kernel function, leveraging multi-layer neural networks for flexible nonlinear transformations. The proposed optimization framework uses rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), ensuring computational efficiency and eliminating the need for training data during new subject alignment. Experimental results demonstrate DHA's superior performance in classification tasks across multiple fMRI datasets compared to state-of-the-art HA methods.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Innovation: DHA introduces a deep learning-based kernel function that is flexible and adaptable across subjects, addressing the limitations of fixed kernel functions in methods like KHA.\n2. Scalability: The use of rank-m SVD and SGD ensures that DHA is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets with many subjects.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results across diverse datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in classification accuracy and runtime compared to baseline and state-of-the-art HA methods.\n4. Practical Utility: DHA's ability to align neural activities without referencing training data during testing is a notable advantage for real-world applications.\n5. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly positions DHA relative to prior work, such as RHA, KHA, and CAE, and highlights its unique contributions.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Complexity of Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, the dense mathematical formulations and extensive supplementary material may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with HA methods or deep learning.\n2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not sufficiently explore potential limitations of DHA, such as sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning or the interpretability of the learned deep representations.\n3. Comparative Baselines: Although the paper compares DHA to several HA methods, it would benefit from additional comparisons to non-HA approaches or alternative deep learning methods for fMRI analysis.\n4. Generality: While DHA is shown to perform well on fMRI datasets, its applicability to other neuroimaging modalities, such as EEG, is not explored.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses a significant problem in functional alignment and proposes a technically sound and innovative solution.\n- DHA demonstrates clear improvements over existing methods in both performance and runtime, advancing the state of the art.\n- The methodology is well-supported by theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The presentation could be more accessible, particularly for readers outside the immediate HA or fMRI analysis communities.\n- The discussion of limitations and broader applicability is limited, leaving open questions about DHA's robustness and generalizability.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of functional alignment and multi-subject fMRI analysis. While the presentation could be improved, the technical rigor and empirical results justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the identified weaknesses."
