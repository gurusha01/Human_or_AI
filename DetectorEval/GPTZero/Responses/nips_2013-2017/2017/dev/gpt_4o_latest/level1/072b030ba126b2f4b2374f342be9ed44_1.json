            "inputText": "The paper introduces PROXASAGA, an asynchronous parallel optimization algorithm designed for composite objective functions, which combines variance reduction techniques with support for nonsmooth objectives. Building on the SAGA algorithm, PROXASAGA addresses the limitations of existing asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, such as HOGWILD, which are restricted to smooth objectives. The authors propose a sparse proximal variant of SAGA and extend it to an asynchronous setting, demonstrating both theoretical and empirical improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The paper provides rigorous convergence guarantees, showing that PROXASAGA achieves linear speedup under certain sparsity and delay assumptions, and validates its performance through experiments on large-scale datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending variance-reduced incremental gradient methods to the asynchronous and nonsmooth setting. This fills a notable gap in the literature, as prior work has not simultaneously addressed these two challenges.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed convergence proofs and derive conditions under which PROXASAGA achieves linear speedup. The use of the \"perturbed iterate framework\" and the bounded overlap assumption is well-motivated and aligns with recent advances in asynchronous optimization.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating that PROXASAGA outperforms existing methods (e.g., ASYSPCD and FISTA) by orders of magnitude in runtime for large sparse problems. The speedup analysis with respect to the number of cores is thorough and highlights the practical scalability of the algorithm.\n4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the algorithm, theoretical analysis, and experimental setup. The inclusion of practical implementation details (e.g., memory compression) adds value for practitioners.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Assumptions on Sparsity: The algorithm's performance heavily relies on the sparsity of gradients and block-separability of the proximal term. While this is a reasonable assumption for many machine learning problems, it limits the generality of the approach. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not explore potential extensions to dense settings.\n2. Memory Overhead: The algorithm's reliance on maintaining historical gradients and block-wise reweighting introduces memory overhead, which may become a bottleneck for extremely high-dimensional problems.\n3. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper provides a detailed comparison with ASYSPCD and other methods, it would benefit from additional experiments on non-sparse datasets to better understand the limitations of PROXASAGA in less favorable scenarios.\n4. Practical Speedup: Although the theoretical speedup is linear, the observed runtime speedup is sublinear due to memory access overhead. This discrepancy could be explored further, perhaps by investigating hardware-specific optimizations.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in asynchronous optimization for nonsmooth objectives.\n- It provides a novel algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees and demonstrates significant empirical improvements over existing methods.\n- The work is likely to have a broad impact, as it extends variance-reduced methods to a wider class of problems and is applicable to large-scale machine learning tasks.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The reliance on sparsity assumptions limits the general applicability of the method.\n- The practical speedup is somewhat constrained by memory access overhead, which could reduce the algorithm's appeal in certain real-world scenarios.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a substantial contribution to the field of optimization and provides a strong foundation for future work on asynchronous methods for nonsmooth objectives. While there are some limitations, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and the proposed method is likely to inspire further research and practical applications."
