            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), addressing a critical bottleneck in large-scale electrophysiological data analysis. The proposed \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach introduces several innovations, including a neural network-based detection method, coreset-based data reduction, and efficient Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering. The pipeline is designed for robustness, scalability, and modularity, enabling efficient processing of large datasets with minimal manual intervention. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency on both synthetic and real MEA datasets, including a 512-electrode recording. Notably, the pipeline achieves faster-than-real-time processing on a single CPU core, outperforming existing methods like KiloSort, Spyking Circus, and MountainSort.\nStrengths\n1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis and extensive experimental validation. The use of biophysically realistic simulations and real datasets strengthens the reliability of the results.\n2. Scalability: The pipeline's ability to process large datasets efficiently, leveraging techniques like coreset construction and divide-and-conquer clustering, is a significant contribution to the field.\n3. Novelty: The combination of neural network-based detection, coreset-based clustering, and modular design represents a novel approach to spike sorting. The use of DP-GMM with split-merge methods for clustering is particularly innovative.\n4. Significance: The work addresses a pressing challenge in neuroscience, with potential applications in large-scale neural recording studies. The open-source availability of the pipeline (YASS) further enhances its impact.\nWeaknesses\n1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, particularly those describing the clustering and coreset construction methods, are dense and could benefit from additional clarity or illustrative examples.\n2. Generality: The reliance on prior training data for the neural network-based detection may limit the pipeline's applicability to labs without access to dense MEA training data. This limitation is acknowledged but could be explored further.\n3. Evaluation Scope: While the pipeline is compared to leading methods, the evaluation could include more diverse datasets, such as those with significant template drift or nonstationarity, to better assess robustness under real-world conditions.\nArguments for Acceptance\n- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of spike sorting, advancing the state-of-the-art in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.\n- The modular design and open-source implementation make the work highly accessible and impactful for the neuroscience community.\n- The technical rigor and thorough experimental validation ensure the reliability of the proposed methods.\nArguments Against Acceptance\n- The paper could improve clarity in certain sections, particularly for readers less familiar with the technical details of clustering and data reduction.\n- The reliance on prior training data for the neural network-based detection may limit the generalizability of the approach.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to scalability, robustness, and modularity in spike sorting are substantial, and the open-source release of YASS will likely have a significant impact on the field. Addressing the clarity and generality concerns in a revision would further strengthen the paper."
