            "inputText": "The paper presents novel subgame-solving techniques for imperfect-information games, addressing key challenges in strategy optimization and opponent modeling. The authors introduce methods that outperform prior approaches both theoretically and practically, with significant improvements in exploitability reduction and adaptability to off-tree opponent actions. These techniques were integral to the success of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top human players in heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em poker, a landmark achievement in the field.\nStrengths:\n1. Clear Contributions: The paper makes three primary claims: (1) the introduction of superior subgame-solving techniques, (2) the adaptation of these techniques to handle off-tree opponent actions, and (3) the demonstration of their effectiveness through the Libratus AI. These claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\n2. Technical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical foundation, including proofs of exploitability guarantees for their Reach-Maxmargin approach. The detailed mathematical framework ensures that the claims are technically sound.\n3. Practical Impact: The techniques are demonstrated in a real-world application, achieving a historic milestone in AI by defeating top human players in no-limit poker. This underscores the practical utility of the methods for large-scale, imperfect-information games.\n4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments cover a range of scenarios, including different levels of abstraction and nested subgame solving. The results consistently show that the proposed methods outperform prior techniques, including action translation.\n5. Novelty: The introduction of Reach subgame solving and nested subgame-solving techniques represents a significant advancement over existing methods. The paper also highlights the limitations of unsafe subgame solving and action translation, providing a clear motivation for the proposed approaches.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the paper is technically rigorous, it is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the domain. Simplifying the presentation of key concepts, such as Reach subgame solving and nested subgame solving, would improve accessibility.\n2. Limited Generalization Discussion: The paper focuses heavily on poker as the primary application. While the techniques are theoretically applicable to other imperfect-information games, the paper could benefit from a broader discussion of potential applications and limitations in other domains.\n3. Experimental Scope: Although the experiments are comprehensive within the poker domain, additional benchmarks in other imperfect-information games (e.g., negotiation or cybersecurity) would strengthen the generalizability of the results.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- The paper introduces significant theoretical and practical advancements in subgame solving.\n- It demonstrates real-world impact through Libratus, a groundbreaking AI achievement.\n- The methods are rigorously evaluated and outperform prior state-of-the-art techniques.\nCons:\n- The dense presentation may hinder understanding for a broader audience.\n- The experimental focus on poker limits the demonstrated generalizability of the techniques.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. It makes substantial contributions to the field of imperfect-information games, both in theory and practice. While the clarity and generalization could be improved, the significance of the results and the demonstrated impact of the techniques outweigh these concerns. This paper is a valuable addition to the conference and will likely inspire further research in subgame solving and related areas."
