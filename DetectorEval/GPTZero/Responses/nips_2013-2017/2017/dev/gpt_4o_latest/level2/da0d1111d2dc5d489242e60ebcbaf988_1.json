            "inputText": "This paper addresses the problem of Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, extending Zinkevich's foundational OCO framework by incorporating multiple stochastic functional constraints that are revealed only after decisions are made. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves \\(O(\\sqrt{T})\\) expected regret and constraint violations, and \\(O(\\sqrt{T} \\log(T))\\) high-probability bounds for both metrics. The paper also demonstrates the algorithm's efficacy through experiments on a real-world data center scheduling problem.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Scope: The paper makes a significant contribution by generalizing OCO to include stochastic constraints, which broadens its applicability to real-world problems such as resource allocation in stochastic environments. The proposed algorithm improves upon state-of-the-art results in several special cases, including OCO with long-term constraints and stochastic constrained convex optimization.\n \n2. Theoretical Guarantees: The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis, proving both expected and high-probability bounds for regret and constraint violations. The use of a novel drift lemma for stochastic processes is particularly noteworthy and could have broader implications for the field.\n3. Practical Relevance: The experimental evaluation on a data center scheduling problem demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm performs comparably to the best fixed decision in hindsight while outperforming baseline methods in balancing electricity cost and job servicing.\n4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly outlines its contributions, including the derivation of performance guarantees and the application to special cases like deterministic constrained convex optimization.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Experimental Scope: While the data center scheduling problem is a compelling application, the experimental evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse real-world scenarios to better demonstrate the algorithm's generality.\n2. Complexity of Presentation: The mathematical exposition, while thorough, is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the technical background. Simplifying some derivations or providing additional intuition could improve accessibility.\n3. Comparison with Baselines: The experimental section could benefit from a more detailed analysis of why the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines like \"react\" and \"low-power.\" For instance, a breakdown of the trade-offs between cost and constraint satisfaction would provide deeper insights.\n4. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as potential scalability issues or sensitivity to parameter tuning (e.g., \\(V\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)).\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of online optimization by addressing a challenging and practical problem with a well-founded theoretical approach. The proposed algorithm is novel, theoretically sound, and practically relevant. However, the paper could be improved by expanding the experimental evaluation, simplifying the presentation, and explicitly discussing limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these points.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper presents a novel algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees.\n- It addresses a practically relevant problem with significant implications for real-world applications.\n- The experimental results validate the algorithm's effectiveness.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The experimental evaluation is somewhat limited in scope.\n- The presentation could be made more accessible to a broader audience.\nIn summary, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and merits acceptance with minor improvements."
