            "inputText": "This paper introduces Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), a novel deep learning-based approach for functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI analysis. The authors claim that DHA addresses key challenges in existing Hyperalignment (HA) methods, including nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and scalability to large datasets. DHA employs a multi-layer neural network as a flexible kernel, alongside rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization. The authors demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art HA methods through extensive experiments on various fMRI datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty: DHA represents a significant innovation in the HA domain by introducing a deep learning-based kernel. Unlike previous methods, DHA is not constrained by fixed kernel functions, allowing for greater flexibility in modeling nonlinear relationships.\n2. Scalability: The use of rank-m SVD and SGD ensures that DHA is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets. This is a notable improvement over methods like Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and SearchLight (SL), which suffer from high time complexity.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results across multiple datasets, demonstrating DHA's superior performance in classification accuracy, runtime, and feature selection compared to existing methods such as SVDHA, SRM, and CAE.\n4. Practical Utility: By eliminating the need for training data during testing, DHA offers a practical advantage for real-world applications, such as brain tumor localization and multi-subject analysis.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the presentation of the DHA algorithm is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the optimization section. The inclusion of supplementary materials for proofs and technical details is helpful but may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the domain.\n2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: Although the authors briefly acknowledge that DHA solutions are not unique, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of other potential limitations, such as sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning or the impact of network architecture choices.\n3. Comparative Analysis: While DHA is compared against several HA methods, the paper does not include a detailed ablation study to isolate the contributions of individual components (e.g., rank-m SVD, multi-layer kernel). This would strengthen the claims about DHA's design choices.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- The paper addresses a critical gap in functional alignment methods by introducing a novel, scalable, and flexible approach.\n- Strong empirical results across diverse datasets validate the method's effectiveness and practical utility.\n- The proposed method has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in fMRI analysis and inspire further research in the field.\nCons:\n- The dense technical presentation may limit accessibility for a broader audience.\n- The lack of a detailed limitations section and ablation studies leaves some questions about the robustness and generalizability of the approach.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of functional alignment in fMRI analysis. While the paper could benefit from improved clarity and a more thorough discussion of limitations, its novelty, scalability, and empirical performance make it a strong candidate for inclusion in the conference."
