            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel multitask learning framework for Weighted Finite Automata (WFAs) by proposing the concept of vector-valued WFAs (vv-WFAs). The authors define a natural notion of relatedness between WFAs and demonstrate how multitask learning can be formalized using this model. A spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs is developed, which enforces the discovery of a shared representation space among tasks. The paper provides theoretical insights into the benefits of this multitask approach, supported by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Originality: The introduction of vv-WFAs is a significant contribution, offering a new perspective on multitask learning for sequence data. The work is the first to address multitask learning for WFAs, filling a gap in the literature.\n2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper is grounded in solid theoretical foundations, with proofs provided for key claims, such as the relationship between the rank of a vv-WFA and its Hankel tensor.\n3. Practical Relevance: The proposed method is shown to be effective in scenarios where data is scarce for individual tasks but abundant for related tasks, a common situation in real-world applications like natural language processing.\n4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed, demonstrating the benefits of multitask learning on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms single-task learning in terms of perplexity and word error rate, especially when tasks are closely related.\n5. Scalability: The computational complexity analysis shows that the method scales well with the number of tasks, making it practical for real-world applications.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections, particularly the theoretical analysis, are dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with spectral learning or tensor algebra. Simplifying or summarizing key results could improve accessibility.\n2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not thoroughly explore the limitations of the proposed approach, such as its dependence on the quality of the estimated Hankel tensors or its performance when tasks are only weakly related.\n3. Evaluation Scope: Although the experiments are compelling, the real-world evaluation is limited to a single dataset (UNIDEP). Testing on additional datasets from other domains (e.g., reinforcement learning or computational biology) would strengthen the paper's claims about generalizability.\n4. Comparison with Alternatives: The paper compares its method primarily with single-task spectral learning and a naive bagging baseline. A comparison with other multitask learning approaches, such as those based on neural networks or Bayesian methods, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper makes a strong contribution to multitask learning for WFAs and is theoretically and experimentally sound. However, the clarity of presentation and breadth of evaluation could be improved. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on enhancing clarity and expanding the experimental evaluation.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically grounded approach to multitask learning for WFAs.\n- The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over single-task learning in relevant scenarios.\n- The work has potential applications in diverse fields, including natural language processing and reinforcement learning.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The theoretical sections are dense and could benefit from clearer exposition.\n- The evaluation is limited to one real-world dataset, and comparisons with alternative multitask methods are missing.\nOverall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and merits inclusion in the conference proceedings."
