            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper:\nThis paper describes a mechanism to incorporate linear operator constraints in the framework of Gaussian process regression. For this, the mean function and the covariance function of the Gaussian processes are changed. The aim of this transformation is to guarantee that samples from the GP posterior distribution satisfy the constraints indicated. These constraints are typically in the form of partial derivatives, although any linear operator can be considered in practice, e.g., integration too. Traditional methods incorporated these constraints by introducing additional observations. This has the limitation that is more expensive and restricted to the observations made. The framework proposed is evaluated in a synthetic problem and in a real problem, showing benefits with respect to the data augmentation strategy.\nDetailed comments:\nQuality:\nI think the quality of the paper is good in general. It is a very well written paper. Furthermore, all the key points are carefully described. It also has a strong related work section. The weakest point is however, the section on experiments in which only a synthetic dataset and a real dataset is considered.\nClarity:\nThe clarity of the paper is high.\nOriginality:\nAs far as I know the paper seems original. There are some related methods in the literature. However, they simply augment the observed data with virtual instances that have the goal of guaranteeing the constraints imposed.\nSignificance:\nI think the problem addressed by the authors is relevant and important for the machine learning community. However, I have the feeling that the authors have not success in noting this. The examples used by the authors are a bit simple. For example they only consider a single real example and only the linear operator of derivatives. I have the feeling that this paper may have potential applications in probabilistic numeric methods, in which often a GP is used. \nSumming up, I think that this is a good paper. However, the weak experimental section questions its significance. Furthermore, I find difficult to find practical applications within the machine learning community. The authors should have made a bigger effort on showing this. I would consider it hence a borderline paper."
