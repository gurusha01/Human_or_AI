Second, they design an asynchronous variant of SAGA where the delay quantity can be up to sqrt(n)/10. Finally, they can deal with nonsmooth regularizers via proximal operators. In terms of convergence results, the still achieve a linear convergence rate under the strong convexity of the overall sum function f, and individual Lipschitz gradient of fi. Although the step-size is slightly smaller than the one of SAGA, the convergence factor remains comparable. This is probably due to different assumption. \nIn fact, the paper combines several advanced ideas from existing works such as SAGA with variance reduction, sparse updates, Hogwild, asynchorinization such as Arock, etc, to improve over all these techniques.
