            "inputText": "[UPDATE AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE]\nI have upgraded by assessment and confidence about this paper. The upgrade is due to the authors' commitment to including a performance breakdown in the paper, should it be accepted. I would also urge the author's to explicitly mention that their method has supervised stages, whereas some of the comparison methods (i.e., Kilosort) are unsupervised. I agree with the authors' response that if prior information is available, it should be utilized. However, since this is an important methodological detail relevant to the comparisons presented, it must be made explicit to facilitate the community's interpretation of the results.\n[ORIGINAL REVIEW]\nThe authors develop a multistage spike sorter, cutely coined YASS, which follows the classical pipeline of spike detection, feature extraction, and clustering. The most appealing aspect of this work is that the developed YASS system outperforms relative to several state-of-the-art methods. Despite this laudable performance, this work raises several concerns, as enumerated below.\nMajor Concerns: \n1. Yass' impressive performance comes at the cost of requiring hand-labeled data (for the detection step), which is not required for all methods to which Yass is compared. In this sense, the comparisons provided are not as apples-to-apples. Requiring the experimenter to provide such hand-labeled data represents an additional burden of effort which is not required by completely unsupervised methods.\n2. Many of the components in the Yass pipeline are derivative of previous work. While there are certainly novel components (possibly enough to merit publication at NIPS), the authors do not provide a performance breakdown to demonstrate that these novel contributions are required to achieve the stated levels of performance. For example, it might be the case that the overall performance is due to the particular selection of previously developed components, rather than due to the inclusion of newly developed ones.\nMinor concerns\n3. If my read was correct, the proposed method discards signals that appear on multiple electrodes, keeping only the waveform signal with the largest amplitude (lines 138-140). This is in contrast to the approach of Kilosort, for example. This seems disadvantageous, and raises another flag that the comparison may not be apples-to-apples against Kilosort. If the experimental data did not contain overlapping signals across channels, Yass' performance would not suffer due to this design choice, and Kilosort's performance would not shine in comparison since one of it's main features would not be in play. If my understanding is not correct here, this text should be clarified. Regardless, the authors should clarify the precise application setting with regard to overlapping signals across channels.\n4. The writing style is rather opaque. I would encourage the authors to clarify their presentation by boiling down the critical mathematical and algorithmic details (be they words or equations), and including them in the main paper. At present, almost none of these critical details are available without diving into supplements. This separation of the details presents quite a burden to the reader and the reviewer."
