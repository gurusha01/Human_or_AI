            "inputText": "The authors propose to use a low rank approximation of second order pooling features for action recognition. They show results on three compelling vision benchmarks for action recognition and show improvements over the baseline. \nPros:\n(+) The proposed method is simple and can be applied on top of any network architecture\n(+) Clear improvement over baseline \nCons:\n(-) Unclear novelty over well known second order pooling approaches\n(-) Fair comparison with other attention based models is missing\nIt is unclear to me how the proposed approach is novel compared to other low rank second order pooling methods, typically used for fine grained recognition (e.g. Lin et al, ICCV2015), semantic segmentation etc. While the authors do a decent job walking us through the linear algebra and interpreting the variables used, the final approach is merely a classifier on second order features.\nIn addition, the authors make design choices that are not clearly justified. For multi class recognition, the authors do not justify the choice for a class agnoistic b but for class-specific a. These experiments should be added in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed design. \nThe authors claim that they get rid of the box detection step present at other approaches such as RCNN or Mallya & Lazebnik. However, they do not discuss how their approach would generalize to instance-specific action recognition. An image can contain many people who perform different actions. In this case, the action labels are not assigned at the frame level, but at an instance level. RCNN was designed for instance-level recognition, thus the necessity of the person box detection step. The authors should discuss how the proposed approach can handle this more generic setup of instance-level labels? This is a limitation of the current approach, rather than a benefit as implied in the Related Work section.\nThe authors fail to provide a fair comparison with competing approaches. The authors use a ResNet101 or an Inception-V2 architecture for their base network. They show improvement over their own non-attentive baseline, using the same architecture. However, the competing approaches, such as R*CNN or Mallya & Lazebnik all use a VGG16 network. This makes comparison with these approaches and the current approach unfair and inconclusive on MPII and HICO dataset. On HMDB, the improvement over the TSN BN-inception method is small while comparisons with other methods is unclear due to the varying underlying base architectures."
