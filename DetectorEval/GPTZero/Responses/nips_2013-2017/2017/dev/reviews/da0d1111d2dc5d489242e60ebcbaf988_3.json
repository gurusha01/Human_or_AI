            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes an algorithm to address a mixed online/stochastic setting where the objective function is a sequence of arbitrary convex functions (with bounded subgradients) under stochastic convex constraints (also with bounded subgradients).\nA static regret analysis (both in expectation and high-probability) is carried out. A real-world experiment about the allocation of jobs across servers (so as to minimize electricity cost) illustrates the benefit of the proposed method.\nAssessment:\n+ Overall good & clear structure and presentation\n+ Technically sound and appears as novel\n+ Good regret guarantees\n- Confusing connection with \"Deterministic constrained convex optimization\"\n- Some confusion with respect to unreferenced previous work [A]\n- More details would be needed in the experimental section\nMore details can be found in the next paragraph.\nFurther comments\n-In Sec. 2.2, the rationale of the algorithm is described. In particular, x(t+1) is chosen to minimize the \"drift-plus-penalty\" expression. Could some intuition be given to explain how the importance of the drift and penalty are traded off (e.g., why is a simple sum, without a tuning weight, sufficient?). \n-Lemma 5: I do not really have the expertise to assess whether Lemma 5 corresponds to \"a new drift analysis lemma for stochastic process\". In particular, I am not sufficiently versed in the stochastic process literature.\n-Could some improvements be obtained by having \\alpha and V dependent on t?\n-For Lemma 9, it seems to me that the authors could reuse the results from Proposition 34 in [B]\n-Comparison with \"OCO with long term constraints\": It appears that [A] (not referenced) already provide O(sqrt(T)) and O(sqrt(T)) guarantees, using similar algorithmic technique. This related work should be discussed.\n-Comparison with \"Stochastic constrained convex optimization\": Is [16] the only relevant reference here?\n-Confusion comparison with \"Deterministic constrained convex optimization\": In the deterministic constrained setting, we would expected the optimization algorithm to output a feasible solution; why is it acceptable (and why does it make sense) to have a non-feasible solution here? (i.e., constraint violation in O(1/sqrt(T)))\n-Experiments:\n - More details about the baselines and the implementation (to make things reproducible, e.g., starting points) should appear in the core article\n - Is the set \\mathcal{X0} = [x1^min, x1^max] \\times ... \\times [x100^min, x_100^max]? If this is the case, it means that problem (2) has to be solved with box constraints. More details would be in order.\n - Log-scale for unserved jobs (Figure d) may be clearer\n - Bigger figures would improve the clarity as well\n - An assessment of the variability of the results is missing to decide on the significance of the conclusions (e.g., repetitions to display standard errors and means).\n - To gain some space for the experiments, Sec. 4 could be reduced and further relegated to the supplementary material.\n-Could the analysis extended to the dynamic regret setting?\nMinor\n-line 52: typo, min -> argmin. I may have missed them in the paper, but under which assumptions does the argmin of the problem reduce to the single x^*? \n-line 204 (a): isn't it an inequality instead of an equality?\n[A] Yu, H. & Neely, M.

I have gone through the other reviews and I maintain my score. I would like to emphasize though, that the authors should clarify the discussion about the stochastic/deterministic constrained convex opt. case (as answered in the rebuttal)."
