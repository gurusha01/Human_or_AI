            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to training neural networks by incorporating a compression-aware cost function, which encourages low-rank weight matrices through nuclear norm regularization. This is achieved via soft-thresholding of singular values after each training epoch. The authors argue that this approach allows for the creation of compact networks from scratch, avoiding the pitfalls of post-hoc compression methods that often lead to suboptimal results. The paper also explores combining this low-rank regularization with group sparsity to further reduce the number of parameters and computational costs. Experimental results on ImageNet, ICDAR, and ResNet-50 architectures demonstrate significant parameter reductions with minimal or no loss in accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a unique perspective by integrating compression into the training process, rather than treating it as a post-processing step. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of model compression.\n2. Technical Soundness: The use of nuclear norm regularization and proximal stochastic gradient descent is well-grounded in theory. The formulation is clear, and the authors provide detailed explanations of their methodology.\n3. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple datasets (ImageNet and ICDAR) and architectures (DecomposeMe and ResNet-50). The results demonstrate significant compression rates (up to 90%) with negligible accuracy loss, validating the method's efficacy.\n4. Practical Implications: The approach has clear benefits for deploying deep networks on resource-constrained devices, such as embedded systems, by reducing memory and computational requirements.\n5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility, including implementation specifics and hyperparameter settings.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lack of Comparisons: While the paper compares its approach to some existing methods (e.g., group sparsity and L1/L2 regularization), it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation against other state-of-the-art compression techniques targeting similar parameter counts. This omission limits the ability to contextualize the performance gains.\n2. Limited Scope of Architectures: The experiments focus primarily on convolutional networks and decomposed architectures. It would be beneficial to see how the method generalizes to other types of networks, such as transformers or recurrent networks.\n3. Inference Time Analysis: Although the paper discusses reductions in multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), the reported inference time improvements are modest. This discrepancy is attributed to hardware limitations, but further discussion on practical deployment scenarios (e.g., FPGA or ASIC hardware) would strengthen the argument.\n4. Energy Threshold Sensitivity: The choice of energy threshold (e.g., 80% or 90%) for post-processing is somewhat arbitrary and may require fine-tuning for different tasks. This could limit the method's out-of-the-box applicability.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of neural network compression by proposing a novel, theoretically sound, and experimentally validated approach. However, the lack of comprehensive comparisons with other compression methods and the limited scope of architectures tested leave room for improvement. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the comparative analysis and discuss broader applicability in the final version.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and practical approach to compression-aware training.\n- Experimental results demonstrate significant parameter reductions with minimal accuracy loss.\n- The method is theoretically sound and well-executed.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Insufficient comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art compression techniques.\n- Limited exploration of the method's generalizability to non-convolutional architectures.\nFinal Rating: 7/10 (Accept with Minor Revisions)"
