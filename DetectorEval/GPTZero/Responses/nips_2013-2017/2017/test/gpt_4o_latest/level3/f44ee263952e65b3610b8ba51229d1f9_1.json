            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel non-parametric method for enhancing language modeling by introducing an unbounded cache mechanism that leverages k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and kernel density estimation (KDE). This approach extends the capabilities of continuous cache models by scaling to larger contexts, storing all past hidden activations and corresponding words. The authors address the limitations of bounded cache models, such as pointer networks, by proposing a scalable memory component that adapts dynamically to data distribution changes without requiring retraining. The use of approximate nearest neighbor search and product quantization ensures computational feasibility, even with millions of stored representations.\nStrengths:\nThe paper is technically sound and well-written, with clear explanations of both the proposed method and its theoretical underpinnings. The unbounded cache model is a significant innovation, as it generalizes existing cache models to handle broader contexts and adapt to time and topic drift. The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating improved perplexity and adaptability in both near-domain and far-domain adaptation scenarios. The method's ability to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and rare tokens is particularly noteworthy, addressing a critical challenge in language modeling. Additionally, the scalability of the approach, achieved through efficient retrieval mechanisms like IVFPQ, is a strong point, making the method practical for large-scale applications. The potential applicability of the unbounded cache beyond language modeling, such as in other sequence modeling tasks, adds to its significance.\nWeaknesses:\nWhile the results are promising, the paper does not compare the proposed method against other parametric or local cache methods, such as pointer-generator networks, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Another concern is the computational cost of querying 1024 nearest neighbors during inference, which, while mitigated by approximate search techniques, may still be prohibitive in real-time applications. The authors could have explored trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by varying the number of nearest neighbors or further optimizing the retrieval process. Additionally, the paper lacks a deeper discussion of potential limitations, such as memory constraints or the impact of noisy data on the unbounded cache's performance.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n1. The unbounded cache model is a novel and impactful contribution to language modeling, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.\n2. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness in adapting to distributional changes and handling OOV words.\n3. The scalability of the approach is well-justified, with practical considerations for large-scale datasets.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n1. The lack of comparisons with other parametric or local cache methods limits the scope of the evaluation.\n2. Concerns about computational cost during inference remain partially unaddressed, particularly for real-time applications.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of language modeling and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing state-of-the-art methods. While there are some areas for improvement, particularly in comparative evaluation and computational efficiency, the strengths of the proposed approach outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the aforementioned concerns."
