            "inputText": "The paper investigates the convergence rate of the Min-Sum Splitting method for solving the average consensus problem in distributed optimization. While the authors establish that the algorithm achieves a marginal improvement in convergence rates, the contribution is limited in significance and clarity. Below, I provide a detailed evaluation based on the conference review criteria.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty of Approach: The paper connects Min-Sum Splitting with lifted Markov chains and multi-step first-order methods, which is a novel perspective. This dual interpretation could inspire further research in distributed optimization.\n2. Theoretical Analysis: The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework, including convergence proofs and the introduction of an auxiliary process to analyze the algorithm. This approach is methodologically sound.\n3. Potential Applications: The study of accelerated convergence in consensus problems is relevant to fields such as sensor networks, distributed machine learning, and multi-agent systems.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Marginal Contribution: The improvement in convergence rate, from \\(O(D^2 \\log(1/\\epsilon))\\) to \\(O(D \\log(D/\\epsilon))\\), is incremental and does not significantly advance the state of the art. In fact, the worst-case bound remains \\(O(n)\\), which is unimpressive compared to existing methods.\n2. Misleading Claims: The claim about achieving the \"optimal rate\" for complete graphs is misleading, as complete graphs converge in a single step and are not representative of general graph categories.\n3. Lack of Clarity: The paper does not clearly specify which general graph categories achieve dimension-independent complexity or what constitutes \"good\" graphs. This ambiguity undermines the practical applicability of the results.\n4. Missing References: The paper omits several critical references, including \"Linear Time Average Consensus on Fixed Graphs,\" works by Shi et al. on consensus optimization, and \"Markov Chain Lifting and Distributed ADMM.\" These omissions weaken the contextualization of the proposed method within the broader literature.\n5. Recycled Techniques: The auxiliary message-passing scheme appears to be a reapplication of Nesterov's acceleration, raising questions about the originality of the contribution.\n6. Trivial Proposition: Proposition 3 is trivial and adds little value to the overall contribution of the paper.\n7. Confusing Notation: The use of directed edges in a simple graph (line 243, page 6) is confusing and requires clarification. Additionally, there is a typo on line 220 of page 6 (\"Laplacian\" should be corrected to \"Lagrangian\").\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- Novel connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other acceleration techniques.\n- Rigorous theoretical analysis with potential for future generalizations.\nCons:\n- Marginal improvement in convergence rates.\n- Misleading claims and lack of clarity in key aspects.\n- Omission of critical references and related work.\n- Limited practical significance of the results.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting perspective on Min-Sum Splitting, its contributions are incremental, and the lack of clarity and missing references significantly detract from its quality. I recommend rejection unless the authors address these issues in a future revision. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of related work, clearer claims, and a stronger emphasis on practical significance."
