            "inputText": "The paper introduces an unbounded continuous cache model designed to extend the adaptability of recurrent neural network (RNN) language models to larger contexts, addressing limitations of prior cache models that only capture local contexts. By leveraging approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization techniques, the proposed model efficiently stores and retrieves millions of representations, enabling dynamic adaptation to changing data distributions. The authors claim significant improvements in perplexity over pre-trained language models and argue that their approach generalizes cache models to broader contexts. While the idea is compelling and builds on prior work by Grave et al., the execution and experimental validation leave room for improvement.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Potential Impact: The unbounded cache model represents a meaningful extension of existing continuous cache models by scaling to larger contexts. This could have significant implications for language modeling, particularly in open-vocabulary and domain adaptation scenarios.\n2. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a well-motivated combination of parametric and non-parametric approaches, supported by a detailed explanation of the unbounded cache mechanism and its integration with fast retrieval methods like IVFPQ.\n3. Relevance to the Field: The work addresses a critical challenge in language modeling\"\"adapting to dynamic distributions without retraining\"\"making it relevant to ongoing research in adaptive and non-parametric models.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lack of Strong Experimental Evidence: While the authors claim superiority over Grave et al.'s model, no direct comparisons are provided. Instead, the paper references older models like Kuhn et al., which limits the ability to assess the proposed model's relative performance against state-of-the-art methods.\n2. Unclear Experimental Section: The experimental setup lacks critical details, such as the vocabulary size and preprocessing steps (e.g., inconsistent lowercasing). These omissions make it difficult to reproduce the results or evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach.\n3. Inconsistent Results Reporting: The results are presented without sufficient clarity or standardization. For example, while the paper discusses improvements in perplexity, the lack of error bars or statistical significance testing undermines the reliability of the reported gains.\n4. Writing and Presentation Issues: Sections 1-3 are well-written and promising, but the experimental section is poorly organized and lacks coherence. Additionally, the paper contains grammatical errors, typos, and inconsistencies in table captions, which detract from its overall readability.\nRecommendations:\nTo improve the paper, the authors should:\n1. Include direct comparisons with Grave et al.'s model and other recent state-of-the-art approaches to substantiate claims of superiority.\n2. Provide a more detailed and standardized description of the experimental setup, including vocabulary size, preprocessing steps, and dataset splits.\n3. Address the inconsistencies in results reporting by including error bars, significance testing, and a clearer explanation of the evaluation metrics.\n4. Revise the manuscript to correct grammatical errors, typos, and inconsistencies, ensuring a polished and professional presentation.\nDecision:\nWhile the paper presents a novel and promising idea, the lack of strong experimental evidence and clarity in the experimental section significantly weakens its contribution. I recommend a major revision before the paper can be considered for publication. The authors should focus on improving the experimental validation and addressing the presentation issues to strengthen the paper's overall quality."
