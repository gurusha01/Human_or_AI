            "inputText": "The paper addresses the influence maximization problem in social networks under the general threshold model, extending prior work by considering cases where local influence functions are not strictly submodular but are instead ε-almost submodular. This is a significant departure from the traditional focus on submodular functions, which have been the cornerstone of most influence maximization algorithms. The authors provide theoretical insights into the hardness of approximation for influence maximization when a sublinear fraction of nodes exhibit ε-almost submodular behavior. They also propose algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for cases where the number of such nodes is constant, supported by empirical evaluations on real-world datasets.\nStrengths\n1. Novelty and Originality: The paper tackles the underexplored area of influence maximization in the nonsubmodular regime, specifically ε-almost submodular functions. This is a meaningful extension to the field, as real-world networks often exhibit non-submodular behaviors, as evidenced by empirical studies cited in the paper (e.g., LiveJournal and Flickr).\n \n2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors rigorously prove that influence maximization is hard to approximate when a sublinear fraction of nodes are ε-almost submodular, providing a strong theoretical foundation. They also present approximation algorithms with guarantees for cases where the number of such nodes is constant.\n3. Empirical Validation: The paper includes extensive experiments on real-world datasets (NetHEPT, Flixster, DBLP) to validate the proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform baseline algorithms, particularly in networks with a significant fraction of ε-almost submodular nodes.\n4. Clarity of Results: The distinction between theoretical hardness results and practical algorithmic solutions is well-articulated. The use of ε-almost submodular bounds to design approximation algorithms is a clever and effective approach.\nWeaknesses\n1. Limited Scope of Non-Submodularity: While the paper focuses on ε-almost submodular functions, it does not address more general forms of non-submodularity. This limits the applicability of the proposed methods to networks where influence functions deviate significantly from submodularity.\n2. Algorithm Scalability: Although the authors employ techniques like Reverse Reachable Sets (RRsets) to improve scalability, the naive greedy algorithm remains computationally expensive for larger datasets. The paper could benefit from further discussion on how to accelerate the proposed methods for arbitrary non-submodular functions.\n3. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is generally well-written, some technical sections, particularly the proofs and algorithmic details, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Additional examples or visual aids could enhance accessibility.\nRecommendation\nThe paper makes a solid scientific contribution by extending influence maximization to the nonsubmodular regime and providing both theoretical and empirical insights. Its focus on ε-almost submodular functions is novel and relevant, and the results are well-supported by rigorous analysis and experiments. Despite some limitations in scope and scalability, the paper represents a meaningful advancement in the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address clarity and presentation issues.\nMinor Comments\n1. Refer to authors by last names (Line 24).\n2. Fix the typo in \"LiveJournal\" (Line 29)."
