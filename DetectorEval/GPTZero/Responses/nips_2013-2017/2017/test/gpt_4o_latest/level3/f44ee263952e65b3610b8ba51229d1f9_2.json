            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel extension to recurrent neural network (RNN) language models by introducing an \"unbounded cache\" mechanism, which dynamically adapts to changes in data distribution. Unlike prior cache-based approaches that rely on local contexts, this method stores all previously seen words and their hidden activations, leveraging kernel density estimation and approximate k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search for scalability. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of parametric and non-parametric models, addressing challenges such as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and rare word prediction. The proposed method is both theoretically intriguing and practically relevant, particularly for NLP applications requiring rapid adaptation to new domains or distributions.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contribution: The unbounded cache model generalizes existing cache-based methods, offering a scalable solution for adapting language models to large datasets. The use of approximate kNN and quantization techniques is well-motivated and innovative.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity across diverse datasets, particularly in far-domain adaptation scenarios. The results highlight the model's ability to handle OOV words and rare word prediction effectively.\n3. Relevance: The work addresses a critical problem in NLP\"\"adapting pre-trained language models to dynamic and evolving data distributions\"\"making it highly relevant for both researchers and practitioners.\n4. Scalability: The integration of inverted file systems and product quantization ensures that the model can efficiently handle millions of examples, a notable improvement over prior local cache models.\n5. Clarity of Results: The paper provides detailed experimental results, including ablation studies on the number of nearest neighbors and cache size, which strengthen the claims.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Numerical Evaluation: While the paper includes extensive qualitative and comparative results, the final version lacks comprehensive numerical evaluations. This omission weakens the empirical rigor, though additional results were provided during the rebuttal process.\n2. Clarity and Language: The paper is generally well-written but would benefit from an English language review to improve readability and eliminate minor grammatical issues.\n3. Comparison to Related Work: Although the related work section is thorough, the paper could better position its contributions relative to recent advances in adaptive language modeling, particularly in the context of transformer-based models.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and scalable solution to a significant problem in NLP.\n- It demonstrates strong empirical performance, improving upon the state of the art in perplexity across multiple datasets.\n- The unbounded cache model is theoretically sound and has practical implications for real-world NLP applications.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The lack of detailed numerical evaluations in the final version is a notable shortcoming.\n- The paper's clarity could be improved with a thorough language review.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of NLP by addressing a critical challenge in adaptive language modeling. Despite minor weaknesses, the strengths of the proposed approach and its empirical validation outweigh the limitations. I recommend acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing the clarity and evaluation concerns in the final version."
