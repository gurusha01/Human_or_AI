            "inputText": "The paper addresses the problem of reconstructing true labels from noisy, non-adaptive query answers, framing it as a clustering problem with connections to locally encodable source coding. The authors propose a novel querying method using \"AND-queries\" and derive theoretical bounds for query complexity in both exact and approximate recovery settings. They demonstrate the superiority of AND-queries over traditional \"same cluster\" queries, particularly in approximate recovery scenarios, and validate their approach through theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world crowdsourced data.\nStrengths:\n1. Novel Perspective: The paper establishes a compelling equivalence between clustering with noisy queries and locally encodable source coding, a relatively unexplored area in information theory. This perspective is both original and insightful.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors derive new information-theoretic lower bounds for query complexity and demonstrate that AND-queries outperform \"same cluster\" queries in approximate recovery. These results are significant and advance the theoretical understanding of query-efficient clustering.\n3. Algorithm Design: The proposed Algorithm 1 is well-motivated and achieves near-optimal performance for approximate recovery, even in the presence of noise. The ability to work without prior distributions (using relative cluster sizes) enhances its practical applicability.\n4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on real crowdsourced data and synthetic datasets substantiate the theoretical claims. The observation that AND-queries result in fewer errors than \"same cluster\" queries is particularly noteworthy.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity of Presentation: The paper suffers from a lack of clarity in presenting its results, proofs, and comparisons to prior work. For instance, the proofs of Theorems 1, 3, and 4 are dense and difficult to follow, limiting accessibility to a broader audience.\n2. Discrepancy with Prior Work: Theorem 1's query complexity bounds differ from those in [Ahn-Lee-Suh], but the paper does not adequately clarify this discrepancy. This raises concerns about the validity or novelty of the results.\n3. Interpretability of Bounds: The lower bounds in Theorems 3 and 4 are hard to interpret, making it unclear how the proposed methods improve performance under relaxed constraints.\n4. Practical Limitations: Algorithm 1 assumes prior knowledge of parameters like cluster sizes and error probabilities, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios.\n5. Comparative Analysis: Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 lack comparisons to state-of-the-art methods, weakening claims about the superiority of AND-queries. Additionally, Figure 2 does not include results for \"same cluster\" queries, undermining the claim that AND-queries outperform them.\n6. Repetition Restriction: The restriction on repeating queries is not well-justified. Simulations or comparisons to models allowing repetitions would strengthen the argument.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper makes significant theoretical contributions and proposes a novel approach to query-efficient clustering, its presentation and experimental comparisons require substantial improvement. The authors should clarify discrepancies with prior work, improve the interpretability of theoretical results, and provide more comprehensive comparisons to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, addressing the practical limitations of Algorithm 1 and justifying the restriction on repeating queries would enhance the paper's impact. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a strong contribution to the field. \nPro Arguments:\n- Novel theoretical insights and bounds.\n- Demonstrated superiority of AND-queries in specific settings.\n- Practical relevance to crowdsourcing applications.\nCon Arguments:\n- Lack of clarity in proofs and results.\n- Insufficient comparisons to related work.\n- Practical limitations and unclear justification for key assumptions.\nOverall Rating: Weak Accept (conditional on revisions)."
