            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel model for predicting human eye movements in static and dynamic images, grounded in three principles: harmonic oscillator constraints, curiosity-driven attention to brightness changes, and brightness invariance. By formulating these principles within a variational framework inspired by the Least Action Principle in physics, the authors derive differential equations to model attentional scanpaths. The model is evaluated on datasets of human eye movements and demonstrates performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in saliency detection.\nStrengths:\n1. Originality: The paper introduces a unique approach to modeling visual attention by leveraging principles from physics, such as the Least Action Principle, and integrating them with cognitive science concepts. This is a refreshing departure from the more common machine learning-based saliency models.\n2. Unified Framework: The model unifies curiosity-driven exploration and brightness invariance into a single mathematical framework, providing a coherent explanation for both saccadic eye movements and object tracking.\n3. Experimental Validation: Results on multiple datasets (e.g., MIT1003, CAT2000, SFU) show that the model achieves competitive performance, particularly in saliency detection tasks, despite its simplicity.\n4. Potential Impact: The approach could inspire further interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computational vision, cognitive science, and physics, particularly in understanding the foundational principles of visual attention.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity: The paper is poorly written, with unclear equations and inconsistent use of abbreviations, making it difficult to follow. For example, the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations is overly dense and lacks sufficient explanation for readers unfamiliar with variational calculus.\n2. Contextualization: The work does not adequately connect to relevant psychological studies, such as those by Najemnik and Geisler on optimal eye movement strategies. This omission limits the broader cognitive science implications of the model.\n3. Limited Scope of Evaluation: While the model performs well on saliency detection, it is not the best on all metrics. Additionally, the evaluation focuses primarily on saliency maps, with limited exploration of temporal scanpath dynamics, which could provide deeper insights into human-like attention mechanisms.\n4. Parameter Tuning: The reliance on simulated annealing for parameter estimation raises concerns about the scalability and generalizability of the approach, especially for larger datasets or real-time applications.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Improve the clarity of the manuscript by revising the mathematical derivations and providing intuitive explanations for key equations. A more structured presentation of the model and its components would enhance readability.\n2. Include a discussion of related psychological literature to contextualize the model within the broader field of cognitive science.\n3. Extend the evaluation to include temporal scanpath comparisons with human data, as this would strengthen the claim that the model captures human-like attention mechanisms.\n4. Consider alternative methods for parameter optimization that are more computationally efficient and scalable.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper has significant strengths in originality and interdisciplinary potential, the poor clarity and limited contextualization hinder its accessibility and impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, contingent on addressing the clarity issues and providing stronger connections to existing literature."
