            "inputText": "The paper tackles the influence maximization problem under a non-submodular model, diverging from the traditional submodularity assumption that dominates the literature. This is a novel and challenging direction, as submodularity has been a cornerstone for designing efficient approximation algorithms in this domain. The authors introduce the concept of ε-almost submodular (ε-AS) threshold functions, where non-submodular functions are bounded closely by submodular ones. They establish strong hardness results for influence maximization in networks with ε-AS nodes and propose approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods compared to baseline algorithms.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Significance: The paper explores influence maximization in the non-submodular regime, a less-studied but practically relevant area. The ε-AS model is a meaningful abstraction, supported by empirical observations in real networks, such as LiveJournal and Flickr.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous hardness results and approximation guarantees for their algorithms. The use of ε-AS bounds and probabilistic mappings to derive approximation ratios is technically sound and innovative.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets (NetHEPT, Flixster, DBLP) are comprehensive. The proposed algorithms consistently outperform baselines like PageRank and High-degree heuristics, demonstrating practical utility.\n4. Scalability: The use of Reverse Reachable Set (RRset) techniques in TIM-U and TIM-L ensures scalability, making the algorithms applicable to large networks.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Justification of ε-AS Assumption: While the ε-AS model is conceptually motivated, the paper lacks sufficient data analysis to justify its prevalence in real-world networks. More empirical evidence or case studies would strengthen this assumption.\n2. Clarity of Proofs: The theoretical sections, particularly the hardness results and approximation proofs, are dense and difficult to follow. Intuitive explanations and concrete examples would greatly enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the technical details.\n3. Limited Scope: The focus on ε-AS functions, while a reasonable starting point, restricts the generality of the results. The paper does not address arbitrary non-submodular functions, which limits its applicability to broader scenarios.\n4. Experimental Setup: While the experiments are thorough, the choice of ε values and their impact on real-world networks could be better contextualized. Additionally, the performance of TIM-U and TIM-L compared to naive greedy algorithms is not fully explored for larger datasets.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper is a strong contribution to the field of influence maximization, addressing a novel and challenging problem with both theoretical and empirical rigor. However, the lack of justification for the ε-AS assumption and the clarity issues in the proofs are notable weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address these concerns in the final version.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- Novel problem formulation and significant theoretical contributions.\n- Strong empirical results demonstrating practical relevance.\n- Advances understanding of influence maximization beyond submodular models.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Insufficient justification for the ε-AS assumption.\n- Dense and inaccessible theoretical sections.\n- Limited generality beyond ε-AS functions.\nOverall, the paper is a valuable addition to the conference, advancing the state of the art in influence maximization under non-submodular models."
