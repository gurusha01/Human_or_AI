            "inputText": "This paper presents \"Adept,\" an adaptive stimulus selection method designed to optimize population-level neural responses, with a focus on mid-level visual processing in macaque V4. The authors leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict neural responses and quantify stimulus similarity, enabling the selection of stimuli that elicit diverse and high-magnitude responses across a population of neurons. This approach represents a significant departure from traditional methods that focus on single-neuron optimization, addressing the challenge of simultaneously optimizing responses for multiple neurons with distinct stimulus preferences.\nThe use of CNN feature embeddings to predict neural responses is innovative and aligns with recent advances in neuroscience and deep learning. The authors validate their method through both simulations and closed-loop electrophysiological experiments, demonstrating that Adept-selected stimuli evoke 20% larger mean responses and greater response diversity compared to randomly chosen stimuli. Furthermore, the paper highlights the robustness of Adept to neural noise and its ability to avoid overfitting, which are critical considerations for practical application.\nStrengths:\n1. Innovation: The use of CNNs to predict neural responses and guide adaptive stimulus selection is novel and well-motivated, leveraging recent breakthroughs in deep learning.\n2. Significance: The method addresses a critical gap in neuroscience by enabling efficient exploration of natural stimuli for population-level neural recordings, which has implications for understanding neural coding in higher cortical areas.\n3. Technical Rigor: The authors provide thorough experimental validation, including comparisons to single-neuron optimization methods, robustness analyses, and tests across different CNN layers.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility, including the mathematical formulation of the Adept algorithm and its implementation.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Paradox of CNN Usage: The reliance on CNNs to predict neural responses introduces a conceptual paradox. If CNNs can accurately predict neural response statistics, the need for experimental validation diminishes. Conversely, if CNN predictions are inaccurate, the experimental outcomes may be biased or suboptimal. This paradox is acknowledged but not fully resolved, leaving an important avenue for future work.\n2. Generative Stimuli: The method is limited to selecting from a pre-existing pool of stimuli. Incorporating generative models, such as GANs, to create novel stimuli could enhance the method's flexibility and applicability.\n3. Generalizability: While the method is tested on V4 neurons, its applicability to other brain areas or sensory modalities is not explored in depth, which could limit its broader impact.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of computational neuroscience and adaptive experimental design. The innovative use of CNNs and the focus on population-level responses represent a significant advancement. Despite the unresolved paradox and some limitations in scope, the method is well-validated and has the potential to inspire future research. I recommend this paper for acceptance at NIPS, as it aligns with the conference's focus on advancing machine learning and its applications in neuroscience.\nPro Arguments:\n- Novel and impactful approach to adaptive stimulus selection.\n- Strong experimental validation and robustness analyses.\n- Clear presentation and well-supported claims.\nCon Arguments:\n- Conceptual paradox in CNN usage remains unresolved.\n- Limited exploration of generative stimuli and generalizability.\nFinal Score: Accept"
