            "inputText": "The paper presents \"Adept,\" a novel adaptive stimulus selection algorithm designed to optimize population-level neuronal responses, advancing beyond traditional single-neuron approaches. By leveraging pre-computed feature embeddings from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Adept predicts neuronal firing rates for candidate stimuli, enabling efficient closed-loop experiments. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy through simulations and closed-loop electrophysiological experiments on macaque V4 neurons, showing that Adept elicits higher mean firing rates and greater response diversity compared to random stimulus selection. This work builds on prior adaptive stimulus selection methods but uniquely addresses the challenge of optimizing responses across a neuronal population.\nStrengths\n1. Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous simulations and experimental validation. The use of CNN-derived feature embeddings to predict neuronal responses is innovative and well-supported by empirical results. The authors carefully evaluate Adept's performance against baseline methods, demonstrating significant improvements in mean responses and response diversity.\n2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, objective functions, and experimental procedures. The inclusion of comparisons between Adept and alternative methods enhances reproducibility and transparency.\n3. Originality: Adept introduces a novel population-level objective function for adaptive stimulus selection, marking a significant departure from single-neuron optimization approaches. The integration of deep learning feature embeddings into the adaptive framework is a noteworthy contribution to the field.\n4. Significance: The results have broad implications for neuroscience, particularly for studying higher-order brain areas where preferred stimuli are less well-defined. Adept's ability to efficiently explore stimulus space could inspire further research into adaptive experimental design and population-level neural coding.\nWeaknesses\n1. Feature Dependence: A key limitation is the reliance on high-quality feature embeddings to describe the stimulus space. While CNNs perform well for V4 neurons, the generalizability to other brain areas or modalities with less predictive embeddings remains uncertain.\n2. Unexplored Scenarios: The algorithm's robustness to suboptimal feature sets or partial population prediction is not thoroughly investigated. This could impact its utility in real-world experiments where feature embeddings may be less accurate.\n3. Discrete Stimulus Space: Adept assumes a fixed, discrete pool of candidate stimuli, which may limit its applicability. The potential for extending the method to generate stimuli dynamically (e.g., via generative models) is acknowledged but not explored.\n4. Noise Sensitivity: The impact of correlated noise across neurons or time on Adept's performance is unclear. While simulations address some noise models, real-world neural variability may pose additional challenges.\nRecommendation\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it represents a significant advancement in adaptive stimulus selection methods and provides a solid foundation for future research. However, the authors should address the limitations of feature dependence and explore robustness to suboptimal embeddings in future work. Additionally, extending Adept to handle continuous stimulus spaces would further enhance its applicability.\nPro and Con Summary\nPros:\n- Novel population-level optimization approach.\n- Demonstrated efficacy in simulations and real experiments.\n- Clear, well-organized presentation with strong empirical support.\nCons:\n- Dependence on high-quality feature embeddings.\n- Limited exploration of robustness to noise and suboptimal conditions.\n- Restricted to discrete stimulus pools."
