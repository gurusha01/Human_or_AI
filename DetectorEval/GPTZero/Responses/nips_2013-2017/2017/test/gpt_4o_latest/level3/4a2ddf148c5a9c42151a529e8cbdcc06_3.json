            "inputText": "The paper under review provides a comprehensive analysis of the Partial Hard Thresholding (PHT) algorithm, focusing on its support recovery performance for sparse signals. This work extends prior research, which primarily addressed parameter estimation, by offering theoretical guarantees for support recovery. The authors demonstrate that PHT can recover the support of an arbitrary \\( s \\)-sparse signal within \\( O(s\\kappa \\log \\kappa) \\) iterations under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) or relaxed sparsity conditions. Furthermore, the paper claims to generalize and improve upon prior results for Hard Thresholding Pursuit (HTP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR).\nStrengths:\n1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending the analysis of PHT to support recovery, a more challenging metric than parameter estimation. The results are well-supported by mathematical proofs and align with empirical findings.\n2. Generality: The analysis encompasses a family of algorithms, including HTP and OMPR, and provides the best-known iteration complexity bounds for these methods.\n3. Practical Relevance: The work addresses a critical problem in sparse recovery, which has applications in machine learning, compressed sensing, and statistics. The inclusion of RIP-free conditions makes the results more applicable to real-world scenarios.\n4. Simulation Results: The numerical experiments complement the theoretical findings, demonstrating the scalability of PHT with respect to sparsity and the tradeoff between iteration count and success rate.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity and Differentiation: While the technical contribution appears sound, the paper lacks clarity in distinguishing its results from prior work, particularly [4]. The novelty of the iteration complexity bounds and the generality of the PHT operator need to be better articulated.\n2. Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from several presentation flaws:\n - The title is grammatically incorrect and should be revised for clarity.\n - The abstract ambiguously defines \\( \\kappa \\) as \"the condition number,\" which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.\n - Numerous typos and grammatical errors detract from the readability of the manuscript.\n3. Overlooked Aspects: The paper does not adequately address the practical implications of the \\( \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\)-scaling in the signal-to-noise ratio condition, which may limit applicability to ill-conditioned problems. Additionally, the discussion on the logarithmic factor \\( \\log \\kappa \\) in the iteration bound is left as an open question, which could have been explored further.\nRecommendation:\nWhile the paper presents a valuable theoretical contribution, its lack of clarity and presentation issues hinder its impact. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors address the following:\n1. Clearly differentiate their contributions from prior work, especially [4], and provide a more explicit discussion of the novelty.\n2. Revise the title, abstract, and manuscript to improve clarity and fix grammatical issues.\n3. Elaborate on the practical implications of the \\( \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\)-scaling and the \\( \\log \\kappa \\) factor.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- Significant theoretical contribution to support recovery analysis.\n- Generalization of results to a family of algorithms.\n- Strong empirical validation.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- Lack of clarity in distinguishing contributions from prior work.\n- Presentation issues that reduce readability.\n- Limited discussion of practical implications.\nIn summary, this paper has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the field, but revisions are necessary to enhance its clarity and accessibility."
