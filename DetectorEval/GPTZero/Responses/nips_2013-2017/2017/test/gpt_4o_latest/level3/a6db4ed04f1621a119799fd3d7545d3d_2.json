            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary: \nThis paper introduces a novel GRU-based architecture, Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU), for precipitation nowcasting, along with a new benchmarking package. The authors aim to address two key challenges in the domain: the location-invariance of convolutional recurrence structures in ConvLSTM and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for precipitation nowcasting. TrajGRU incorporates spatial transformer-inspired modules to learn location-variant recurrent connections, making it more flexible in modeling complex motion patterns such as rotation and scaling. The paper also introduces the HKO-7 dataset, a large-scale real-world dataset, along with balanced loss functions (B-MSE and B-MAE) to address the imbalanced nature of rainfall events. The proposed model is evaluated on both the HKO-7 dataset and a synthetic MovingMNIST++ dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to ConvGRU, optical flow-based methods, and other deep learning baselines.\nStrengths: \n1. Novelty: The use of spatial transformer-inspired modules for learning location-variant recurrent connections is a creative and promising extension of ConvGRU/ConvLSTM architectures. \n2. Significance: The introduction of the HKO-7 dataset, balanced loss functions, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol provides a valuable benchmark for the community. These contributions have the potential to standardize evaluations and advance the field. \n3. Technical Quality: The empirical results are thorough, with evaluations on multiple datasets, including MovingMNIST++ and HKO-7. The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of TrajGRU in capturing spatiotemporal correlations and handling imbalanced rainfall events. \n4. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear motivation and a detailed experimental setup. \nWeaknesses: \n1. Comparative Analysis: While the paper introduces TrajGRU as an improvement over ConvGRU, it lacks a direct comparison with LSTM or fully connected RNNs, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's advantages. \n2. Model Description: The explanation of TrajGRU, particularly the flow field generation and its connection topology, is somewhat unclear. A more explicit and intuitive description, possibly with additional visualizations, would improve readability. \n3. Novelty: While the trajectory learning mechanism is innovative, the overall architecture bears similarities to ConvLSTM/ConvGRU, which limits its novelty. \n4. Significance of Results: Although the trajectory learning idea is interesting, its broader applicability to other spatiotemporal tasks (e.g., video segmentation or object tracking) is not explored, leaving its generalizability uncertain. \nRebuttal Impact: \nThe authors' rebuttal effectively addressed some concerns, particularly by providing additional experiments and clarifications. The inclusion of results with online fine-tuning and balanced loss functions strengthens the case for TrajGRU's utility. However, the lack of comparisons with LSTM and fully connected RNNs remains a limitation.\nPros: \n- Innovative trajectory learning mechanism. \n- Strong empirical results on real-world and synthetic datasets. \n- Introduction of a valuable benchmark dataset and evaluation protocol. \nCons: \n- Limited novelty beyond trajectory learning. \n- Insufficient comparisons with alternative RNN architectures. \n- Unclear explanation of certain technical aspects. \nRecommendation: \nOverall, this paper makes meaningful contributions to precipitation nowcasting and spatiotemporal modeling. Despite some limitations in novelty and clarity, the introduction of TrajGRU and the HKO-7 benchmark are significant steps forward. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve the clarity of the model description and include comparisons with additional baselines."
