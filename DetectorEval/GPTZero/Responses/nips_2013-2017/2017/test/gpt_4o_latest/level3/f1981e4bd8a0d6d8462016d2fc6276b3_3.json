            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel method for learning sequence classifiers without labeled data by aligning predicted distributions with a prior distribution using KL divergence. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where labeled data is costly or unavailable, such as OCR and spell correction tasks. The authors introduce the Empirical-ODM cost function, which emphasizes a \"coverage-seeking\" property to avoid trivial solutions, and propose a Stochastic Primal-Dual Gradient (SPDG) algorithm to optimize this non-convex cost function effectively. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, achieving error rates approximately twice those of fully supervised learning, which is a notable achievement for unsupervised methods.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Technical Soundness: The proposed Empirical-ODM cost function and SPDG algorithm are innovative and address key limitations of prior works, such as mode-seeking behavior and reliance on strong generative models. The theoretical insights into the coverage-seeking property and the challenges of optimization are well-articulated.\n2. Experimental Validation: The method is evaluated on two real-world tasks (OCR and spell correction), demonstrating its effectiveness. The results highlight the robustness of the approach, even when using out-of-domain language models.\n3. Practical Implications: The paper addresses a critical problem in unsupervised learning with significant practical applications, such as speech recognition and machine translation, where labeled data is scarce or expensive.\n4. Clarity of Contributions: The authors clearly differentiate their work from prior methods, such as those in [7] and [30], and provide detailed comparisons to highlight the advantages of their approach.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Scalability: The method's scalability to large vocabularies and long sequences is a concern. The experiments are limited to small vocabularies and short N-grams, leaving open questions about its applicability to more complex tasks.\n2. Dependence on Prior Models: While the method leverages language models as priors, the practicality of obtaining high-quality priors in data-sparse domains is not thoroughly addressed.\n3. Sequence Structure in Classifier: The method predicts labels independently rather than incorporating sequence structure directly into the classifier, which may limit its performance on tasks with strong sequential dependencies.\n4. Clarity and Presentation: Some terms and concepts, such as the sign of cross-entropy and the explanation of dual variables, are not clearly explained, which may hinder reproducibility. Additionally, minor typos and repeated phrases detract from the overall clarity.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound method for unsupervised sequence classification.\n- It demonstrates strong empirical results, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning.\n- The approach has broad applicability and addresses a critical problem in machine learning.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The scalability of the method to larger vocabularies and longer sequences remains unproven.\n- The reliance on high-quality priors may limit its practical applicability in certain domains.\n- Some aspects of the methodology and presentation could be improved for clarity and completeness.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Address the scalability issue by discussing potential solutions or providing preliminary results on larger datasets.\n2. Explore the applicability of the method to non-NLP domains with sequential output structures.\n3. Clarify the rationale for not incorporating sequence structure into the classifier and discuss potential extensions.\n4. Revise the manuscript to improve clarity, fix typos, and ensure all terms are well-defined.\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to unsupervised learning and is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the concerns raised."
