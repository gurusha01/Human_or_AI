            "inputText": "The paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis of partial hard thresholding (PHT) for sparse signal recovery, focusing on support recovery performance under restricted isometry property (RIP) and alternative conditions like restricted strong convexity (RSC) and restricted smoothness (RSS). The authors establish iteration complexity bounds for PHT, demonstrating that it recovers the support of an arbitrary sparse signal within \\(O(s\\kappa \\log \\kappa)\\) iterations, where \\(\\kappa\\) is a condition number. The results generalize prior work on hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement (OMPR), offering the best-known iteration bounds for these algorithms. Simulations complement the theoretical findings, confirming the iteration complexity's dependence on sparsity.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper extends existing results on hard thresholding algorithms by analyzing PHT under both RIP and relaxed sparsity conditions. The generalization to arbitrary sparse signals and the unified analysis of a family of algorithms are noteworthy.\n2. Novelty: The work improves upon prior results, particularly by addressing limitations in iteration complexity bounds and providing RIP-free conditions. The focus on support recovery, a more challenging metric than parameter estimation, is significant.\n3. Clarity of Results: The iteration complexity bounds are explicit, with clear parameter dependencies, making the theoretical contributions accessible and interpretable.\n4. Simulation Validation: The simulations align well with the theoretical predictions, reinforcing the practical relevance of the results.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Unclear Prior Work: The description of related work is ambiguous. For instance, the generality of results in [4], the interpretation of Theorem 4 in [13], and the connection between RIP and the condition number in Theorem 2 are not adequately clarified. This weakens the context for the paper's contributions.\n2. Limited Simulations: Experiments are restricted to \\(s\\)-sparse signals, leaving open questions about the algorithm's performance for less idealized settings, such as signals with approximate sparsity or varying matrix condition numbers.\n3. Terminology and Presentation: Minor grammatical errors in the title and property names, as well as unclear terminology for \"condition number,\" detract from the paper's readability. The lack of termination conditions in the algorithm and insufficient comparisons to prior work further hinder clarity.\n4. Borderline Contribution: While the theoretical results are strong, the practical significance is less clear. The reliance on stringent conditions like the \\(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\)-scaling in the signal-to-noise ratio condition may limit applicability to ill-conditioned problems.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper provides a significant theoretical advancement in understanding hard thresholding algorithms, particularly for support recovery.\n- The results are general and improve upon prior work, making them a valuable contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery.\n- The simulations corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating practical relevance.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The unclear discussion of prior work and limited experimental scope leave gaps in understanding the broader impact and novelty of the contributions.\n- The practical applicability of the results is constrained by stringent assumptions, such as well-conditioned matrices and exact sparsity.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper is marginally above the threshold for acceptance. While the theoretical contributions are strong, the unclear exposition of prior work, limited experiments, and borderline practical significance warrant further revision. Enhancing the clarity of related work, expanding simulations to include approximate sparsity and varying condition numbers, and addressing the \\(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\)-scaling limitation would strengthen the paper significantly."
