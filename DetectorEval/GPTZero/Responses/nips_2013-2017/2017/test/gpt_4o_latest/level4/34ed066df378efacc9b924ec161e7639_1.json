Carreira, P. Agrawal, K. Fragkiadaki, and J. Malik. Human pose estimation with iterative error feedback. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016. \n[b] A. Newell, K. Yang, and J. Deng. Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016. \n- Line 110: \"we find that using residual blocks as basic component improves the generation performance.\" Could you clarify in what specific way the performance is improved? Please elaborate. \nAlthough the evaluation is generally thorough, I am curious about how the Stage 2 network would perform if it were directly provided with the inputs for Stage 1 and trained adversarially. Is the blurring observed in the Stage 1 + GAN results attributable to the intermediate fully connected layer? \nOverall Rating:\nGiven the novelty of the problem and the proposed approach, I confidently recommend the paper for acceptance. \nRebuttal:\nWhile I appreciate the authors' effort to conduct a user study, its preliminary nature makes it unconvincing, and I have chosen to discount it in my evaluation. The authors are strongly encouraged to include a more substantive human evaluation in their revision. Nevertheless, my positive assessment of the work remains unchanged."
