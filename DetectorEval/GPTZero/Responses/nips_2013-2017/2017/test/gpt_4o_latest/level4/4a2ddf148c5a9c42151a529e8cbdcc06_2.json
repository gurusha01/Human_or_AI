            "inputText": "Review prior to rebuttal:\nThe manuscript presents analytical findings on partial hard thresholding for sparse signal recovery, leveraging both the RIP framework and an alternative condition (RSC and RSS), which are applicable to arbitrary signals.\nThe exposition of prior work is occasionally unclear. First, [4] offers more general results than suggested in line 51 of this paper. Specifically, Remark 7 addresses arbitrary signals, while Theorems 5 and 6 pertain to all sufficiently sparse signals. Second, [13] establishes a guarantee for sparse signal recovery (Theorem 4), so the statement on line 59 regarding \"parameter estimation only\" is ambiguous. If exact recovery is achieved, it inherently ensures correct support estimation. Third, the classification of Theorem 2 as an RIP-based guarantee is unclear\"\"how does RIP relate to the condition number, especially given that RIP extends beyond specific matrix constructions?\nThe simulations are limited to s-sparse signals, leaving it uncertain whether the authors are evaluating aspects of their results that extend beyond existing work. Additionally, the dependence of the results on the condition number of the matrix is not explicitly tested.\nMinor comments:\n- Title: The phrase \"A Towards\" is grammatically incorrect.\n- Line 128: The property names are grammatically inconsistent; consider revising \"convex\" to \"convexity\" and \"smooth\" to \"smoothness,\" or append \"property\" to each term.\n- Line 136: Referring to M/m as \"the condition number of the problem\" may cause confusion, as this term is already established in linear algebra. Is there a connection between these two concepts?\n- Line 140: The algorithm lacks a termination condition. Does it terminate when the gradient in the first step becomes zero, or when the support St stabilizes across iterations?\n- Line 185: The manuscript contrasts the analysis in [4], described as \"confined to a special signal,\" with its own \"generalization\"Â¦ [to] a family of algorithms.\" The basis for this comparison is unclear.\n- Line 301: Replace \"degrade\" with \"degradation.\"\n- Line 304: Replace \"reduces\" with \"reduce.\"\nResponse to rebuttal:\nThe authors have addressed several of the concerns raised (notably those related to the discussion of prior work). However, the overall contribution remains \"borderline\" in terms of impact. Since the paper would be acceptable if the authors implement the changes outlined in the rebuttal, I have adjusted my score to \"marginally above threshold.\""
