This screening rule is demonstrated to be optimal for identifying non-interacting variables within an L1-regularized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework. By integrating this screening rule with approximate optimization techniques, the authors enable efficient parallel computation of the complete model structure, as shown through experiments on various synthetic graph problems.\nPROS: \nThe proposed screening rule can be computed relatively efficiently, with a time complexity quadratic in the number of data points, making it practical for real-world applications. The authors also rigorously establish the optimality of the method in the context of regularized MLE. Furthermore, the computation of the screening rule provides a range of valid regularization parameters, including those corresponding to a fully disconnected graph.\nCONS: \nThe authors fail to address the connection between their proposed screening rule and the closely related \"correlation decay\" property discussed in Loh and Wainwright (2013) and related works. While Loh and Wainwright are referenced, they are not explicitly cited in the main text. This omission is notable, as their work provides probabilistic guarantees for accurate reconstruction using the node-wise method, which is central to the present paper.\nThe experimental evaluation is insufficient, and too much material is relegated to the supplementary section. For instance, the authors claim to have conducted experiments on real-world data (L:228), but this is limited to a single gene interaction network where only the node-wise method is applied, and the results are entirely confined to the supplement (B.6). Additionally, the real-world experiment involves a small graph where the screening method achieves only a modest 20% speedup. This lack of comprehensive real-world experimentation is a missed opportunity to strengthen the paper.\nBeyond the real-world experiment, other experimental details are either deferred to the supplement or omitted altogether. For example, the discussion on model selection is minimal and refers to B.4, which itself provides only a brief explanation and cites Liu et al. (2010). Comparisons between approximate and exact inference are limited to a single experiment (also in the supplement), where exact computation takes just 90 seconds. Lastly, the inclusion of the \"mixed\" approach, which combines node-wise (NW) for model selection and pseudo-likelihood (PL) for estimation, is puzzling. This approach is both slower than PL and less accurate than NW, leaving its utility unclear."
