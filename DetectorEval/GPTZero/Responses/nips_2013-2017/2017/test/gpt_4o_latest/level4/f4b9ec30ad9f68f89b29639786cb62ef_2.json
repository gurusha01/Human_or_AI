With a batch size of 100 (on the larger end), 500 rounds correspond to 50,000 examples, which do not constitute a full pass through the training set. The experiment would be more complete if it included a second plot (or at least a remark) describing the behavior closer to convergence.\n4. In the \"multi-Krum\" experiment (Figure 6), setting the parameter m to n - f (the number of non-Byzantine machines) seems like an overly omniscient choice\"\"how would one know the number of adversaries f in practice? The experiment would be more comprehensive if it included results for other values of m (for the same f). Since the text suggests that m provides a trade-off, such a plot would effectively illustrate the trade-off curve."
