Additionally, the discussion of specific problem examples is limited to a brief and abstract treatment in the final paragraph of Section 2. For instance, if the nonzero entries of \\(\\bar{x}\\) follow a distribution without discontinuity at \\(x=0\\), then \\(x{\\text{min}}\\) should scale as \\(O(1/n)\\). Consequently, satisfying the \\(x{\\text{min}}\\) condition becomes increasingly difficult as \\(n\\) grows.\nCOMMENT AFTER REBUTTAL: In the above, I should have stated that \\(x_{\\text{min}}\\) should scale as \\(O(1/d)\\). I sincerely apologize for this oversight.\nClarity: \nThe description of the simulations is too brief to effectively connect the simulation setups with the theoretical results. Specifically, the paper should explicitly specify the function \\(F(x)\\) used in the simulations, as well as the condition numbers and other parameters referenced in the theoretical results. Additionally, it would be valuable to assess whether the 10,000 iterations are sufficient to meet the theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, since the nonzero entries of the signals are generated as Gaussian random variables, the \\(x_{\\text{min}}\\) values and the specified \\(s\\) values vary across trials. \nLastly, Lemma 4 and Theorem 5 in the main text are restated in the supplementary material as Lemma 19 and Theorem 20, but the paper does not explicitly clarify that they are identical.\nOriginality: \nThis work appears to be moderately original, as it extends existing analyses of support recovery via hard thresholding to the partial hard thresholding framework. This extension is non-trivial and represents a meaningful contribution.\nSignificance: \nThe partial hard thresholding algorithm generalizes both conventional hard thresholding and the orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement. Therefore, the theoretical guarantees for support recovery provided in this paper are significant and relevant to the broader research community.\nMinor Points: \n- Line 16: ha(ve â ' s) found \n- Line 56: in turn indicate(s) \n- Line 76: (Lowercase â ' A lowercase) letter(s) \n- Line 132: restricted (strongly) smooth \n- Line 196: The(n) the support \n- Line 287: i.i.d.
