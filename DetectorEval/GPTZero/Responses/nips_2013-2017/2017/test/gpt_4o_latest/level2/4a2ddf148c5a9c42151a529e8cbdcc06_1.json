            "inputText": "The paper presents a rigorous analysis of support recovery performance for a family of hard thresholding algorithms, leveraging the recently proposed Partial Hard Thresholding (PHT) operator. The authors claim that PHT achieves support recovery of an arbitrary \\( s \\)-sparse signal within \\( O(s\\kappa \\log \\kappa) \\) iterations under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) or relaxed sparsity conditions. The work generalizes existing results for Hard Thresholding Pursuit (HTP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR), providing the best-known iteration complexity bounds for these algorithms. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PHT.\nStrengths:\n1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a unified framework for analyzing hard thresholding algorithms, significantly extending prior work. The iteration complexity bound of \\( O(s\\kappa \\log \\kappa) \\) is well-justified and improves upon existing results in terms of generality and clarity.\n2. Novelty: The use of the PHT operator to analyze a family of algorithms is innovative and allows for a broader understanding of support recovery performance. The paper also establishes RIP-free conditions, which are particularly relevant for large-scale machine learning problems.\n3. Clarity of Analysis: The theoretical results are presented with detailed proofs, and the conditions under which the results hold are clearly stated. The authors also provide insightful comparisons with prior work, highlighting the improvements and generalizations achieved.\n4. Practical Relevance: The numerical experiments complement the theoretical findings, showing that the iteration complexity scales linearly with sparsity and confirming the robustness of PHT for different parameter settings. The discussion of trade-offs between iteration count and success rate is valuable for practitioners.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Assumptions and Limitations: The results rely on certain conditions, such as the RIP or a generalized signal-to-noise ratio condition, which may not always hold in practice. While the authors acknowledge this and provide some RIP-free results, the practical applicability of these conditions could be further explored.\n2. Empirical Validation: While the simulations are informative, they are limited in scope (e.g., fixed dimensions and specific noise models). Additional experiments on real-world datasets or larger-scale problems would strengthen the paper's claims.\n3. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense, and some sections, particularly the proofs, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. A more concise summary of key results and their implications would improve accessibility.\n4. Open Questions: The authors highlight several open questions, such as improving the \\( \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\) factor in the signal-to-noise ratio condition and extending the analysis to two-stage algorithms like CoSaMP. While these are promising directions, addressing even one of them would have further strengthened the paper.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the analysis of hard thresholding algorithms and provides valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in empirical validation and presentation, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the empirical evaluation.\nPros:\n- Rigorous theoretical analysis.\n- Novel use of the PHT operator.\n- Practical relevance demonstrated through simulations.\nCons:\n- Limited empirical validation.\n- Dense presentation of results.\nRating: 7/10 (Good paper, clear accept with minor revisions)."
