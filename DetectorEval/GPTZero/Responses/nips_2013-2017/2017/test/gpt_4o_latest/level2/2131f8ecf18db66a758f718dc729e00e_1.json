            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel theoretical framework connecting locally encodable source coding with semisupervised clustering, offering significant contributions to both information theory and clustering methodologies. The authors propose new querying strategies, particularly the use of AND queries, which outperform traditional \"same cluster\" queries in terms of query efficiency and error reduction. They also provide rigorous theoretical bounds for both exact and approximate recovery of labels under noiseless and noisy query settings. The work is further validated through experiments on real-world crowdsourcing datasets and synthetic data.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper introduces the concept of locally encodable source coding, which is relatively unexplored in information theory, and demonstrates its applicability to clustering problems. This is a significant conceptual leap, bridging two distinct domains.\n2. Query Efficiency: The introduction of AND queries is a key innovation. The authors show that AND queries achieve better performance than \"same cluster\" queries, both theoretically and empirically, particularly for approximate recovery.\n3. Robustness to Noise: The paper addresses noisy query settings, a practical consideration in crowdsourcing applications, and proposes an efficient algorithm (Algorithm 1) that achieves (1âˆ'Î´)-good recovery with O(n log(k/Î´)) queries.\n4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real crowdsourced datasets and synthetic data effectively validate the theoretical claims, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed methods.\n5. Clarity of Theoretical Results: The paper provides detailed proofs and bounds, such as the lower bounds on the number of queries and the performance guarantees of the proposed algorithms. These results are well-grounded in information theory.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper is dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with information theory or clustering to follow. Simplifying some of the mathematical derivations or providing more intuitive explanations would enhance accessibility.\n2. Experimental Scope: The experimental validation, though insightful, is limited in scale. The crowdsourcing dataset involves only 200 movies, and the synthetic dataset is relatively small. Larger-scale experiments would strengthen the empirical claims.\n3. Comparison with Existing Methods: While the paper highlights the limitations of \"same cluster\" queries, it does not extensively compare its methods with other state-of-the-art clustering techniques or crowdsourcing algorithms. This limits the broader contextualization of the proposed approach.\n4. Assumptions on Priors: The reliance on prior knowledge of cluster sizes or label distributions may limit the applicability of the methods in scenarios where such information is unavailable or difficult to estimate.\nArguments for Acceptance:\n- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing locally encodable source coding and connecting it to clustering.\n- The proposed AND queries and associated algorithms demonstrate clear advantages over traditional methods, both theoretically and empirically.\n- The work addresses practical challenges in crowdsourcing, such as noisy query responses, making it relevant to real-world applications.\nArguments Against Acceptance:\n- The paper's dense presentation and limited experimental scope may hinder its impact and accessibility to a broader audience.\n- The lack of extensive comparisons with existing clustering methods leaves some questions about the practical competitiveness of the proposed approach.\nRecommendation:\nOverall, the paper presents a strong theoretical foundation and promising practical results, making it a valuable contribution to the field. However, the authors should consider expanding the experimental scope and improving the clarity of presentation in a future revision. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."
