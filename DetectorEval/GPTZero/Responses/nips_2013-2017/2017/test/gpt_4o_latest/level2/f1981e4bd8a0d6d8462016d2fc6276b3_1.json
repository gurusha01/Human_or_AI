            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to learning sequence classifiers without labeled data by leveraging sequential output statistics, specifically through the proposed Empirical Output Distribution Match (Empirical-ODM) cost function and the Stochastic Primal-Dual Gradient (SPDG) optimization algorithm. The authors claim that their method avoids the pitfalls of trivial solutions, eliminates the need for strong generative models, and achieves significantly lower error rates compared to existing unsupervised methods. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on two real-world tasks: optical character recognition (OCR) and English spelling correction, achieving error rates approximately twice that of fully supervised learning.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Practical Value: The paper addresses a highly relevant problem in machine learning\"\"reducing reliance on labeled data. The proposed Empirical-ODM cost function introduces a coverage-seeking property, which is a significant improvement over prior mode-seeking methods.\n2. Technical Soundness: The SPDG algorithm is well-motivated and effectively addresses the challenges of optimizing the non-convex Empirical-ODM cost. Theoretical insights into the algorithm's ability to reduce optimization barriers are compelling.\n3. Experimental Results: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over baselines. The results show that the method achieves error rates close to supervised learning, which is a notable achievement for unsupervised methods.\n4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and experimental setup. The use of visualizations to illustrate the optimization landscape is particularly helpful.\n5. Broader Applicability: The method has potential applications in various domains, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and image captioning, making it broadly significant.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Scope: The current work is restricted to linear classifiers, which may limit its applicability to more complex tasks requiring nonlinear models like deep neural networks. While the authors acknowledge this and propose future work, it remains a limitation.\n2. Scalability Concerns: The computational cost of summing over all N-grams in high-order language models or large vocabularies is not fully addressed. The proposed solutions, such as parameterizing dual variables with RNNs, are left for future work.\n3. Comparison with Prior Work: While the paper compares its method to [7] and SGD, it does not include a broader range of baselines, such as recent advances in unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. This limits the contextualization of the results.\n4. Dependence on Language Models: The method relies heavily on the quality of the language model (LM) used. Although the experiments show robustness to out-of-domain LMs, the approach may not generalize well to domains without strong sequential priors.\nPro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:\nPros:\n- The paper introduces a novel and effective unsupervised learning framework with strong theoretical and empirical support.\n- It addresses a critical problem in machine learning with significant practical implications.\n- The results are compelling, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sequence classification.\nCons:\n- The scope is limited to linear classifiers, and scalability for large vocabularies remains unaddressed.\n- The experimental comparisons could be more comprehensive to situate the work within the broader field.\nRecommendation:\nI recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to unsupervised learning by addressing key challenges and demonstrating strong results. However, the authors should consider expanding the experimental comparisons and addressing scalability concerns in future work."
