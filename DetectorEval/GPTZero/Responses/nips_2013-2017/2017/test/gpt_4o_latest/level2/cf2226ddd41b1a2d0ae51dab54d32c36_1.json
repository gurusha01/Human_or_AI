            "inputText": "The paper addresses the influence maximization problem in social networks under the general threshold model, focusing on scenarios where some nodes exhibit non-submodular behavior. The authors introduce the concept of ε-almost submodular (ε-AS) threshold functions, which are closely bounded by submodular functions, and analyze the implications of this property on influence maximization. The paper makes three primary contributions: (1) a strong hardness result showing that influence maximization is inapproximable under certain conditions, (2) approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees for networks with ε-AS nodes, and (3) empirical validation of the proposed algorithms on real-world datasets.\nStrengths:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The study of influence maximization under non-submodular threshold functions is a significant departure from the dominant focus on submodular models. The introduction of ε-AS functions bridges the gap between theoretical submodularity and real-world observations of non-submodular behavior.\n2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous hardness results and approximation guarantees, demonstrating a deep understanding of the problem's complexity. The use of probabilistic-AND gate constructions and mapping between probability spaces is technically sound and innovative.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets (NetHEPT, Flixster, DBLP) are comprehensive and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed algorithms. The comparison with baseline methods highlights the effectiveness of the ε-AS-based approaches.\n4. Clarity of Definitions: The introduction of ε-AS functions and (γ, ε)-almost submodular graphs is well-motivated and clearly explained, making the theoretical framework accessible to readers.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited Scope of Non-Submodularity: The paper focuses on ε-AS functions, which are close to submodular. While this is a reasonable starting point, the applicability of the results to more general non-submodular functions is unclear. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide concrete directions for extending their methods.\n2. Algorithm Scalability: Although the proposed algorithms perform well in practice, the reliance on greedy schemes may limit their scalability for very large networks, especially when the submodular bounds do not align with the Triggering model. This issue is briefly mentioned but not thoroughly addressed.\n3. Experimental Diversity: The experiments are conducted on three datasets, but the results could benefit from additional diversity in network types (e.g., bipartite or hierarchical networks) to better generalize the findings.\n4. Clarity of Hardness Proofs: While the hardness results are significant, the proofs are only sketched in the main text, with details relegated to the appendix. This may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the techniques used.\nRecommendation:\nThe paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of influence maximization by addressing a less-explored but practically relevant problem. The theoretical insights and empirical results are compelling, though the scope is somewhat narrow. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors expand the discussion on extending their methods to more general non-submodular settings and address scalability concerns in greater detail.\nPros for Acceptance:\n- Novel and relevant problem formulation.\n- Strong theoretical and empirical contributions.\n- Clear and well-organized presentation.\nCons for Acceptance:\n- Limited focus on general non-submodular functions.\n- Scalability concerns for large networks.\nSuggested Improvements:\n1. Provide a more detailed discussion on how the methods could be extended to handle arbitrary non-submodular threshold functions.\n2. Explore ways to accelerate the greedy algorithms when submodular bounds do not align with the Triggering model.\n3. Include additional experiments on diverse network structures to strengthen the empirical evaluation.\nOverall, this paper advances the state of the art in influence maximization and has the potential to inspire further research in non-submodular diffusion models."
