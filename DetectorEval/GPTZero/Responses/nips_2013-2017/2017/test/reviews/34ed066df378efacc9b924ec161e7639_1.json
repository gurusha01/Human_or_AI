Carreira, P. Agrawal, K. Fragkiadaki, and J. Malik. H man pose estimation with iterative error feedback. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.\n[b] A. Newell, K. Yang, and J. Deng. Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.\n- line 110: \"we find that using residual blocks as basic component improves the generation performance\" In what way? Please elaborate.\nWhile the evaluation is generally extensive, I was left curious how using the Stage 2 network with the inputs for Stage 1 and trained adversarially would perform. Is the blurring observed with Stage 1 + GAN due to the intermediate fully connected layer?\nOverall rating:\nBased on the novelty of the problem and approach I am confidently recommending that the paper be accepted.\nRebuttal:\nWhile this reviewer appreciates the attempt at a user study, given its very preliminary nature, I do not find it convincing and thus am discount it in my review rating. The authors are urged to include a substantive human evaluation in their revision. Nonetheless, my positive review of the work still stands."
