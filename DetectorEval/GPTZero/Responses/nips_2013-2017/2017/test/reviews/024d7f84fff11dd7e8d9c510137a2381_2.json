            "inputText": "This paper studies the convergence rate of a so-called min-sum splitting method on the average consensus problem. In general he paper reads fine but the improvement of the result seems not impressive. Detailed comments are as follows.\n(1) It writes that ``This rate is optimal for graphs with good expansion properties, such as the complete graph. In this case the convergence time, i.e., the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed level of error accuracy in the… of the dimension of the problem, as…''. \nFor complete graphs, the linear rate is 0 because everyone converges to the average in 1 step. Also complete graphs are too special to be representative.\nSo for which general category of graphs the complexity does not depend on the dimension (number of nodes)? Which general category of graphs is considered as good?\n(2) In this paragraph (same as comment 1), the literature review should include ''Linear Time Average Consensus on Fixed Graphs and Implications for Decentralized Optimization and Multi-Agent Control'' by Olshevsky. Its convergence rate should be reported properly (more explanation will be given in comment 8). The reference mentioned here has reached a rather competitive or ever better bound compared the result of the submission. \n(3) At the top of page 2, for consensus optimization, important references like \n``On the Linear Convergence of the ADMM in Decentralized Consensus Optimization'' by Shi, Ling, Kun, Wu, and Yin,\n``Optimal algorithms for smooth and strongly convex distributed optimization in networks'' by Scaman, Bach, Bubeck, Lee, Massoulié\nshould be cited. Also the authors should report the state-of-the-art algorithms for consensus optimization and their corresponding (linear) convergence rates. \n(4) When discussing lifted graph and Markov chain, this paper ignored a very related paper ``Markov Chain Lifting and Distributed ADMM'' by Franca and Bento.\n(5) The content of the the last paragraph of page 5 is a long known fact. Should refer to ``Generalized consensus computation in networked systems with erasure links'' by Rabbat, Nowak, and Bucklew. In the sequel, the connection between those variants and Heavy ball/Nesterov/Polyak is known to the field.\n(6) There are many important references regarding consensus optimization the authors have ignored. For example, \n``Extra: An exact first-order algorithm for decentralized consensus optimization'' by Shi, Ling, Wu, and Yin.\n``Fast distributed gradient methods'' by Jakovetic, J Xavier, and Moura.\n(7) Proposition 3 seems to be trivial and is a supplementary contribution. \n(8) The rate has reached by this paper, D log(D/eps), does not seem to have a significant improvement on the rate D log(1/eps) that has been reached by Linear Time Average Consensus on Fixed Graphs and Implications for Decentralized Optimization and Multi-Agent Control (see comment 2). Especially in the worst case scenario (holds for all graphs), D~n, the bound is even worse than that has been achieved in ``Linear Time Average Consensus….''.\n(9) The paper``Linear Time Average Consensus…'' improves the bound through Nesterov's acceleration. The reviewer suspects that the so-called ``Auxiliary message-passing scheme'' proposed by the authors is again a Nestov's acceleration applied to min-sum algorithm. This is fine but the analysis is done for consensus which boils down to analyzing a linear system and is supposed to be not hard. The contribution of the paper becomes not clear given such situation.\n(10) The tiny improvement may come from a careful handle on the spectral gap of graphs. Eventually the worst case bound is still O(n) because O(n)=O(D) for the set of all graphs with n nodes.\n(11) Line 243 of page 6. The graph is simple but the author is using directed edges. This is confusing.\n(12) Typo at line 220 of page 6. Laplacian—> Lagrangian.\nAfter rebuttal:\nThe reviewer is satisfied with the authors' response. But the evaluation score from this reviewer stays the same."
