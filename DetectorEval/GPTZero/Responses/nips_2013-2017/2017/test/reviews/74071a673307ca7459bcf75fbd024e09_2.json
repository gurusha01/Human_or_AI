The authors also clearly show that the method is optimal in a regularized MLE sense, and computation of the screening rule also provides a range of valid regularization parameters including those that yield a fully disconnected graph.\nCONS:\n=====\nThe authors do not discuss the relationship between the proposed screening rule and the nearly identical \"correlation decay\" property considered in Loh and Wainwright (2013) and references therein. The work of Loh and Wainwright is referenced but not cited in the text. This oversight is curious since Loh and Wainwright provide a probabilistic bound of correct reconstruction using the nodewise method considered in the present paper. \nThis reviewer feels that the experimental results are lacking and too much material is referenced in the supplement. In particular, the authors claim experiments on real world data (L:228). However, the real world experiment is a single gene interaction network on which only the node-wise method is performed, and is entirely contained in the supplement (B.6). Moreover, the real world experiment is a small graph for which screening only yields a 20% speed improvement. This is an unfortunate omission as more detailed experimentation of real world data would have been beneficial.\nIn addition to the real world experiment, other experimental details are deferred to the supplement or not discussed at all. Discussion of model selection is omitted and references B.4, which in turn provides only a few sentences and references Liu et al. (2010). Approximations are only compared to exact inference in a single experiment (also in the supplement) for which exact computation is computed in 90s. Finally, inclusion of the \"mixed\" approach which uses NW for model selection and PL for estimation is both slower than PL and less accurate than NW, it is unclear why this approach would be considered."
