            "inputText": "This papers covers some theoretical limitations on variance-reduced stochastic algorithms\nfor finite sum problems (SAG, SDCA, SAGA, SVRG etc.). Such algorithms have had some important\nimpact in machine learning & convex optimization as they have been shown to reach a linear convergence\nfor strongly convex problems with lipschitz gradient (log term) while having a factor in $n + \\kappa$ (and not as $n\\kappa$).\nA first result of this paper is that the sequential iterative algorithm needs to know\nwhich individual function has been returned by the oracle to reach the linear convergence\nrate. Typically SAG or SAGA need this knowledge to update the gradient memory buffer\nso it is not terribly surprising that knowing the function index is necessary.\nIt is then argued that such variance-reduced methods cannot be used with data augmentation\nduring learning. This is only true if the data augmentation is stochastic and if there is\nnot a finite set of augmented samples.\nA second result concerns the possibility to accelerate in the \"Nesterov sense\" such\nvariance-reduced algorithm (go from $\\kappa$ to $\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$). It is shown that\n\"oblivious\" algorithms whose update rules are (on average) fixed for any iteration\ncannot be accelerated.\nA practical consequence of the first result in 3.2 is that knowing the value of the\nstrong convexity parameter is necessary to obtain an accelerated convergence\nwhen the algorithm is stationary.\nSuch oblivious algorithms are further analysed using\nrestarts which are well known techniques to alleviate the non-adaptive nature of\naccelerated algorithms in the presence of unknown local conditionning.\nThe paper is overhaul well written with some pedagogy.\nMinor:\nCLI is first defined in Def 2 but is used before.\nTypo: L224 First, let us we describe -> First, let us describe"
