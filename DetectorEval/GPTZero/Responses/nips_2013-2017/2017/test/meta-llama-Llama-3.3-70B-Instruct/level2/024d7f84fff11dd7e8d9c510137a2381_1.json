            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel application of the Min-Sum message-passing protocol to solve the consensus problem in distributed optimization. The authors introduce a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to converge to the problem solution with accelerated rates. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence behavior of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, including a proof of its convergence and a characterization of its asymptotic rate of convergence.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) Min-Sum Splitting converges to the consensus solution, (2) the introduction of splitting parameters is fundamental to guarantee convergence and can be tuned to achieve accelerated convergence rates, and (3) the acceleration mechanism of Min-Sum Splitting is analogous to that of lifted Markov chain techniques and multi-step first-order methods.\nThe support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The authors derive a linear message-passing update for the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and introduce an auxiliary process to track its evolution. They also provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, including lifted Markov chain techniques and multi-step first-order methods.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its analysis. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithms and their implementation.\nThe usefulness of the paper is high, as it provides a novel solution to the consensus problem in distributed optimization. The Min-Sum Splitting algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, including distributed machine learning and signal processing.\nThe field knowledge demonstrated by the authors is excellent, as they provide a thorough review of existing methods and a clear explanation of the underlying mathematical concepts. The authors also demonstrate a good understanding of the limitations of their approach and provide a clear discussion of the potential extensions and applications of their work.\nThe novelty of the paper is high, as it introduces a new algorithm and provides a thorough analysis of its convergence behavior. The authors also provide a novel connection between the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and existing methods, including lifted Markov chain techniques and multi-step first-order methods.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, as the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithms and their implementation. However, some of the proofs and derivations are omitted and provided in the supplementary material.\nThe limitations of the paper are clearly discussed by the authors, including the restriction to quadratic objective functions and the dependence on global information about the graph. The authors also provide a clear discussion of the potential extensions and applications of their work.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a novel solution to the consensus problem in distributed optimization and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper introduces a novel algorithm and provides a thorough analysis of its convergence behavior.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its analysis.\n* The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the limitations of the approach and provides a clear discussion of the potential extensions and applications.\n* The novelty of the paper is high, and the authors provide a novel connection between the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and existing methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* Some of the proofs and derivations are omitted and provided in the supplementary material.\n* The restriction to quadratic objective functions may limit the applicability of the algorithm.\n* The dependence on global information about the graph may be a limitation in some applications."
