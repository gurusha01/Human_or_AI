The authors provide a (2+)-approximation algorithm for the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem for k = 1, which runs in sublinear time.\n2. The authors provide a bicriteria algorithm for the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem for k > 1, which runs in polynomial time and achieves an O(k2 log(n/k))-approximation.\n3.
