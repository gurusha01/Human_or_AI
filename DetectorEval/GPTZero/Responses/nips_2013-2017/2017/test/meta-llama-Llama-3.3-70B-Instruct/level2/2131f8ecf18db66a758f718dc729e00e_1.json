            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of multiclass labeling of unlabeled elements using a semisupervised clustering model. The authors show that this problem is equivalent to locally encodable source coding, a concept from information theory. They provide new information theoretic lower bounds on the number of queries required to recover the correct labeling and propose a querying scheme based on AND operations that outperforms the traditional 'same cluster' queries.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed querying scheme. The experimental results on a real crowdsourced dataset validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The novel connection between semisupervised clustering and locally encodable source coding, which provides a new perspective on the problem.\n* The provision of new information theoretic lower bounds on the number of queries required to recover the correct labeling.\n* The proposal of a querying scheme based on AND operations that outperforms the traditional 'same cluster' queries.\n* The thorough analysis of the proposed querying scheme, including the provision of theoretical guarantees and experimental results.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption that the oracle provides binary answers, which may not always be the case in practice.\n* The limitation of the proposed querying scheme to pairwise queries, which may not be sufficient for more complex clustering problems.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of semisupervised clustering and provides a new perspective on the problem. The technical contributions are sound, and the experimental results validate the theoretical findings. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the limitations mentioned above and providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of semisupervised clustering.\n* The technical contributions are sound, and the experimental results validate the theoretical findings.\n* The paper provides a new perspective on the problem and has the potential to inspire further research in the field.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption that the oracle provides binary answers may not always be the case in practice.\n* The limitation of the proposed querying scheme to pairwise queries may not be sufficient for more complex clustering problems.\n* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms may limit the evaluation of the proposed approach."
