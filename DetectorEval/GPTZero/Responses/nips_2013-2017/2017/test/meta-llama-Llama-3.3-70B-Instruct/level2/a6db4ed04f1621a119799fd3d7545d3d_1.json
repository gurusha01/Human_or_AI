            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel model, Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU), and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting, a crucial task for predicting short-range rainfall intensity. The authors address two main limitations of existing approaches: the location-invariant convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models and the lack of clear evaluation protocols for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) TrajGRU outperforms existing models, including ConvGRU, Dynamic Filter Network (DFN), and 2D/3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), on both a synthetic MovingMNIST++ dataset and the proposed HKO-7 dataset; (2) the proposed benchmark, which includes a large-scale dataset, a new training loss (Balanced Mean Squared Error, B-MSE, and Balanced Mean Absolute Error, B-MAE), and a comprehensive evaluation protocol, provides a more accurate assessment of model performance; and (3) online learning can improve model performance in the online setting.\nThe support for these claims is strong, with extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The authors demonstrate that TrajGRU can learn location-variant connection structures, which is essential for capturing complex motion patterns like rotation and scaling. The proposed benchmark and evaluation protocol provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance, taking into account the highly imbalanced distribution of rainfall levels.\nThe usefulness of the proposed approach is evident, as precipitation nowcasting has significant impacts on daily life, flight safety, and citywide rainfall alerts. The ideas presented in the paper are practically useful, and the proposed benchmark and evaluation protocol can facilitate future research in this area.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with correct use of terms and evidence of understanding of relevant literature. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, including deep learning for precipitation nowcasting and video prediction, as well as structured recurrent connections for spatiotemporal modeling.\nThe novelty of the work is significant, as the authors propose a new model and benchmark that address the limitations of existing approaches. The references are comprehensive, accessible, and relevant, with proper citations.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The authors discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential for overfitting and the need for further evaluation on larger datasets.\nSome potential limitations of the paper include the reliance on a specific dataset (HKO-7) and the need for further evaluation on other datasets. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the computational efficiency of the proposed approach.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their ideas. The proposed approach has the potential to improve precipitation nowcasting, and the benchmark and evaluation protocol can facilitate future research in this area.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel model and benchmark that address the limitations of existing approaches.\n* The experimental evaluations are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* The paper reflects common knowledge in the field and provides a thorough review of related work.\n* The proposed approach has significant practical implications for precipitation nowcasting.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper relies on a specific dataset (HKO-7), and further evaluation on other datasets is needed.\n* The authors could provide more analysis on the computational efficiency of the proposed approach.\n* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential limitations and future directions of the proposed approach."
