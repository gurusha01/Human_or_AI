            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the conditions under which variance reduction and acceleration schemes can be efficiently applied to finite sum optimization problems. The authors identify three main claims: (1) knowing the identity of individual functions is crucial for obtaining linear convergence rates with linear dependence on n, (2) acceleration is not possible without an explicit knowledge of the strong convexity parameter, and (3) stationary algorithms for smooth and convex finite sums are sub-optimal.\nThe paper provides strong support for these claims through a series of theoretical analyses and proofs. The authors use a stochastic oracle setting to demonstrate that not knowing the identity of individual functions leads to a significant increase in the required number of oracle calls. They also introduce a framework for oblivious CLI algorithms and show that knowing the strong convexity parameter is essential for achieving accelerated rates.\nThe paper's strengths include its thorough analysis, clear presentation, and significant contributions to the field of optimization. The authors provide a detailed framework for understanding the limitations of variance reduction and acceleration schemes, which can inform the design of more efficient algorithms.\nHowever, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the results. While the authors provide some examples of algorithms that achieve the proposed lower bounds, it would be helpful to explore the consequences of these findings for real-world optimization problems.\nIn terms of novelty, the paper presents significant improvements over existing work. The authors extend the theory of oblivious finite sum algorithms and provide new insights into the importance of knowing the strong convexity parameter. The paper also introduces a restarting scheme that allows for the reduction of smooth and convex finite sums to strongly convex finite sums, enabling the derivation of tighter lower bounds.\nOverall, this paper is well-written, technically sound, and makes significant contributions to the field of optimization. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a comprehensive study on the conditions under which variance reduction and acceleration schemes can be efficiently applied to finite sum optimization problems.\n* The authors provide strong support for their claims through a series of theoretical analyses and proofs.\n* The paper makes significant contributions to the field of optimization, including the introduction of a framework for oblivious CLI algorithms and the derivation of tighter lower bounds.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the results.\n* Some readers may find the theoretical analyses and proofs to be dense and difficult to follow."
