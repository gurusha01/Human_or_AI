            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel Pose Guided Person Generation Network (PG2) that synthesizes person images in arbitrary poses based on a reference image and a target pose. The authors employ a two-stage approach, where the first stage generates a coarse image with the target pose, and the second stage refines the image to produce a sharper and more detailed result. The paper presents extensive experimental results on two person datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed PG2 network can generate high-quality person images with convincing details, (2) the two-stage approach is effective in capturing the global structure of a person and generating a refined image, and (3) the pose mask loss alleviates the influence of background on person image synthesis.\nThe support for these claims is provided through various experiments, including comparisons with alternative pose embedding methods, losses, and a one-stage model. The results show that the proposed PG2 network outperforms the baseline methods in terms of image quality and pose accuracy. The user study also demonstrates that the generated images are often indistinguishable from real images.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and the experimental results. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the differences between their approach and existing methods.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed PG2 network is novel and effective in generating high-quality person images with arbitrary poses.\n* The two-stage approach is well-designed, and the pose mask loss is a useful contribution to the field.\n* The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the failure cases, as shown in Figure 6.\n* The comparison with the most related work [36] is limited, and more comprehensive comparisons with other existing methods would be useful.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed PG2 network is a significant contribution to the field of person image synthesis. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the paper provides a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of the approach.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The proposed PG2 network is novel and effective in generating high-quality person images with arbitrary poses.\n* The two-stage approach is well-designed, and the pose mask loss is a useful contribution to the field.\n* The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the failure cases.\n* The comparison with other existing methods is limited, and more comprehensive comparisons would be useful.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide more detailed analysis of the failure cases and consider adding more comprehensive comparisons with other existing methods."
