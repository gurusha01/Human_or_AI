            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning approach for sequence classification tasks, leveraging sequential output statistics to train a classifier without labeled data. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed Empirical Output Distribution Match (Empirical-ODM) cost function, combined with a stochastic primal-dual gradient (SPDG) algorithm, can effectively learn a sequence classifier that achieves significantly lower errors than previous unsupervised learning methods.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, motivation, and related work. The proposed Empirical-ODM cost function is well-defined, and its properties, such as coverage-seeking, are thoroughly discussed. The SPDG algorithm is also well-explained, and its effectiveness in optimizing the Empirical-ODM cost function is demonstrated through experiments.\nThe experimental results are impressive, showing that the proposed method achieves error rates that are only about twice those of fully supervised learning on two real-world datasets. The comparison with previous methods, such as [7] and [30], demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.\nThe paper also provides a thorough analysis of the challenges in optimizing the Empirical-ODM cost function and how the SPDG algorithm addresses these challenges. The visualization of the cost function profiles provides valuable insights into the behavior of the proposed method.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant effort to provide a clear and concise presentation of their work. The related work is properly cited, and the authors have demonstrated a good understanding of the existing literature.\nHowever, there are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method, such as the restriction to linear classifiers and the potential challenges in scaling up to large vocabulary and high-order language models.\n* The experimental results could be further strengthened by providing more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and analyzing the performance of the proposed method on different datasets.\n* The paper could also benefit from a more detailed discussion on the potential applications of the proposed method beyond natural language processing tasks.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning, and the proposed Empirical-ODM cost function and SPDG algorithm have the potential to be widely applicable in various sequence classification tasks.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning.\n* The proposed Empirical-ODM cost function and SPDG algorithm are well-defined and effective in optimizing the cost function.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous approaches.\n* The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant effort to provide a clear and concise presentation of their work.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper is restricted to linear classifiers, which may limit its applicability to more complex models.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed method and its potential challenges in scaling up to large vocabulary and high-order language models.\n* The experimental results could be further strengthened by providing more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and analyzing the performance of the proposed method on different datasets."
