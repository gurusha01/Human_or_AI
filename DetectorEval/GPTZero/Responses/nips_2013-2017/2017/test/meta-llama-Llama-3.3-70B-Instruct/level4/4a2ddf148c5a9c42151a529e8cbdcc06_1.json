            "inputText": "This paper examines the support recovery of the partial hard thresholding algorithm and derives its iteration complexity under specific conditions. \nIn terms of quality, the paper lacks a clear explanation of the conditions under which the PHT(r) algorithm terminates, making Proposition 1 difficult to comprehend. The inclusion of concrete arguments and specific problem examples would have strengthened the paper. For instance, the brief discussion in the last paragraph of Section 2 could be expanded, particularly in cases where nonzeros in \\bar{x} follow a continuous distribution at x=0, leading to xmin scaling as O(1/d), which would make satisfying the xmin condition challenging for large n.\nFollowing the rebuttal, it is noted that the correct scaling for x_min should be O(1/d), correcting an earlier mistake.\nThe clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly in the description of simulations, which is too brief to establish a clear connection between simulation setups and theoretical results. Specifically, the function F(x) used in simulations, as well as condition numbers and other parameters from theoretical results, should be explicitly stated. It would also be beneficial to assess whether 10,000 iterations are sufficient in light of theoretical guarantees. Additionally, since nonzeros of signals are generated as Gaussians, x_min values and specified s values vary between trials. Furthermore, Lemma 4 and Theorem 5 in the main text are reproduced in the supplementary material as Lemma 19 and Theorem 20 without clear indication that they are identical.\nThe originality of this work is moderate, as it extends existing arguments on support recovery via hard thresholding to partial hard thresholding, a non-trivial extension.\nThe significance of this work lies in its provision of theoretical support-recovery guarantees for the partial hard thresholding algorithm, which encompasses conventional hard thresholding and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement as special cases, thereby contributing to the field.\nMinor points to consider include:\n- Line 16: \"have\" should be \"has\"\n- Line 56: \"indicate\" should be \"indicates\"\n- Line 76: \"lowercase\" should be \"A lowercase\"\n- Line 132: \"restricted\" could be clarified as \"strongly smooth\"\n- Line 196: \"The\" should be \"Then\"\n- Line 287: \"i.i.d.\" could be expanded to \"independent and identically distributed\" and \"normal\" clarified as \"standard normal\"\n- Line 304: \"reduce\" should be \"reduces\""
