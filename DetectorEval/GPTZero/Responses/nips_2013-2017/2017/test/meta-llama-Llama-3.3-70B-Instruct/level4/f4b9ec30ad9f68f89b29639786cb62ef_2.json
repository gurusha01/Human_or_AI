To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to explore fault-tolerance from this perspective, a concept already established in other contexts. However, I did not verify the analysis presented.\nRegarding the presentation, the paper provides an extensive background on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), including an illustration of unbiased stochastic gradients via a cartoon figure (Figure 1). While this background is nice, it might be unnecessary for an audience familiar with stochastic optimization at NIPS, and the authors may consider reallocating this space to more central technical content.\nMy additional comments pertain to the experimental section:\n1. The experiments could be improved by utilizing more contemporary datasets and models, as the current setup, focusing on small-scale, single-machine datasets, does not fully align with the paper's primary setting. Distributed learning is not typically applied to such datasets, making the experiments more of a simulation.

The choice of a mini-batch size of 3 for correct workers appears arbitrary and lacks explanation.\n3. In the \"cost of resilience\" experiment (Figure 5), reporting the error at round 500 seems to capture an early phase of training, given that the accuracies are not yet optimal for the task. With a batch size of 100, 500 rounds correspond to 50,000 examples, which do not constitute a full pass through the training set. The experiment would benefit from an additional plot or a remark describing the behavior closer to convergence.\n4. In the \"multi-Krum\" experiment (Figure 6), setting the parameter m to be n - f, where n is the total number of machines and f is the number of Byzantine machines, seems like an overly informed choice, as it assumes knowledge of the number of adversaries. The experiment would be more comprehensive if it included results for other values of m (for the same f), as this would illustrate the trade-off curve suggested by the writing."
