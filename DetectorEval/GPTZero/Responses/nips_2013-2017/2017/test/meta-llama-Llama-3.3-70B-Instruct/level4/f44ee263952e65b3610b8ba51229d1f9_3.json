Although the idea is intriguing, the paper lacks robust experimental evidence to support its claims. The main argument is that this model surpasses Grave et al.'s, yet a comparison with their work is not provided. Instead, it appears to compare with outdated cache models from the 1990s, specifically Kuhn et al., but this is only briefly mentioned in line 206, where \"the static model interpolated with the unigram probability distribution observed up to time t\" seems to refer to Kuhn et al.'s work, which is distinct from Grave et al.'s approach.\nThe authors emphasize the significance of large vocabularies but fail to specify the vocabulary size used in their experiments. Additionally, it is unclear why all datasets were lowercased, given the focus on large vocabularies. This oversight is unfortunate, as sections 1-3 show promise. To make this paper publishable, the authors should devote more attention to the experiments section.\nMinor comments include:\n* Line 5: \"stores\" should be \"store\"\n* Line 13: The phrase \"be\" is repeated\n* Line 30: \"speach\" should be \"speech\"\n* Line 31: \"THE model\" should be revised\n* Line 59: \"assumptions ABOUT\" should be rephrased\n* Line 72: A comma is missing after \"and\"\n* Line 79: \"algorithm\" should be \"algorithms\" and \"approach\" should be \"approaches\"\n* Line 97: \"non-parameteric\" should be \"non-parametric\"\n* Line 99: \"THE nineties\" should be revised\n* Line 110: \"aN update rule\" should be revised\n* Line 127: \"Khun\" should be \"Kuhn\"\n* Line 197: \"motivationS\" and \"adapt to A changing distribution\" should be revised\n* Line 211: \"time steps\" and \"adaptative\" should be \"adaptive\"\n* Table 2: The caption mentions training on news 2007, but this varies throughout the table\n* Line 216: \"interest\" should be \"interested\"\n* Line 235: \"millions\" should be \"million\"\n* Line 267: \"experimentS\" should be revised\n* Line 269: The percentages seem incorrect and lack explanation\n* Line 281: \"THE static model\" should be revised\n* Line 283: \"Set\" should be revised."
