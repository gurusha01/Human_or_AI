Furthermore, the authors provide a clear demonstration of the method's optimality in the context of regularized MLE, and the computation of the screening rule yields a range of valid regularization parameters, including those that result in a fully disconnected graph.\nCONS:\n=====\nOne notable omission is the lack of discussion regarding the relationship between the proposed screening rule and the closely related \"correlation decay\" property, as explored in the work of Loh and Wainwright (2013) and related references. Although the authors reference Loh and Wainwright, they fail to cite it in the text, which is surprising given that Loh and Wainwright provide a probabilistic bound on correct reconstruction using the nodewise method employed in the present paper.\nThis reviewer believes that the experimental results are insufficient and that an excessive amount of material is relegated to the supplement. Specifically, the authors claim to have performed experiments on real-world data (L:228), but the sole real-world experiment, which involves a single gene interaction network using only the node-wise method, is confined to the supplement (B.6). Moreover, the real-world experiment is limited to a small graph, where screening yields a modest 20% speed improvement. The lack of more comprehensive experimentation on real-world data is a significant oversight, as it would have been highly beneficial.\nAdditionally, various experimental details are either deferred to the supplement or not discussed at all. For instance, the discussion of model selection is omitted, and the reference to B.4 provides only a brief description, which in turn cites Liu et al. (2010). The comparison of approximations to exact inference is limited to a single experiment in the supplement, where exact computation is feasible in 90 seconds. Finally, the inclusion of the \"mixed\" approach, which combines the nodewise (NW) method for model selection and the parallel learning (PL) method for estimation, is perplexing, as it is both slower than PL and less accurate than NW, making its consideration unclear."
