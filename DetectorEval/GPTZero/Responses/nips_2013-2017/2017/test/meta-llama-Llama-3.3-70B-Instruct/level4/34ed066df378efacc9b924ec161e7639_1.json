Carreira, P. Agrawal, K. Fragkiadaki, and J. Malik. Human pose estimation with iterative error feedback. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.\n[b] A. Newell, K. Yang, and J. Deng. Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.\n* On line 110, the statement \"we find that using residual blocks as basic components improves the generation performance\" requires further clarification. Specifically, what aspects of the performance are enhanced?\n \nAlthough the evaluation is comprehensive, it would be interesting to investigate the performance of the Stage 2 network using the inputs for Stage 1 and trained adversarially. Is the observed blurring with Stage 1 + GAN attributable to the intermediate fully connected layer?\nOverall Rating:\nBased on the novelty of the problem and approach, I strongly recommend accepting this paper.\nRebuttal:\nWhile I appreciate the authors' attempt to conduct a user study, I find it preliminary and unconvincing. Therefore, I am discounting it in my review rating. The authors are encouraged to include a more substantive human evaluation in their revised manuscript. Nonetheless, my overall positive assessment of the work remains unchanged."
