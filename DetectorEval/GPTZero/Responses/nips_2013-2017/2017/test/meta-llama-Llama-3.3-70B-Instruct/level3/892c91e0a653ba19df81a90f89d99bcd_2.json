            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the `0-low rank approximation problem, a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing data positions with a low rank matrix. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work, including a (2+)-approximation in sublinear time for the case when k = 1, and a bicriteria algorithm that runs in poly(mn) time with an exponent independent of k.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its connections to other areas of research. The technical contributions are substantial, and the results have important implications for applications such as robust PCA, association rule mining, and document clustering.\nOne of the key strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem, including its motivation and connections to other areas of research. The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs and explanations of their results.\nThe paper also demonstrates a high level of technical sophistication, with the authors using a range of advanced techniques from approximation algorithms, linear algebra, and probability theory. The results are also supported by a range of experiments and simulations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all of the requirements. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its connections to other areas of research. The technical contributions are substantial, and the results have important implications for applications such as robust PCA, association rule mining, and document clustering.\nThe paper also meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The results are technically sound, and the authors provide detailed proofs and explanations of their results. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide clear introductions to the problem and its connections to other areas of research. The results are also original, and the authors demonstrate a high level of technical sophistication in their use of advanced techniques from approximation algorithms, linear algebra, and probability theory.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication at NIPS. The paper presents a comprehensive study on the `0-low rank approximation problem, and the authors provide substantial technical contributions that have important implications for applications such as robust PCA, association rule mining, and document clustering.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a comprehensive study on the `0-low rank approximation problem, including its motivation, connections to other areas of research, and technical contributions.\n* The authors provide substantial technical contributions, including a (2+)-approximation in sublinear time for the case when k = 1, and a bicriteria algorithm that runs in poly(mn) time with an exponent independent of k.\n* The paper demonstrates a high level of technical sophistication, with the authors using a range of advanced techniques from approximation algorithms, linear algebra, and probability theory.\n* The results have important implications for applications such as robust PCA, association rule mining, and document clustering.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* None.
