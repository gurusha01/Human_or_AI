            "inputText": "This paper proposes an innovative approach to the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation that minimizes the number of disagreeing data positions. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work. The paper is well-structured, and the authors clearly explain the problem, their approach, and the theoretical guarantees of their algorithms.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n1. Originality: The paper tackles a novel problem that has not been extensively studied before, and the authors provide new insights and approaches to solving it.\n2. Theoretical guarantees: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for their algorithms, including approximation factors and running times, which demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach.\n3. Improvement over previous work: The paper improves upon previous work in terms of running time and approximation factor, making it a significant contribution to the field.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n1. Lack of experimental evidence: While the paper provides theoretical guarantees, it lacks experimental evidence to support the claims. Adding experimental results would strengthen the paper and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the algorithms.\n2. Comparison to recent work: The paper compares its results to older cache models from the nineties, but it would be more relevant to compare it to the recently proposed model by Grave et al.\n3. Vocabulary size: The authors emphasize the importance of large vocabularies but fail to specify the vocabulary size used in their experiments. This information would be useful to understand the scalability of the approach.\n4. Minor errors: There are several minor errors in grammar, punctuation, and formatting that need to be corrected to improve the overall quality of the paper.\n5. Clarity of the experiments section: The experiments section is poorly executed and lacks clarity, which detracts from the promising ideas presented in the earlier sections of the paper.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the key criteria:\n1. Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis.\n2. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written, but there are areas for improvement, particularly in the experiments section.\n3. Originality: The paper proposes a novel approach to a previously understudied problem.\n4. Significance: The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field, particularly in applications where the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem is relevant.\nOverall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, it has the potential to be an excellent paper. \nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel approach to a previously understudied problem.\n* The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for their algorithms.\n* The paper improves upon previous work in terms of running time and approximation factor.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper lacks experimental evidence to support the claims.\n* The comparison to recent work is limited.\n* The vocabulary size used in the experiments is not specified.\n* The experiments section is poorly executed and lacks clarity."
