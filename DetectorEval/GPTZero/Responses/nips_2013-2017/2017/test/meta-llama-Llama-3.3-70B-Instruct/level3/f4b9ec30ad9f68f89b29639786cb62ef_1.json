The screening rule is simple and closed-form, making it easily applicable to large-scale problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening rule through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, showing that it can provide significant speedups when combined with various optimization algorithms.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution. The technical results are sound, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed screening rule.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a foolproof screening rule for exact blockwise structure identification. The authors show that the screening rule can be used to identify the blockwise structure of the solution with a given regularization parameter, and that it can be combined with various optimization algorithms to provide significant speedups.\nHowever, one potential weakness of the paper is that the screening rule is not foolproof when combined with inexact methods. The authors acknowledge this limitation and provide some theoretical justifications for the conditions under which the screening rule can be combined with inexact algorithms to recover block structures losslessly. Nevertheless, further theoretical justifications and experiments are needed to fully understand the limitations of the screening rule.\nAnother potential weakness of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the screening rule. While the authors mention that the screening rule can be computed in O(p^2) operations, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the overall algorithm.\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed screening rule is a significant contribution to the field of statistical learning. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution, and the technical results are sound. The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the paper provides a good discussion of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed screening rule.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel screening rule for `1-regularized Ising model estimation, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exact blockwise structure recovery.\n* The screening rule is simple and closed-form, making it easily applicable to large-scale problems.\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening rule through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.\n* The paper provides a good discussion of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed screening rule.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The screening rule is not foolproof when combined with inexact methods.\n* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the screening rule.\n* Further theoretical justifications and experiments are needed to fully understand the limitations of the screening rule.\nQuality: 8/10\nClarity: 9/10\nOriginality: 8/10\nSignificance: 8/10\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of statistical learning, and the proposed screening rule has the potential to be widely applicable to large-scale problems. However, the authors should address the limitations of the screening rule and provide further theoretical justifications and experiments to fully understand its limitations."
