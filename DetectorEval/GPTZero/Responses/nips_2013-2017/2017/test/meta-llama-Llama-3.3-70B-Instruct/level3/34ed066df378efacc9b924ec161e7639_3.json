            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to increasing the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, called the Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM). The tLSTM represents hidden states as higher-dimensional tensors, allowing for more flexible parameter sharing and efficient widening of the network without additional parameters. The model also merges deep computations into temporal computations, enabling the network to be deepened with little additional runtime.\nThe paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on several challenging sequence learning tasks, including language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and image classification. The results show that the tLSTM outperforms other popular approaches, such as stacked LSTMs and convolutional LSTMs, in terms of performance and runtime efficiency.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a novel solution to the problem of increasing the capacity of LSTMs. The use of tensors to represent hidden states and the merging of deep computations into temporal computations are innovative ideas that have the potential to improve the performance of LSTMs on a wide range of tasks.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One of the main concerns is the lack of quantitative evaluation and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. While the authors provide some comparisons with other approaches, the evaluation is mostly qualitative, and it is difficult to assess the significance of the results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis and visualization of the internal workings of the tLSTM, which would help to better understand its strengths and limitations.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly explained. The authors provide a good overview of the related work and demonstrate the significance of the proposed approach. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed evaluation and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to increasing the capacity of LSTMs.\n* The tLSTM shows promising results on several challenging sequence learning tasks.\n* The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly explained.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The lack of quantitative evaluation and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results.\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis and visualization of the internal workings of the tLSTM.\n* The evaluation is mostly qualitative, and more rigorous evaluation is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM.\nOverall, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of sequence learning, but it requires more rigorous evaluation and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. With some revisions to address these concerns, the paper could be a strong candidate for acceptance."
