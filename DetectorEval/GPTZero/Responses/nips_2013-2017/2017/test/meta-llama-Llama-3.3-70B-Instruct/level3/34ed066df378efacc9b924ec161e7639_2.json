The generator utilizes a stacked architecture, predicting a difference map to refine the coarse image, and leverages the DeepFashion dataset for evaluation. The paper introduces the concept of conditioning on appearance and pose maps for human image generation and proposes a novel technique of stacked architecture and loss design.\nThe strengths of the paper include its technical novelty, as it presents a unique approach to human image generation. The use of a stacked architecture and the introduction of a difference map to refine the coarse image are innovative and demonstrate a good understanding of the challenges in human image generation. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors effectively utilize the generation strategy to produce high-resolution images.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The image quality of the generated results is not satisfactory, with visible artifacts that require further refinement. Additionally, the significance of the paper may be limited, as it can be seen as another GAN architecture, and its application domain is specific to vision and graphics. The paper may not appeal to a large audience due to its application-specific challenges.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.\nThe originality of the paper is also a strength, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques. The use of a stacked architecture and the introduction of a difference map are new and demonstrate a good understanding of the challenges in human image generation. The paper is significantly different from previous contributions, and the authors provide adequate references to related work.\nThe significance of the paper is somewhat limited, as it is specific to vision and graphics. However, the results are important, and the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper provides unique data, conclusions, and a theoretical or pragmatic approach, which advances the state of the art in human image generation.\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a novel approach to human image generation, with technical novelty and a well-organized structure. However, the image quality needs improvement, and the significance of the paper may be limited. The paper is suitable for publication, but the authors should address the weaknesses and improve the image quality to make the results more visually consistent and appealing.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to human image generation.\n* The use of a stacked architecture and the introduction of a difference map are innovative.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the authors effectively utilize the generation strategy.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The image quality of the generated results is not satisfactory.\n* The significance of the paper may be limited, as it is specific to vision and graphics.\n* The paper may not appeal to a large audience due to its application-specific challenges."
