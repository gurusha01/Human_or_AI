The authors introduce a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to achieve accelerated convergence rates for the consensus problem. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior, including a proof of convergence and a characterization of the convergence rate.\nThe paper's main strengths lie in its technical soundness and clarity. The authors provide a detailed and well-organized presentation of the algorithm and its analysis, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of auxiliary algorithms and spectral analysis techniques is particularly noteworthy, as it allows for a deeper understanding of the algorithm's behavior and its connection to other accelerated methods.\nThe paper also demonstrates a good understanding of the related work in the field, including lifted Markov chains techniques and multi-step first-order methods. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the existing literature, highlighting the connections and differences between their approach and other methods.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, with limited discussion of its practical implications and potential applications. While the authors do provide some examples and numerical results, a more detailed exploration of the algorithm's performance in real-world scenarios would be beneficial.\nIn terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques from distributed optimization and spectral analysis. The introduction of splitting parameters and their tuning to achieve accelerated convergence rates is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides new insights into the connection between Min-Sum algorithms and other accelerated methods, which is an important area of research.\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of distributed optimization and consensus problems. The authors' results demonstrate that Min-Sum Splitting can achieve accelerated convergence rates, which is an important improvement over existing methods. The paper's findings also have implications for other areas of research, such as machine learning and signal processing, where distributed optimization and consensus problems are common.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and their work has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. With some minor revisions to address the practical implications and potential applications of the algorithm, the paper would be even stronger.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and consensus problems.\n* The authors provide a thorough and well-organized analysis of the algorithm's behavior.\n* The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the related work in the field.\n* The introduction of splitting parameters and their tuning to achieve accelerated convergence rates is a novel and significant contribution.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper focuses primarily on theoretical analysis, with limited discussion of practical implications and potential applications.\n* The authors could provide more numerical results and examples to illustrate the algorithm's performance in real-world scenarios.\n* Some minor revisions are needed to improve the clarity and readability of the paper."
