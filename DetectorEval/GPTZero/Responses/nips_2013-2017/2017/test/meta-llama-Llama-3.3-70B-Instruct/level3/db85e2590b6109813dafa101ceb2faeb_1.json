The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and its relevance to various applications.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the `0-low rank approximation problem and its significance in various fields.\n* The paper presents several new results on the `0-rank-k problem, including a structural lemma that shows the existence of k columns which provide a (k + 1)-approximation to the optimal solution.\n* The authors propose an impractical algorithm that runs in poly(nk,m) time and achieves an O(k2)-approximation, which is the first algorithm with provable non-trivial approximation guarantees for the `0-rank-k problem.\n* The paper also presents a practical algorithm that runs in poly(n,m) time with an exponent independent of k, if we allow for a bicriteria solution.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper lacks a clear comparison with other related work, such as variational inference, which also compresses networks by reducing description length and pruning weights.\n* The experimental section is limited, and more baseline results are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer in achieving a better accuracy-compression tradeoff.\n* The results are hard to interpret, and a graph showing accuracy vs compression ratio would be more informative for comparing the approach to previous regularizers and compressors.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time complexity of the algorithms and a discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria:\n* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\n* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and its significance.\n* Originality: The paper presents several new results and a novel approach to the `0-low rank approximation problem.\n* Significance: The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach.\nHowever, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with related work and a more comprehensive experimental evaluation.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to the `0-low rank approximation problem, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n* The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the problem and its significance, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.\n* The paper presents several new results and a practical algorithm that runs in poly(n,m) time with an exponent independent of k.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper lacks a clear comparison with other related work, such as variational inference.\n* The experimental section is limited, and more baseline results are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer.\n* The results are hard to interpret, and a graph showing accuracy vs compression ratio would be more informative."
