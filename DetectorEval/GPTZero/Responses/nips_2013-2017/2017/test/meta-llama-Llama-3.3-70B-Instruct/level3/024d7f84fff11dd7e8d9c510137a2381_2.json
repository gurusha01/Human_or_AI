            "inputText": "This paper proposes a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, to solve the consensus problem in distributed optimization. The authors claim that their algorithm achieves subdiffusive accelerated convergence rates, matching the rates obtained by shift-register methods. However, upon closer examination, several concerns arise regarding the paper's claims, literature review, and technical contributions.\nFirstly, the paper's claim of an optimal convergence rate for graphs with good expansion properties is questionable, as complete graphs are too special to be representative. The authors should provide more comprehensive analysis for various graph topologies. Furthermore, the literature review is incomplete, missing key references such as Olshevsky's work on linear time average consensus, which has a competitive or better bound than the submission.\nAdditionally, important references on consensus optimization, such as Shi et al. and Scaman et al., are not cited, and the state-of-the-art algorithms and their convergence rates are not reported. The paper also ignores related work on Markov chain lifting and distributed ADMM by Franca and Bento. The content of the last paragraph of page 5 is a long-known fact and should refer to Rabbat et al.'s work on generalized consensus computation.\nMany important references on consensus optimization are ignored, including Shi et al.'s work on exact first-order algorithms and Jakovetic et al.'s work on fast distributed gradient methods. Proposition 3 seems trivial and is a supplementary contribution, lacking significant impact. The paper's convergence rate does not show significant improvement over existing work, particularly in the worst-case scenario.\nThe \"Auxiliary message-passing scheme\" may be equivalent to Nesterov's acceleration, which reduces the paper's contribution. The improvement may come from a careful handling of the spectral gap of graphs, but the worst-case bound is still O(n). The use of directed edges in a simple graph is confusing, and a typo is found in the text, referring to \"Laplacian\" instead of \"Lagrangian\".\nDespite the authors' response, the reviewer's evaluation score remains the same, indicating that the issues raised were not fully addressed. In conclusion, while the paper proposes an interesting modification to the Min-Sum algorithm, its claims and technical contributions are not adequately supported by the literature review and analysis. The paper requires significant revisions to address the aforementioned concerns and provide a more comprehensive and rigorous treatment of the topic.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel modification to the Min-Sum algorithm, which may be of interest to the community.\n* The authors provide some theoretical analysis and simulations to support their claims.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The literature review is incomplete, and important references are missing.\n* The paper's claims are not adequately supported by the analysis, and the convergence rate does not show significant improvement over existing work.\n* The technical contributions are not rigorous, and the paper requires significant revisions to address the concerns raised."
