            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of the `0-low rank approximation problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of non-zero entries in the difference between the original matrix and its low-rank approximation. The authors provide approximation algorithms for this problem, which significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical contributions. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the problem and explains its relevance to various applications, such as association rule mining, biclustering structure identification, and robust PCA.\nThe authors present several algorithms for the `0-low rank approximation problem, including a (2+)-approximation algorithm for the case when k=1, which runs in sublinear time. They also provide a bicriteria algorithm for the case when k>1, which outputs a matrix of rank O(k log(n/k)) and achieves an approximation factor of O(k^2 log(n/k)).\nThe paper also includes a section on algorithms for the Boolean `0-rank-1 problem, which is a special case of the `0-low rank approximation problem where the matrix is binary. The authors provide a (1+O(φ))-approximation algorithm for this problem, which runs in time O(min{ A 0 + m + n, φ^(-1) (m + n) log(mn)}), where φ is a parameter that controls the quality of the approximation.\nThe paper concludes with a section on lower bounds for the Boolean `0-rank-1 problem, which shows that any (1+O(φ))-approximation algorithm must read at least Ω(n/φ) entries of the matrix.\nOverall, this paper makes significant contributions to the study of the `0-low rank approximation problem and its variants. The authors provide efficient algorithms for these problems, which can be used in a variety of applications. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.\nStrengths:\n* The paper presents a comprehensive study of the `0-low rank approximation problem and its variants.\n* The authors provide efficient algorithms for these problems, which can be used in a variety of applications.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper assumes that the input matrix is represented in a specific format, which may not be the case in all applications.\n* The authors do not provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms in practice.\n* The paper does not discuss the robustness of the algorithms to noise or errors in the input data.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper makes significant contributions to the study of the `0-low rank approximation problem and its variants.\n* The authors provide efficient algorithms for these problems, which can be used in a variety of applications.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper assumes that the input matrix is represented in a specific format, which may not be the case in all applications.\n* The authors do not provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms in practice.\n* The paper does not discuss the robustness of the algorithms to noise or errors in the input data.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper because of its significant contributions to the study of the `0-low rank approximation problem and its variants, and its potential impact on various applications. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above in a future version of the paper."
