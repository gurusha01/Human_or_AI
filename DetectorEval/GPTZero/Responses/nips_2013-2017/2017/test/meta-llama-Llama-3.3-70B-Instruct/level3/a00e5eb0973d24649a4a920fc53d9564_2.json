The authors introduce a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to achieve accelerated convergence rates compared to traditional diffusive methods. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior, including a proof of convergence and a characterization of the convergence rate.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The introduction of a new algorithm, Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods for consensus.\n* A thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior, including a proof of convergence and a characterization of the convergence rate.\n* The connection established between Min-Sum Splitting and other accelerated methods, such as lifted Markov chains and multi-step gradient methods.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the intuition behind the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its connection to other accelerated methods.\n* Some of the notation and equations could be clarified or simplified to improve readability.\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in distributed optimization and consensus, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper presents a novel algorithm and provides a thorough analysis of its behavior, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-written and well-organized, although some minor clarifications and simplifications could be made to improve readability. The paper is original and presents a new perspective on the consensus problem, and its significance is clear in terms of its potential impact on the field of distributed optimization.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel algorithm with significant potential impact on the field of distributed optimization.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior, including a proof of convergence and a characterization of the convergence rate.\n* The paper establishes a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other accelerated methods, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in distributed optimization and consensus, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* Some of the notation and equations could be clarified or simplified to improve readability.\n* The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the intuition behind the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its connection to other accelerated methods.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior. However, I suggest that the authors address the minor weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to improve the clarity and readability of the paper."
