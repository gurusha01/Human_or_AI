            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to increasing the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, called the Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM). The key idea is to represent the hidden states as tensors and update them via a cross-layer convolution, allowing the network to be widened efficiently without additional parameters. The paper also introduces a memory cell convolution to capture long-range dependencies from multiple directions.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits of their approach, including the ability to increase the capacity of the network without increasing the parameter number or runtime. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on several challenging sequence learning tasks, including language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and image classification.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, addressing a key limitation of traditional LSTM networks.\n* The technical details are clearly explained, making it easy to understand the proposed approach.\n* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on several tasks.\n* The paper provides a good analysis of the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work, such as convolutional LSTMs and deep LSTMs.\n* Some of the experimental results could be improved, such as the use of more baseline models and a more detailed analysis of the results.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequence learning and LSTM networks. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of LSTM networks on several tasks, and the paper provides a good foundation for future research in this area.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to increasing the capacity of LSTM networks.\n* The technical details are clearly explained, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on several tasks.\n* The paper provides a good analysis of the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work.\n* Some of the experimental results could be improved.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of LSTM networks on several tasks. However, the paper could benefit from some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above."
