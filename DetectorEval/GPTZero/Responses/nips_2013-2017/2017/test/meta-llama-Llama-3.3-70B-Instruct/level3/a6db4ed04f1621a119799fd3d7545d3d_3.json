            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to increasing the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, called the Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM). The tLSTM represents hidden states as higher-dimensional tensors, allowing for more flexible parameter sharing and efficient widening of the network without additional parameters. The model also merges deep computations into temporal computations, enabling the network to be deepened with little additional runtime.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the tLSTM, including its advantages over existing methods, such as Convolutional LSTMs (cLSTMs) and Deep LSTMs (dLSTMs).\nThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on a variety of tasks, including Wikipedia language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and MNIST image classification. The results show that the tLSTM outperforms existing methods, such as sLSTM and cLSTM, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks.\nThe paper also provides a detailed analysis of the internal working mechanism of the tLSTM, including visualization of the memory cell and channel mean. The results show that the tLSTM is able to capture long-range dependencies and perform deep computations efficiently.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling. The proposed tLSTM method has the potential to improve the performance of LSTMs on a wide range of tasks, and the paper provides a thorough and well-written explanation of the method and its advantages.\nStrengths:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to increasing the capacity of LSTMs.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on a variety of tasks.\n* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the internal working mechanism of the tLSTM.\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, such as cLSTMs and dLSTMs.\n* The paper could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the tensor size and kernel size.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the tLSTM.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling.\n* The proposed tLSTM method has the potential to improve the performance of LSTMs on a wide range of tasks.\n* The paper provides a thorough and well-written explanation of the method and its advantages.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods.\n* The paper could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the tLSTM.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and provides a thorough and well-written explanation of the proposed method. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the paper."
