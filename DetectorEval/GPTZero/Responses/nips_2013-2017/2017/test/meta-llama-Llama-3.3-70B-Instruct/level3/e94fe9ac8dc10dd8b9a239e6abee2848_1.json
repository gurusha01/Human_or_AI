            "inputText": "This paper studies the problem of `0-Low Rank Approximation, which aims to find a rank-k matrix that minimizes the number of non-zero entries that differ from the original matrix. The authors provide several approximation algorithms for this problem, including a bicriteria approximation algorithm for k > 1 and a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for k = 1 in sublinear time. They also present an algorithm for binary matrices that achieves a (1 + O(ψ))-approximation in sublinear time, where ψ is the ratio of the optimal solution to the number of non-zero entries in the matrix.\nThe paper's results are technically sound, and the algorithms are well-motivated by the problem's applications in areas such as association rule mining, biclustering structure identification, and pattern discovery for gene expression. However, the paper could benefit from more experiments and a clearer explanation of the problem's practical applications.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its thorough analysis of the problem's complexity and the algorithms' performance guarantees. The authors provide a detailed discussion of the problem's NP-hardness and the trade-offs between the approximation factor and the running time. They also present a lower bound on the number of samples required for any (1 + O(φ))-approximation algorithm for the Boolean `0-rank-1 problem.\nHowever, the paper has some minor errors and areas for improvement. For example, the formatting could be improved, and some of the notation could be clarified. Additionally, the authors could provide more context and background information on the problem and its applications.\nOverall, the paper provides reasonable progress on an interesting theoretical problem, but its applicability in practice is not well-supported. The results are clean and standard, but some assumptions lack sufficient evidence, such as the need for sum of rows and column to be accessed in O(m+n) and the conjecture for Boolean `0-rank-1.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem's complexity and the algorithms' performance guarantees.\n* The authors present a bicriteria approximation algorithm for k > 1 and a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for k = 1 in sublinear time.\n* The paper has a clear and well-organized structure, making it easy to follow.\nArguments for rejection:\n* The paper lacks experiments and a clear explanation of the problem's practical applications.\n* Some assumptions lack sufficient evidence, such as the need for sum of rows and column to be accessed in O(m+n) and the conjecture for Boolean `0-rank-1.\n* The paper has minor errors and areas for improvement, such as formatting and notation."
