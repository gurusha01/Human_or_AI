            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to training deep neural networks (DNNs) using a Tikhonov regularization technique. The authors propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that can guarantee global convergence to stationary points with R-linear convergence rate of order one. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the theoretical guarantees provided, and the empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, which helps to contextualize their contribution.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is the computational complexity of the algorithm, which may be a limitation in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future work could focus on developing faster implementations.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.\nIn terms of clarity, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The notation is consistent, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the key concepts and techniques used in the paper.\nIn terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to training DNNs, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work. The paper also provides new insights into the use of Tikhonov regularization for training DNNs.\nIn terms of significance, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of deep learning. The authors demonstrate that their approach can outperform traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based solvers, and the paper provides a new perspective on the use of regularization techniques for training DNNs.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel approach to training DNNs that has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.\n* The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate that their approach can outperform traditional SGD based solvers.\n* The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The computational complexity of the algorithm may be a limitation in practice.\n* The paper may benefit from additional experimental results to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\nOverall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field of deep learning, and I recommend acceptance."
