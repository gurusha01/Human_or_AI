            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to solving the consensus problem in distributed optimization using the Min-Sum message-passing protocol with splitting. The authors establish a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and lifted Markov chains techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, showing that it achieves a subdiffusive rate of convergence, which is a significant improvement over the diffusive rate of classical consensus algorithms.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the consensus problem and the Min-Sum protocol. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to contextualize the authors' contributions.\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to establish a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other accelerated methods, such as lifted Markov chains and multi-step gradient methods. This connection provides valuable insights into the acceleration mechanism of Min-Sum Splitting and highlights its potential for solving other optimization problems.\nHowever, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Min-Sum Splitting in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm, as well as its scalability to large-scale problems.\nIn terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization. The authors have also done a good job of relating their work to previous research in the area, and the paper provides a clear and concise summary of the main ideas.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization, and its connection to other accelerated methods makes it a valuable addition to the literature.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper provides a novel approach to solving the consensus problem in distributed optimization.\n* The authors establish a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other accelerated methods, such as lifted Markov chains and multi-step gradient methods.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm.\n* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the consensus problem and the Min-Sum protocol.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Min-Sum Splitting in practice.\n* The paper could provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm, as well as its scalability to large-scale problems."
