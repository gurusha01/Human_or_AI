            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel GRU-based architecture for precipitation nowcasting, a video prediction problem with a fixed camera position. The authors introduce a new benchmarking package for evaluation and present an interesting proposed architecture. However, the technical quality of the paper is somewhat diminished by the lack of comparisons with LSTM versions and fully connected RNNs.\nThe paper is generally well-written, but the description of the proposed TrajGRU model is hard to understand, particularly the structure generating network and its production of flow fields. The idea of learning trajectories with spatial transformer-inspired modules is novel, although the general architecture is similar to ConvLSTM.\nThe significance of the work is uncertain due to the new benchmark and lack of comparison with existing precipitation nowcasting benchmarks. Nevertheless, the idea may have applications in other domains with high-dimensional distributions. The pros of the paper include an interesting model, nice baselines, and practical evaluation, while the cons include a hard-to-follow model description and limited novelty compared to ConvGRU/LSTM.\nIn terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims could be better supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, but the authors could be more careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.\nThe clarity of the paper is good, but the organization could be improved. The paper adequately informs the reader, but some sections, such as the description of the TrajGRU model, could be clearer.\nThe originality of the paper is moderate, as the idea of using GRU-based architectures for precipitation nowcasting is not entirely new. However, the introduction of a new benchmarking package and the novel idea of learning trajectories with spatial transformer-inspired modules are notable contributions.\nThe significance of the paper is uncertain, as the results are not directly comparable to existing precipitation nowcasting benchmarks. Nevertheless, the idea may have applications in other domains, and the paper presents a interesting and novel approach to video prediction problems.\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the clarity and technical quality issues. The authors should provide more comparisons with existing methods, clarify the description of the TrajGRU model, and provide more theoretical analysis or experimental results to support their claims.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* Interesting and novel approach to video prediction problems\n* Nice baselines and practical evaluation\n* Potential applications in other domains with high-dimensional distributions\nArguments against acceptance:\n* Hard-to-follow model description\n* Limited novelty compared to ConvGRU/LSTM\n* Lack of comparisons with existing precipitation nowcasting benchmarks\n* Uncertain significance of the work due to the new benchmark."
