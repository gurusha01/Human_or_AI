            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel approach to training deep neural networks (DNNs) using a Tikhonov regularization technique. The authors propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to minimize the regularized objective function, which is shown to converge globally to stationary points with R-linear convergence rate of order one. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including proofs of convergence and R-linear convergence rate.\nThe strengths of the paper include its novel approach to DNN training, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its empirical results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The paper also provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the material, making it easy to follow.\nHowever, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One concern is the computational complexity of the algorithm, which involves solving a sequence of quadratic programs. While the authors mention that they focus on the theoretical development of the algorithm and consider fast implementations in future work, this could be a significant limitation in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency.\nAnother potential concern is the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization constants Î³n. While the authors provide some guidance on how to choose these parameters, more experimentation and analysis may be needed to fully understand their impact on the algorithm's performance.\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, and its novel approach to DNN training has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of existing methods. However, further work is needed to fully realize the potential of this approach and to address the limitations and concerns mentioned above.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to DNN training.\n* The theoretical analysis is thorough and well-presented.\n* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n* The paper has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of existing DNN training methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The computational complexity of the algorithm may be a significant limitation in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from more comparisons to existing state-of-the-art methods.\n* The choice of hyperparameters may require more experimentation and analysis.\n* The paper may benefit from more discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach."
