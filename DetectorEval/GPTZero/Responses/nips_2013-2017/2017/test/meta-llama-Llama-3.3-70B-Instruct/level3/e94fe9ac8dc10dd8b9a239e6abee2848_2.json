The authors establish a connection between the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and lifted Markov chains techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, showing that it achieves a subdiffusive rate of convergence, which is a significant improvement over traditional diffusive methods.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed algorithm and its analysis. The introduction of the splitting parameters is shown to be fundamental in guaranteeing the convergence of the Min-Sum scheme, and the proper tuning of these parameters yields accelerated convergence rates. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, highlighting the advantages and similarities of the proposed approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel algorithm for solving the consensus problem, which achieves a subdiffusive rate of convergence.\n* The establishment of a connection between the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and lifted Markov chains techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization.\n* A thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, including a comparison with existing methods.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The lack of experimental evaluation, which makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.\n* The extensive literature review, which occupies a significant portion of the paper and could be reduced to make room for experimental evaluations.\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and provides a novel approach to solving the consensus problem. The authors' analysis and comparison with existing methods are thorough and well-presented, making the paper a valuable addition to the literature.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel algorithm for solving the consensus problem, which achieves a subdiffusive rate of convergence.\n* The authors establish a connection between the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and lifted Markov chains techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, including a comparison with existing methods.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The lack of experimental evaluation, which makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.\n* The extensive literature review, which occupies a significant portion of the paper and could be reduced to make room for experimental evaluations.\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and provides a novel approach to solving the consensus problem.
