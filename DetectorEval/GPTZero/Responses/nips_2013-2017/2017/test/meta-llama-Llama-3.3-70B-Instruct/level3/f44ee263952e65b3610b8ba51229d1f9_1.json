The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its significance.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the problem, including its motivation, related work, and a clear definition of the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem.\n* The paper presents several algorithms for solving the problem, including a (2+)-approximation algorithm for the case when k=1, and a bicriteria algorithm for the case when k>1.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including their running time, approximation factor, and optimality.\n* The paper includes a discussion of the implications of the results, including their potential applications and the significance of the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a high level of mathematical sophistication, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* Some of the proofs and analyses are quite technical and may require careful reading to understand.\n* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in practice.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and presents significant contributions to the field of low rank approximation.

The paper presents significant contributions to the field of low rank approximation, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its significance. However, the paper could benefit from more numerical experiments and a clearer explanation of the technical proofs and analyses."
