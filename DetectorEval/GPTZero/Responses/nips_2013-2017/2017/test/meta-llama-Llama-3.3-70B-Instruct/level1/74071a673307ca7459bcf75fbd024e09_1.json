The screening rule is a simple closed-form formula that can be used to identify the blockwise structure of the solution with a given regularization parameter. The authors demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the screening rule through various experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the background, notation, and technical results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the contributions of their paper. The experimental results are impressive, showing significant speedups in learning when combining the screening rule with various optimization algorithms.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The screening rule is a novel and useful contribution to the field of statistical learning with sparsity.\n* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the screening rule, including proofs and justifications.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening rule in practice.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a specific form of the Ising model, which may not be applicable to all scenarios.\n* The screening rule is not foolproof when combined with inexact methods, and the authors acknowledge that further theoretical justifications are needed.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of statistical learning with sparsity.\n* The screening rule has the potential to be widely applicable and useful in practice.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening rule.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a specific form of the Ising model, which may limit its applicability.\n* The screening rule is not foolproof when combined with inexact methods, which may limit its usefulness in practice.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper due to its significant contributions to the field and its potential for widespread applicability. However, I suggest that the authors address the limitations of the paper and provide further theoretical justifications for the screening rule in future work. \nQuality: 8/10\nThe paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the contributions of their paper. However, the paper assumes a specific form of the Ising model, which may limit its applicability.\nClarity: 9/10\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide clear explanations of the technical results and experimental methodology.\nOriginality: 8/10\nThe screening rule is a novel and useful contribution to the field of statistical learning with sparsity. However, the paper builds on existing work in the field and does not introduce entirely new concepts.\nSignificance: 9/10\nThe paper has the potential to be widely applicable and useful in practice. The screening rule could be used to improve the efficiency of various optimization algorithms and has the potential to be used in a variety of fields, including biology and social network analysis."
