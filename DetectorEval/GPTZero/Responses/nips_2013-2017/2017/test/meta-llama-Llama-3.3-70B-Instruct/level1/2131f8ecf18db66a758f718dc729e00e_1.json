            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of multiclass labeling of unlabeled elements using a semisupervised clustering model. The authors show that this problem is equivalent to locally encodable source coding, a concept that has not been well-studied in the information theory community. By leveraging this equivalence, the authors are able to derive lower bounds on the number of queries required to recover the correct labelings in various scenarios.\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem setup, the information theoretic view, and the main results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, including a discussion of the limitations of pairwise 'same cluster' queries and the benefits of using AND queries instead.\nOne of the main strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for understanding the problem of multiclass labeling. The authors show that their approach can be applied to a variety of scenarios, including noiseless and noisy queries, and exact and approximate recovery. The paper also provides a number of interesting insights and observations, such as the fact that AND queries can outperform 'same cluster' queries in certain situations.\nThe experimental results presented in the paper are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the authors' approach on a real-world dataset. The comparison with 'same cluster' queries and spectral clustering algorithms is particularly interesting, and highlights the benefits of using AND queries in certain situations.\nIn terms of weaknesses, one potential limitation of the paper is that it assumes a relatively simple model of noise in the query answers. In practice, the noise may be more complex and nuanced, and it would be interesting to see how the authors' approach performs in such scenarios. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the algorithms presented, as well as a more thorough analysis of the trade-offs between the number of queries and the accuracy of the recovered labelings.\nOverall, however, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of semisupervised clustering. The authors' approach is novel and well-motivated, and the results are impressive and well-supported by theory and experiment.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to the problem of multiclass labeling.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.\n* The experimental results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the authors' approach.\n* The paper provides a number of interesting insights and observations, and highlights the benefits of using AND queries in certain situations.\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a relatively simple model of noise in the query answers, which may not be realistic in practice.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the algorithms presented.\n* The paper could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the trade-offs between the number of queries and the accuracy of the recovered labelings."
