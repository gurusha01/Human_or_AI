            "inputText": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the conditions under which variance reduction and acceleration schemes can be efficiently applied to finite sum optimization problems. The authors show that knowing the identity of the individual function being referred to by the oracle at each iteration is crucial for obtaining linear convergence rates with a linear dependence on the number of functions, n. They also demonstrate that without an explicit knowledge of the strong convexity parameter, acceleration is not possible for a broad class of first-order and coordinate-descent finite sum algorithms.\nThe paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and a thorough literature review. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the importance of individual identity in finite sum problems and show that variance-reduction mechanisms cannot be applied without explicitly knowing the identity of the individual functions.\nThe paper's main contributions are:\n1. Showing that knowing the identity of the individual function is necessary for obtaining linear convergence rates with a linear dependence on n.\n2. Demonstrating that without an explicit knowledge of the strong convexity parameter, acceleration is not possible for a broad class of first-order and coordinate-descent finite sum algorithms.\n3. Establishing a tight lower bound for the iteration complexity of oblivious algorithms for smooth and convex finite sum problems.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A clear and concise writing style\n* A thorough analysis of the problem and its implications\n* A comprehensive literature review\n* A detailed and well-structured presentation of the results\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The paper assumes a strong background in optimization and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.\n* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the results.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and presents significant contributions to the field of optimization. The results have important implications for the design of efficient algorithms for finite sum problems and highlight the importance of considering the individual identity of the functions in these problems.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper presents significant contributions to the field of optimization.\n* The results have important implications for the design of efficient algorithms for finite sum problems.\n* The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The paper assumes a strong background in optimization and machine learning, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts.\n* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the results.\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions to improve clarity and accessibility."
