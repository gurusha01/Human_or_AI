            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning approach for training sequence classifiers without labeled data. The authors introduce an Empirical Output Distribution Match (Empirical-ODM) cost function that exploits sequential output statistics, such as language models, to learn the classifier. The cost function is designed to match the output distribution of the classifier with the prior distribution of the output sequences. The authors also develop a stochastic primal-dual gradient (SPDG) algorithm to optimize the Empirical-ODM cost function, which is shown to be effective in addressing the challenges of optimizing the cost function.\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving significantly lower error rates compared to other unsupervised learning methods. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* The proposal of a novel unsupervised learning approach that exploits sequential output statistics to learn sequence classifiers without labeled data.\n* The development of an effective optimization algorithm, SPDG, to address the challenges of optimizing the Empirical-ODM cost function.\n* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experimental results.\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The restriction of the proposed approach to linear classifiers, which may limit its applicability to more complex models.\n* The computational expense of the SPDG algorithm, which may be challenging to scale to large vocabulary and high-order language models.\nArguments for acceptance:\n* The paper proposes a novel and effective unsupervised learning approach that addresses a significant challenge in machine learning.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other unsupervised learning methods.\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the results and discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.\nArguments against acceptance:\n* The restriction of the proposed approach to linear classifiers may limit its applicability to more complex models.\n* The computational expense of the SPDG algorithm may be challenging to scale to large vocabulary and high-order language models.\nOverall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and effective unsupervised learning approach that addresses a significant challenge in machine learning. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the results. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of the proposed approach, such as extending it to nonlinear models and improving the scalability of the SPDG algorithm."
