            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel approach to achieving Byzantine resilience in distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. The authors propose a new aggregation rule, called Krum, which is designed to tolerate Byzantine failures in a distributed system. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the Krum function, including its computational complexity, Byzantine resilience, and convergence properties.\nThe main idea behind Krum is to select the vector that is closest to its n-f neighbors, where n is the total number of workers and f is the number of Byzantine workers. The authors show that Krum satisfies a Byzantine resilience property, which guarantees that the output of the aggregation rule is not too far from the true gradient. They also provide a convergence analysis of the SGD algorithm using Krum, which shows that the algorithm converges to a \"flat\" region of the cost function.\nThe paper also presents experimental evaluations of Krum, which demonstrate its effectiveness in tolerating Byzantine failures. The authors compare Krum with classical averaging and show that Krum is more resilient to Byzantine attacks. They also evaluate the cost of resilience and show that Krum can be optimized to reduce its overhead.\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n* A novel and well-motivated approach to achieving Byzantine resilience in distributed SGD algorithms\n* A thorough analysis of the Krum function, including its computational complexity, Byzantine resilience, and convergence properties\n* Experimental evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of Krum in tolerating Byzantine failures\nThe weaknesses of the paper include:\n* The assumption that the Byzantine workers have full knowledge of the system, which may not be realistic in all scenarios\n* The lack of comparison with other Byzantine-resilient algorithms, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Krum's performance\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed machine learning and provides a promising approach to achieving Byzantine resilience in distributed SGD algorithms.\nArguments pro acceptance:\n* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to achieving Byzantine resilience in distributed SGD algorithms\n* The analysis of the Krum function is thorough and well-done\n* The experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Krum in tolerating Byzantine failures\nArguments con acceptance:\n* The assumption that the Byzantine workers have full knowledge of the system may not be realistic in all scenarios\n* The lack of comparison with other Byzantine-resilient algorithms may limit the scope of the evaluation\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of Krum in practice."
