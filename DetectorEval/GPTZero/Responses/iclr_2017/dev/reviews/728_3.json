            "inputText": "The paper presents a method for visualization and analysis of policies from observed trajectories that the policies produce. The method infers higher level skills and clusters states. The result is a simplified, discrete higher-order state and action transition matrix. This model can be used for analysis, modeling, and interpretation. To construct semi-aggregated MDP the authors propose combining ideas for creating semi-MPDs and agregrated-MDPs. The method consists of choosing features, state clustering, skill inference, reward and skill length inference, and model selection. The method was demonstrated on a small grid-world problem, and DQN-trained agent for playing Atari games.\nThe authors correctly identify that tools and means for interpretibility of RL methods are important for analysis, and deployment of such methods for real-world applications. This is particularly true in robotics and high-consequence systems.\nThe end-result of the presented method is a high-level transition matrix. There is a big body of literature looking into hierarchical RL methods where lower level skills are combined with higher level policies. The presented method has the similar result, but the advantage of the presented method is that it comes up with a structure and analyzes already trained agent, which is very interesting. The paper would benefit from emphasizing this difference, and contrasting with the broader body of literature.\nTo build the model, the authors propose combining the ideas from two existing ideas, semi-MPDs and agregrated-MDPs with using modified k-means for state clustering. It appears that the novelty of the presented method is limited. The paper would have been stronger if the authors explicitly stated the contributions over combining existing methods, and better highlighted the practical utility of the method. \nThe evaluation section would be made stronger with more analytical results and precise evaluation, showing full strength of the method.\nThe paper is difficult to read. To improve readability:\n- The Semi-Aggregated MDP section should include more precise description of the methods. The narrative that builds intuition is welcome. In addition to the existing narrative, algorithms and formulas where applicable should be included as well. \n- The paper should be self-contained. For example, more background on Occams Razor principle should be included.\n- Reduce the number of acronyms, in particular similarly sounding acronyms. Define acronyms before using. \n- Be more clear on the contributions, contrast with relevant literature, and the specific benefits of the presented method.\n- Fix typos, formatting mistakes etc., as they can be distracting for reading. \nThe approach of reverse engineering the hierarchy, and learning high-level transition matrix is very interesting and promising. Perhaps the method can be used to outperform single network approach by using the model as an input to more specialized hierarchical trainers and learn complex behaviors more optimally then possible with one large network approach. Unfortunately, the paper falls short in the novelty, precision, and clarity."
