When these states are observed, an error signal\nis computed by comparing the predictions and the observations. This error\nsignal is fed back into the model. The authors show that this model is able to\nmake good predictions on a toy dataset of rotating 3D faces as well as on\nnatural videos. They also show that these features help perform supervised\ntasks.\nStrengths\n- The model is an interesting embodiment of the idea of predictive coding\n implemented using a end-to-end backpropable recurrent neural network architecture.\n- The idea of feeding forward an error signal is perhaps not used as widely as it could\n be, and this work shows a compelling example of using it. \n- Strong empirical results and relevant comparisons show that the model works well.\n- The authors present a detailed ablative analysis of the proposed model.\nWeaknesses\n- The model (esp. in Fig 1) is presented as a generalized predictive model\n where next step predictions are made at each layer. However, as discovered by\nrunning the experiments, only the predictions at the input layer are the ones\nthat actually matter and the optimal choice seems to be to turn off the error\nsignal from the higher layers. While the authors intend to address this in future\nwork, I think this point merits some more discussion in the current work, given\nthe way this model is presented.\n- The network currently lacks stochasticity and does not model the future as a\n multimodal distribution (However, this is mentioned as potential future work).\nQuality\nThe experiments are well-designed and a detailed analysis is provided\nin the appendix.\nClarity\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nOriginality\nSome deep models have previously been proposed that use predictive coding.\nHowever, the proposed model is most probably novel in the way it feds back the\nerror signal and implements the entire model as a single differentiable\nnetwork.\nSignificance\nThis paper will be of wide interest to the growing set of researchers working\nin unsupervised learning of time series. This helps draw attention to\npredictive coding as an important learning paradigm.\nOverall\nGood paper with detailed and well-designed experiments. The idea of feeding\nforward the error signal is not being used as much as it could be in our\ncommunity. This work helps to draw the community's attention to this idea."
