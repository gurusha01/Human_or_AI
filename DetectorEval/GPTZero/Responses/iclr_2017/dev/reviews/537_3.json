            "inputText": "The submission proposes an interesting way to match synthetic data to real data in a GAN type architecture.\nThe main novelty are parametric modules that emulate different transformations and artefact that allow to match the natural appearance.\nseveral points were raised during the discussion:\n1. the proposed method is more model driven that previous GAN models. But does it pay off? how would a traditional GAN approach perform? The mentioned effects like blur, lighting and background could also potentially be modelled by upsamling network that directly predicts the image. I would assume that blur and lighting can be modelled by convolutions. transformations to some extend by convolutions - or spatial transformer networks.\nThe answers of the authors only partially addresses the point. The key proposal of the submission seems parameterised modules that can be trained to match the real data distribution. but it remains unclear why not a more generic parameterisation can also do the job. E.g. a neural network - as done in regular GANs. The benefit of introducing a stronger model is unclear. Using a render engine to generate the initial sample appearance if of limited novelty.\n2. how does it compare to traditional data augmentation techniques, e.g. noise, dropout, transformations. you are linking to keras code - where data augmentation is readily available and could be tested (ImageDataGenerator)\nThe authors reply that plenty of such augmentation was used and more details are going to be provided in the appendix. it would have been appreciated if such information was directly included in the revision - so that the procedure could be directly checked. right now - this remains a point of uncertainty.\n3. How do the different stages (\\phis) effect performance? which are the most important ones?\nThe authors do evaluate the effect of hand tuning the transformation stages vs. learning them. it would be great to also include results of including/excluding stages completely - and also reporting how much the initial jittering of the data helps.\nWhile there is an interesting idea of (limited) novelty to the paper, there are some concerns about evalations and comparisons as outlined above. In addition, only success on a single dataset/task is shown. Yet the task is interesting and seems challenging. Overall, this remains makes only a weak recommendation for acceptance."
