            "inputText": "UPDATE: I have read the replies on this thread. My opinion has not changed.\nThe authors propose deep VCCA, a deep version of the probabilistic CCA model by using likelihoods parameterized by nonlinear functions (neural nets). Variational inference is applied with an inference network and reparameterization gradients. An additional variant, termed VCCA-private, is also introduced, which includes local latent variables for each data point (view). A connection to the multi view auto encoder is also shown.\nSince the development of black box variational inference and variational auto-encoders, the methodology in model-specific papers like this one are arguably not very interesting. The model is a straightforward extension of probabilistic CCA with neural net parameterized likelihoods. Inference is mechanically the same as any black box approach using the reparameterization gradient and inference networks. The approach also uses a mean-field approximation, which is quite old given the many recent developments in more expressive approximations (see, e.g., Rezende and Mohamed (2015); Tran et al. (2016)).\nThe connection to multi-view auto encoders is at first insightful, but no more than the difference between MAP and variational inference. This is a well-known insight: in the abstract, the authors argue that the key distinction is the additional sampling, but ultimately what matters is the KL regularizer. Even with noisy samples, the variances of a normal variational approximation would collapse to zero and thus become a point mass approximation, equivalent to optimizing a point estimate from the MVAE objective. (I suspect the authors know this to some degree due to their remarks in the paper, but it is unclear.)\nThat said, I think the paper has strong merits in application. The experiments are strong, comparing to alternative multi-view approaches under a number of interesting data sets. While the use of \"private variables\" is simple, they demonstrate how it can successfully disentangle the per-view latent representation from the shared view. It would have been preferable to compare to methods using probabilistic inference, such as full Bayes for the linear CCA. \nThere are also a number of approximations taken to almost be standard in the paper which may not be necessary, such as the use of a mean-field family or the use of an inference network. To separate out how much the approximate inference is influencing the fit of the model, I strongly recommend using MCMC and non-amortized variational inference on at least one experiment. \n+ Rezende, D.
