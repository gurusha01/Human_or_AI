The compatibility of these representation with the question representation is then calculated.\nThe scores are combined linearly and used for calculating the probability of the candidate answer being the right answer for the question.\nThe method is tested on the SQUAD dataset and outperforms the proposed baselines.\n----------\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\nThe method presented in this paper is interesting but not very motivated in some points.\nFor example, it is not explained why in the attention mechanism it is beneficial to concatenate the original passage encoding with the attention-weighted ones.\nThe contributions of the paper are moderately novel proposing mainly the attention mechanism and the convolutional re-encoding.\nIn fact, combining questions and passages and score their compatibility has became a fairly standard procedure in all QA models.\n----------\nDETAILED COMMENTS\nEquation (13) i should be s, not s^l.\nI still do not understand the sentence \" the best function is to concatenate the hidden stat of the fist word in a chunk in forward RNN and that of the last word in backward RNN\". The RNN is over what all the words in the chunk? in the passage? \nThe answer the authors gave in the response does not clarify this point."
