            "inputText": "This paper considers the case where multiple views of data are learned through a probabilistic deep neural network formulation. This makes the model non-linear (unlike e.g. CCA) but makes inference difficult. Therefore, the VAE framework is invoked for inference.\nIn [Ref 1] the authors show that maximum likelihood estimation based on their linear latent model leads to the canonical correlation directions. But in the non-linear case with DNNs it's not clear (at least with the present analysis) what the solution is wrt to the canonical directions. There's no such analysis in the paper, hence I find it a stretch to refer to this model as a CCA type of model. In contrast, e.g. DCCA / DCCAE are taking the canonical correlation between features into account inside the objective and provide interpretations.\n[Ref 1] F. R. Bach and M. I. Jordan. A probabilistic interpretation of canonical correlation analysis. Technical Report 688, 2005.\nThere is also a significant body of very related work on non-linear multi-view models which is not discussed in this paper. For example, there's been probabilistic non-linear multi-view models [Ref 2, 3], also extended to the Bayesian case with common/private spaces [Ref 4] and the variational / deep learning case [Ref 5].\n[Ref 2] Ek et al. Gaussian process latent variable models for human pose estimation. MLMI, 2007.\n[Ref 3] Shon et al. Learning shared latent structure for image synthesis and robotic imitation. NIPS, 2006.\n[Ref 4] Damianou et al. Manifold relevance determination. ICML, 2012.\n[Ref 5] Damianou and Lawrence. Deep Gaussian processes. AISTATS, 2013.\nI can see the utility of this model as bringing together two elements: multi-view modeling and VAEs. This seems like an obvious idea but to the best of my knowledge it hasn't been done before and is actually a potentially very useful model.\nHowever, the question is, what is the proper way of extending VAE to multiple views? The paper didn't convince me that VAE can work well with multiple views using the shown straightforward construction. Specifically, VCCA doesn't seem to promote the state of the art in terms of results (it actually is overall below the SOA), while the VCCA-private seems a quite ill-posed model: the dimensionalities d have to be manually tuned with exhaustive search; further, the actual model does not provide a consinstent way of encouraging the private and common variables to avoid learning redundant information. Relying only on dropout for this seems a quite ad-hoc solution (in fact, from Fig. 4 (ver2) it seems that the dropout rate is quite crucial). Perhaps good performance might be achieved with a lot of tuning (which might be why the FLICKR results got better in ver2 without changing the model), but it seems quite difficult to optimize for the above reasons. From a purely experimental point of view, VCCA-private doesn't seem to promote the SOA either. Of course one wouldn't expect any new published paper to beat all previous baselines, but it seems that extension of VAE to multiple views is a very interesting idea which deserves some more investigation of how to do it efficiently.\nAnother issue is the approximate posterior being parameterized only from one of the views. This makes the model less useful as a generic multi-view model, since it will misbehave in tasks other than classification. But if classification is the main objective, then one should compare to a proper classification model, e.g. a feedforward neural network.\nThe plots of Fig. 8 are very nice. Overall, the paper convinced me that there is merit in attaching multiple views to VAE. However, it didn't convince me a) that the proposed way to achieve this is practical b) that there is a connection to CCA (other than being a method for multiple views). The bottom line is that, although the paper is interesting, it needs a little more work."
