            "inputText": "This paper purports to investigate the ability of RL agents to perform 'physics experiments' in an environment, to infer physical properties about the objects in that environment. The problem is very well motivated; indeed, inferring the physical properties of objects is a crucial skill for intelligent agents, and there has been relatively little work in this direction, particularly in deep RL. The paper is also well-written.\nAs there are no architectural or theoretical contributions of the paper (and none are claimed), the main novelty comes in the task application \"\" using a recurrent A3C model for two tasks that simulate an agent interacting with an environment to infer physical properties of objects. More specifically, two tasks are considered \"\" moving blocks to determine their mass, and poking towers such that they fall to determine the number of rigid bodies they are composed of. These of course represent a very limited cross-section of the prerequisite abilities for an agent to understand physics. This in itself is not a bad thing, but since there is no comparison of different (simpler) RL agents on the tasks, it is difficult to determine if the tasks selected are challenging. As mentioned in the pre-review question, the 'Which is Heavier' task seems quite easy due to the actuator set-up, and the fact that the model simply must learn to take the difference between successive block positions (which are directly encoded as features in most experiments). Thus, it is not particularly surprising that the RL agent can solve the proposed tasks. \nThe main claim beyond solving two proposed tasks related to physics simulation is that \"the agents learn different strategies for these tasks that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes\". The 'cost of gathering information' is implemented by multiplying the reward with a value of gamma < 1. This is somewhat interesting behaviour, but is hardly surprising given the problem setup.\nOne item the authors highlight is that their approach of learning about physical object properties through interaction is different from many previous approaches, which use visual cues. However, the authors also note that this in itself is not novel, and has been explored in other work (e.g. Agrawal et al. (2016)). I think it's crucial for the authors to discuss these approaches in more detail (potentially along with removing some other, less relevant information from the related work section), and specifically highlight why the proposed tasks in this paper are interesting compared to, for example, learning to move objects towards certain end positions by poking them.\nTo discern the level of contribution of the paper, one must ask the following questions: \n1) how much do these two tasks contribute (above previous work) to the goal of having agents learn the properties of objects by interaction; and\n2) how much do the results of the RL agent on these tasks contribute to our understanding of agents that interact with their environment to learn physical properties of objects? \nIt is difficult to know exactly, but due to the concerns outlined above, I am not convinced that the answers to (1) or (2) are \"to a significant extent\". In particular, for (1), since the proposed agent is able to essentially solve both tasks, it is not clear that the tasks can be used to benchmark more advanced agents (e.g. it can't be used as a set of bAbI-like tasks). \nAnother possible concern, as pointed out by Reviewer 3, is that the description of the model is extremely concise. It would be nice to have, for example, a diagram illustrating the inputs and outputs to the model at each time step, to ease replication.\nOverall, it is important to make progress towards agents that can learn to discover physical properties of their environment, and the paper contributes in this direction. However, the technical contributions of this paper are rather limited \"\" thus, it is not clear to what extent the paper pushes forward research in this direction beyond previous work that is mentioned. It would be nice, for example, to have some discussion about the future of agents that learn physics from interaction (speculation on more difficult versions of the tasks in this paper), and how the proposed approach fits into that picture. \n---------------\nEDIT: score updated, see comments below"
