            "inputText": "This paper addresses the question of how to utilize physical interactions to answer questions about physical outcomes. This question falls into a popular stream in ML community -- understanding physics. The paper moved a step further and worked on experimental setups where there is no prior about the physical properties/rules and it uses a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to address the problem. My overall opinion about this paper is: an interesting attempt and idea, yet without a clear contribution.\nThe experimental setups are quite interesting. The goal is to figure out which blocks are heavier or which blocks are glued together -- only by pushing and pulling objects around without any prior. The paper also shows reasonable performances on each task with detailed scenarios.\nWhile these experiments and results are interesting, the contribution is unclear. My main question is: does this result bring us any new insight? While the scenarios are interesting and focused on physical experiments, this is not any more different (potentially easier) than learning from playing games (e.g. Atari). In other words, are the tasks really different from other typical popular DRL tasks? To this end, I would have been more excited if authors showed some more new insights or experiments on learned representations and etc. Currently, the paper only discusses the factual outcome. For example, it describes the experimental setup and how much performances an agent could achieve. The authors could probably dissect the learned representations further, or discuss how the experimental results are linked to the human behavior or physical properties/laws.\nI am very in-between for my overall rating. I think the paper could have a deeper analysis. I however recommend the acceptance because of its merit of the idea.\nThe followings are some detailed questions (not directly impacting my overall rating):\n(1) Page 2 \"we assume that the agent has no prior knowledge about the physical properties of objects, or the laws of physics, and hence must interact with the objects in order to learn to answer questions about these properties.\": why does one \"must\" interact with objects in order to learn about the properties? Can't we also learn through observation?\n(2) Figure 1right is missing a Y-axis label.\n(3) Page 3: A relating to bandit is interesting, but the formal approach is all based on DRL.\n(4) Page 5 \"which makes distinguishing between the two heaviest blocks very difficult\": I am a bit confused why having a small mass gap makes the task harder (unless it's really close to 0). Shouldn't a machine be possible to distinguish even a pixel difference of speed? If not, isn't this just because of the network architecture?\n(5) Page 5 \"Since the agents exhibit similar performance using pixels and features we conduct the remaining experiments in this section using feature observations, since these agents are substantially faster to train.\": How about at least showing a correlation of performances at the instance level (rather than average performances)? Even so, I think this is a bit of big conclusion.\n(6) Throughout the papers, I felt that many conclusions (e.g. difficulty and etc) are based on a particularly chosen training distribution. For example, how does an agent really know when the instance is any more difficult? Doesn't this really depend on the empirically learned distribution of training samples (i.e. P(m3 \" m1, m2), where mi indicates masses of object 1, 2, and 3)? In other words, does what's hard/easy matter much unless this is more thoroughly tested over various types of distributions?\n(7) Any baseline approach?"
