The framework combines recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with temporal point processes to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of user-item interactions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both item prediction and time prediction tasks.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in recommender systems, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed framework. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the limitations of existing methods and propose a novel solution that addresses these limitations. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including an examination of the sparsity of the datasets and the robustness of the algorithm.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the following: (1) provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, (2) consider adding more baselines for comparison, and (3) provide more insights into the interpretability of the learned latent features.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How did you select the hyperparameters for the RNN and the temporal point process models?
