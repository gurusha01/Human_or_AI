            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper introduces a novel method for domain transfer, which enables the transfer of samples from one domain to another while preserving the representation function. The proposed Domain Transfer Network (DTN) achieves impressive results in various applications, including digit and face image transfer. The DTN outperforms existing methods, including those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and style transfer, in terms of visual quality and identifiability.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the evaluation, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Well-motivated approach: The paper introduces a well-motivated approach to domain transfer, which addresses a significant problem in computer vision and machine learning. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, related work, and their proposed solution.\n2. Strong empirical results: The paper presents impressive empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DTN in various applications, including digit and face image transfer. The results show that the DTN outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and identifiability.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including a detailed description of the architecture, loss functions, and optimization procedure. The authors also provide a comprehensive evaluation of the DTN, including comparisons with existing methods and ablation studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTN in preserving the representation function and generating high-quality images in the target domain.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insight into the following aspects:\n* How does the DTN handle cases where the representation function is not effective in both domains?\n* Can the DTN be applied to other types of data, such as text or audio?\n* How does the choice of hyperparameters, such as Î±, Î², and Î³, affect the performance of the DTN?\nI would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:\n* Can you provide more details on the architecture of the DTN and how it differs from existing GAN-based methods?\n* How do you ensure that the DTN preserves the representation function in the target domain?\n* Can you provide more examples of applications where the DTN can be used, and how it can be extended to other domains?"
