The authors show that RNNs outperform conventional models, such as generalized linear models (GLMs), in predicting the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells to natural images.\nI decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a challenge in the field where standard receptive field models have struggled to explain responses to natural movies. Secondly, the paper supports its claims with rigorous empirical results, demonstrating the superiority of RNNs over GLMs in predicting neural spiking responses.\nThe authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, including the use of a multitask framework with shared parameters across neurons. The results show that RNNs consistently outperform GLMs, capturing around 80% of the explainable variance across experiments and cell types. The authors also investigate the benefits of the multitask framework and show that it leads to better and more stable predictions.\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider pruning and simplifying the trained RNN to identify critical components contributing to its performance. This would provide further insight into the workings of the RNN and help to address the \"black box\" nature of deep networks. Additionally, I would like clarification on the definition of a \"movie\" in the paper, specifically whether it refers to a sequence of unrelated images or actual dynamic natural scenes.\nI would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on the specific characteristics of the natural images used in the study, and how they relate to the performance of the RNNs? (2) How do you plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas, and what potential challenges do you anticipate?
