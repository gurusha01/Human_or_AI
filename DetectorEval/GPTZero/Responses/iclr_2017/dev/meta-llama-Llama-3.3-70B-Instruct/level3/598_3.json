The approach is evaluated on three ATARI games, demonstrating its ability to learn multiple tasks simultaneously without degradation in performance. The paper also introduces a new type of recurrent neural network, Residual Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN), which is well-suited for this task.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and novel approach to deep reinforcement learning, which has the potential to open new lines of research. The paper is well-written, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific question/problem in reinforcement learning, which is learning multiple tasks simultaneously. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods, such as Q-learning. The use of a model-based approach and the introduction of the RRNN are notable contributions. The experiments are well-designed, and the results demonstrate the potential of the approach.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training process, such as the learning schedule and the weights assigned to each iteration. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison to other multi-task learning approaches in reinforcement learning. The authors should also address the potential problem of the model \"forgetting\" which actions lead to a death, as mentioned in the discussion section.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How did you choose the hyperparameters for the RRNN, and what is the effect of changing these hyperparameters on the performance of the model?\n* Can you provide more details on the instability during training, and how you addressed this issue?\n* How do you plan to extend this approach to more complex environments, such as those with long-term dependencies?"
