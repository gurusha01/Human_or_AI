The authors claim that SAMDP can analyze trained policies by identifying temporal and spatial abstractions, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a gridworld problem and Atari2600 games.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the formalism of SAMDP lacks clear definition and theoretical rigor, relying on quasi-heuristic approaches and examples rather than precise explanations. Secondly, the experiments are simplistic, using 2D grid worlds, which are considered outdated and should be replaced with more realistic domains to demonstrate the model's effectiveness.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's lack of theoretical rigor is a significant concern, as it makes it difficult to understand the underlying principles of the SAMDP model. The authors rely heavily on examples and heuristics, which may not generalize to more complex problems. Furthermore, the experiments are limited to simple grid worlds and Atari2600 games, which may not be representative of real-world problems. The use of more realistic domains, such as robotic control or complex video games, would provide a more convincing demonstration of the model's effectiveness.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more rigorous definition of the SAMDP model, including a clear explanation of the underlying mathematical principles. Additionally, the authors should consider using more realistic domains to demonstrate the model's effectiveness. It would also be helpful to provide more detailed comparisons with existing models, such as SMDP and AMDP, to highlight the advantages of the SAMDP model.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like the authors to clarify the following points:\n1. Can you provide a more rigorous definition of the SAMDP model, including a clear explanation of the underlying mathematical principles?\n2. How do you plan to address the lack of theoretical rigor in the paper, and what steps will you take to provide a more precise explanation of the model?\n3. Can you provide more detailed comparisons with existing models, such as SMDP and AMDP, to highlight the advantages of the SAMDP model?\n4. How do you plan to extend the model to more complex problems, such as robotic control or complex video games, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?"
