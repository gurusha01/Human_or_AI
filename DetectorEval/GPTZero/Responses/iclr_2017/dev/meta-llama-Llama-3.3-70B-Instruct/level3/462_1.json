            "inputText": "This review is based on the provided key points and conference guidelines.\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the inductive bias of convolutional networks, specifically focusing on their ability to model correlations among regions of their input. The authors introduce the concept of separation rank, which measures how far a function is from being separable with respect to a given partition of its input. They analyze the separation rank of deep and shallow convolutional arithmetic circuits, showing that deep networks can support exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while shallow networks are limited to linear separation ranks.\nThe paper addresses the specific question of how convolutional networks model correlations among input regions, which is a crucial aspect of their inductive bias. The approach is well-motivated, as it builds upon existing work on the depth efficiency of neural networks and provides a new perspective on the role of pooling geometry in controlling the inductive bias.\nThe paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the separation rank of deep and shallow convolutional arithmetic circuits, including proofs and derivations of key results. They also present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in various tasks, including image classification and shape analysis.\nHowever, the paper could benefit from additional clarity and detail in certain sections, particularly in the presentation of the theoretical analysis. Some of the proofs and derivations are lengthy and technical, and may require careful reading to follow. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion of the implications of the results and their potential applications in practice.\nOverall, I would accept this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to understanding the inductive bias of convolutional networks. The paper provides a clear and detailed analysis of the separation rank of deep and shallow convolutional arithmetic circuits, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through empirical results.\nTo improve the paper, I would suggest the following:\n* Provide more detail and clarity in the presentation of the theoretical analysis, particularly in the proofs and derivations.\n* Discuss the implications of the results and their potential applications in practice.\n* Consider adding more empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in various tasks and domains.\n* Provide more context and background information on the related work, to help readers understand the significance and novelty of the approach.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:\n* Can you provide more intuition on why the separation rank is a useful measure of the inductive bias of convolutional networks?\n* How do the results on separation rank relate to other measures of inductive bias, such as depth efficiency?\n* Can you provide more details on the empirical results, including the specific tasks and datasets used, and the performance metrics used to evaluate the approach?\n* How do you envision the approach being used in practice, and what are the potential applications and benefits of understanding the inductive bias of convolutional networks?"
