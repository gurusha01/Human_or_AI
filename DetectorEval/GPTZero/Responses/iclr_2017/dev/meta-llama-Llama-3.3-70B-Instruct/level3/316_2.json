They also conduct experiments on the MNIST and SVHN datasets, demonstrating that their approach achieves state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs.\nBased on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:\n1. The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to protecting sensitive training data, which is a critical problem in machine learning.\n2. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the privacy guarantees of the approach, using established techniques from differential privacy.\nTo further improve the paper, I provide the following feedback:\n* The authors could consider additional experiments on sensitive data applications, such as medical histories, to demonstrate the approach's usefulness in real-world scenarios.\n* The authors could provide more details on the computational cost of their approach, particularly in terms of the number of teacher models required to achieve strong privacy guarantees.\n* The authors could explore the application of their approach to other machine learning tasks, such as natural language processing or recommender systems.\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n* Can the authors provide more intuition on why the noisy voting mechanism is effective in protecting sensitive training data?\n* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex machine learning models, such as deep neural networks or recurrent neural networks?\n* Can the authors provide more details on the trade-offs between the number of teacher models, the noise level, and the privacy guarantees of the approach?"
