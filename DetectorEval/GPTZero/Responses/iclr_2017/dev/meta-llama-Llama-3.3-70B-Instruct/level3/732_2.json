            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data in machine learning applications, called Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The authors claim that their approach can protect the privacy of sensitive training data while maintaining the accuracy of the model. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and SVHN, and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of privacy-utility trade-offs.\nDecision and Reasons\nBased on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to reject the paper. The main reason for this decision is that the paper's premise is flawed, as the original paragraph vectors paper can actually infer representations for text outside of the training data, rendering the current work's foundation invalid. Additionally, the paper's approach, although novel, is not well-motivated, and the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's approach is based on the idea of training an ensemble of teacher models on disjoint subsets of the sensitive data and then using a student model to learn from the aggregate output of the ensemble. However, the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why this approach is necessary or how it addresses the privacy concerns. Furthermore, the paper's evaluation is limited to a few benchmark datasets, and the authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the results or a comparison with existing methods.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of their approach and its motivations. They should also conduct a more thorough evaluation of their method, including a comparison with existing methods and an analysis of the results. Additionally, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of their approach, such as the need for a large number of teachers and the potential impact on the accuracy of the model.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of why the original paragraph vectors paper is not sufficient for inferring representations for text outside of the training data?\n2. How do you plan to address the limitations of your approach, such as the need for a large number of teachers and the potential impact on the accuracy of the model?\n3. Can you provide a more thorough evaluation of your method, including a comparison with existing methods and an analysis of the results?"
