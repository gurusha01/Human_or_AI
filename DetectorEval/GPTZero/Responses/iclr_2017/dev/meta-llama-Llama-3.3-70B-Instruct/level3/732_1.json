            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes two models, Generative Paragraph Vector (GPV) and Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector (SGPV), which are designed to learn distributed representations of texts. GPV is an unsupervised model that extends the Paragraph Vector model by introducing a complete generative process, allowing it to infer representations for unseen texts. SGPV is a supervised version of GPV that incorporates text labels into the model to guide representation learning. The paper claims that both models can achieve state-of-the-art results on text classification tasks.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's motivation is flawed due to an incorrect assumption about the Paragraph Vector's ability to work on unseen data. Secondly, the model presented lacks novelty, being a standard directed LDA-like bag of words/bigram model that doesn't offer anything new or innovative.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's motivation is based on the idea that Paragraph Vector cannot infer representations for unseen texts, which is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Paragraph Vector has limitations, the paper's proposed solution is not significantly different from existing models. Furthermore, the model presented is essentially a re-implementation of existing ideas, with no substantial contributions to the field. The paper's claims of state-of-the-art results are also not entirely convincing, given the lack of novelty in the model.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, the authors should revisit their motivation and provide a more accurate assessment of the limitations of Paragraph Vector. They should also consider adding more innovative elements to their model, such as new architectures or training methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more rigorous evaluations and comparisons to existing models. The authors should also address the numerous basic formatting and Bibtex citation issues that are present throughout the paper.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How do the authors respond to the criticism that their model is not significantly different from existing models?\n* Can the authors provide more detailed comparisons to existing models, including those that are not mentioned in the paper?\n* How do the authors plan to address the formatting and citation issues in the paper?"
