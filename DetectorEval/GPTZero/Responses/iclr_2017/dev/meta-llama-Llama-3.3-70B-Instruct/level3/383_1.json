The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and their approach is well-placed in the literature. The results are also well-supported by empirical evidence, including comparisons with existing models and analyses of the benefits of the multitask framework.\nAdditional Feedback and Suggestions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analyses of the computational features captured by the recurrent networks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more discussions on the potential applications of the proposed framework in other brain areas and its limitations. Some specific questions I would like the authors to address in their revision include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas?
