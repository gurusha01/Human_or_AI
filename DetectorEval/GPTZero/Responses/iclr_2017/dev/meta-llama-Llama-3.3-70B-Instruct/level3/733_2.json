            "inputText": "This review is based on the provided key points and conference guidelines.\nSummary of the paper's contribution:\nThe authors propose using an LSTM on a sequence of system calls for network intrusion detection. While this idea has been explored before, the authors aim to contribute to the state-of-the-art in NIDS. The paper also checks the portability of the proposed system.\nDecision:\nI decide to reject this paper.\nReasons for the decision:\nThe main reason for this decision is that the paper does not significantly add to the state-of-the-art in NIDS. The use of LSTMs for sequence problems is not particularly innovative, as many researchers have applied LSTMs to similar problems. Furthermore, the paper may be a better fit for a security conference rather than ICLR, given its focus on NIDS rather than representation learning.\nSupporting arguments:\nThe key points provided suggest that the paper's approach is not well-motivated, as it has been previously explored. Additionally, the paper's use of LSTMs is not innovative, which raises questions about the paper's contribution to the field. The fact that the paper checks portability is a positive aspect, but it is not enough to outweigh the lack of innovation and contribution to the state-of-the-art.\nAdditional feedback:\nTo improve the paper, the authors could consider exploring more innovative approaches to NIDS, such as using other types of neural networks or incorporating additional features. They could also provide more detailed comparisons to existing work in the field, to better demonstrate the paper's contribution. Furthermore, the authors could consider submitting the paper to a security conference, where it may be a better fit.\nQuestions for the authors:\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify how their approach differs from existing work in NIDS, and what specific contributions they believe their paper makes to the field. I would also like to know more about the experimental setup and results, to better understand the paper's claims. Additionally, I would like to ask the authors to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of using LSTMs for NIDS, and how they addressed these in their work."
