The authors also introduce a supervised version of GPV, called Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector (SGPV), which can incorporate text labels into the model to guide the representation learning. The experiments on five text classification benchmark datasets show that both GPV and SGPV can yield superior classification performance over the state-of-the-art counterparts.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear discussion on the restrictions and subspace where the proposed method is efficient, and instead claims that theoretical analysis is not needed in the deep learning era, which is a subjective claim that lacks clarification. Secondly, the experiments in the paper are insufficient, relying on simple baselines and lacking extensive experiments, particularly for missing data and applications beyond images.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper proposes a generative model for mixtures of basic local structures using tensor decomposition and hierarchical Tucker for inference, but its applicability is conditioned on the existence of decomposition. However, the authors fail to discuss the restrictions and subspace where their method is efficient, which is a crucial aspect of any machine learning model. Furthermore, the experiments in the paper are limited to simple baselines and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. The paper also lacks experiments beyond images, which is a significant limitation, as the authors claim their approach can be applied to other areas.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, the authors should provide a clear discussion on the restrictions and subspace where the proposed method is efficient, and clarify the limitations of their approach. Additionally, the authors should conduct more extensive experiments, including evaluations on missing data and applications beyond images. The authors should also provide more details on the implementation of their method, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* Can you provide more details on the restrictions and subspace where the proposed method is efficient?\n* How do you plan to address the issue of missing data in the proposed method?\n* Can you provide more extensive experiments, including evaluations on applications beyond images?\n* How do you choose the hyperparameters for the proposed method, and what is the optimization algorithm used?\n* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the supervised version of GPV, including the choice of loss function and the optimization algorithm used?"
