The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms traditional models, such as generalized linear models (GLMs), in predicting the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells to natural images. The use of a multitask framework, where features are shared across neurons, leads to better and more stable predictions, even with relatively small amounts of experimental data.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the impressive results achieved by the authors using deep neural networks to model sensory neurons. The paper presents a well-motivated approach, building on the strengths of both neuroscience and artificial neural networks.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, comparing it to traditional models and demonstrating its superiority in predicting neural spiking responses. The use of a multitask framework is a key innovation, allowing the model to leverage information across neurons and improve predictions. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the benefits of using deep neural networks, including their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships and temporal dynamics.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the deep neural networks. While the authors acknowledge the \"black box\" nature of these models, some additional analysis or visualization of the learned features and weights could help to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, it would be interesting to see the authors explore the application of their approach to other brain areas or sensory modalities.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the specific types of nonlinear relationships that the deep neural networks are capturing, and how these differ from the traditional models?\n2. How do you plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?\n3. Can you provide more insight into the computational resources required to train and deploy these models, and how this might impact their applicability in real-world settings?"
