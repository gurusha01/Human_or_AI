The authors introduce the \"AutoSegCriterion\" (ASG), which is a simpler and faster alternative to the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion. The ASG criterion is used to train the CNN to output letter scores, and a beam-search decoder is used to generate the final transcription. The authors demonstrate competitive results on the LibriSpeech corpus, with word error rates (WERs) of 7.2% for MFCC features, 9.4% for power spectrum features, and 10.1% for raw speech features.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the proposed approach is novel, well-motivated, and demonstrates competitive results on a benchmark dataset. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method, and the experimental results are well-presented and easy to follow.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles an important problem in speech recognition, and the proposed approach is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a thorough review of existing methods and clearly explain the limitations of current approaches. The introduction of the ASG criterion is a significant contribution, as it provides a simpler and faster alternative to CTC. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the effect of the hyperparameters on the results, particularly the impact of the ASG criterion on the decoding process. Additionally, the authors could provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, such as recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches. It would also be helpful to include more details on the implementation of the ASG criterion and the beam-search decoder.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the ASG criterion, particularly the calculation of the transition scores and the normalization process?\n2. How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to larger vocabularies and more complex speech recognition tasks?\n3. Can you provide more analysis on the effect of the hyperparameters on the results, particularly the impact of the ASG criterion on the decoding process?"
