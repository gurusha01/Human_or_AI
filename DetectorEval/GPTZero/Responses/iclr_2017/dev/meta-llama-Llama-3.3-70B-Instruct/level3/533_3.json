The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMDP model in a gridworld problem and three Atari games, showing that it can identify skills and provide insights into the policy hierarchy.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the proposed types of intrinsic motivation are not novel, with similar concepts already existing in previous works such as Kompella et al 2012. Secondly, the paper's claimed superiority over VIME is questionable, as the gain attributed to faster initialization rather than per-step cost, making the comparison to VIME less convincing.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper explores intrinsic motivation in deep RL, proposing variants derived from auxiliary model-learning processes to aid exploration in continuous control tasks and Atari games. However, the idea of seeking uncertain states has potential, but is limited, and the authors are encouraged to discuss its limitations and explore alternative forms of learning progress or surprise. Furthermore, the paper's evaluation criteria, such as Value Mean Square Error (VMSE) and Inertia, are not thoroughly justified, and the authors should provide more rigorous analysis to support their claims.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo improve the paper, the authors should provide more detailed comparisons with existing works, such as Kompella et al 2012, and discuss the limitations of their approach.
