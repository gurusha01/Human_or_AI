The paper reports that training the RNN model takes 8-10 days on 10 GPUs, which is prohibitively long for most applications, especially for relatively small datasets.\nSupporting Arguments\nWhile the paper presents promising results, the computational cost of the method is a major concern. The authors do not provide a clear justification for the choice of 10 GPUs or the training time, and it is unclear whether the model can be trained on a single GPU or with a smaller number of GPUs. Furthermore, the paper does not demonstrate the scalability of the method to larger images or more complex datasets, which is a crucial aspect of any machine learning model.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct an experiment on the Caltech-101 dataset to demonstrate the method's ability to discover a competitive architecture in a low-data regime. This would help to alleviate concerns about the scalability of the method and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Additionally, I recommend mentioning ResNets in the table for completeness, as they are a relevant baseline for image classification tasks.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can the RNN model be trained on a single GPU or with a smaller number of GPUs, and if so, what is the expected training time?\n2. How does the method perform on larger images or more complex datasets, such as ImageNet or CIFAR-10?\n3. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, units, and training epochs?"
