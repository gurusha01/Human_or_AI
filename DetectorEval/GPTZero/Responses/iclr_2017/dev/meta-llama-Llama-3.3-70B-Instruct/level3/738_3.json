The authors demonstrate that this framework can accurately predict the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells to natural images, outperforming traditional generalized linear models (GLMs). The use of shared parameters across neurons in a multitask framework leads to better and more stable predictions, even with relatively small amounts of experimental data.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach of using a multitask RNN framework to model sensory neurons is well-motivated and offers a new perspective on improving efficiency. Secondly, the paper provides strong empirical evidence to support the claims, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting neural spiking responses.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific question of developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons, which is a crucial problem in understanding sensory processing and brain computations. The authors' approach is well-placed in the literature, building on previous work on deep neural networks and their application to neuroscience. The results presented in the paper are correct and scientifically rigorous, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional GLMs.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the RNN models, which is currently a black box. Additionally, it would be helpful to explore the application of this approach to other brain areas and to investigate the potential of using this framework for retinal prosthetics research. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of interpretability of the RNN models? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the potential applications of this approach to other brain areas? (3) How do the authors envision the use of this framework in retinal prosthetics research?"
