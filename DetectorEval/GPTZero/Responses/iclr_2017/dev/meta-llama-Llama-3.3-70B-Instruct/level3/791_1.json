The authors claim that their method is effective for initializing neural networks for supervised training on several datasets.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's experimental results are misleading due to unfair comparisons, particularly with exemplar convnets, which may achieve similar improvements with fine-tuning. Secondly, the method's usefulness may be limited to natural images where patches from the same image can be similar, and further comparison with other methods like \"What-where\" autoencoder in large-scale settings is needed.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's approach is well-motivated, and the idea of using patch contrasting for visual representation learning is reasonable, particularly for high-level features showing translation invariance.
