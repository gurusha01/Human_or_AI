            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper presents a novel approach to analyzing trained policies in Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The SAMDP model combines the advantages of temporal and spatial abstractions, allowing for a more concise and interpretable representation of the policy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMDP model on various Atari 2600 games and a gridworld problem, showing that it can identify skills and provide insights into the policy's behavior.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nI decide to accept this paper, with the key reasons being the novelty and potential impact of the SAMDP model, as well as the thorough evaluation and analysis of the model on various tasks. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to addressing the challenges of analyzing trained policies in RL, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMDP model in identifying skills and providing insights into the policy's behavior.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the SAMDP model, including a clear explanation of the challenges of analyzing trained policies in RL. The authors also provide a detailed description of the SAMDP model and its components, including the feature selection, state aggregation, skill identification, inference, and model selection stages. The evaluation of the SAMDP model on various tasks, including Atari 2600 games and a gridworld problem, demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying skills and providing insights into the policy's behavior.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the SAMDP model and its scalability to larger tasks. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of the SAMDP model with other approaches to analyzing trained policies in RL, such as those using graph-based methods or attention mechanisms. I also have some questions regarding the implementation of the SAMDP model, such as how the authors handle cases where the policy is not nearly deterministic, and how they choose the hyperparameters for the clustering algorithm. Furthermore, I would like to see more discussion on the potential applications of the SAMDP model, such as in robotics or autonomous driving, and how it can be used to improve the robustness and interpretability of RL policies. \nSome specific questions I would like the authors to answer are: \n1. How do you handle cases where the policy is not nearly deterministic, and how do you ensure that the SAMDP model is robust to such cases?\n2. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the SAMDP model and its scalability to larger tasks?\n3. How do you choose the hyperparameters for the clustering algorithm, and what is the sensitivity of the SAMDP model to these hyperparameters?\n4. Can you provide more discussion on the potential applications of the SAMDP model, such as in robotics or autonomous driving, and how it can be used to improve the robustness and interpretability of RL policies?"
