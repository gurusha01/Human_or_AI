The authors motivate the need for interpretable neural networks and explain how the ISAN model addresses this need. The experimental results demonstrate that the ISAN model achieves comparable performance to traditional RNNs on the language modeling task, while being more efficient and interpretable.

Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations and examples to illustrate the interpretability of the ISAN model. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How does the ISAN model handle out-of-vocabulary words or characters? (2) Can the ISAN model be applied to other tasks beyond language modeling? (3) How does the computational efficiency of the ISAN model compare to traditional RNNs in practice?"
