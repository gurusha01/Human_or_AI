            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems (IDS) using a system-call language modeling technique. The authors employ a neural language model, specifically a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to learn the semantic meaning and interactions of system calls. To reduce false alarm rates, they introduce an ensemble method that combines multiple thresholding classifiers. The proposed system is evaluated on public benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and high portability.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in computer security, and the proposed approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature; (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their system.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of intrusion detection and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors motivate their approach by highlighting the importance of capturing the semantic meaning and interactions of system calls. The proposed system-call language model is well-designed, and the use of LSTM networks is justified. The ensemble method is innovative and simple, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing false alarm rates. The experimental results are thorough, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their system, including the specific hyperparameters used for the LSTM network and the ensemble method. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned representations, such as the 2D projection of the calls using the embedding matrix. The authors may also consider discussing the potential applications of their approach to other areas, such as network intrusion detection or malware detection.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the specific hyperparameters used for the LSTM network and the ensemble method?\n2. How do you plan to extend your approach to detect more complex attacks, such as mimicry attacks?\n3. Can you discuss the potential limitations of your approach, such as the requirement for large amounts of training data or the potential for overfitting?"
