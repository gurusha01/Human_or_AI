The authors frame the problem of structure discovery as a learning problem, where a function is learned to map empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. This approach allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and flexibility in modeling different types of graphs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including genetics and neuroimaging data.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper.\nReasons\nThe paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of graphical models, and the approach proposed is well-motivated and novel. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their method, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in various settings. The paper is well-written, and the authors have done a good job of situating their work in the context of existing research.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper addresses the three key questions posed by the conference guidelines. Firstly, the specific question/problem tackled by the paper is clearly defined, and the authors provide a thorough motivation for their approach. Secondly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with the authors providing a clear explanation of how their method differs from existing approaches. Thirdly, the paper provides extensive experimental results to support the claims made, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various datasets.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational efficiency of their approach, particularly in comparison to existing methods. Additionally, it would be useful to see more analysis on the robustness of the learned estimator to different types of noise or perturbations in the data. Finally, the authors may want to consider providing more discussion on the potential applications of their approach in different domains.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on how the learned estimator is robust to different types of noise or perturbations in the data?\n2. How does the computational efficiency of your approach compare to existing methods, particularly in terms of scalability to large datasets?\n3. Are there any potential applications of your approach in domains beyond genetics and neuroimaging, and if so, how do you envision the approach being adapted for these domains?"
