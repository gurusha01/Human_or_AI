The experimental results are impressive, with HORNNs outperforming regular RNNs and LSTMs on both PTB and text8 sets.\nAdditional feedback to improve the paper includes providing more details on the computational complexity of HORNNs and comparing it with other models. The authors could also explore the use of HORNNs for other sequential modeling tasks, such as speech recognition and sequence-to-sequence modeling. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the effect of different pooling functions on the performance of HORNNs.\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the HORNN structure to other sequential modeling tasks?
