            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel model-based approach to deep reinforcement learning, which tackles the problem of multi-task learning in complex environments such as ATARI games. The authors propose a Predictive Reinforcement Learning (PRL) framework, which separates the understanding of the environment from the strategy, allowing the model to learn from different strategies simultaneously. The approach is based on a recurrent neural network architecture, specifically a Residual Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN), which decouples memory from computation.\nThe paper claims to achieve state-of-the-art results in multi-task learning, surpassing human performance in three different ATARI games simultaneously. The authors also demonstrate that their approach can benefit from learning multiple tasks, with no degradation in performance.\nI decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and novel approach to deep reinforcement learning, which tackles a significant problem in the field. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and results.\nThe supporting arguments for this decision are:\n* The paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches, specifically Q-learning, which is widely used in reinforcement learning.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of Q-learning and demonstrate how their approach can overcome these limitations.\n* The experimental results are impressive, with the model achieving state-of-the-art results in multi-task learning.\nHowever, I do have some additional feedback to help improve the paper:\n* The authors could provide more details on the training process, specifically the learning schedule and the hyperparameters used.\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, specifically the comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n* The authors mention that the model can potentially play a very different strategy from the one it has observed, but this could be explored further in future work.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:\n* Can the authors provide more details on the RRNN architecture and how it is implemented?\n* How do the authors plan to address the instability during training, which is mentioned as a potential problem?\n* Can the authors provide more insights into the transfer learning that occurs when learning multiple tasks simultaneously?"
