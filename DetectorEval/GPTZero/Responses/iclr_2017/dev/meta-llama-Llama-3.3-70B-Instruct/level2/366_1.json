The authors address the challenges of applying AEVB to topic models, specifically the Dirichlet prior and component collapsing, and propose a Laplace approximation to the Dirichlet prior and a modified variational objective function. The paper also introduces a new topic model, ProdLDA, which replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts, and demonstrates its effectiveness in achieving better topic coherence.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the following key reasons:\n1. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of topic modeling by proposing a novel AEVB inference method, AVITM, which addresses the challenges of applying AEVB to topic models.\n2. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of AVITM in achieving better topic coherence and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, and introduces a new topic model, ProdLDA, which achieves significantly better topics than LDA.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of topic modeling and the challenges of applying AEVB to topic models. The authors propose a novel solution, AVITM, which addresses the Dirichlet prior and component collapsing challenges, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on several datasets. The paper also introduces a new topic model, ProdLDA, which achieves significantly better topics than LDA, and provides a detailed analysis of the results.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the network architecture used for the inference network, and consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the method to different hyperparameters and datasets. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more insights into the interpretability of the topics learned by ProdLDA, and exploring the potential applications of the method to other domains.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the network architecture used for the inference network, and how it was designed?\n2. How did you choose the hyperparameters for the Laplace approximation to the Dirichlet prior, and how sensitive is the method to these hyperparameters?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the interpretability of the topics learned by ProdLDA, and how they compare to those learned by traditional topic models?"
