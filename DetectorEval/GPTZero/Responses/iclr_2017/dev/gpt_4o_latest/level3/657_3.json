            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper addresses the challenge of producing compact text classification models that maintain high accuracy while drastically reducing memory usage. The authors propose a method built on Product Quantization (PQ) to compress word embeddings and classifier matrices, combined with aggressive dictionary pruning techniques. The approach achieves memory reductions of 100-1000x compared to the original FastText model, with minimal accuracy loss. Key contributions include a PQ variant for unnormalized vectors, dictionary pruning framed as a set-covering problem solved via a greedy algorithm, and the use of hashing tricks and Bloom filters to optimize memory further. The techniques are generic and applicable beyond this specific use case, making them broadly relevant to the field. The authors also provide empirical results on datasets with varying class sizes, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method. The promise to release code as part of the FastText library adds value by enabling reproducibility and practical adoption.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its strong empirical results, practical contributions, and relevance to the community. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Practical Impact: The proposed techniques significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining classification accuracy, addressing a critical bottleneck in deploying NLP models on resource-constrained devices.\n2. Generality: The methods are not limited to FastText and can be applied to other text classification models, broadening their applicability.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating consistent memory savings with minimal accuracy degradation. The comparisons with other compression techniques (e.g., LSH) are thorough and highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.\n2. Relevance and Placement in Literature: The paper builds on well-established methods like PQ and hashing, situating itself well within the existing body of work. While it does not propose novel classification methods, its focus on adapting and improving existing techniques for compression is valuable.\n3. Reproducibility: The authors' commitment to releasing code ensures that the work can serve as a benchmark for future research in model compression.\nSuggestions for Improvement\nWhile the paper is solid overall, there are areas where clarity and depth could be improved:\n1. Model Size Computation: The paper lacks clarity on how the full model size is computed and the specific size bottlenecks for different applications. Providing a more detailed breakdown of memory usage across components would enhance transparency.\n2. Underexplained Techniques: The greedy dictionary pruning approach and the binary search overhead for the hashing trick are underexplained. A more detailed explanation or pseudocode would help readers understand these methods better.\n3. Comparative Analysis: While the paper evaluates PQ against LSH, it would benefit from a broader comparison with other recent compression methods, such as knowledge distillation or pruning techniques used in neural networks.\n4. Extreme Compression Scenarios: The results for extremely compressed models (e.g., under 64KiB) are promising but could be elaborated further. For instance, discussing the trade-offs between extreme pruning and coverage loss in more detail would provide deeper insights.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How is the full model size computed, and what are the primary contributors to memory usage in different applications (e.g., embeddings vs. classifier matrices)?\n2. Could you provide more details on the greedy dictionary pruning algorithm, particularly how it balances coverage and feature importance?\n3. Have you considered combining PQ with other compression techniques, such as knowledge distillation, to achieve even greater memory savings?\n4. How does the proposed approach perform on datasets with highly imbalanced class distributions or very rare labels?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of efficient NLP model design, particularly for resource-constrained environments. While there are areas where clarity could be improved, the overall quality, practical impact, and reproducibility of the work justify its acceptance."
