            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces the Input-Switched Affine Network (ISAN), a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that eschews nonlinearity in favor of input-dependent affine transformations. The authors argue that this design enhances interpretability while maintaining competitive performance with traditional RNN architectures, such as GRUs and LSTMs, on character-level language modeling tasks. The paper demonstrates the model's ability to decompose predictions into contributions from past inputs, offering insights into its decision-making process. Additionally, the authors highlight computational advantages, such as sparse parameter access and the ability to precompute affine transformations for sequences. The paper is well-written, provides compelling visualizations, and makes a strong case for the educational utility of the ISAN due to its simplicity and interpretability.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper presents an interesting and interpretable RNN variant, it falls short in terms of empirical rigor and broader applicability. The primary reasons for rejection are:\n1. Limited Evaluation Scope: The model is only tested on a small 10M-character dataset (Text8) and does not demonstrate competitive performance on larger or more complex datasets. The reported perplexity (2135) is far from state-of-the-art, raising concerns about the model's practical utility.\n2. Performance Caveats: The ISAN underperforms significantly compared to GRUs for smaller model sizes (22%-39% worse in perplexity per word), and its competitive performance is only observed for the largest models, limiting its generalizability.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Limited Dataset and Generalization: The evaluation on a single, relatively small dataset does not provide sufficient evidence that the ISAN can generalize to real-world, large-scale language modeling tasks. The lack of experiments on datasets with larger vocabularies or diverse structures is a significant limitation.\n2. Performance Trade-offs: While the ISAN achieves interpretability, its predictive accuracy is subpar for smaller models and non-competitive with state-of-the-art methods. This trade-off between interpretability and performance is not convincingly justified for practical applications.\n3. Unproven Scalability: The paper claims computational benefits, but these are theoretical and not demonstrated in practice. The potential for speedups through precomputing affine transformations is intriguing but requires empirical validation.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Broader Evaluation: Test the ISAN on larger and more diverse datasets, such as Penn Treebank or WikiText-103, to assess its scalability and generalizability. Include comparisons with state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks.\n2. Performance Analysis: Provide a more detailed analysis of why the ISAN underperforms for smaller models and explore strategies to mitigate this issue. For example, could hybrid architectures combining ISAN with nonlinear components improve performance without sacrificing interpretability?\n3. Empirical Validation of Computational Benefits: Demonstrate the claimed computational advantages (e.g., sparse parameter access, precomputing affine transformations) with real-world benchmarks and runtime comparisons.\n4. Expanded Use Cases: Explore applications beyond language modeling, such as time-series forecasting or other sequence tasks, to showcase the model's versatility.\n5. Visualization Enhancements: While the visualizations are compelling, they could be expanded to include comparisons with nonlinear RNNs to better illustrate the interpretability advantages of the ISAN.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the ISAN perform on larger datasets or tasks with more complex dependencies, such as word-level language modeling or machine translation?\n2. Can the ISAN be extended to handle continuous-valued inputs, and how would this impact its interpretability and performance?\n3. Have you conducted any experiments to empirically validate the claimed computational benefits, such as precomputing affine transformations or sparse parameter access?\nIn conclusion, while the ISAN is an interesting contribution to interpretable RNN research, its limited evaluation and performance trade-offs make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Addressing the above concerns could significantly strengthen the paper."
