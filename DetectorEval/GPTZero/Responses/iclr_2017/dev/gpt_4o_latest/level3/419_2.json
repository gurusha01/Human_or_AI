            "inputText": "The paper introduces TopicRNN, a novel language model that integrates the strengths of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to capture both local syntactic dependencies and global semantic coherence in text. The authors propose a switching mechanism to incorporate latent topics into the word generation process, enabling TopicRNN to model long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional RNNs. The model is trained end-to-end, eliminating the need for pre-trained topic features, and demonstrates competitive performance on two tasks: word prediction on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset and sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea and shows promise, several critical issues need to be addressed before it can be accepted. The lack of clarity in methodology, incomplete comparisons, and concerns about scalability and interpretability significantly weaken the paper's contributions.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Clarity of Methodology: The paper does not sufficiently explain how LDA features are integrated into the RNN, particularly in Table 2. This is a critical aspect of the model, and its omission makes it difficult to fully understand the proposed approach.\n2. Incomplete Baseline Comparisons: The experiments lack comparisons with LSTM-based models, which are widely regarded as state-of-the-art for language modeling. Without this, it is unclear how much of the performance gain is attributable to the latent topic integration versus the choice of architecture.\n3. Scalability Concerns: The scalability of TopicRNN for large vocabulary sizes (>10K) is not addressed. This is a significant limitation, as real-world applications often involve much larger vocabularies.\n4. Interpretability of Results: The generated text in Table 3 is unclear and lacks explanation regarding its relevance to specific topics. This undermines the claim that TopicRNN produces \"sensible topics.\"\nAdditional Feedback for Improvement:\n1. Comparative Analysis with LSTM: Include results from LSTM models to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of TopicRNN's performance. This would help quantify the gap closed by incorporating latent topics.\n2. Explain Generated Text: Clarify the relevance of the generated text to specific topics and provide qualitative analysis to demonstrate the model's ability to capture semantic coherence.\n3. Scalability Experiments: Conduct experiments with larger vocabularies to evaluate the model's scalability and computational efficiency.\n4. Direct Feature Comparison: Provide classification accuracy on IMDB using extracted features directly, to allow fair comparison with baseline methods.\n5. Dynamic Stop Word Handling: The paper mentions plans to dynamically discover stop words during training. Including preliminary results on this would strengthen the contribution.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How exactly are LDA features incorporated into the RNN architecture? Can you provide a more detailed explanation or diagram?\n2. Why were LSTM-based comparisons omitted, given their prominence in language modeling tasks?\n3. How does TopicRNN handle scalability issues with larger vocabularies, and what are its computational trade-offs compared to standard RNNs?\n4. Can you provide additional examples of generated text and explain their alignment with the inferred topics?\nIn summary, while TopicRNN is a promising approach, the paper requires significant improvements in clarity, experimental rigor, and scalability analysis before it can be considered for acceptance."
