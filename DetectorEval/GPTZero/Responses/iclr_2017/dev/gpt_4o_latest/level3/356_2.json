            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to program synthesis, addressing key challenges in the field by introducing a Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis (NSPS) technique. The proposed method combines a generative model for tree-structured programs with an input/output (I/O) pair encoder to condition program generation. The Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN) is a core innovation, enabling incremental program construction by encoding and expanding partial program trees. The model is applied to a domain-specific language (DSL) inspired by FlashFill, achieving promising results on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks. Notably, the system demonstrates the ability to synthesize unseen programs during testing, achieving 63% accuracy on novel tasks and solving 38% of FlashFill benchmarks.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a strong case for acceptance due to its novel contributions, rigorous experimental evaluation, and practical relevance. The introduction of the R3NN model and its application to tree-structured program generation represents a significant advancement in the field. The results, particularly on unseen tasks and real-world benchmarks, demonstrate the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Additionally, the paper is well-written, with a clear exposition of the methodology and comprehensive experiments.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a unique combination of neural architectures for program synthesis, addressing limitations of prior approaches such as computational inefficiency, task-specific training, and lack of interpretability. The R3NN model and cross-correlation I/O encoder are innovative and well-motivated.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The evaluation is thorough, covering both synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks. The comparison with simpler models (e.g., io2seq) highlights the advantages of the proposed approach. The analysis of sampling effects and input-output example variations further strengthens the results.\n3. Practical Relevance: The application to FlashFill DSL demonstrates the model's utility in real-world scenarios, particularly for string transformation tasks. The ability to solve 82.7% of FlashFill benchmarks requiring programs of size â ¤13 is impressive.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Clarification on Rule-Based Strategy: The paper briefly mentions a \"rule-based strategy\" for generating well-formed input strings but does not elaborate on its impact on the model's performance. A detailed analysis of how this strategy influences training and generalization would be beneficial.\n2. Explanation of Backtracking Search: The concept of \"backtracking search\" is mentioned but not adequately explained. Clarifying its role in generating latent functions and its interaction with the R3NN model would enhance understanding.\n3. Log-Probability Reporting: Reporting the log-probability of the latent function as the sample size increases could simplify the accuracy description and provide a more intuitive understanding of the model's confidence.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does the rule-based strategy for generating input strings affect the diversity and quality of the training data? Could this introduce biases that impact generalization to real-world benchmarks?\n2. Could you provide more details on the backtracking search process and its relationship with the R3NN model? Is it used during training, inference, or both?\n3. How does the model handle cases where multiple programs are consistent with the given I/O examples? Are there any heuristics or mechanisms to prioritize simpler or more interpretable programs?\nOverall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of program synthesis, and the suggested clarifications would further strengthen its impact."
