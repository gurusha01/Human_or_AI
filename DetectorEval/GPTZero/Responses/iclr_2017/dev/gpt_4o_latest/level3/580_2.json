            "inputText": "Review of \"Input-Switched Affine Network for Character-Level Language Modeling\"\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper introduces the Input-Switched Affine Network (ISAN), a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed for character-level language modeling. ISAN replaces traditional nonlinear activation functions with input-dependent switching of transition matrices and biases, resulting in a purely affine model. This design prioritizes intelligibility by enabling linear decomposition of contributions from past inputs, facilitating interpretability and analysis using linear algebra. The authors demonstrate that ISAN achieves comparable performance to standard RNN architectures like LSTMs and GRUs on the Text8 dataset, while offering potential computational advantages. The paper also provides detailed analyses of ISAN's behavior, including decomposition of predictions, word-level aggregation, and subspace projections, showcasing its interpretability.\nRecommendation: Accept\nI recommend accepting this paper for its originality, strong execution, and potential to inspire future research. The proposed ISAN architecture is a novel contribution to the field of interpretable machine learning, and the paper is well-written, with rigorous experiments and thoughtful analyses. While the evaluation is limited to a small dataset and the applicability of the model is restricted to character-level tasks, the work offers valuable insights into designing interpretable RNNs and opens avenues for further exploration.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Originality and Motivation: The ISAN architecture is a unique and innovative approach to RNN design, addressing the critical challenge of interpretability without sacrificing performance. The motivation to leverage linear algebra for network analysis is well-articulated and aligns with the broader goal of intelligible AI.\n2. Quality and Execution: The paper is methodologically sound, with clear definitions, thorough experiments, and detailed analyses. Section 4.5 on projecting into readout and computational subspaces is particularly insightful, demonstrating how ISAN's design facilitates novel interpretative techniques.\n3. Potential Impact: ISAN's simplicity and interpretability make it a promising candidate for applications where understanding model behavior is crucial. The computational benefits outlined in Section 6.2 further enhance its appeal.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Evaluation on Larger Datasets: The paper's evaluation is limited to the Text8 dataset, which raises concerns about ISAN's scalability and generalizability to larger, more complex tasks. Future work should include experiments on larger datasets or tasks with larger vocabularies.\n2. Restricted Applicability: ISAN is currently limited to character-level language modeling with small vocabularies. Extending the model to word-level tasks or continuous inputs would significantly broaden its applicability.\n3. Analysis Limitations: While the analyses are interesting, they lack concrete insights into the learned network dynamics. For example, the metric \\(\\kappa_s^t\\) introduced in Section 4.2-4.3 and Figure 2 is not convincingly linked to meaningful interpretability. Clarifying its significance would strengthen the paper.\n4. Generality of Findings: It is unclear whether the insights from ISAN's analysis generalize to other RNN architectures. A comparative analysis of interpretability across architectures would be valuable.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does ISAN's performance scale with larger datasets or tasks involving larger vocabularies? Have you considered testing it on datasets like WikiText-103 or word-level tasks?\n2. Can you provide more evidence or examples to demonstrate the interpretability of the metric \\(\\kappa_s^t\\) and its practical utility?\n3. How do the computational benefits of ISAN (e.g., precomputing affine transformations) translate to real-world scenarios with large-scale data and complex inputs?\n4. Could the insights from ISAN's analysis (e.g., decomposition of contributions) be applied to standard nonlinear RNNs, or are they specific to ISAN's architecture?\nIn summary, this paper presents a compelling and original contribution to interpretable RNN design. Addressing the limitations and extending the scope of evaluation would further strengthen its impact."
