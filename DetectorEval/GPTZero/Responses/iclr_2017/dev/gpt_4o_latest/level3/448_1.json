            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper presents a theoretical framework using mean-field theory to analyze the behavior of untrained, randomly initialized neural networks. The authors identify depth scales that limit signal propagation and establish a connection between these scales and the trainability of deep networks. A key finding is that networks initialized near the \"edge of chaos\" can propagate information more effectively, enabling training of arbitrarily deep networks. The paper also extends the analysis to include dropout, showing that even small dropout rates destroy the critical point, limiting trainable depth. Additionally, the authors develop a mean-field model for backpropagation, linking the ordered and chaotic phases to vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively. Empirical results on MNIST and CIFAR10 support the theoretical claims, demonstrating that trainability is governed by the depth scales derived from the framework.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to understanding the theoretical underpinnings of neural network trainability, particularly through its novel use of mean-field theory to predict depth scales and its exploration of the \"edge of chaos\" phenomenon. While some points require clarification, the theoretical insights and their empirical validation make this work a valuable addition to the field.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper builds on prior work (e.g., Poole et al., 2016; Glorot & Bengio, 2010) by introducing depth scales as a predictive tool for trainability. The extension to dropout and the formalization of the connection between forward signal propagation and backpropagation gradients are particularly impactful.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 convincingly demonstrate the relationship between depth scales and trainability, supporting the theoretical claims. The results are dataset-independent, highlighting the universality of the proposed framework.\n3. Clarity of Results: The paper provides clear mathematical derivations and empirical evidence, making the findings accessible to the broader machine learning community.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarification of Terminology: The use of \"evolution\" to describe \\(x{i;a}\\) is misleading, as \\(x{*;a}\\) is immutable. The authors should revise this terminology to avoid confusion, especially since \\(z\\) and \\(y\\) represent the actual evolution.\n2. Definition of \"Training Algorithm\": The paper suggests that perturbations during training enable information flow but does not clearly define what is meant by \"training algorithm.\" A more precise definition or examples would strengthen this point.\n3. Dropout Analysis: While the impact of dropout on criticality is well-explained, the practical implications for training with dropout could be expanded. For instance, how might one mitigate the limitations imposed by dropout while maintaining its regularization benefits?\n4. Connection to Prior Work: The paper references prior work on initialization schemes (e.g., Glorot & Bengio, 2010) but could provide a more detailed comparison to highlight the novelty of its contributions.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide additional intuition or examples for the term \"training algorithm\" and how it relates to perturbations that enable information flow?\n2. How does the proposed framework generalize to architectures beyond fully connected networks, such as convolutional or recurrent networks?\n3. The analysis assumes bounded activation functions like \\(\\tanh\\). How might the framework be extended to unbounded activations like ReLU, where fixed points may not exist?\n4. Could the depth-scale predictions be used to inform practical initialization schemes or pre-training strategies for specific architectures?\nConclusion\nThis paper provides a rigorous theoretical framework with practical implications for understanding and improving the trainability of deep neural networks. While some areas require clarification, the contributions are substantial and well-supported, warranting acceptance. The insights into depth scales, criticality, and the effects of dropout are likely to inspire further research and inform neural network design."
