            "inputText": "Review\nThe paper presents a novel application of nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to natural stimuli, outperforming conventional linear-nonlinear (LN) and generalized linear models (GLMs). This work is a significant contribution to the field of computational neuroscience, as it addresses the challenge of capturing the complex nonlinear response properties of RGCs, particularly their transient responses, which are poorly modeled by traditional approaches. The authors also introduce a GLM-RNN hybrid model, which provides insights into the temporal and spatial nonlinearities that contribute to the improved performance of RNNs. The study demonstrates that RNNs can achieve high predictive accuracy with relatively small amounts of experimental data, making this approach feasible for typical neuroscience datasets.\nDecision: Accept\nThe decision to accept this paper is based on two key reasons. First, the paper tackles a well-defined and important problem: improving the predictive modeling of sensory neurons, particularly in response to natural stimuli. The use of RNNs is well-motivated, leveraging their capacity to capture complex temporal and spatial dynamics. Second, the results are scientifically rigorous and strongly support the claims made. The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline models, provide detailed analyses of the RNN's contributions, and validate their findings across multiple datasets.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Impact: The use of multitask RNNs to model RGC responses is a novel approach that advances the state of the art in computational modeling of sensory neurons. The study has implications for both basic neuroscience and applied fields, such as retinal prosthetics.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The methods are well-documented, and the results are robust across different experimental conditions and datasets. The authors also address potential concerns about data limitations and demonstrate that their approach works well with modest training data.\n3. Interpretability: While RNNs are inherently black-box models, the authors make efforts to interpret their results, such as by analyzing the contributions of spatial and temporal nonlinearities and introducing a hybrid model.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Terminology Clarification: The use of the term \"movie\" and its association with the stated frame rate (likely the monitor's refresh rate) is somewhat confusing. The authors should clarify this to avoid ambiguity.\n2. Dynamic Stimuli: The study uses unrelated image sequences as stimuli. It would be valuable to explore whether the RNN's performance improves further with dynamic natural scenes, such as real movies, which may better mimic natural visual input.\n3. Model Interpretability: While the authors acknowledge the black-box nature of RNNs, further efforts to identify critical components or mechanisms within the network would enhance the paper's impact. For example, visualizing the learned temporal dynamics or exploring feature importance could provide additional insights.\n4. Generalization to Other Sensory Areas: The authors suggest that their approach could be extended to higher sensory areas. Including preliminary results or a discussion of potential challenges in applying this method to other brain regions would strengthen the paper.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on how the \"naturalistic movie stimulus\" was constructed and why unrelated image sequences were chosen over dynamic natural scenes?\n2. How does the performance of the RNN compare to simpler models (e.g., GLM-RNN hybrid) when tested on dynamic stimuli? \n3. Could you elaborate on the specific challenges or limitations encountered when interpreting the internal dynamics of the RNN?\n4. How sensitive is the RNN's performance to the choice of hyperparameters or network architecture? Would a simpler architecture achieve comparable results?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance, with minor revisions to address the points raised above."
