            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel metric learning framework for constructing invariant geometric functions of planar curves under Euclidean and Similarity transformations. The authors leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a Siamese configuration to approximate these invariants, demonstrating superior numerical robustness compared to traditional axiomatic approaches. The proposed framework also introduces a multi-scale representation paradigm, which is shown to be effective in handling noise, sampling irregularities, and occlusion. The paper bridges the gap between numerical differential geometry and deep learning, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional handcrafted geometric pipelines. The experimental results validate the robustness and stability of the proposed method, particularly under challenging conditions such as high noise and low sampling density.\nDecision: Accept\nKey Reasons:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper presents an innovative approach to a classical problem in numerical differential geometry by integrating deep learning techniques, which is a timely and impactful contribution.\n2. Empirical Validation: The results convincingly demonstrate the robustness and stability of the learned invariants, outperforming traditional methods in noise resilience and sampling adaptability.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, providing a thorough background on invariant representations and their challenges. The use of CNNs to approximate geometric invariants is a logical and well-justified extension of existing metric learning techniques.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The authors provide a detailed description of the training process, including the loss function, network architecture, and dataset construction. The experiments are comprehensive, addressing key issues such as noise robustness, sampling irregularities, and multi-scale representation.\n3. Practical Impact: The proposed framework has potential applications in shape analysis, object recognition, and other domains requiring invariant representations, making it a valuable contribution to both theory and practice.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Deeper Analysis of Representation: While the paper demonstrates the numerical robustness of the learned invariants, it lacks a deeper layer-wise analysis of the learned representations. For example, how do the intermediate layers contribute to the final invariant signature? A visualization or interpretation of the learned filters could provide additional insights.\n2. Comparison with Other Learning-Based Methods: The paper primarily contrasts its approach with traditional axiomatic methods. A comparison with other learning-based approaches, if available, would strengthen the evaluation.\n3. Scalability and Generalization: The experiments focus on planar curves under Euclidean and Similarity transformations. It would be valuable to discuss the scalability of the approach to higher-dimensional curves or other transformation groups.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can the proposed framework be extended to handle transformations beyond Euclidean and Similarity groups, such as affine or projective transformations?\n2. How sensitive is the network to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the margin in the contrastive loss function or the number of convolutional layers?\n3. Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation or visualization of the multi-scale representations learned by the network? How do these compare qualitatively with traditional scale-space methods?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the intersection of numerical differential geometry and deep learning by proposing a robust, data-driven framework for learning geometric invariants. While there is room for deeper analysis and broader comparisons, the novelty, rigor, and practical relevance of the work merit its acceptance. The suggestions provided aim to further enhance the clarity and impact of the paper."
