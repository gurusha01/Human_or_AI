            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper presents a framework for training an AI agent to play the first-person shooter game Doom using a combination of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model and curriculum learning. The authors claim their approach is simpler than prior work by relying solely on game states from the AI's perspective without opponent-specific information. The framework incorporates adaptive curriculum training and post-training rules to improve performance. The trained agent, named F1, achieved first place in Track 1 of the ViZDoom AI Competition 2016, significantly outperforming other competitors. The paper also provides detailed ablation studies and visualizations to analyze the agent's behavior and performance.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper demonstrates strong experimental results and a well-executed implementation, it lacks sufficient novelty and broader insights to warrant acceptance at a major AI conference. The use of A3C and curriculum learning is well-established in the literature, and the paper does not provide significant theoretical or methodological contributions beyond applying these techniques to a specific domain. Additionally, concerns about the robustness of the experimental results (e.g., Fig. 5) and the limited scope of the contributions suggest that the work may be better suited for a workshop.\nSupporting Arguments for Decision\n1. Lack of Novelty: The combination of A3C and curriculum learning is not novel, as these techniques have been extensively studied in reinforcement learning. While the implementation in a real system (Doom) is commendable, the paper does not introduce new algorithms, theoretical insights, or significant methodological innovations.\n2. Experimental Robustness: The results presented in Fig. 5 raise concerns about robustness. The authors should report results across multiple random initializations to ensure that the observed performance is not due to specific conditions or overfitting.\n3. Scope of Contribution: The paper focuses on a specific application (Doom) without generalizing the findings to broader 3D navigation or adversarial environments. This limits the impact and relevance of the work for the wider AI community.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Broader Insights: The authors could strengthen the paper by providing deeper insights into the challenges of applying A3C in partially observable 3D environments or proposing modifications to the algorithm that improve its performance in such settings.\n2. Robustness Analysis: Include results with multiple random seeds or initializations to demonstrate the stability and generalizability of the reported performance.\n3. Comparison with Baselines: While comparisons with prior work are provided, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation against other state-of-the-art methods, including those that do not rely on curriculum learning.\n4. Generalization: Discuss how the proposed framework could be adapted to other 3D environments or adversarial tasks, and provide experiments in additional domains to demonstrate its versatility.\n5. Clarity in Figures: Some figures, such as Fig. 5, lack sufficient detail and clarity. Ensure that all visualizations are interpretable and include error bars where applicable.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How robust are the reported results across different random seeds or initializations? Could the performance differences in Fig. 5 be due to overfitting or specific initial conditions?\n2. Can the proposed framework be generalized to other 3D environments or games? Have you tested its applicability in domains beyond Doom?\n3. How does the adaptive curriculum learning approach compare quantitatively to fixed curriculum strategies in terms of convergence speed and final performance?\n4. What are the primary limitations of your approach, and how do you plan to address them in future work?\nIn conclusion, while the paper demonstrates strong experimental results and a well-executed application of existing techniques, its lack of novelty and limited generalizability make it more suitable for a workshop than a conference. Addressing the above concerns could significantly improve the paper's impact and relevance."
