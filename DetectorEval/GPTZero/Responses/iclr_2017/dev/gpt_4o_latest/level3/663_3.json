The authors leverage state-of-the-art deep learning models for text (Text CNN) and image (VGG) classification and introduce a policy network to dynamically select between the two modalities. The paper demonstrates that this multi-modal approach improves top-1 classification accuracy on a large-scale dataset of 1.2 million products from Walmart.com, outperforming single-modality models. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of error patterns and explore various multi-modal fusion techniques, including feature-level and decision-level fusion. This work is positioned as the first to show a direct improvement in top-1 accuracy for large-scale multi-modal classification in e-commerce.\nDecision: Reject \nThe primary reasons for rejection are the lack of novelty in the proposed approach and the misalignment of the paper's focus with the conference's research-centric goals. While the methodology is sound and the results are empirically validated, the reliance on standard techniques like feature fusion and decision-level fusion limits the paper's contribution to advancing the state of the art. The work is better suited for venues focused on applied or production systems rather than research-oriented conferences like ICLR.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Definition and Motivation: The paper tackles a well-defined and practically relevant problem in e-commerce. The motivation for using multi-modal inputs (text and image) is clear, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of single-modality models. However, the problem itself is not novel, as multi-modal classification has been extensively studied in other domains.\n2. Methodology: The proposed decision-level fusion approach is methodologically sound and builds on established practices in multi-modal learning. The use of a policy network to dynamically select between modalities is a reasonable design choice, but it does not introduce a fundamentally new idea or technique. The paper primarily applies existing methods to a specific e-commerce dataset, which limits its contribution to the broader research community.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are robust and demonstrate a measurable improvement in classification accuracy. The authors provide detailed error analysis and ablation studies, which strengthen the empirical rigor of the paper. However, the performance gains are incremental and do not justify the claim of a significant breakthrough in multi-modal learning.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Highlight Novelty: To make the paper more suitable for a research-centric venue, the authors should focus on introducing novel techniques or theoretical insights. For example, exploring innovative architectures for policy networks or proposing new confidence measures for decision-level fusion could enhance the paper's contribution.\n2. Broader Applicability: The paper could benefit from demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach to other domains or datasets beyond e-commerce. This would make the work more appealing to a broader audience.\n3. Comparison with Baselines: While the paper compares its results with single-modality models, it lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion techniques. Including such baselines would provide a clearer picture of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\n4. Theoretical Insights: The paper could include a deeper theoretical analysis of why decision-level fusion outperforms feature-level fusion in this context. This would provide valuable insights for the research community.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed policy network handle cases where both modalities provide conflicting but equally confident predictions? Are there specific strategies to address such scenarios?\n2. Could the authors elaborate on why feature-level fusion consistently underperformed compared to decision-level fusion? Were there specific challenges in training the end-to-end multi-modal network?\n3. How sensitive is the performance of the policy network to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the positive coefficient \\(q\\) in the cost function?\n4. Have the authors considered using pre-trained multi-modal models, such as CLIP, as a baseline for comparison? If not, why?\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents a well-executed application of multi-modal learning to e-commerce, its reliance on standard techniques and lack of novel contributions make it more suitable for applied venues rather than a research-focused conference like ICLR. The authors are encouraged to build on this work by introducing more innovative methods and exploring broader applications."
