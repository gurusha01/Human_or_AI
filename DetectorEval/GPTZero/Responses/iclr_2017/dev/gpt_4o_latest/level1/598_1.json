The system introduces an Automatic Segmentation Criterion (ASG), which eliminates the need for force alignment of phonemes during training. The authors demonstrate that ASG is simpler and computationally more efficient than the widely used Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion while achieving comparable accuracy. The system is evaluated on the LibriSpeech dataset, achieving competitive word error rates (WER) with MFCC features (7.2%) and promising results with power spectrum (9.4%) and raw waveform (10.1%) features. The paper emphasizes the simplicity of the architecture, reduced computational requirements compared to RNN-based models, and the flexibility of using different input features.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, introduces a meaningful contribution to the field of speech recognition, and provides scientifically rigorous results. The primary reasons for acceptance are:\n1. The introduction of the ASG criterion, which simplifies training without sacrificing accuracy, is a significant innovation.\n2. The competitive results on a standard benchmark (LibriSpeech) and the computational efficiency of the proposed system make it a practical alternative to existing methods.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Relevance and Novelty: The paper addresses the long-standing challenge of simplifying end-to-end speech recognition systems while maintaining performance. By removing the dependency on force alignment and introducing ASG, the authors provide a novel and practical solution.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The results are well-supported with comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with existing methods (CTC, Deep Speech). The authors also analyze the impact of training data size and data augmentation, which strengthens the validity of their claims.\n3. Practical Impact: The system's reduced computational complexity compared to RNN-based approaches and its ability to work with raw waveform input make it highly appealing for real-world applications.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity on ASG Criterion: While the ASG criterion is a core contribution, its mathematical formulation and differences from CTC could be explained more intuitively. A visual comparison of the graphs (e.g., Figures 2 and 3) could be better integrated into the discussion to aid understanding.\n2. Decoder Details: The paper mentions a simple beam-search decoder but does not provide sufficient details about its performance trade-offs compared to more sophisticated decoders. A deeper analysis would strengthen the claims of simplicity and efficiency.\n3. Raw Waveform Results: While the results with raw waveform are promising, the paper could discuss why this feature type lags behind MFCCs and power spectrum. Insights into potential improvements or future directions for raw waveform input would be valuable.\n4. Comparison with Larger Datasets: The paper highlights that the proposed system uses less training data compared to Deep Speech models. However, it would be helpful to discuss how the system might scale with larger datasets and whether the gap in performance could be closed.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the ASG criterion perform when scaled to larger vocabularies or other languages with more complex phonetic structures?\n2. Could the proposed system benefit from integrating more advanced language models or decoding strategies, and how would this impact computational efficiency?\n3. What are the limitations of the current architecture when using raw waveform input, and how might these be addressed in future work?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of speech recognition with its novel ASG criterion and efficient ConvNet-based architecture. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance its clarity and impact."
