            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method, Under-Appreciated Reward Exploration (UREX), which enhances exploration in model-free RL by focusing on action sequences that are under-appreciated by the current policy. Unlike traditional entropy regularization approaches, UREX explicitly promotes exploration of regions where the policy's log-probabilities underestimate the observed rewards. The method is a straightforward modification of the REINFORCE algorithm, making it easy to implement. The authors evaluate UREX on challenging algorithmic tasks, including multi-digit addition, sequence reversal, and binary search, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods like entropy-regularized REINFORCE and Q-learning. Notably, UREX achieves state-of-the-art results on multi-digit addition, generalizing to sequences of up to 2000 digits, and solves the binary search task, which requires smart exploration strategies. The paper also highlights UREX's robustness to hyper-parameter changes, reducing the need for extensive tuning.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its significant contributions to reinforcement learning, particularly in sparse reward settings. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Impact: UREX introduces a principled and effective exploration strategy that addresses a critical limitation of existing RL methods in sparse reward environments. The ability to solve algorithmic tasks like multi-digit addition and binary search is a notable advancement.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are comprehensive, demonstrating UREX's superiority across multiple tasks and its robustness to hyper-parameter variations. The generalization to longer sequences further underscores the method's effectiveness.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper identifies a clear limitation of existing exploration strategies (e.g., entropy regularization) and provides a theoretically grounded solution. The use of importance sampling to approximate the optimal policy is innovative and well-justified.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: UREX outperforms baselines on all tested tasks, particularly excelling in sparse reward scenarios. The ability to generalize multi-digit addition to sequences far beyond the training range is a compelling demonstration of the method's efficacy.\n3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides detailed derivations, ablation studies, and robustness analyses, ensuring the claims are well-supported. The inclusion of a new benchmark task (binary search) adds value to the RL research community.\nSuggestions for Improvement\nWhile the paper is strong overall, the following points could enhance its clarity and impact:\n1. Theoretical Analysis: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth theoretical analysis of UREX's convergence properties and its behavior in environments with continuous action spaces.\n2. Comparisons with Other Exploration Strategies: While the paper compares UREX to entropy regularization and Q-learning, additional comparisons with modern exploration techniques (e.g., intrinsic motivation or curiosity-driven methods) would strengthen the empirical evaluation.\n3. Scalability: The paper focuses on algorithmic tasks with discrete action spaces. It would be helpful to discuss how UREX might scale to more complex environments, such as robotics or continuous control tasks.\n4. Binary Search Task: The results on the binary search task reveal that the learned policy does not fully implement binary search but instead combines it with linear search. Further analysis of why this occurs and potential solutions would be valuable.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does UREX perform in environments with continuous action spaces or dense reward signals? Can the method be adapted to such settings?\n2. The paper mentions that UREX combines mode-seeking and mean-seeking behaviors. Could you provide more insights into how this trade-off impacts exploration in practice?\n3. For the binary search task, why do the learned policies deviate from pure binary search? Could additional reward shaping or curriculum learning address this issue?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to reinforcement learning by addressing a critical challenge in sparse reward environments. The proposed UREX method is both innovative and practical, with strong empirical results to support its claims. With minor improvements and additional analyses, this work has the potential to make a lasting impact on the field."
