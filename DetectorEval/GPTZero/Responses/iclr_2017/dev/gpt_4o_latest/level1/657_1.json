            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper addresses the problem of reducing the memory footprint of text classification models while maintaining competitive accuracy. Specifically, it proposes a method based on product quantization (PQ) to compress word embeddings and combines this with techniques such as feature pruning, hashing, and retraining. The authors demonstrate that their approach, implemented as an extension of the fastText library, achieves memory reductions of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the original fastText model, with minimal loss in classification accuracy. The paper also provides empirical evidence across multiple benchmarks, showing that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the trade-off between memory usage and accuracy. The authors plan to release their code, contributing to reproducibility and practical adoption.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and makes a significant contribution to the field of efficient NLP models. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Practical Impact: The proposed combination of PQ, feature pruning, and hashing techniques is innovative in the context of text classification and offers a practical solution for memory-constrained environments, such as mobile devices.\n2. Strong Empirical Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and comparing against strong baselines. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is grounded in relevant literature, building on established techniques like PQ and extending them with domain-specific adaptations for text classification. The motivation to balance memory efficiency and accuracy is clearly articulated and addresses a pressing need in NLP applications.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The authors provide detailed explanations of their methods, including the mathematical foundations of PQ and its adaptations. The experiments are thorough, with evaluations on both small and large datasets, and include ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components.\n3. Reproducibility: The commitment to releasing code and scripts enhances the paper's impact and ensures that the community can build on this work.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, such as the explanation of PQ and its bottom-up retraining strategy, could benefit from more intuitive descriptions or illustrative diagrams to aid understanding for a broader audience.\n2. Comparison with Other Models: The paper mentions convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a baseline but does not explore quantization techniques for CNNs. Including such comparisons would strengthen the claim that the proposed method is superior in memory-accuracy trade-offs.\n3. Extreme Compression Scenarios: While the results for models under 64KiB are promising, more discussion on the practical implications of such extreme compression (e.g., latency, robustness) would be helpful.\n4. Future Work Directions: The authors suggest combining entropy and norm pruning criteria but do not provide preliminary results or a clear roadmap for this idea. Including a brief discussion on the feasibility and expected challenges would add value.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method generalize to other NLP tasks beyond text classification, such as sequence labeling or machine translation?\n2. Can the hashing trick and pruning strategies be dynamically adjusted during training to further optimize the memory-accuracy trade-off?\n3. Have you explored the impact of quantization on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or rare word embeddings, particularly in low-resource settings?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and broaden the scope of comparisons."
