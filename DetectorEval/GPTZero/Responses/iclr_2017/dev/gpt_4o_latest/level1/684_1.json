            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of the Paper\nThis paper introduces a novel model-based approach to deep reinforcement learning, termed Predictive Reinforcement Learning (PRL), which addresses the challenges of multi-task learning in reinforcement learning environments. The authors propose a framework that decouples the understanding of the environment from the strategy, enabling the model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously without performance degradation. The paper also introduces a new recurrent neural network architecture, Residual Recurrent Neural Networks (RRNN), designed to decouple memory from computation, making it well-suited for environments with complex dynamics but limited memory requirements. Empirical results demonstrate that PRL achieves human-level performance on three ATARI games (Breakout, Pong, and Demon Attack) simultaneously, and even shows performance improvements due to transfer learning. The authors also highlight the potential for generalization and strategy independence in their approach.\nDecision: Accept\nKey Reasons:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a novel model-based approach to reinforcement learning, which is a significant departure from the dominant model-free methods. The introduction of RRNNs and their demonstrated benefits in multi-task learning environments further strengthen the paper's contribution.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are compelling, showing that the proposed approach not only avoids performance degradation in multi-task settings but also achieves transfer learning benefits. The results are scientifically rigorous and well-documented.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-motivated, addressing the open problem of multi-task reinforcement learning, which is a critical challenge in the field. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of Q-learning-based methods and position their work effectively within the existing literature.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is clearly described, and the experiments are designed to rigorously test the claims. The use of multiple ATARI games as benchmarks and the comparison with single-task models provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n3. Novel Architecture: The introduction of RRNNs is a valuable contribution that could have broader applications beyond the specific tasks studied in this paper.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity on Strategy Independence: While the paper claims that the model can play strategies different from those it learns, the experiments rely on hard-coded strategies. It would be helpful to include additional experiments or analysis demonstrating the model's ability to generalize to unseen strategies.\n2. Long-Term Dependencies: The authors acknowledge that their approach struggles with long-term dependencies. Including a discussion or preliminary results on how this limitation might be addressed (e.g., through hybrid approaches with Q-learning) would strengthen the paper.\n3. Training Stability: The oscillations in performance, particularly in Demon Attack, suggest potential instability in training. A more detailed analysis of this issue and potential solutions (e.g., curriculum learning or dynamic sampling) would be valuable.\n4. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the authors acknowledge that their approach does not achieve state-of-the-art results, a more detailed comparison with leading methods would provide additional context for the paper's contributions.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the model handle environments with highly stochastic dynamics? Would the RRNN architecture still be effective in such cases?\n2. Can the proposed approach be extended to environments requiring long-term planning, such as strategy games or robotics tasks? If so, how would the architecture need to be modified?\n3. How sensitive is the model to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly in the Perception and Prediction networks?\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by introducing a novel model-based approach and demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-task settings. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations, and I recommend its acceptance."
