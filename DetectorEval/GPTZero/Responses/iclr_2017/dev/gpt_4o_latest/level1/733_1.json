            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) by leveraging system-call language modeling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The authors propose an innovative ensemble method to reduce false alarm rates, a common challenge in anomaly-based intrusion detection. The paper claims that the system-call language model captures semantic relationships between system calls, enabling more effective anomaly detection. Through experiments on benchmark datasets (ADFA-LD, KDD98, and UNM), the authors demonstrate that their method achieves competitive performance, with lower false alarm rates and high portability across different systems. The proposed ensemble method further enhances detection performance by combining multiple classifiers. The paper also highlights the efficiency and compactness of the approach, making it suitable for real-world deployment.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of intrusion detection by introducing a novel application of language modeling to system-call sequences, combined with a well-designed ensemble method. The results are compelling, demonstrating both theoretical rigor and practical utility. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Impact: The application of LSTM-based language models to system-call sequences is innovative and addresses a critical limitation of existing methods in capturing long-term dependencies and semantic relationships.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of false alarm rates and detection rates, as evidenced by robust experimental results on multiple datasets.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a thorough review of the literature, highlighting the limitations of existing methods (e.g., high false alarm rates, reliance on feature engineering) and positioning their approach as a meaningful advancement. The use of LSTMs to model system-call sequences as a \"language\" is both intuitive and well-justified.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and baseline comparisons. The use of ROC curves and AUC values provides a clear and standard evaluation metric. The results convincingly show that the proposed ensemble method improves detection performance while reducing false alarms.\n3. Portability: The demonstration of the model's portability across datasets (e.g., KDD98 to UNM) is a significant strength, as it suggests the potential for real-world applicability without retraining for every system.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarify Ensemble Method Details: While the ensemble method is described mathematically, additional explanation of its intuition and practical implementation would improve accessibility for readers less familiar with ensemble techniques.\n2. Comparison with Contemporary Methods: The paper compares its results with older methods like STIDE and HMM but lacks direct comparisons with more recent deep learning-based approaches. Including such comparisons would strengthen the claims of state-of-the-art performance.\n3. Scalability Discussion: While the paper mentions the efficiency of the proposed method, a more detailed discussion of its scalability to larger datasets or real-time settings would be valuable.\n4. Visualization of Anomalies: The visualization of learned representations is insightful, but extending this to include abnormal sequences could provide deeper insights into how the model distinguishes between normal and anomalous patterns.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method handle mimicry attacks or other sophisticated adversarial strategies? Can the language model detect subtle anomalies embedded within otherwise normal sequences?\n2. Could you provide more details on the computational overhead of training and inference, particularly in comparison to other deep learning-based methods?\n3. How sensitive is the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., LSTM cell size, number of layers)? Did you observe significant differences in performance across the three LSTM configurations tested?\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel and effective approach to host intrusion detection, supported by rigorous experimentation and clear contributions to the field. While there are areas for further clarification and improvement, the work is well-positioned for acceptance and has the potential to inspire future research in this domain."
