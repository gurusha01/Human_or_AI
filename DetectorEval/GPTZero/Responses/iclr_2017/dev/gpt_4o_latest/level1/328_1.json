            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework to model the spiking responses of primate parasol retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to natural images. The authors claim that their approach outperforms traditional generalized linear models (GLMs) in predictive accuracy, even with limited experimental training data. Additionally, they propose a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model to disentangle spatial and temporal processing, offering insights into the neural computations captured by the RNNs. The paper highlights the benefits of multitask learning for leveraging shared features across neurons and demonstrates the robustness of the RNN framework in handling small datasets. The work is positioned as a significant step forward in building predictive models of sensory neurons and understanding complex nonlinear computations in the retina.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted because it presents a well-motivated and scientifically rigorous approach to a critical problem in computational neuroscience. The use of multitask RNNs to model neural responses is novel, and the results convincingly demonstrate superior predictive performance over state-of-the-art GLMs. The paper also provides valuable insights into the contributions of temporal and spatial nonlinearities to neural computations, which could have broad implications for neuroscience and neural prosthetics research.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Clear Problem Statement and Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing GLM-based models in capturing complex neural responses to natural stimuli. The motivation to explore RNNs as a flexible and biologically plausible alternative is well-grounded in the literature.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their models using robust metrics (e.g., fraction of explainable variance) and compare multiple architectures, including GLMs, LNs, and RNN variants. The results are consistent and statistically significant, supporting the claims made.\n3. Novelty and Impact: The introduction of a multitask RNN framework and the GLM-RNN hybrid model represents a meaningful contribution to the field. The ability to achieve high predictive accuracy with limited data is particularly noteworthy, given the constraints of typical neuroscience experiments.\n4. Broader Implications: The potential applications of this work, such as in retinal prosthetics and modeling higher sensory areas, underscore its relevance and significance.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Interpretability of RNNs: While the authors acknowledge the \"black-box\" nature of RNNs, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the internal dynamics of the RNNs. For example, visualizing the temporal filters or recurrent weights could provide additional insights into the computations performed by the network.\n2. Comparison with Other Deep Learning Models: The paper focuses on RNNs but does not compare their performance with other modern architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers, which might also be suitable for this task.\n3. Generalizability: While the results are compelling for parasol RGCs, it would be helpful to discuss the potential limitations of the approach when applied to other neural systems or sensory modalities.\n4. Ablation Studies: The paper could include more detailed ablation studies to quantify the specific contributions of different components of the multitask RNN framework (e.g., shared parameters, number of layers, etc.).\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the performance of the RNNs compare to simpler deep learning architectures, such as feedforward neural networks or CNNs, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy?\n2. Can the multitask framework be extended to model correlations between neurons, which were explicitly excluded in this study?\n3. How sensitive are the results to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of RNN layers or units, and the size of the shared feature space?\n4. Could the authors provide more details on the biological interpretability of the learned RNN features? For instance, do the first-layer filters align with known receptive field properties of RGCs?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong case for the adoption of multitask RNNs in modeling neural responses and provides a solid foundation for future work in this area."
