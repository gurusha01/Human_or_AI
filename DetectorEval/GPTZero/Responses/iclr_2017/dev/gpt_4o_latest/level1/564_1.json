            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper introduces Higher Order Recurrent Neural Networks (HORNNs), a novel extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) designed to better model long-term dependencies in sequential data. By incorporating multiple memory units that track preceding states and feed them back through weighted paths, HORNNs aim to enhance the short-term memory mechanism and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNNs. The authors draw an analogy to digital filters in signal processing and explore three pooling mechanisms\"\"max-based, FOFE-based, and gated pooling\"\"to calibrate feedback signals from different paths. The proposed models are evaluated on two language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank (PTB) and English text8, where HORNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both standard RNNs and LSTMs. The experimental results demonstrate that HORNNs are computationally efficient and scalable, making them a promising alternative for sequence modeling tasks.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to improving RNNs for long-term dependency modeling, supported by rigorous experiments and state-of-the-art results. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Impact: The HORNN architecture introduces an innovative way to address the limitations of RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem, while maintaining computational efficiency.\n2. Strong Empirical Evidence: The experimental results on PTB and text8 datasets convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of HORNNs, achieving significant improvements over existing models like LSTMs.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper provides a thorough review of related work, clearly identifying the limitations of existing models (e.g., RNNs and LSTMs) and positioning HORNNs as a meaningful extension. The analogy to digital filters and the exploration of pooling mechanisms are particularly compelling contributions.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, with detailed ablation studies on the impact of model order and pooling mechanisms. The results are benchmarked against strong baselines, and the authors provide sufficient implementation details for reproducibility.\n3. Broader Applicability: The generalizability of HORNNs to other sequential tasks is emphasized, and the computational efficiency of the model is demonstrated, making it a practical contribution to the field.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is comprehensive, the mathematical notations and descriptions of pooling mechanisms (e.g., FOFE-based and gated pooling) could be simplified for better readability. Including more intuitive diagrams or pseudocode would help clarify the implementation details.\n2. Analysis of Computational Trade-offs: Although the authors claim that HORNNs are computationally efficient, a more detailed comparison of training time and memory usage across models (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs, and HORNNs) would strengthen the paper.\n3. Ablation Studies for Pooling Mechanisms: While the results suggest that FOFE-based and gated pooling perform better, the paper could include more analysis on why these mechanisms outperform max-based pooling, particularly in terms of gradient flow and convergence behavior.\n4. Broader Evaluation: The paper focuses exclusively on language modeling tasks. Evaluating HORNNs on other sequential tasks, such as speech recognition or sequence-to-sequence modeling, would provide stronger evidence of their generalizability.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive are HORNNs to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the order of the model and the forgetting factor in FOFE-based pooling?\n2. Have you explored the scalability of HORNNs on larger datasets or tasks with longer sequences? Are there any limitations in terms of memory or computational overhead?\n3. Could the proposed pooling mechanisms be applied to other architectures, such as LSTMs or GRUs, to further enhance their performance?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequential modeling and is well-suited for acceptance. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the clarity and impact of the work."
