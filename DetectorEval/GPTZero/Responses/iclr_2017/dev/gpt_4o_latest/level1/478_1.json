            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel metric learning framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to construct invariant geometric functions of planar curves under Euclidean and Similarity transformations. It addresses the numerical challenges of classical differential invariants by replacing them with learned representations that are more robust to noise, sampling irregularities, and occlusions. The authors introduce a Siamese network configuration to train for invariance using positive and negative examples of transformations. They also extend this framework to develop multi-scale representations, which are shown to be hierarchical and robust. The paper demonstrates the superiority of the learned invariants over traditional differential and integral invariants through experiments on noise robustness, sampling resiliency, and shape retrieval tasks. The work bridges the gap between numerical differential geometry and deep learning, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional axiomatic approaches.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a deep learning-based approach to a classical problem in numerical differential geometry. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper connects two distinct fields\"\"numerical geometry and metric learning\"\"offering a fresh perspective on constructing geometric invariants.\n2. Empirical Validation: The results convincingly demonstrate the robustness and numerical stability of the proposed method compared to traditional approaches.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a thorough background on invariant representations and their numerical challenges, clearly motivating the need for a learning-based framework. The use of CNNs in a Siamese configuration is well-justified, and the connection to classical methods like curvature-scale space and integral invariants is thoughtfully articulated.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, testing the proposed method under various conditions (noise, sampling irregularities, and shape retrieval). The results consistently show that the learned invariants outperform traditional methods in terms of robustness and adaptability.\n3. Theoretical and Practical Contributions: The development of multi-scale representations using a data-driven approach is a valuable theoretical contribution. Practically, the framework has potential applications in shape analysis, computer vision, and related fields.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is well-written overall, certain sections (e.g., the loss function and architecture descriptions) are dense and could benefit from additional visual aids or simplified explanations for accessibility.\n2. Dataset Diversity: The experiments rely heavily on the MPEG7 dataset. Including results on other datasets or real-world applications would strengthen the generalizability of the approach.\n3. Comparison with More Recent Methods: While the paper compares its method to classical approaches, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with other modern deep learning-based shape analysis techniques.\n4. Computational Efficiency: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of the proposed framework compared to traditional methods. Including such an analysis would provide a more complete evaluation.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the method perform on curves with more complex transformations, such as affine or projective transformations? Could the framework be extended to handle these cases?\n2. Can the learned invariants be interpreted geometrically, similar to classical invariants like curvature? If so, how?\n3. How sensitive is the framework to the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., the margin in the contrastive loss function)?\n4. Could the approach be adapted to handle 3D curves or surfaces, and what challenges might arise in doing so?\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to a longstanding problem, with strong empirical results and potential for further exploration. While there are areas for improvement, they do not detract from the overall merit of the work."
