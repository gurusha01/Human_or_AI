            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper investigates the behavior of untrained, random neural networks using mean field theory. It identifies depth scales that govern signal propagation and demonstrates how these scales determine the maximum depth at which networks can be trained. A key insight is that networks are trainable when information can propagate through them, with a critical \"edge of chaos\" regime allowing arbitrarily deep networks to be trained. The authors also extend the analysis to dropout, showing that it destroys the critical point and limits trainable depth. Additionally, they develop a mean field theory for backpropagation, linking the ordered and chaotic phases to vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively. Empirical results on MNIST and CIFAR10 validate their theoretical predictions, offering a universal framework for understanding trainability based on architecture and initialization.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted due to its strong theoretical contributions, practical relevance, and rigorous validation. It provides a novel, formal framework for understanding the trainability of deep networks, which is a critical topic in machine learning. The results are well-supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, and the insights are broadly applicable to neural network design and initialization.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a fundamental question in deep learning: what limits the trainability of deep networks? By identifying depth scales and linking them to the order-to-chaos transition, the work provides a new lens for understanding network initialization and architecture design. The extension to dropout and the duality between forward and backward signal propagation are particularly impactful.\n \n2. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical results are derived rigorously using mean field theory, and the authors provide detailed proofs in the appendix. The empirical validation is thorough, spanning multiple datasets, training conditions, and network configurations. The agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is compelling.\n3. Practical Implications: The findings have direct implications for practitioners, offering guidelines for selecting hyperparameters and designing architectures to ensure trainability. The notion of \"edge of chaos\" initialization is particularly useful for training very deep networks.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical derivations are detailed, they may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with mean field theory. Including more intuitive explanations or visual summaries of key equations (e.g., depth scales) could improve accessibility.\n2. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses on fully connected networks with bounded activations (e.g., tanh). Extending the framework to unbounded activations like ReLU or structured architectures like convolutional networks would enhance its impact. The authors acknowledge this limitation but could discuss potential extensions in more detail.\n3. Dropout Analysis: The claim that dropout destroys the critical point is intriguing but could benefit from further exploration. For example, how do different dropout rates affect training dynamics in practice? Are there ways to mitigate the negative effects of dropout on trainable depth?\n4. Empirical Validation on Larger Architectures: While the experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 are convincing, testing the framework on larger, more complex architectures (e.g., ResNets) or datasets (e.g., ImageNet) would strengthen the paper's claims about universality.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive are the results to the choice of activation function? For example, how would the depth scales and criticality behave with ReLU or other unbounded activations?\n2. Can the framework be extended to convolutional or recurrent networks? If so, what challenges might arise in applying mean field theory to these architectures?\n3. The empirical results suggest that networks are trainable when their depth is approximately six times the depth scale (6両c). Can you provide more intuition or theoretical justification for this threshold?\n4. How do the findings generalize to other regularization techniques beyond dropout, such as batch normalization or weight decay?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the theoretical understanding of neural network trainability and provides practical insights for designing deep architectures. With minor improvements in clarity and broader validation, it has the potential to be highly impactful."
