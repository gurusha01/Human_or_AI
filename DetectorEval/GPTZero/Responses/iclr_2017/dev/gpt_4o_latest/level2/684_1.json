            "inputText": "Review\nThis paper presents a novel model-based approach to deep reinforcement learning (PRL) aimed at addressing the challenges of multi-task learning in reinforcement learning environments. The authors propose a predictive model that separates the understanding of the environment from the strategy, enabling simultaneous learning across multiple tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces a new recurrent neural network architecture, the Residual Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN), which decouples memory from computation and is particularly suited for environments requiring complex modeling but minimal memory. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three ATARI games, showing that the model not only avoids performance degradation but also benefits from multi-task learning. The results suggest that transfer learning occurs between tasks, and the model achieves human-level performance in all three games.\nDecision: Accept\nThe key reasons for this decision are the novelty of the proposed model-based approach and the introduction of the RRNN architecture, which addresses significant challenges in reinforcement learning. The experimental results are promising, showing that the approach can achieve multi-task learning without performance degradation and even improve performance in some cases. Furthermore, the paper opens new avenues for research in model-based reinforcement learning, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a model-based reinforcement learning approach that explicitly decouples environment understanding from strategy, which is a significant departure from traditional model-free methods like Q-learning. The introduction of the RRNN architecture is also a noteworthy contribution, addressing challenges related to vanishing gradients and computational complexity.\n2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving multi-task learning. The results are compelling, particularly the improvement in performance for Breakout and the ability to generalize strategies beyond those observed during training.\n3. Positioning in Literature: The paper provides a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the limitations of Q-learning in multi-task settings and positioning the proposed approach as a meaningful alternative. The references are relevant and comprehensive.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Reproducibility: While the authors mention that the code will be released, the paper lacks sufficient implementation details for full reproducibility. For example, the exact hyperparameters used during training and the rationale for certain design choices (e.g., the specific architecture of the RRNN) could be elaborated.\n2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper acknowledges two key limitations\"\"handling long-term dependencies and instability during training\"\"but does not provide detailed insights into how these issues might be addressed. Suggestions for future work, such as combining PRL with Q-learning techniques, are promising but could be expanded upon.\n3. Evaluation Metrics: While the results are promising, the evaluation could benefit from additional metrics, such as sample efficiency or comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in multi-task reinforcement learning.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the proposed approach scale to a larger number of tasks or more complex environments beyond ATARI games? Have you considered testing on real-world tasks such as robotics?\n2. Can you provide more details on the training process, particularly the choice of hyperparameters and the weighting scheme for sampling training cases?\n3. How does the RRNN compare to other recurrent architectures like LSTMs or GRUs in terms of computational efficiency and performance across different tasks?\n4. Have you considered integrating the proposed model with existing Q-learning techniques to address the issue of long-term dependencies?\nIn summary, this paper makes a strong case for the adoption of model-based approaches in reinforcement learning and introduces innovative techniques that could inspire further research. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are significant enough to warrant acceptance."
