            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel metric learning framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to construct invariant geometric functions of planar curves under Euclidean and Similarity transformations. The authors claim that their approach achieves superior numerical robustness, resiliency to noise, and adaptability to occlusion compared to traditional axiomatic methods. Additionally, the paper introduces a multi-scale representation within a similarity metric learning paradigm, offering a hierarchical analysis of geometric invariants.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a compelling contribution to the intersection of numerical differential geometry and deep learning. The key reasons for this decision are: (1) the innovative application of CNNs to learn geometric invariants, which bridges a gap between traditional numerical methods and modern machine learning, and (2) the demonstrated advantages of the proposed method in terms of robustness to noise, sampling variability, and computational efficiency, supported by rigorous experiments.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a well-motivated problem of constructing invariant geometric signatures, which are essential in shape analysis and classification. By replacing handcrafted numerical pipelines with a data-driven CNN-based approach, the work introduces a significant innovation. The connection between convolutional operations and differential/integral invariants is particularly insightful.\n2. Support for Claims: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional differential and integral invariants. Robustness to noise, adaptability to varying sampling resolutions, and the ability to handle occlusion are well-documented through quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The multi-scale representation further enhances the utility of the framework.\n3. Relevance and Completeness: The paper situates itself well within the existing literature, citing foundational works in differential geometry and CNN-based metric learning. The methodology is described in sufficient detail, including the architecture, loss function, and dataset construction, ensuring reproducibility.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical depth is commendable, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations in certain sections. For instance, the description of the multi-scale representation (Section 4) could be expanded with more illustrative examples or diagrams to aid understanding.\n2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper does not explicitly discuss potential limitations of the approach, such as its reliance on large datasets or computational overhead during training. Acknowledging these aspects and suggesting directions for improvement (e.g., transferability to 3D curves or other transformation groups) would strengthen the discussion.\n3. Broader Impact: The authors briefly mention the non-specific nature of their framework but could elaborate on its potential applications beyond planar curves, such as in medical imaging, robotics, or computer vision tasks.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the proposed framework to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the margin (Âµ) in the contrastive loss function? Have alternative loss functions been considered?\n2. Can the framework generalize to other transformation groups (e.g., affine or projective transformations) without significant modifications?\n3. How does the computational efficiency of the proposed method compare to traditional pipelines in real-world applications?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel deep learning-based approach to geometric invariants. With minor improvements in presentation and a more detailed discussion of limitations, the work has the potential to inspire further research and practical applications. I recommend acceptance."
