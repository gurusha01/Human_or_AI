            "inputText": "Review of \"Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) Model for Policy Analysis in Reinforcement Learning\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model, a novel framework for analyzing trained reinforcement learning (RL) policies by leveraging spatiotemporal abstractions. SAMDP combines the strengths of Semi-MDP (SMDP) and Aggregated MDP (AMDP) approaches, enabling both temporal and spatial abstractions in a transformed state space. The authors propose a five-stage process for constructing SAMDP models and demonstrate their utility in analyzing policies trained on toy problems and complex Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents. Notably, the SAMDP model is shown to monitor policy performance and improve robustness by identifying suboptimal behaviors. The paper also introduces novel evaluation criteria, such as Value Mean Square Error (VMSE) and entropy, to assess the quality of SAMDP models. Experimental results on Atari games and a gridworld problem highlight the model's ability to uncover policy hierarchies and enhance shared autonomy systems through an \"eject button\" mechanism.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a significant and novel contribution to the field of RL by addressing the critical challenge of policy interpretability in complex environments. The SAMDP model is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and demonstrates practical utility in diverse scenarios. However, some aspects of the methodology and experiments could benefit from additional clarification and refinement.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Significance: The SAMDP model represents a meaningful advancement over existing SMDP and AMDP approaches by combining their strengths in a unified framework. Its ability to analyze DQN policies and identify skills in a transformed state space is a notable innovation.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides extensive empirical evidence, including experiments on gridworld and Atari games, to validate the SAMDP model. The use of evaluation metrics like VMSE and entropy further strengthens the scientific rigor.\n3. Practical Utility: The SAMDP model's application to shared autonomy systems, particularly the \"eject button\" mechanism, demonstrates its potential for real-world impact in safety-critical domains.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Methodology: While the five-stage process for constructing SAMDP models is detailed, some steps (e.g., the modified K-means algorithm and model selection criteria) could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.\n2. State Representation: The paper emphasizes the importance of state representation but does not explore alternative feature extraction methods in depth. Future work could investigate how different feature representations affect SAMDP performance.\n3. Reproducibility: The paper lacks sufficient details for full reproducibility, particularly regarding hyperparameter settings, clustering methods, and the t-SNE configuration. Providing supplementary code or pseudocode would enhance the paper's impact.\n4. Comparison to Baselines: While SAMDP is compared qualitatively to MDP, SMDP, and AMDP models, quantitative comparisons with other state-of-the-art interpretability methods in RL would strengthen the claims of superiority.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the SAMDP model to the choice of clustering algorithm and hyperparameters (e.g., number of clusters, window size)?\n2. Can the SAMDP framework handle stochastic environments or policies with high exploration rates, and if so, how does it adapt to such scenarios?\n3. Have you considered applying SAMDP to continuous-action RL policies beyond actor-critic methods, and what challenges do you foresee in such extensions?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a compelling case for the SAMDP model as a tool for analyzing and improving RL policies. While there are areas for refinement, the novelty, experimental rigor, and practical relevance of the work justify its acceptance. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the paper's clarity and impact."
