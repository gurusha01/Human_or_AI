            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: \"Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs)\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs), a novel family of generative models designed to address limitations in existing generative approaches, particularly for high-dimensional data. The authors propose a framework where local structures (e.g., image patches) are modeled using mixtures of simple component distributions, with dependencies captured by a \"priors tensor.\" To overcome the intractability of this tensor due to its exponential size, the authors leverage tensor decomposition techniques, transforming TMMs into Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvACs). The paper demonstrates that ConvACs enable tractable inference and marginalization, making TMMs particularly effective for classification tasks with missing data. The authors also provide theoretical insights into the expressive capacity of their models and empirically validate their approach on MNIST and NORB datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for classification under missing data scenarios.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling by addressing a critical gap in handling missing data with tractable inference and marginalization. The theoretical rigor, coupled with strong empirical results, justifies its acceptance. However, there are areas where the paper could be improved for clarity and broader applicability.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Significance: The introduction of TMMs and their connection to ConvACs is highly innovative. The paper addresses a well-motivated problem\"\"classification with missing data\"\"where discriminative models often fail. The ability to achieve optimal classification regardless of the missingness distribution is a notable advancement.\n \n2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical foundation, including proofs of universality, depth efficiency, and the expressive capacity of their models. These insights strengthen the paper's contributions and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on MNIST and NORB datasets are comprehensive, showing that TMMs outperform existing methods (e.g., data imputation, discriminative models) by a significant margin. The results convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of TMMs, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.\n4. Practical Relevance: The paper emphasizes the simplicity of designing TMM architectures, aligning with the conventions of modern deep learning. This makes the approach accessible to practitioners.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Presentation: The paper is dense, with extensive mathematical details that may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with tensor decompositions or ConvACs. A more concise explanation of key concepts, supported by intuitive diagrams, would improve accessibility.\n2. Broader Evaluation: While the results on MNIST and NORB are compelling, additional experiments on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) would strengthen the generalizability of the approach.\n3. Comparison with Modern Generative Models: The paper briefly mentions related models like GANs and VAEs but does not provide a direct empirical comparison. Including such comparisons would contextualize the advantages of TMMs more effectively.\n4. Ablation Studies: The paper could benefit from ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (e.g., CP vs. HT decompositions, depth of ConvACs).\n5. Computational Efficiency: While the paper claims that TMMs are computationally efficient, a detailed analysis of runtime and resource requirements compared to competing methods is missing.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the choice of tensor decomposition (e.g., CP vs. HT) affect the performance of TMMs in practice? Are there scenarios where one decomposition is clearly superior?\n2. Can TMMs be extended to semi-supervised or unsupervised learning tasks? If so, how would the model handle unlabeled data?\n3. What are the limitations of TMMs in terms of scalability to larger datasets or higher-dimensional data?\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to generative modeling, with strong theoretical and empirical contributions. While there are areas for improvement, the significance of the proposed method and its demonstrated effectiveness in handling missing data make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to enhance clarity and broaden the scope of evaluation."
