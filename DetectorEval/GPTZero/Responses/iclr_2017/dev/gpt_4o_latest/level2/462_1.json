            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper addresses the critical problem of adversarial attacks on deep learning systems by proposing a novel method to detect adversarial perturbations using a small \"detector\" subnetwork. The detector is trained to distinguish between genuine data and adversarial examples, leveraging intermediate feature representations of the classifier. The authors claim that their method is orthogonal to existing approaches that aim to harden the classifier itself, offering a complementary solution. Key contributions include: (1) empirical evidence that adversarial perturbations, despite being imperceptible to humans, can be detected with high accuracy, (2) demonstration of the detector's ability to generalize to weaker adversaries, (3) introduction of a dynamic adversary capable of fooling both classifier and detector, and (4) a novel training procedure to harden the detector against such dynamic adversaries. The experiments on CIFAR10 and a subset of ImageNet provide strong empirical support for the proposed approach.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper offers a well-motivated and novel approach to a significant problem in the field of adversarial machine learning. The proposed method is practical, demonstrates strong empirical results, and is complementary to existing defenses. However, there are areas where the paper could be improved, as discussed below.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Practicality: The idea of using a detector subnetwork is innovative and provides a practical fallback mechanism for safety-critical applications. Unlike many existing methods, this approach does not require modifying the classifier itself, making it easier to integrate into existing systems.\n2. Empirical Support: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple adversarial attack methods and datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the detector, even against dynamic adversaries.\n3. Generalization: The detector's ability to generalize to unseen and weaker adversaries is a significant strength, as it suggests robustness beyond the specific adversary used during training.\n4. Dynamic Adversary Training: The introduction of dynamic adversary training is a valuable contribution, addressing a potential weakness of static detectors and demonstrating improved robustness.\nAreas for Improvement\n1. Theoretical Insights: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from deeper theoretical analysis of why adversarial perturbations are detectable. The discussion section touches on this but remains speculative.\n2. Reproducibility: The paper lacks detailed information about the detector's architecture and hyperparameter choices, particularly for the ImageNet experiments. Providing this information would enhance reproducibility.\n3. Comparison with Existing Methods: The paper does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art adversarial detection methods. Including such comparisons would strengthen the claims of novelty and effectiveness.\n4. Scalability: While the method works well on CIFAR10 and a 10-class subset of ImageNet, it remains unclear how it would scale to larger datasets or more complex adversarial attacks. Additional experiments on larger datasets or real-world scenarios would be valuable.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the performance of the proposed detector compare to existing adversarial detection methods? Could you provide quantitative comparisons?\n2. What are the computational overheads of adding the detector subnetwork, particularly for large-scale datasets or real-time applications?\n3. Have you explored the use of ensemble detectors or other architectural variations to improve robustness further?\n4. Could the detector's gradient be exploited by adversaries to craft more sophisticated attacks? If so, how might this be mitigated?\nAdditional Feedback\n- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, but the introduction could be streamlined to focus more on the contributions of this work rather than extensively summarizing prior research.\n- The authors should consider releasing their code and pretrained models to facilitate reproducibility and adoption by the community.\n- Future work could explore integrating the detector with other defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training or input preprocessing, to create a more comprehensive defense system.\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial machine learning and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. With minor revisions to address the above points, it could have an even greater impact."
