            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper investigates the impact of different action parameterizations on the performance of deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) policies for dynamic locomotion tasks. The authors compare four actuation models\"\"torques, muscle activations, target joint angles, and target joint velocities\"\"on criteria such as learning speed, robustness, motion quality, and policy query rates. The paper introduces a DeepRL framework for motion imitation tasks, evaluates the performance of these parameterizations across multiple planar articulated figures and gaits, and proposes an optimization approach for actuator parameters in complex muscle models. The results suggest that higher-level action parameterizations incorporating local feedback (e.g., PD controllers) improve learning speed and robustness, especially for complex morphologies. The work highlights the importance of considering action parameterization as a design decision in DeepRL for motion control.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field by addressing an underexplored but critical aspect of reinforcement learning for control tasks: the choice of action parameterization. The results are well-supported by extensive experiments, and the findings have practical implications for designing RL systems for biomechanical and robotics applications. However, some limitations and areas for improvement are noted below.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a gap in the literature by systematically comparing action parameterizations, a topic often overlooked in favor of state representation or reward design. The findings are novel and relevant to both the biomechanics and RL communities.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple agents, gaits, and evaluation criteria. The use of both learning speed and robustness as metrics strengthens the validity of the conclusions.\n3. Practical Implications: The results provide actionable insights for practitioners, particularly the recommendation to use higher-level parameterizations like PD controllers for complex morphologies.\n4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-structured, with clear descriptions of the methods, experiments, and results. The inclusion of supplemental videos and materials enhances reproducibility and understanding.\nAreas for Improvement\n1. Generalization to 3D: The experiments are limited to planar articulated figures, and the authors acknowledge the need to extend the work to 3D. Addressing this limitation in future work would significantly enhance the paper's impact.\n2. Actuator Optimization: While the proposed optimization approach improves MTU performance, the authors note that it may not achieve optimal parameters. Further refinement of this method could provide more conclusive comparisons between MTUs and other parameterizations.\n3. Bias in Reward Function: The reward function is primarily based on joint positions and velocities, which may favor PD and velocity-based parameterizations. While the authors argue that other challenges (e.g., balance and foot placement) mitigate this bias, additional experiments with alternative reward functions would strengthen the claims.\n4. Query Rate Analysis: The observation that MTU policies perform better at lower query rates is intriguing but unexplained. A deeper analysis of this phenomenon would add value.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do you anticipate the results would change when extending the experiments to 3D articulated figures? Are there specific challenges you foresee?\n2. Could the optimization approach for MTU parameters be extended to optimize for a suite of motions rather than a single motion? If so, how might this affect the results?\n3. Have you considered alternative reward functions that emphasize different aspects of motion control (e.g., energy efficiency or naturalness)? How might these affect the relative performance of the parameterizations?\nAdditional Feedback\n- The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between low-level and high-level action parameterizations in specific applications (e.g., robotics vs. biomechanics).\n- Including a comparison of computational costs for training and inference across the different parameterizations would provide additional practical insights.\n- The supplemental video is a valuable addition; however, a brief qualitative analysis of the motion quality observed in the video would strengthen the discussion.\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a well-executed study on an important topic and provides valuable insights for the design of RL systems for motion control. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations, and it is a strong candidate for acceptance."
