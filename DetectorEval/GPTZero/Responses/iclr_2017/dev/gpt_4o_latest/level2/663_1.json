            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThe paper addresses the critical problem of product classification in e-commerce by proposing a multi-modal deep learning approach that fuses text and image inputs at the decision level. The authors claim three main contributions: (1) demonstrating the superiority of text CNNs over image CNNs for product classification on a large-scale dataset, (2) analyzing the errors of individual modalities to highlight the potential of multi-modality, and (3) proposing a novel decision-level fusion policy that improves classification accuracy over both single-modal networks. The paper is well-motivated, as it tackles a real-world problem with significant implications for e-commerce platforms, and the authors provide a detailed experimental setup using a large-scale dataset collected from Walmart.com.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance primarily because of its novelty and practical relevance. The proposed decision-level fusion approach demonstrates a measurable improvement in top-1 classification accuracy, which is a significant achievement for a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem. Additionally, the work is well-placed in the literature, addressing gaps in multi-modal learning for large-scale classification tasks, and the experimental results are rigorously presented.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The decision-level fusion policy is a novel approach that effectively leverages the strengths of both text and image classifiers. While multi-modal learning is not new, the paper is the first to demonstrate a performance improvement in top-1 accuracy for a large-scale dataset using decision-level fusion.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct thorough experiments, including error analysis and comparisons with baseline methods such as feature-level fusion and pre-defined policies. The use of a large-scale dataset with 1.2 million products adds credibility to the results.\n3. Practical Relevance: The work has clear practical applications in e-commerce, where accurate product classification can enhance search efficiency and customer experience. The discussion on computational efficiency (e.g., selectively using the image network) is particularly insightful.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Clarity and Reproducibility: While the paper provides a detailed description of the architectures and training procedures, it would benefit from more explicit hyperparameter settings and training details for reproducibility. For example, the exact configuration of the policy network and the rationale behind choosing specific hyperparameters like the positive coefficient \\( q \\) could be elaborated.\n2. Error Analysis: The error analysis is insightful but could be extended. For instance, the authors mention that t-SNE maps do not reveal well-defined regions where one modality outperforms the other. Could alternative visualization techniques or feature representations provide more clarity?\n3. Limitations and Future Work: The authors acknowledge that the potential of multi-modality was only partially realized and suggest future directions. However, a more detailed discussion of the challenges faced (e.g., overfitting in feature-level fusion) and how these could be addressed would strengthen the paper.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed decision-level fusion approach generalize to other datasets or domains beyond e-commerce? Have you tested its robustness on datasets with different characteristics?\n2. The paper mentions that deeper policy networks and more sophisticated confidence measures could improve performance. Did you experiment with these during preliminary trials, and if so, what were the results?\n3. Given the computational cost of image CNNs, have you explored lightweight alternatives or strategies to further reduce runtime costs?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of multi-modal learning and its application to e-commerce. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, practical relevance, and strong experimental results make it a valuable addition to the conference. I encourage the authors to address the feedback and questions to further strengthen the work."
