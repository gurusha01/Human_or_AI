            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions:\nThis paper presents a novel multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework for modeling the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms traditional generalized linear models (GLMs) in predictive accuracy, even with limited experimental data. The paper also introduces a hybrid GLM-RNN model that separates spatial and temporal processing, providing insights into the neural computations captured by RNNs. The multitask framework, which shares features across neurons, is shown to improve predictive performance and stability. The work highlights the utility of deep networks in neuroscience, particularly in capturing complex nonlinearities in neural responses.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computational neuroscience by introducing an innovative application of multitask RNNs to model neural spiking responses. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Strong Empirical Results: The RNN-based models consistently outperform state-of-the-art GLMs across multiple datasets and metrics, demonstrating their robustness and effectiveness.\n2. Novelty and Practical Utility: The multitask framework and GLM-RNN hybrid model represent innovative approaches that address key challenges in modeling neural responses, such as limited data and complex nonlinearities.\n3. Relevance and Impact: The proposed methods have broad applicability in neuroscience, including potential use in retinal prosthetics and higher sensory area modeling.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Claims and Support: The claims are well-supported by rigorous experiments, including comparisons with baseline models (GLMs and LNs), ablation studies (e.g., reduced image patch size), and performance evaluations across different architectures. The use of explainable variance as a metric is appropriate and aligns with prior literature.\n2. Field Knowledge and Literature: The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the field, referencing relevant prior work on GLMs, deep learning, and neural modeling. The methods are grounded in established neuroscience practices, such as receptive field estimation and spike-triggered averaging.\n3. Completeness: The paper provides sufficient methodological details to enable reproducibility, including data preprocessing, model architectures, and training procedures.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Interpretability: While the authors acknowledge the black-box nature of RNNs, more effort could be made to interpret the learned features and dynamics. For instance, visualizing the temporal filters or analyzing the role of specific recurrent units might provide additional insights.\n2. Comparison with Other Deep Models: The paper focuses on RNNs but does not compare them to other deep architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers, which might also capture spatial and temporal nonlinearities.\n3. Limitations: The authors briefly mention limitations, such as the black-box nature of RNNs and the focus on individual neurons rather than population-level correlations. Expanding on these and discussing potential solutions would strengthen the paper.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the performance of the multitask RNN framework compare to simpler deep learning models, such as CNNs or feedforward networks, for the same task?\n2. Can the GLM-RNN hybrid model be extended to capture correlations between neurons, and if so, how might this impact performance?\n3. Could the multitask framework be applied to other sensory modalities or brain regions, and what challenges might arise in doing so?\nAdditional Feedback:\nThe paper is well-written and presents a compelling case for the use of multitask RNNs in neuroscience. The authors should consider expanding the discussion on the broader implications of their work, particularly in terms of its potential to bridge the gap between biological and artificial neural networks. Additionally, providing open-source code or pretrained models would enhance the paper's impact and facilitate adoption by the community. Overall, this work represents a valuable contribution to the field and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference."
