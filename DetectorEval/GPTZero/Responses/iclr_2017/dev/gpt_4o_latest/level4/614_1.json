These latent representations are modeled as coupled autoregressive processes\"\"i.e., the representation of a user/item evolves upon interaction with an item/user and is influenced by both the user and item representations prior to time t. This mechanism, referred to as coevolution in the paper, is implemented using a recurrent neural network. The model is also capable of incorporating heterogeneous inputs. The authors validate their approach through experiments on multiple datasets and compare its performance against various baseline methods.\nThe paper makes several contributions: 1) it formulates recommendation as a problem of parameterized point processes, where the parameters are governed by dynamic latent user/item representations, 2) it proposes an optimization algorithm for maximizing the likelihood of this process, employing technical strategies to mitigate its inherent complexity, and 3) it conducts experimental evaluations for time-dependent recommendation.\nHowever, a prior paper by the same authors (NIPS 2016) introduces a closely related model of continuous-time coevolution and employs a similar evaluation framework. The primary differences lie in the specifics of the models: the point process formulation and the latent factor dynamics differ slightly, but the overall modeling approach and arguments remain largely the same. Consequently, it is unclear what drives the improved performance of the current model compared to the NIPS paper\"\"whether it is the choice of the point process, the updated parameterization, or other factors. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a justification for the specific form of the point process used in either work. Did the authors explore alternative formulations? The same concern applies to the dynamic process: the non-linearity in the latent user/item vector modeling is limited to a sigmoid function, which may not differ significantly from a linear model. However, the paper does not provide evidence to clarify the role or impact of this non-linearity. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies between the results reported in the two papers.\nRegarding the evaluation, the authors propose two criteria. However, the explanation of item recommendation evaluation is unclear. It is stated that the model predicts the item a user will interact with at each time t\"\"does this refer to predicting the next item a user will interact with after time t? For time prediction, the relevance of this metric to recommendation tasks is not adequately justified. \nA comparison of the computational complexity or execution time of the proposed method against other approaches would also strengthen the paper. The complexity of the proposed method appears to scale with the product of the number of users and items. What are the practical complexity limits of the method?\nIn summary, the paper is technically sound and well-executed, but it leaves several important details unaddressed. Moreover, the strong resemblance to the NIPS 2016 paper raises concerns about whether this work represents a substantial advancement or merely a marginal extension of the prior work. The evaluation criteria are also not entirely convincing, and there is no evidence that the proposed model can scale effectively to large datasets."
