Specifically, given a roll of T timesteps of pitches, the authors randomly mask certain pitches and train the model to predict the missing notes. This approach aligns with the training methodology of the orderless NADE model. For sampling, the standard approach involves ancestral sampling, where an ordering is defined over the outputs. The model processes the current input, samples one output based on the defined order, incorporates this output into the next input, and iterates until all outputs are sampled. The paper's central argument is that this sampling strategy is suboptimal. Instead, they propose adopting the blocked Gibbs sampling strategy from Yao et al. 2014. In this method, N inputs are randomly and independently masked, sampled, and the process is repeated. The goal of this strategy is to ensure better mixing of the sampling chain, which is achieved with a large N. However, large N can lead to incoherent samples due to the independence of the samples. To address this, the authors employ an annealed schedule for N, gradually reducing it over time. This eventually transitions to ancestral sampling, thereby preserving the global structure of the sample. The paper includes extensive experiments using both standard metrics and human evaluations, demonstrating that the blocked Gibbs sampling approach outperforms other sampling methods.\nOverall, this is a well-written paper\"\"great work.\nMy primary concern is that, having read the works of Uria and Yao, I am uncertain about the extent of new insights this paper provides, particularly in the context of an ICLR submission.
