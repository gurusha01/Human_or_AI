            "inputText": "The submission introduces an intriguing approach to aligning synthetic data with real data within a GAN-like architecture. \nThe primary novelty lies in the use of parametric modules designed to emulate various transformations and artifacts, enabling the synthetic data to better match the natural appearance of real data. \nSeveral points were raised during the review discussion: \n1. Model-driven approach vs. traditional GANs: \n The proposed method is more model-driven compared to prior GAN models. However, does this added complexity yield significant benefits? How would a traditional GAN-based approach perform in comparison? Effects such as blur, lighting, and background could potentially be captured by an upsampling network that directly predicts the image. For instance, blur and lighting could be modeled using convolutional layers, while transformations might be approximated to some extent by convolutions or spatial transformer networks. \n The authors' response partially addresses this concern. While the submission emphasizes the use of parameterized modules to align with the real data distribution, it remains unclear why a more generic parameterization, such as a neural network (as employed in standard GANs), would not suffice. The advantage of introducing a more structured model is not convincingly demonstrated. Additionally, the use of a rendering engine to generate the initial synthetic appearance offers limited novelty. \n2. Comparison with traditional data augmentation: \n How does the proposed method compare to conventional data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection, dropout, or geometric transformations? The submission references Keras code (e.g., ImageDataGenerator), where such augmentations are readily available and could have been tested. \n The authors claim that extensive augmentation was employed and promise to provide more details in the appendix. However, it would have been preferable for this information to be included directly in the revised submission, allowing the procedure to be thoroughly evaluated. As it stands, this remains an unresolved point of uncertainty. \n3. Impact of different transformation stages (\\phis): \n The authors evaluate the effect of hand-tuning the transformation stages versus learning them. However, it would be valuable to include results showing the impact of completely including or excluding specific stages, as well as quantifying the contribution of the initial jittering applied to the data. This would provide a clearer understanding of which stages are most critical to performance. \nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea with limited novelty, there are significant concerns regarding the evaluation and comparisons, as outlined above. Furthermore, the method is demonstrated on only a single dataset and task, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Nonetheless, the task itself is compelling and appears to be challenging. Overall, this submission warrants only a weak recommendation for acceptance."
