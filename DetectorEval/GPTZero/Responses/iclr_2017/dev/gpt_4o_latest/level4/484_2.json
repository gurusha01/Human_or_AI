Hopefully, someone will eventually provide a more concise and intuitive explanation of these ideas—perhaps one that could fit on a single slide.\nWhile I believe this paper is suitable for publication at the conference in its current form, I have two suggestions that could enhance its impact:\n1. Theoretical Improvements: The theoretical framework presented in this paper is still far from the completeness achieved by PAC-bound papers during the \"shallow network era.\" Specifically, the non-probabilistic lower and upper bounds in Theorem 1 appear to be loose, and the paper lacks a PAC-like framework to determine which bound is more relevant and how it impacts performance beyond intuition. Additionally, the paper only addresses one aspect of the inductive bias—the maximal representation capacity of a DNN under bounded network size constraints. However, one primary reason for bounding network size is to mitigate overfitting, which is typically justified by PAC or VC-dimension bounds. If we consider the expected risk as the sum of empirical risk and structural risk, this paper focuses entirely on empirical risk minimization while leaving structural risk unaddressed.\n2. Practical Considerations: The experimental results in the paper largely confirm intuitive conclusions or outcomes that could be derived from simpler reasoning. For instance, the use of convolutions to capture symmetry in images by joining symmetrical pixels is a well-known concept that has been employed in computer vision for decades using handcrafted pattern detectors. To better motivate the use of this framework, the authors could address questions that are not easily resolved by human intuition and remain poorly understood. For example, one intriguing application could be the recent use of gated convolutions with dilations (\"à trous\") for 1D speech signals, as popularized in Google WaveNet."
