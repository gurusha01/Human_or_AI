This setting, which involves pixel inputs and the Fist actuator in a continuous action space, is the closest approximation to real-world robotic scenarios. Its omission raises concerns about the applicability of the proposed approach to real-world robots. For example, Figure 5 does not include results for this setting. Is there a specific reason for this omission?\n- Lack of baseline comparisons: The paper does not compare its approach to any baseline methods, making it difficult to discern what the agent is genuinely learning and which aspects of the proposed approach contribute to the task's success. For instance, in the Towers task, how would an agent with a fixed action policy\"\"randomly pushing or hitting the tower with the Fist actuator and passively observing the consequences\"\"perform in generating labels compared to the proposed deep reinforcement learning approach? A comparison with such a baseline (keeping all other components constant) would provide valuable insights into the benefits of the proposed method."
