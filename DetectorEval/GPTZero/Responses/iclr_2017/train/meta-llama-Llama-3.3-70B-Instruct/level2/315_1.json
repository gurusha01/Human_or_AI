The authors observe that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training function, which leads to poor generalization performance.

The paper presents numerical evidence to support this claim and explores several strategies to remedy the generalization problem of large-batch methods.\nI decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reason for this decision is that the paper tackles an important problem in deep learning and provides valuable insights into the behavior of large-batch methods. The authors' observation that large-batch methods converge to sharp minimizers is a significant contribution to the field, and their experiments provide strong evidence to support this claim.\nThe paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide a thorough review of the related literature and clearly explain the motivation behind their work. The experimental results are well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nOne area for improvement is the discussion of the limitations of the paper. While the authors mention some potential limitations, they could provide a more detailed discussion of the potential drawbacks of their approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more context about the significance of their results and how they relate to the broader field of deep learning.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors address the following questions:\n* Can the authors provide more insight into why large-batch methods converge to sharp minimizers? Is this due to the optimization algorithm or the properties of the loss function?\n* How do the results of this paper relate to other work on deep learning optimization? Are there any potential connections to other areas of research, such as robust optimization or adversarial training?\n* Can the authors provide more details about the experimental setup and the hyperparameters used in the experiments? This would help to ensure reproducibility of the results.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides significant contributions to the field of deep learning. With some minor revisions to address the limitations and provide more context, the paper would be even stronger."
