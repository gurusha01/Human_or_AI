            "inputText": "This paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to environment simulation, which is a crucial component of agent-based systems. The authors introduce a recurrent neural network-based simulator that can make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance and presents extensive experiments on various environments, including Atari games, a 3D car racing environment, and complex 3D mazes.\nThe main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed simulator outperforms existing approaches in terms of long-term accuracy, (2) the use of prediction-dependent transitions improves performance, and (3) the simulator can be used for model-based exploration. The paper provides strong support for these claims through extensive experiments and analysis.\nI decide to accept this paper for several reasons:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of environment simulation, which is a crucial component of agent-based systems.\n2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing approaches and how their proposed simulator addresses these limitations.\n3. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis to support the claims, including comparisons with existing approaches and ablation studies to understand the contributions of different components of the simulator.\nSome potential limitations of the paper include:\n1. The simulator is designed for deterministic environments, which may not be representative of real-world environments that often involve noisy state transitions.\n2. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the simulator can be used for more complex tasks, such as navigation or planning.\n3. The experiments are limited to a specific set of environments, and it is unclear how the simulator would perform in other environments.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest the authors:\n1. Provide more details on how the simulator can be used for more complex tasks, such as navigation or planning.\n2. Discuss the potential limitations of the simulator and how they can be addressed in future work.\n3. Consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the simulator's performance in other environments.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:\n1. How does the simulator handle noisy state transitions, and what are the implications of this for real-world environments?\n2. Can the simulator be used for more complex tasks, such as navigation or planning, and if so, how?\n3. How does the simulator's performance compare to other approaches in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?"
