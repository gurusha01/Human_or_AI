The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a complex synthetic car following benchmark, achieving substantial improvement over conventional approaches and state-of-the-art model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.\nThe paper claims to contribute to the field of visual servoing by introducing a new method that can learn to servo using low amounts of data, enabling quick adaptation to new targets. The authors support their claims with extensive experiments, comparing their approach to various baselines, including classical image-based visual servoing, position-based visual servoing, and end-to-end servoing policies learned with TRPO.\nThe approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work in visual servoing, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and the potential benefits of learning-based approaches. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide detailed descriptions of their method, including the architecture of the visual feature extractor, the predictive dynamics model, and the reinforcement learning algorithm.\nThe results presented in the paper are impressive, demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to learn effective visual servoing policies with limited data. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their approach, including comparisons to various baselines and ablation studies to evaluate the importance of different components of their method.\nBased on the results and the analysis presented in the paper, I decide to accept this paper. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to visual servoing, which addresses the limitations of traditional methods.\n2. The authors provide extensive experiments to support their claims, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach on a complex benchmark.\n3. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide clear descriptions of their method and the related work in the field.\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their approach, including the specific architectures used for the visual feature extractor and the predictive dynamics model. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the robustness of their approach to different types of visual variations, such as changes in lighting or occlusions.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:\n1. How do the authors select the specific visual features used in their approach, and what is the impact of using different features on the performance of the method?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn the visual servoing policy, including the specific reward function and exploration strategy employed?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex visual servoing tasks, such as servoing in cluttered environments or with multiple targets?"
