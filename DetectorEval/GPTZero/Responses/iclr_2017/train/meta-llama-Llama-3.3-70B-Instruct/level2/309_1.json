The main claim of the paper is that by incorporating auxiliary control and reward prediction tasks, the agent can learn more efficiently and robustly. The authors demonstrate that UNREAL outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agents, achieving an average human-normalized score of 87% on Labyrinth and 880% on Atari.\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being the impressive experimental results and the well-motivated approach. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the UNREAL architecture and its components, including the auxiliary control tasks, reward prediction, and experience replay. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons to other state-of-the-art agents.\nThe supporting arguments for my decision include:\n* The paper presents a well-motivated and clearly explained approach to improving deep reinforcement learning agents.\n* The experimental results are impressive, with significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art agents on both Labyrinth and Atari environments.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons to other state-of-the-art agents.\n* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the UNREAL architecture and its components.\nAdditional feedback to improve the paper includes:\n* Providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings.\n* Including more analysis on the computational cost and memory requirements of the UNREAL agent, especially in comparison to other state-of-the-art agents.\n* Exploring the potential applications of the UNREAL agent to other domains and environments, such as robotics or real-world control tasks.\nQuestions to the authors:\n* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the auxiliary control tasks and reward prediction, including the specific architectures and hyperparameters used?\n* How do you plan to extend the UNREAL agent to other domains and environments, and what potential challenges or limitations do you foresee?\n* Can you provide more analysis on the robustness of the UNREAL agent to different types of noise or perturbations in the environment, such as changes in the reward structure or the presence of adversarial agents?"
