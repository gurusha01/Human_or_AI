            "inputText": "This paper introduces the Gated Graph Transformer Neural Network (GGT-NN), a novel neural network architecture that extends the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network (GGS-NN) by allowing graph-structured intermediate representations. The GGT-NN model can learn to construct and modify graphs in sophisticated ways based on textual input and use the graphs to produce a variety of outputs.\nThe main claims of the paper are that the GGT-NN model can successfully learn to solve a wide range of tasks, including the bAbI tasks and rule discovery tasks, and that it can generalize to large inputs. The paper also claims that the GGT-NN model has several advantages over existing architectures, including the ability to work with unstructured input, modify graphical structures, and distribute complex computations across nodes.\nThe support for these claims comes from a series of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the GGT-NN model on various tasks. The results show that the GGT-NN model can achieve high accuracy on most tasks, often outperforming other state-of-the-art models. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance and discusses its limitations and potential applications.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident in the potential applications of the GGT-NN model. The model can be used to extract graph-structured information from unstructured textual descriptions, which has many potential applications in natural language processing and other fields. The model's ability to distribute complex computations across nodes also makes it a promising candidate for solving complex tasks that require parallel processing.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with a thorough review of related work and a clear explanation of the technical details of the GGT-NN model. The novelty of the work lies in the extension of the GGS-NN model to allow graph-structured intermediate representations and the demonstration of the model's effectiveness on a range of tasks.\nThe completeness of the paper is evident in the detailed description of the GGT-NN model and its components, as well as the thorough analysis of the experimental results. The paper also discusses the limitations of the model and potential directions for future work, which demonstrates a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the model.\nThe limitations of the paper are acknowledged, including the high computational cost of training the model and the need for additional supervision to extract meaningful graph-structured data. The paper suggests potential solutions to these limitations, such as using sparse edge connections or reducing the level of supervision required.\nOverall, I recommend accepting this paper. The GGT-NN model is a significant contribution to the field of neural networks, and the paper provides a thorough and well-written description of the model and its applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, and the analysis of the results provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest the following:\n* Provide more details on the implementation of the GGT-NN model, including the specific architectures used for the graph transformations and the output function.\n* Discuss the potential applications of the GGT-NN model in more detail, including potential uses in natural language processing, computer vision, and other fields.\n* Provide more analysis of the experimental results, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the model on different tasks and a comparison with other state-of-the-art models.\nQuestions for the authors:\n* Can you provide more details on the specific architectures used for the graph transformations and the output function?\n* How do you plan to address the high computational cost of training the GGT-NN model?\n* Can you discuss potential applications of the GGT-NN model in more detail, including potential uses in natural language processing, computer vision, and other fields?"
