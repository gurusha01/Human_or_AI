The model is designed to mimic the primate retina's eccentricity-dependent sampling lattice, with a high-resolution region in the fovea surrounded by a low-resolution periphery. The authors explore the emergent properties of the model's retinal sampling lattice after training and find that it resembles the primate retina's lattice, with a high-acuity region at the center and a low-acuity periphery.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to understanding the optimal retinal sampling lattice for a visual search task. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their model and results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's main contribution is the proposal of a learnable retinal sampling lattice, which allows the model to adapt to the task constraints and learn an optimal sampling strategy. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's performance and compare it to existing attention models. The results show that the model is able to learn a high-acuity region at the center of the lattice, similar to the primate retina, and that this region is essential for the model's performance.\nThe paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the limitations of the current approach. The authors acknowledge that the model is simplified and that future work should focus on more challenging tasks and naturalistic visual scenes.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details about the training process and the hyperparameters used. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis of the model's performance on different datasets and tasks. The authors could also provide more discussion about the implications of their results for our understanding of the primate retina and visual attention.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How did you choose the specific architecture and hyperparameters for the model?\n2. Can you provide more details about the training process and the convergence of the model?\n3. How do you think the results would change if the model were trained on more naturalistic visual scenes or more challenging tasks?\n4. Can you provide more discussion about the implications of your results for our understanding of the primate retina and visual attention?"
