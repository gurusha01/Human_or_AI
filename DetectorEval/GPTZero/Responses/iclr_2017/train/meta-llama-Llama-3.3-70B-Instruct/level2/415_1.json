            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel regularization technique called OrthoReg, which aims to reduce overfitting in deep neural networks by enforcing local orthogonality between feature detectors. The authors argue that regularizing negatively correlated features can be an obstacle to effective decorrelation and propose a method that only regularizes positively correlated feature weights.\nThe paper claims to contribute to the field of deep learning by introducing a new regularization technique that improves the performance of state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effects of OrthoReg on the performance of neural networks, including its ability to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\nBased on the provided information, I decide to Accept this paper. The main reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper presents a well-motivated approach to regularization, which is a key problem in deep learning.\n2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effects of OrthoReg on the performance of neural networks, including its ability to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoReg in improving the performance of state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets.\nThe supporting arguments for this decision include:\n* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of regularization in deep learning and motivates the need for a new approach.\n* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effects of OrthoReg on the performance of neural networks, including its ability to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoReg in improving the performance of state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets.\nAdditional feedback to improve the paper includes:\n* Providing more details on the implementation of OrthoReg, including the choice of hyperparameters and the computational cost of the method.\n* Investigating the effect of OrthoReg on other types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks and generative models.\n* Providing more analysis on the relationship between OrthoReg and other regularization techniques, such as dropout and batch normalization.\nQuestions to the authors include:\n* Can you provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters for OrthoReg, including the value of 纬 and 位?\n* How does OrthoReg compare to other regularization techniques, such as dropout and batch normalization, in terms of computational cost and effectiveness?\n* Can you provide more analysis on the effect of OrthoReg on the feature detectors of the neural network, including the distribution of feature weights and the correlation between features?"
