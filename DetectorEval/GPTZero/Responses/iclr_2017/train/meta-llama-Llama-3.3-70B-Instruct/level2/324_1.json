The authors propose a simple yet effective approach to prune filters based on their weight magnitudes, which achieves significant reductions in FLOP (up to 34% for VGG-16 and 38% for ResNet-110) while maintaining close to the original accuracy.\nI decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of CNNs, which is reducing computation costs without sacrificing accuracy.\n2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and the advantages of the proposed method.\nThe supporting arguments for this decision are:\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the sensitivity of each layer to pruning, which is useful for understanding the robustness of the network.\n* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various architectures, including VGG-16 and ResNet-110, and on different datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.\n* The paper provides a comparison with other pruning methods, including random filter pruning and activation-based feature map pruning, which shows the superiority of the proposed approach.\nAdditional feedback to improve the paper:\n* It would be helpful to provide more details on the computational resources used for the experiments, such as the GPU model and the batch size.\n* The authors could consider providing more visualizations, such as plots of the filter weights and feature maps, to help illustrate the pruning process.\n* It would be interesting to see an analysis of the effect of pruning on the network's robustness to adversarial attacks.\nQuestions to the authors:\n* Can you provide more insights on why the `1-norm works better than the `2-norm for filter pruning in some cases?\n* How do you plan to extend this work to other types of neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?\n* Have you considered using other pruning criteria, such as the filter's output variance or the feature map's activation statistics?"
