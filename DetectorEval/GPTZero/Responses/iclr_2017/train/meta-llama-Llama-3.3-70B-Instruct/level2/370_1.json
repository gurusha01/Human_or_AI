The paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed idea, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSD training strategy.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of optimizing deep neural networks and motivates the need for a new training strategy. The authors propose a simple yet effective approach to regularize neural networks by pruning and re-densifying the connections.

Can you provide more details on the choice of sparsity ratio and its effect on the performance of DSD training?\n2. How does DSD training compare to other regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, in terms of performance and computational cost?\n3. Can you provide more examples of the captions generated by NeuralTalk with and without DSD training to demonstrate the qualitative improvements?"
