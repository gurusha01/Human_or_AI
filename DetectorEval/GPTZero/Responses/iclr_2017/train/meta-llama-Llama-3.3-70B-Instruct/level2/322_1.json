            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel framework for automatically determining the optimal size of a neural network for a given task without prior information. The authors introduce nonparametric neural networks, a non-probabilistic framework for conducting optimization over all possible network sizes, and prove its soundness when network growth is limited via an `p penalty. They also develop a novel optimization algorithm, Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent (AdaRad), and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on several benchmark datasets.\nThe main claims of the paper are:\n1. Nonparametric neural networks can automatically adapt and choose the size of a neural network during a single training run.\n2. The proposed framework, including AdaRad, can improve the performance of trained networks beyond what is achieved by regular parametric networks of the same size.\n3. The framework is scalable and can be applied to large datasets.\nThe support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors prove the soundness of the nonparametric neural network framework and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, rectangles images, and convex. They also show that the framework is scalable by applying it to a large dataset, poker.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as they address a significant problem in deep learning, namely, the need for prior information to choose a good network size. The framework proposed in the paper provides a way to automatically adapt and choose the size of a neural network during a single training run, which can be beneficial in many applications.\nThe field knowledge reflected in the paper is excellent, as the authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the existing literature on neural networks, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques. They also provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework and its components.\nThe novelty of the work is significant, as the authors introduce a new framework for nonparametric neural networks and a novel optimization algorithm, AdaRad. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the framework and its components, including a proof of its soundness and experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, as the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework and its components. They also provide a thorough analysis of the framework and its components, including a proof of its soundness and experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. However, some details, such as the implementation of the AdaRad algorithm, are not fully explained and may require additional information to reproduce the results.\nThe limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the framework may not work well for all datasets and that the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter ‰Ωç, can significantly affect the performance of the framework.\nIn conclusion, this paper proposes a novel framework for nonparametric neural networks and a novel optimization algorithm, AdaRad. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through experiments on several benchmark datasets and provide a thorough analysis of the framework and its components. The paper reflects excellent field knowledge, and the novelty of the work is significant. However, some details may require additional information to reproduce the results, and the limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors.\nDecision: Accept\nReasons for the decision:\n1. The paper proposes a novel framework for nonparametric neural networks and a novel optimization algorithm, AdaRad, which addresses a significant problem in deep learning.\n2. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through experiments on several benchmark datasets.\n3. The paper reflects excellent field knowledge, and the novelty of the work is significant.\nAdditional feedback:\n1. The authors may want to consider providing more details on the implementation of the AdaRad algorithm to facilitate reproducibility of the results.\n2. The authors may want to consider exploring the application of the framework to other datasets and tasks to further demonstrate its effectiveness.\n3. The authors may want to consider providing more analysis on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter ‰Ωç, and their effect on the performance of the framework.\nQuestions for the authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the AdaRad algorithm?\n2. How do you choose the hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter ‰Ωç, and what is their effect on the performance of the framework?\n3. Have you considered applying the framework to other datasets and tasks, and what are the results?"
