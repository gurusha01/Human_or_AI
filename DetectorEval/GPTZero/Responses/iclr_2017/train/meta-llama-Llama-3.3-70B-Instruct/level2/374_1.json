Discussing potential applications of the fine-grained gating mechanism beyond reading comprehension tasks.\nQuestions to the authors include: \n1. How do the authors plan to extend the fine-grained gating mechanism to combine other levels of representations, such as phrases and sentences?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed approach and how it compares to existing methods?\n3. How do the authors plan to integrate the fine-grained gating mechanism with other natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation?"
