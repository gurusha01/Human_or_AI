The authors introduce a framework that combines model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, allowing the agent to balance the trade-off between task performance and computational cost.\nThe paper claims to contribute a new framework for adaptive, imagination-based optimization, which enables the agent to learn to optimize its computations based on the difficulty of the task. The authors evaluate their approach on a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics and demonstrate that their metacontroller can achieve better performance than traditional fixed-policy approaches.\nI decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the metacontroller in adapting to different task difficulties and computational costs. The paper also provides a clear and detailed explanation of the framework, including the metacontroller, experts, and memory, and the experimental results are well-organized and easy to follow.\nThe key reasons for my decision are:\n1. The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to optimization in neural networks, which addresses the limitations of traditional fixed-policy approaches.\n2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the metacontroller in adapting to different task difficulties and computational costs, and the authors provide a clear and detailed analysis of the results.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest the following:\n1. Provide more details on the training procedure, including the hyperparameter settings and the optimization algorithm used.\n2. Consider adding more experiments to evaluate the robustness of the metacontroller to different task settings and computational costs.\n3. Provide more discussion on the potential applications of the metacontroller framework to other areas of reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer are:\n1. How did the authors choose the specific architecture for the metacontroller, experts, and memory, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of this architecture?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the metacontroller and how it compares to traditional fixed-policy approaches?\n3. How does the metacontroller framework relate to other areas of reinforcement learning, such as model-based reinforcement learning and meta-learning, and what are the potential applications of this framework to these areas?"
