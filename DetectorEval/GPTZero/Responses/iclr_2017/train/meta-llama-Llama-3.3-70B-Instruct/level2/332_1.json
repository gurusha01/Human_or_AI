            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to learning perceptual similarity judgment using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with object persistence constraints. The authors retrain a pre-trained AlexNet using a Siamese triplet architecture with multi-view images of 3D objects, which enables the network to learn a view-manifold that captures the notion of object persistence and continuity. The resulting network, called Object Persistence Net (OPnet), demonstrates improved performance in similarity judgment tasks, including instance and categorical retrieval, on both trained and novel objects. The authors claim that their approach leads to more abstract and general feature representations that are transferable to novel objects and categories.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novel approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to learning perceptual similarity judgment using object persistence constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Improved performance: The authors demonstrate improved performance of OPnet on various similarity judgment tasks, including instance and categorical retrieval, on both trained and novel objects.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to learning perceptual similarity judgment. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the view-manifold learned by OPnet and demonstrate its effectiveness in similarity judgment tasks. The results show that OPnet outperforms other approaches, including AlexNet and a joint embedding model, on various tasks. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the feature representations learned by OPnet and demonstrate their transferability to novel objects and categories.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:\n1. Provide more analysis on the limitations of OPnet: While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OPnet, they should also discuss its limitations and potential biases.\n2. Compare OPnet with other state-of-the-art approaches: The authors should compare OPnet with other state-of-the-art approaches to learning perceptual similarity judgment, such as those using attention mechanisms or graph neural networks.\n3. Provide more details on the implementation: The authors should provide more details on the implementation of OPnet, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters used.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer are:\n1. How does OPnet handle objects with complex textures or lighting conditions?\n2. Can OPnet be applied to other domains, such as audio or text data?\n3. How does the performance of OPnet compare to human performance on similarity judgment tasks?"
