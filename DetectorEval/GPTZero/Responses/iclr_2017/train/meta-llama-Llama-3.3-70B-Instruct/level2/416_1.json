The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of maximum entropy modeling, which is a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning.\n2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the ME principle and its applications.\n3. The MEFN algorithm is novel and has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in ME modeling.\nHowever, I have some concerns and suggestions for improvement:\n* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing methods, particularly in the finance and computer vision applications.\n* The authors could provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the results to these choices.\n* The paper could be improved by providing more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the MEFN algorithm.\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n* Can you provide more details on the choice of the transformation family F and the optimization algorithm used to learn the parameters of the transformation?\n* How do you handle the case where the support of the ME distribution is not known or is complex?\n* Can you provide more insights into the computational complexity of the MEFN algorithm and its scalability to high-dimensional problems?\nOverall, I believe that this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of maximum entropy modeling, and I look forward to seeing the authors' responses to my questions and concerns."
