            "inputText": "This paper presents a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, proposing that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. The authors argue that this viewpoint provides a unified theory for understanding these architectures and offers a framework for explaining several recent findings. I will summarize the paper's claims, provide my decision, and offer supporting arguments and additional feedback.\nThe paper claims to contribute a new perspective on Highway and Residual networks, deriving both architectures from the concept of unrolled iterative estimation. The authors demonstrate that this viewpoint leads to a better understanding of the behavior of these networks, including their resilience to lesioning, benefits of layer dropout, and mild negative effects of layer reshuffling.\nMy decision is to accept this paper. The key reasons for this choice are:\n1. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-supported argument for the unrolled iterative estimation perspective, providing a clear and concise explanation of the concept and its implications.\n2. The authors demonstrate the validity of their perspective through a series of experiments and analyses, including the derivation of Highway and Residual networks from the unrolled iterative estimation concept.\nSupporting arguments for my decision include:\n* The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the unrolled iterative estimation perspective, making it easy to follow and understand.\n* The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work, demonstrating a strong understanding of the current state of research in the field.\n* The experiments and analyses presented in the paper are well-designed and provide strong evidence for the validity of the unrolled iterative estimation perspective.\nAdditional feedback and suggestions for improvement include:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the unrolled iterative estimation perspective for the design and training of neural networks.\n* The authors may want to consider providing more experimental results to further demonstrate the validity of their perspective, such as comparisons with other architectures or applications to different tasks.\n* The paper could be improved by providing a clearer summary of the main contributions and takeaways, making it easier for readers to quickly understand the key points and implications of the work.\nQuestions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:\n* Can you provide more details on how the unrolled iterative estimation perspective relates to other concepts in deep learning, such as optimization and representation learning?\n* How do you envision the unrolled iterative estimation perspective being used in practice, and what potential applications or benefits do you see for this work?\n* Are there any potential limitations or drawbacks to the unrolled iterative estimation perspective, and how do you propose addressing these in future work?"
