Notably, the NPE adopts an object-centric approach, eschewing video frames in favor of explicit object representation, and leverages training data to incorporate physical knowledge. The proposed framework is evaluated in a simplified 2D domain featuring bouncing balls.\nThe NPE processes individual objects within a scene sequentially, embedding pairs of objects in a shared space to capture their mutual effects. These embeddings are then combined with the focal object's state to predict its velocity change. Alternative baseline models are presented, which either abandon pairwise embedding in favor of single-object embedding or utilize LSTM states to encode neighboring objects.\nThe NPE demonstrates significant performance gains over the baseline models, underscoring the importance of architectural design in learning object-based simulation. The model is subjected to various tests, including its ability to predict long-term object trajectories, generalize to diverse object counts, and adapt to modified environments with altered wall shapes. Furthermore, the NPE is trained to predict object mass solely from interactions with other objects, yielding superior results compared to the baseline models.\nComments\n===\n* A clarifying question arises regarding the inputs to the blue box in Figure 3 (b)/(c): Are they a concatenation of the summed embeddings and the state vector of object 3, or an alternative combination of these vectors?\n* Section 2.1 commences with the assertion that physics remains invariant across inertial frames, allowing for separate prediction of each object's future state conditioned on its past states and those of neighboring objects. This argument would benefit from explicit contrast with visual representation approaches to justify the adoption of an object-only representation.\n* Although the paper presents a novel approach, its originality is somewhat diminished by the concurrent work of Battaglia et al. (2016) on \"Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations, and Physics.\" While the two studies share the use of object-based representations for predicting physical behavior, they differ in network architecture, experimental design, and presentation.\nOverall Evaluation\n===\nThis manuscript was engaging and provided a wealth of experiments yielding clear and intriguing conclusions. Although its novelty is slightly reduced in light of concurrent research by Battaglia et al. (2016), the paper contributes a significant advancement in the ongoing investigation of intuitive physics, offering a fresh perspective and noteworthy results."
