The results show that the network can automatically figure out complicated game rule concepts, such as the concept of a chessboard grid, the winning rule, and the concept of two sides.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper with the reason that it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to learning game concepts under weak supervision. The paper is well-organized, and the experiments are thoroughly conducted and analyzed.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific question of whether a CNN can learn game concepts under weak supervision, which is a well-defined and interesting problem. The approach is well-motivated, building upon previous work on cross-modal supervision and class activation mapping. The experiments are carefully designed, and the results are thoroughly analyzed, providing strong evidence for the claims made in the paper. The use of CAM to visualize the learned representations is particularly effective in demonstrating the network's ability to collect information from context.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the implications of their results and how they can be applied to more complex games or real-world scenarios. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the learned representations, such as visualizing the feature maps or analyzing the weights of the network.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex games, such as chess or Go?\n* Can the authors provide more insight into how the network is able to collect information from context, and what are the key factors that contribute to this ability?\n* How do the authors think their approach can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as learning concepts from images or videos?"
