            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel framework for solving the distributed stochastic optimization problem using synchronous stochastic optimization with backup workers. This approach aims to mitigate the straggler effect while avoiding gradient staleness, which is a major issue in asynchronous stochastic optimization. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations on several models, including Inception and PixelCNN, and show that it outperforms asynchronous stochastic optimization in terms of test accuracy and convergence speed.\nBased on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate the paper as follows:\n1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the distributed stochastic optimization problem, which is a crucial challenge in deep learning. The paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem, which is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature.\n2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the weaknesses of both synchronous and asynchronous stochastic optimization. The use of backup workers to mitigate stragglers is a novel and interesting idea.\n3. The paper supports its claims through empirical evaluations on several models, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results are scientifically rigorous, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between convergence speed and test accuracy.\nBased on these evaluations, I decide to Accept the paper. The key reasons for this choice are:\n* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to address the distributed stochastic optimization problem.\n* The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the results are scientifically rigorous.\nHowever, I have some concerns that need to be addressed:\n* The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which is an important aspect of distributed stochastic optimization.\n* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the number of backup workers, which is a crucial hyperparameter in the proposed approach.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:\n* Provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.\n* Investigate the effect of different numbers of backup workers on the performance of the proposed approach.\n* Consider applying the proposed approach to other models and datasets to demonstrate its generality.\nI would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:\n* How do the authors choose the number of backup workers, and what is the effect of different numbers of backup workers on the performance of the proposed approach?\n* Can the authors provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, and how it compares to other distributed stochastic optimization algorithms?\n* Have the authors considered applying the proposed approach to other models and datasets, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of doing so?"
