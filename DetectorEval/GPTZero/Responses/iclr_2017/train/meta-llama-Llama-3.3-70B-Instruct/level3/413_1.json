            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper presents a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-HMM (HDP-HMM). This method allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals, which is a crucial step in understanding animal communication. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world bioacoustic datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird songs.\nDecision: Accept\nI decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-written approach to a challenging problem in bioacoustics. The use of HDP-HMMs is a clever and suitable choice for this task, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific question/problem in bioacoustics, namely the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough review of the related work in the field. The use of HDP-HMMs is a well-justified choice, as it allows for the automatic inference of the number of hidden states in the model. The experimental results are promising, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including comparisons with expert annotations.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points:\n* Provide more details on the computational cost of the HDP-HMM approach and how it compares to other methods.\n* Investigate the use of other feature extraction methods, such as convolutional neural networks, to improve the accuracy of the song unit identification.\n* Consider applying the HDP-HMM approach to other bioacoustic datasets, such as those from different species or environments.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n* Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the HDP-HMM model?\n* How do you plan to address the issue of scalability, as the current approach may not be suitable for larger datasets?\n* Have you considered using other evaluation metrics, such as precision and recall, to assess the performance of the song unit identification method?"
