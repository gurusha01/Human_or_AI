            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to network quantization, which is a crucial technique for reducing the memory footprint of deep neural networks. The authors introduce a Hessian-weighted distortion measure to quantify the impact of quantization errors on the neural network loss function. This measure is used to guide the clustering of network parameters, resulting in a more effective quantization scheme.\nThe paper is well-written, and the experimentation is thorough, covering various state-of-the-art architectures, including LeNet, ResNet, and AlexNet. The results demonstrate that the proposed Hessian-weighted k-means clustering method outperforms the conventional k-means clustering approach, especially when combined with Huffman coding.\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the effectiveness of the proposed technique in minimizing the performance loss due to quantization. The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, and the results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods.\nThe key strengths of the paper include:\n1. Effective technique: The proposed Hessian-weighted k-means clustering method is shown to be highly effective in minimizing the performance loss due to quantization.\n2. Thorough experimentation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on various architectures, demonstrating the robustness of their approach.\n3. Clear motivation: The paper provides a clear motivation for the proposed technique, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the benefits of the Hessian-weighted distortion measure.\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:\n1. Provide more insights into the Hessian computation: While the authors mention that Hessian computation can be performed using the backpropagation method, more details on the computational complexity and the impact of Hessian approximation on the results would be helpful.\n2. Explore the application of the proposed technique to other domains: The authors focus on image classification tasks, but it would be interesting to see how the proposed technique performs on other tasks, such as natural language processing or speech recognition.\n3. Compare with other quantization methods: While the authors compare their approach with k-means clustering, it would be beneficial to compare it with other quantization methods, such as uniform quantization or iterative quantization.\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the Hessian computation process and its computational complexity?\n2. How do you plan to extend the proposed technique to other domains or tasks?\n3. Have you considered comparing the proposed technique with other quantization methods, such as uniform quantization or iterative quantization?"
