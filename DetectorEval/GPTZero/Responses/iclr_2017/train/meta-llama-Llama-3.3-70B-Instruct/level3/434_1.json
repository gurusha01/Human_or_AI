            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals, which is a crucial step in understanding animal communication. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world bioacoustic datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird songs.\nDecision and Reasons\nI decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in bioacoustics, namely the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals.\n2. The authors propose a well-motivated and novel approach to addressing this problem, using a Bayesian non-parametric formulation of HMMs.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper is well-written and clearly presents the idea, making it easy to understand and follow. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and motivate the need for a non-parametric approach to modeling bioacoustic signals. The experimental results on the two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying song units and segmenting bioacoustic signals.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:\n* Provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed approach and potential ways to accelerate the MCMC sampling.\n* Consider evaluating the proposed approach on more datasets and comparing it to other state-of-the-art methods in bioacoustics.\n* Clarify how the proposed approach can be used for classification tasks, such as identifying species from bioacoustic signals.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer:\n* How do the authors plan to address the issue of over-classification, where the model identifies too many song units?\n* Can the authors provide more insights into the interpretation of the song units identified by the model, and how they relate to the underlying biology of the species?\n* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to handle more complex bioacoustic signals, such as those with multiple species vocalizing simultaneously?"
