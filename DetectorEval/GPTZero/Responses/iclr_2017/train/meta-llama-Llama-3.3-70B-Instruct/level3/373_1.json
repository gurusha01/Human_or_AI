            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to combining algorithms and machine learning, specifically in the context of state estimation in robotics. The authors introduce end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs), which encode problem-specific information from algorithms and learn task-specific details from data. The E2E-HFs are demonstrated to be effective in two localization tasks, outperforming traditional methods in terms of data efficiency and accuracy.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's novelty is limited, as the idea of combining algorithms and machine learning is not new, and the specific application to histogram filters, while interesting, does not significantly advance the state-of-the-art. Secondly, the experimental results, while promising, are not comprehensive enough to fully support the claims made in the paper.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's contribution is primarily in the application of end-to-end learning to histogram filters, which, while useful, is not a significant departure from existing work. The experimental results show improved data efficiency and accuracy, but the comparison to other methods, such as LSTMs, is limited, and the evaluation metrics used are not comprehensive. Additionally, the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed approach, which is a critical aspect of any practical application.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed comparison to existing work, including a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. Additionally, the authors should consider evaluating their method on more complex tasks and providing a more comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of their approach. It would also be helpful to include more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the E2E-HFs.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on how the E2E-HFs are initialized and trained, and how the hyperparameters are selected?\n2. How do the authors plan to address the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed approach, particularly for higher-dimensional problems?\n3. Can you provide more comprehensive evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to support the claims made in the paper?"
