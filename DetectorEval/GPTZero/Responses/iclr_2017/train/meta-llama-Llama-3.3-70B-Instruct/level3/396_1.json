The authors develop a specialized neural network architecture with a learning curve layer that improves learning curve predictions. They also compare different methods for generating Bayesian neural networks, including probabilistic backpropagation, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The paper evaluates the predictive performance of these models on several datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting asymptotic values of partially observed learning curves and unobserved learning curves.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept the paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper tackles an important problem in machine learning, namely predicting learning curves, which is crucial for hyperparameter optimization.\n2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and its advantages over existing methods.\n3. The paper provides extensive experimental evaluations on several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution. The authors demonstrate the importance of predicting learning curves and show how their approach can be used to improve hyperparameter optimization. The experimental evaluations are comprehensive, and the results are convincing. The paper also provides a detailed comparison with existing methods, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\nAdditional Feedback and Suggestions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the following:\n1. Provide more details on the implementation of the learning curve layer and the Bayesian neural network architecture.\n2. Consider adding more datasets to the experimental evaluation to demonstrate the generality of the approach.\n3. Provide more insights into the hyperparameter settings used for the experiments and how they were chosen.\n4. Consider adding a section on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to large datasets.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the basis functions used in the learning curve layer?\n2. How did you select the hyperparameters for the Bayesian neural network architecture?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the performance of the proposed approach on datasets with different characteristics (e.g., noise levels, curve shapes)?\n4. Have you considered applying the proposed approach to other machine learning tasks, such as model selection or feature selection?"
