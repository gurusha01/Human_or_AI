The model uses an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN, allowing it to capture fine details in images while maintaining a latent representation of the data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PixelVAE on several datasets, including MNIST, LSUN bedrooms, and 64x64 ImageNet.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant improvement in performance over existing models, particularly on the MNIST dataset. The authors' approach to combining VAEs and PixelCNNs is well-motivated and effectively addresses the limitations of each individual model.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed model, including its architecture, training procedure, and evaluation on various datasets. The results demonstrate that PixelVAE achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while requiring fewer computationally expensive autoregressive layers. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing models, including PixelCNN and VAE, highlighting the advantages of their approach.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more detailed comparisons with concurrent work, such as the \"Variational Lossy Autoencoder\" model. Additionally, including more visualizations of the learned latent representations and providing a more in-depth analysis of the disentangling of high-level factors of variation in the hidden code would be beneficial. The authors should also consider open-sourcing their code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more insight into the design choices behind the PixelVAE architecture, particularly the decision to use a conditional PixelCNN in the decoder?\n2. How do you plan to extend the PixelVAE model to more complex datasets, such as high-resolution images or videos?\n3. Can you provide more details on the computational resources required to train the PixelVAE model, and how it compares to existing models in terms of training time and memory usage?"
