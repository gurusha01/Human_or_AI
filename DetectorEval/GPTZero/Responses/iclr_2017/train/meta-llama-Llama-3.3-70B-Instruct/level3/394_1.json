            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called Zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations by setting them to their previous time step values with a certain probability. The authors claim that Zoneout improves performance across tasks, outperforming many alternative regularizers and achieving results competitive with state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons: (1) the lack of mathematical investigation into Zoneout, including analysis of gradients and potential variational interpretation, which would help explain why it works well, and (2) the unconvincing experiments, which lack a complete hyperparameter search and proper model selection process.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear representation of the method and related work on regularizing RNNs. However, the experimental section has several limitations. The authors only use symbolic datasets and lack experimentation on continuous data, such as from dynamical systems, which makes it unclear whether Zoneout will transfer to other domains. Furthermore, the paper relies heavily on \"tricks\" for improved RNN training, which makes the contribution feel like an \"epsilon improvement\" with little impact.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more thorough mathematical analysis of Zoneout, including an investigation into its gradient dynamics and potential connections to variational inference. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more comprehensive hyperparameter search and model selection process to demonstrate the robustness of their method. It would also be beneficial to include experiments on continuous data and to explore the application of Zoneout to other domains.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper and to provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the gradient dynamics of Zoneout and how it compares to other regularization methods?\n2. How do you plan to address the lack of experimentation on continuous data and the limited scope of the current benchmarks?\n3. Can you provide more insight into the relationship between Zoneout and variational inference, and how this connection can be leveraged to improve the method?"
