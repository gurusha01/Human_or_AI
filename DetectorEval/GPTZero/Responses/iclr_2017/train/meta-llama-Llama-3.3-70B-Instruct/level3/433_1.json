The authors propose four modeling recommendations: using fixed heap memory allocation, structured control flow with loop and if-then-else templates, immutable registers, and separate storage for data of different types. These recommendations are evaluated on a range of program induction tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in the success ratio of learning programs from input/output examples.\nDecision and Reasons\nBased on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:\n1. The paper presents a well-motivated approach to adapting features of modern high-level programming languages to the differentiable setting, which is a significant contribution to the field of inductive program synthesis.\n2. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed modeling recommendations, showing improved results on a range of program induction tasks.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the modeling recommendations and their implementation. The empirical evaluation is thorough, covering a range of tasks and comparing the results to a strong baseline from the programming languages community. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the benefits and limitations of their approach.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed approach, such as integrating perceptual data or using natural language hints about the desired functionality. I would also like to see more analysis of the learned programs, including examples of the actual code produced by the system.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer:\n* How do the proposed modeling recommendations interact with each other, and are there any potential conflicts or trade-offs between them?\n* Can the authors provide more insight into the types of programs that are learned using their approach, and how they compare to programs written by humans?\n* Are there any plans to extend the proposed approach to support more complex data structures, such as arrays or associative maps, or to integrate recursive functions?"
