            "inputText": "This paper introduces a novel formulation of binary auto-encoders, framing the objective function as a min-max reconstruction error that can be solved using alternating minimization methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through proof-of-concept experiments, showing improvements over traditional methods for 1-hidden layer auto-encoders.\nThe specific question tackled by the paper is how to learn a binary autoencoder that reconstructs its inputs with worst-case optimal loss, using only pairwise correlations between encoded and decoded bits. The approach is well-motivated, as it avoids making explicit model assumptions and instead focuses on the minimax structure of the problem.\nThe paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors provide a clear and concise derivation of the optimal decoding function, which emerges as a single layer of logistic sigmoid artificial neurons. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on several datasets, showing competitive results with traditional autoencoders trained with backpropagation.\nOne potential weakness of the paper is the experimental section, which is considered weak due to the vast existing literature on autoencoders and the presence of more effective variants, such as denoising autoencoders. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and provide additional results and visualizations to support their claims.\nTo improve the paper, I would suggest providing more detailed comparisons with other autoencoder variants, such as denoising autoencoders and variational autoencoders. Additionally, the authors could explore the application of their approach to more complex datasets and tasks, such as image and speech recognition.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:\n* How does the choice of reconstruction loss affect the performance of the binary autoencoder?\n* Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the pairwise correlations and the optimal decoding function?\n* How does the approach scale to larger and more complex datasets, and what are the potential limitations of the method?\nOverall, I believe that the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of autoencoders, and with some additional experimentation and analysis, it has the potential to be a strong accept. \nDecision: Accept\nReasons: \n1. The paper introduces a novel formulation of binary auto-encoders that is well-motivated and supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.\n2. The approach has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field of autoencoders, and with some additional experimentation and analysis, it could be even more compelling.\nAdditional feedback: \n* Provide more detailed comparisons with other autoencoder variants.\n* Explore the application of the approach to more complex datasets and tasks.\n* Consider providing more insight into the relationship between the pairwise correlations and the optimal decoding function.\n* Discuss the potential limitations of the method and how it scales to larger and more complex datasets."
