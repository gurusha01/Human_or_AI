The authors describe a careful and interesting dataset validation process, ensuring the data's usefulness and homogeneity. They also provide basic experiments to demonstrate the dataset's potential for learning low-level features in an end-to-end context. The contribution of the work lies primarily in the dataset itself, which is a significant contribution due to the importance of good datasets in advancing research.\nDecision and Reasons\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the substantial contribution of the MusicNet dataset. Although the experiments and techniques used are not particularly groundbreaking, the dataset itself is a valuable resource that can benefit the music processing community. The careful validation process and the potential for learning low-level features demonstrated in the experiments further support the acceptance of this paper.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe MusicNet dataset is a significant contribution, likely ranking in the top 15% of available datasets. The authors' careful validation process ensures the data's quality, and the experiments demonstrate the dataset's potential for learning low-level features. While the techniques used may not be novel, the dataset's value lies in its meticulous annotation and verification, making it a valuable resource for the music processing community.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I would like the authors to provide more details on the dataset's annotation process and the validation methodology. Additionally, I would like to know more about the potential applications of the MusicNet dataset and how it can be used to advance music processing research. Specifically, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n* Can you provide more information on the annotation process, such as the number of annotators and the criteria used for annotation?\n* How do you plan to make the MusicNet dataset available to the research community, and what are the potential applications of this dataset?\n* Can you discuss the limitations of the MusicNet dataset and potential areas for future improvement?"
