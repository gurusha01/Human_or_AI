The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several datasets, including the challenging LAMBADA dataset, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art models. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work and clearly positions the neural cache model within the context of existing research.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training algorithm and its scalability, as well as the hyper-parameter search process. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the interpretability of the results and the expected relationship between hyper-parameters. I would also like to see more discussion on the potential applications of the neural cache model beyond language modeling.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:\n* Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the neural cache model and how it compares to other memory-augmented neural networks?\n* How do you plan to extend the neural cache model to other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation or question answering?\n* Can you provide more insight into the hyper-parameter search process and how you selected the optimal values for the cache size and interpolation parameter?"
