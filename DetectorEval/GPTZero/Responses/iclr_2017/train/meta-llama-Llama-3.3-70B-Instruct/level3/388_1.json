            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-HMM (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the unsupervised learning of song units from bioacoustic data, without requiring prior knowledge of the number of states. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two real-world bioacoustic applications: humpback whale song decomposition and multi-species bird song unit structuration.\nDecision\nBased on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The main reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals, which addresses a significant challenge in the field.\n2. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the HDP-HMM model and its application to bioacoustic data.\n3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on two real-world applications, with promising results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's strengths include:\n1. The introduction of a new concept to bioacoustic analysis, which has the potential to improve our understanding of animal communication.\n2. The use of a BNP formulation of HMMs, which allows for the unsupervised learning of song units without requiring prior knowledge of the number of states.\n3. The demonstration of the approach on two real-world applications, which showcases its potential for practical use.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:\n1. The computational expense of the MCMC sampling algorithm, which may limit its applicability to larger datasets.\n2. The need for further analysis and evaluation of the approach, particularly in terms of its robustness to noise and variability in the data.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:\n1. Provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the approach.\n2. Explore methods to accelerate the MCMC sampling algorithm, such as variational inference or stochastic variational inference.\n3. Consider applying the approach to other bioacoustic datasets, to further demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do the authors plan to address the computational expense of the MCMC sampling algorithm, and what alternatives have they considered?\n2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the approach?\n3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the robustness of the approach to noise and variability in the data, and what methods have they considered for improving its robustness?"
