The proposed algorithm is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on crosslingual training and Bayesian non-parametrics, and demonstrates significant improvements over previous methods.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed algorithm, including a detailed description of the model, learning procedure, and experimental setup. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing improved performance on word sense induction tasks and comparable results to state-of-the-art methods using significantly less data. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the effects of language family distance and window size on the performance of the model.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:\n* Provide more detailed analysis of the learned sense vectors and their relationships to specific words and contexts.\n* Explore the application of the proposed algorithm to other languages and tasks, such as named entity recognition and machine translation.\n* Consider using more advanced evaluation metrics, such as semantic similarity measures, to assess the quality of the learned embeddings.\n* How do the authors plan to address the issue of parameter tuning, particularly with regards to the choice of hyperparameters and window sizes?\n* Can the authors provide more insight into the computational resources required to train the model, and how this might impact the scalability of the approach to larger datasets and more complex tasks?"
