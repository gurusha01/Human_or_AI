The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a new sequence learning task, predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences, and show that it significantly improves sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, while the proposed approach is novel and shows promise, the experimental results are not comprehensive enough to fully support the claims made by the authors. Secondly, the comparison with other curriculum learning methods is limited, and it is not clear whether the proposed approach is superior to other methods in all scenarios.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper presents some interesting results, but the experimental setup has some limitations. For example, the comparison with other curriculum learning methods is limited to only two other methods, and the results are not consistent across all experiments. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis of the origins of the performance improvement, and more discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct more comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with other curriculum learning methods and analysis of the sensitivity of the proposed approach to hyperparameters. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach, and consider adding more related work to provide context for the proposed approach.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the experimental setup, and what additional experiments do they plan to conduct to further support their claims?\n* Can the authors provide more analysis of the origins of the performance improvement, and what insights do they have into why the proposed approach is effective?\n* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other sequence learning tasks, and what potential applications do they see for the proposed approach?"
