            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to transferring knowledge from a powerful teacher network to a smaller student network by leveraging attention mechanisms. The authors define attention as a set of spatial maps that encode the importance of different regions in the input data for the network's output decision. They introduce two types of attention maps: activation-based and gradient-based, and demonstrate that these maps can be used to improve the performance of the student network. The paper presents experimental results on various image classification datasets, including CIFAR, ImageNet, and fine-grained recognition tasks, showing consistent improvements in performance when using attention transfer.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Well-motivated approach: The paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to transferring knowledge from a teacher network to a student network using attention mechanisms. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the literature and provide a novel perspective on how attention can be used for knowledge transfer.\n2. Strong experimental results: The paper presents strong experimental results on various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed attention transfer approach. The results show consistent improvements in performance, which suggests that the approach is robust and generalizable.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the attention mechanisms and their application to knowledge transfer. The authors demonstrate that attention maps can be used to identify important regions in the input data and that these maps can be transferred from a teacher network to a student network to improve its performance. The experimental results are well-presented and provide a clear comparison of the proposed approach with other knowledge transfer methods.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I would suggest the following:\n* Provide more details on the implementation of the attention transfer approach, including the specific architectures used and the hyperparameters tuned.\n* Consider adding more analysis on the attention maps themselves, such as visualizations of the maps and discussions on what they reveal about the network's decision-making process.\n* How do the authors plan to extend the attention transfer approach to other tasks, such as object detection or weakly-supervised localization?\n* Can the authors provide more insights on why the attention transfer approach works better than other knowledge transfer methods, such as knowledge distillation, in certain cases?"
