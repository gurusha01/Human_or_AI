            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, A2T (Attend, Adapt, and Transfer), designed for transfer learning in reinforcement learning tasks. A2T aims to address two significant challenges in transfer learning: avoiding negative transfer, where the transfer hampers the learning process, and enabling selective transfer, where the agent can select and transfer knowledge from multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. The authors claim that A2T can effectively avoid negative transfer while performing selective transfer from multiple source tasks in the same domain. They demonstrate the architecture's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on various learning algorithms and tasks, including policy transfer and value transfer.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Well-motivated approach: The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing transfer learning approaches and proposes a well-motivated solution, A2T, which addresses the challenges of negative transfer and selective transfer.\n2. Empirical evidence: The authors provide extensive empirical evaluations of A2T on various tasks and algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in avoiding negative transfer and performing selective transfer.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the related work, highlighting the limitations of existing transfer learning approaches. The authors also provide a clear and detailed explanation of the A2T architecture, including the attention mechanism and the base network. The empirical evaluations are comprehensive, covering various tasks, including chain world, puddle world, and Atari 2600 games. The results demonstrate that A2T can effectively avoid negative transfer and perform selective transfer, outperforming baseline methods in many cases.\nAdditional Feedback and Questions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors:\n* Provide more detailed analysis of the attention mechanism and its role in selective transfer.\n* Investigate the applicability of A2T to more complex tasks, such as continuous control tasks.\n* Compare A2T with other state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches in reinforcement learning.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer:\n* How does the attention mechanism handle cases where multiple source tasks are relevant to the same part of the state space?\n* Can A2T be applied to tasks with different state and action spaces?\n* How does the base network learn to replicate the useful source task solutions, and what is the role of the attention mechanism in this process?"
