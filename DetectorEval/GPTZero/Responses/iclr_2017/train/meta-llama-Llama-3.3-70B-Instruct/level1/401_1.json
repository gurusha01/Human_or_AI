The method is tested on various networks and datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, and demonstrates significant reductions in training time.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in accelerating training times.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of slow training times in deep neural networks and motivates the need for a new approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the novelty of their approach. The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the introspection network in accelerating training times across various networks and datasets.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and units in the introspection network, and the selection of jump points. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the generalization capacity of the introspection network to other tasks and datasets.
