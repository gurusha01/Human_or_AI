            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluating the performance of decoder-based generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs). The authors suggest using Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate the log-likelihood of these models, which is a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the advantages and limitations of AIS and demonstrates its effectiveness in evaluating the performance of decoder-based models.\nThe paper tackles the specific question of how to evaluate the performance of decoder-based generative models, which is a challenging problem due to the intractability of log-likelihood estimation. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses a significant limitation of existing evaluation methods, such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which can be inaccurate and misleading. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the AIS method and its application to decoder-based models, making it easy to follow and understand.\nThe paper supports its claims through extensive experiments on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of AIS in evaluating the performance of decoder-based models. The results show that AIS outperforms KDE and other existing evaluation methods, providing more accurate and reliable estimates of log-likelihood. The paper also provides insightful analysis and visualization of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different models and evaluation methods.\nBased on the analysis, I decide to Accept this paper. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper tackles a significant and challenging problem in the field of generative models, providing a novel and effective solution.\n2. The approach is well-motivated, and the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the AIS method and its application to decoder-based models.\n3. The paper supports its claims through extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of AIS in evaluating the performance of decoder-based models.\nTo further improve the paper, I provide the following feedback:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the AIS method, as well as its computational requirements and scalability.\n* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the results to these choices.\n* The paper could include more visualizations and analysis of the results, particularly for the posterior samples and the reconstruction of digit \"2\" for each model.\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n* Can you provide more details on the computational requirements and scalability of the AIS method, particularly for larger datasets and models?\n* How sensitive are the results to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of intermediate distributions and the transition operator?\n* Can you provide more insight into the visualization of posterior samples and the reconstruction of digit \"2\" for each model, particularly for GAN-10 and GAN-50?"
