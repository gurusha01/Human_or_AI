The authors claim that successive layers within a stage cooperate to compute a single level of representation, which is then iteratively refined by subsequent layers. This view is supported by mathematical derivations and experimental results, including a comparison of Highway and Residual networks on image classification and language modeling tasks.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, providing a new perspective on Highway and Residual networks; and (2) the paper supports its claims with a combination of mathematical derivations, experimental results, and visualizations.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific question/problem by challenging the traditional representation view of deep learning and proposing an alternative viewpoint based on unrolled iterative estimation. The approach is well-motivated, as it provides a unified theory for understanding Highway and Residual networks, and is well-placed in the literature, building on existing research on deep learning and neural networks. The paper also provides a range of supporting evidence, including mathematical derivations, experimental results, and visualizations, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed perspective.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed explanations of the mathematical derivations, particularly in Section 3. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more experimental results, such as comparisons with other architectures or tasks, to further demonstrate the generality of the proposed perspective. Finally, I would like to see more discussion of the implications of the unrolled iterative estimation perspective for future research in deep learning.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions: (1) Can you provide more intuition on why the unrolled iterative estimation perspective is particularly well-suited for understanding Highway and Residual networks? (2) How do you think the proposed perspective will impact the design of future neural network architectures?
