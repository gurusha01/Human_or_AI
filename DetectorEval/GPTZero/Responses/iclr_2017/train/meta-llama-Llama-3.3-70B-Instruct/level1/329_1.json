            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes an augmented training procedure for generative adversarial networks (GANs) that addresses the shortcomings of the original GAN framework. The authors introduce a denoising auto-encoder to estimate and track the distribution of discriminator features, which are used to propose high-level targets for the generator. This new loss is combined with the original adversarial loss, resulting in a hybrid criterion that improves the quality of generated samples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several datasets, including CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of Inception score and visual quality.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their method, and the experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of generated samples.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of GANs, namely the difficulty of training GANs to produce high-quality samples on diverse datasets. The authors provide a thorough review of the literature and clearly motivate their approach, which is based on the idea of using a denoising auto-encoder to estimate the distribution of discriminator features. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with significant improvements in Inception score and visual quality.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the denoising auto-encoder, including the architecture and hyperparameters used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visual examples of the generated samples, as well as a more detailed analysis of the failure cases. Finally, I would like to see more discussion on the potential limitations and future directions of the proposed method.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How did you choose the hyperparameters for the denoising auto-encoder, and what is the sensitivity of the results to these hyperparameters?\n* Can you provide more details on the architecture and implementation of the denoising auto-encoder, including the number of layers and units used?\n* How do you plan to address the potential issue of mode collapse, which is a common problem in GAN training?\n* Can you provide more visual examples of the generated samples, including examples of failure cases and cases where the proposed method outperforms existing methods?"
