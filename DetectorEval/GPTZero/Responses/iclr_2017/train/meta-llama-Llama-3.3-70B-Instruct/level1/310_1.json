The authors demonstrate that simple neural network agents can learn to coordinate in these games and assign meanings to symbols that capture general conceptual properties of objects. They also show that grounding the communication in natural language is possible by combining the game with a supervised task.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing on ideas from linguistics, cognitive science, and game theory. Secondly, the paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims, including results from experiments with different sender architectures and vocabulary sizes.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of AI, namely how to develop agents that can communicate effectively with humans. The authors provide a clear and well-structured framework for language learning, and their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The use of referential games as a testbed for language learning is a novel and interesting contribution, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the experimental setup and the hyperparameters used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis of the emergent language and its properties, such as its syntax and semantics. The authors could also consider exploring more complex scenarios, such as multi-step communication or communication with multiple agents.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How do the authors plan to scale up their approach to more complex language learning tasks, such as conversation or dialogue?\n* Can the authors provide more insight into the nature of the emergent language and its relationship to human language?\n* How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach in more realistic scenarios, such as human-agent communication?"
