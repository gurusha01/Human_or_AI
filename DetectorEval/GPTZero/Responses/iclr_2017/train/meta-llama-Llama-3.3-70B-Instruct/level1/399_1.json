This layer consists of a set of expert networks and a trainable gating network that selects a sparse combination of experts to process each input. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on large-scale language modeling and machine translation tasks, achieving significant improvements in model capacity and computational efficiency.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in deep learning, namely the limitation of model capacity due to computational constraints.\n2. The authors propose a well-motivated and novel approach to address this problem, and provide extensive experimental evidence to support their claims.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and thorough motivation for the proposed approach, including a detailed analysis of the challenges and limitations of existing methods. The authors also provide a comprehensive description of the MoE layer and its components, including the gating network and the expert networks. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating significant improvements in model capacity and computational efficiency on large-scale language modeling and machine translation tasks.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training procedure and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the specialization of the expert networks and how they contribute to the overall performance of the model. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:\n* How do the expert networks specialize in different tasks or domains?\n* What is the effect of the number of experts and the sparsity of the gating network on the overall performance of the model?\n* How does the MoE layer compare to other approaches to conditional computation, such as hierarchical or recursive models?"
