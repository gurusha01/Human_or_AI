The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two tasks, computer vision and speech recognition, achieving 20X to 200X compression rates on fully-connected layers.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in deep learning, and (2) the paper provides strong empirical evidence supporting the claims, with impressive compression rates and minimal performance loss.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific and important question in deep learning, namely, reducing the computational and memory costs of fully-connected layers. The approach is well-motivated, building on previous work on weight sharing, pruning, and quantization. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the density-diversity penalty regularizer and its efficient optimization using a \"sorting trick\". The empirical results on MNIST and TIMIT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with significant compression rates and comparable performance to the original models.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the learned sparsity and diversity patterns of the trained weight matrices. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the application of the density-diversity penalty to other types of neural network layers, such as convolutional layers, and to other domains beyond computer vision and speech recognition. The authors may also consider providing more detailed comparisons with other compression methods, such as \"deep compression\", to highlight the advantages and limitations of their approach.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the strength of the density-diversity penalty, and how they were tuned?\n2. How do the learned sparsity and diversity patterns of the trained weight matrices relate to the underlying structure of the data, and can this be used to improve performance or provide insights into the data?\n3. Have you explored the application of the density-diversity penalty to other types of neural network layers or domains, and if so, what were the results?"
