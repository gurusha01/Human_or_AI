The paper tackles a specific and important problem in reinforcement learning, namely the challenge of learning policies that can generalize to different target domains.\n2. The approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and supported by theoretical and empirical evidence, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in learning robust policies.\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of their approach, which demonstrates a good understanding of the field and the challenges involved.\nTo improve the paper, I would suggest the following:\n* Provide more details on the implementation of the algorithm, such as the specific hyperparameters used and the computational resources required.\n* Consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to different types of disturbances and uncertainties.\n* Provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the different components of the algorithm, such as the ensemble size and the adversarial training parameter.\nSome questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:\n* How do the authors choose the ensemble size and the adversarial training parameter, and what is the sensitivity of the algorithm to these hyperparameters?\n* Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to implement the algorithm, and how it scales to more complex tasks and larger ensemble sizes?\n* How do the authors plan to extend the algorithm to more complex tasks and real-world applications, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of the approach?"
