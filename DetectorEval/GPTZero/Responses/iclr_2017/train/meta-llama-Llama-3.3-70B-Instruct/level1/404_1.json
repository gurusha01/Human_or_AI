            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper introduces Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), a novel approach to neural sequence modeling that combines the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. QRNNs address the limitations of traditional RNNs, which are unable to parallelize computations across timesteps, by using convolutional layers and a minimalist recurrent pooling function. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of QRNNs on several natural language tasks, including language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation, achieving better predictive accuracy and significantly faster computation times compared to LSTM-based models.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the well-motivated approach and the strong empirical results demonstrating the advantages of QRNNs over traditional RNNs. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the QRNN architecture and its variants, and the experiments are thoroughly conducted and well-presented.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of neural sequence modeling, namely the limitations of traditional RNNs in handling long sequences. The approach is well-motivated, drawing on the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The empirical results are strong, demonstrating the effectiveness of QRNNs on several tasks and showcasing significant improvements in computation time. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, discussing the implications and potential applications of QRNNs.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more detailed explanations of the QRNN architecture and its variants, particularly the convolutional and pooling components. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations or illustrations to facilitate understanding of the QRNN architecture and its differences from traditional RNNs. The authors may also consider providing more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of QRNNs, as well as potential future directions for research.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the QRNN architecture, particularly the convolutional and pooling components?\n2. How do the authors plan to address potential limitations and challenges of QRNNs, such as handling very long sequences or sequences with complex dependencies?\n3. What are the potential applications of QRNNs beyond the tasks evaluated in the paper, and how do the authors envision QRNNs being used in practice?"
