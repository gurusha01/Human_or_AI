The module uses fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network. The authors demonstrate the versatility of the module by adding it to various networks, including convolutional, sequence-to-sequence, and recurrent-convolutional models, and show state-of-the-art results on the Omniglot dataset and a large-scale machine translation task.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in deep learning, and the proposed solution is novel and effective.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the memory module, including its architecture, update rules, and efficient nearest-neighbor computation. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of related work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of existing approaches. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the memory module in various settings, including image classification, machine translation, and a synthetic task. The paper also discusses the challenges of evaluating one-shot learning and proposes a temporary solution, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, as well as the computational resources required to train the models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the memory module's behavior, such as the distribution of memory keys and values, and how they evolve during training. The authors may also consider providing more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the machine translation task.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:\n1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of evaluating one-shot learning, and what alternative metrics do they propose?\n2. Can the authors provide more insights into the update rule for the memory module, and how it affects the performance of the model?\n3. How do the authors plan to extend the memory module to more complex tasks, such as multi-task learning or meta-learning?"
