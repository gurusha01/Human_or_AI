            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper introduces OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that enforces local feature orthogonality in deep neural networks. The authors argue that regularizing negatively correlated features can be an obstacle to effective decorrelation and propose a method that only regularizes positively correlated feature weights. The approach is shown to be effective in reducing overfitting and improving the performance of state-of-the-art models on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the problem, and the proposed solution is novel and effective.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific question/problem, namely, the limitation of feature decorrelation regularization in deep neural networks. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a thorough review of existing regularization techniques. The paper supports its claims with extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of OrthoReg in reducing overfitting and improving model performance. The results are impressive, with OrthoReg outperforming state-of-the-art models on several benchmarks.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the theoretical aspects of OrthoReg, such as the relationship between feature orthogonality and overfitting. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks or generative models. The authors may also consider providing more details on the computational cost of OrthoReg and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more intuition on why regularizing negatively correlated features can be harmful, and how OrthoReg addresses this issue?\n2. How do you plan to extend OrthoReg to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks or generative models?\n3. Can you provide more details on the computational cost of OrthoReg and its potential applications in real-world scenarios?"
