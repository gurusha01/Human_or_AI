The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of previous methods, such as concatenation and scalar gating. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including visualization and sampling of gate values, which helps to understand the effectiveness of the fine-grained gating mechanism.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors to provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources used for the experiments. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the types of words or tokens that benefit the most from the fine-grained gating mechanism. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the results change when using different types of word embeddings or character-level representations?
