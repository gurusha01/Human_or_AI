            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes a novel neural memory access paradigm called Lie-access memory, which is based on Lie groups and provides a continuous and differentiable way to access memory. The authors argue that traditional neural memory systems lack specific structure important for relative indexing and propose Lie-access memory as an alternative. They implement a Lie-access neural Turing machine (LANTM) and experiment with it on various algorithmic tasks, showing that it can learn to solve these tasks with high accuracy.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in neural memory systems, and (2) the approach is well-supported by theoretical arguments and experimental results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of neural memory systems and the limitations of traditional approaches. The authors propose a novel solution based on Lie groups, which provides a continuous and differentiable way to access memory. The experimental results show that the LANTM model can learn to solve various algorithmic tasks with high accuracy, outperforming traditional baseline models. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results and discusses the potential limitations and future directions of the approach.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the LANTM model, such as the specific Lie groups used and the hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the memory access patterns learned by the model, as well as more detailed analysis of the results on each task. Finally, the authors may want to consider discussing the potential applications of Lie-access memory beyond algorithmic tasks, such as in natural language processing or computer vision.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* Can you provide more details on the specific Lie groups used in the experiments and how they were chosen?\n* How did you initialize the LANTM model to favor Lie access over random access?\n* Can you provide more visualizations of the memory access patterns learned by the model on different tasks?\n* How do you plan to extend the Lie-access memory approach to more complex tasks and applications?"
