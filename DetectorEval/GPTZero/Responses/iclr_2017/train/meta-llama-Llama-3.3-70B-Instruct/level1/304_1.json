The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by implementing recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. They show that the learned recursive programs achieve superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts of training data. Moreover, they provide a verification procedure to prove that the learned recursive programs generalize perfectly, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper. The main reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of neural programming, which is the poor generalizability of neural networks that learn programs from data.\n2. The approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and grounded in the literature. They provide a clear explanation of how recursion can help improve generalizability and interpretability.\n3. The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support the claims made by the authors. The results on the four tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving superior generalizability and interpretability.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem of generalizability in neural programming and proposes a novel solution that incorporates recursion into neural architectures. The authors provide a clear explanation of how recursion can help reduce the complexity of programs and make them more interpretable. The empirical results on the four tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving superior generalizability and interpretability. Additionally, the paper provides a verification procedure to prove that the learned recursive programs generalize perfectly, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the recursion mechanism in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework. Additionally, they could provide more analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger programs. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different tasks and datasets to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on how the recursion mechanism is implemented in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework?\n2. How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex programs and larger datasets?\n3. Can you provide more analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger programs?"
