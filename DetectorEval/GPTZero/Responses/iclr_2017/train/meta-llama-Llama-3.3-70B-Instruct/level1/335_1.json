            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised learning of representations based on the infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. The authors propose a hierarchical infomax approach to optimize the mutual information between the input and output of a neural network, which is approximated using an asymptotic formula. The method is shown to be robust and efficient for extracting salient features from input datasets, outperforming existing methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper tackles a specific question/problem of unsupervised learning of representations, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning. The approach is well-motivated, building on the infomax principle and asymptotic approximation of mutual information. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including the hierarchical infomax approach and the optimization algorithm.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that it can learn complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete basis vectors quickly from different datasets. The results are compared to existing methods, such as ICA and sparse coding, and the proposed method is shown to have a faster convergence rate and better robustness.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Clear problem formulation: The paper clearly formulates the problem of unsupervised learning of representations and motivates the use of the infomax principle.\n2. Novel methodology: The hierarchical infomax approach is a novel contribution, and the paper provides a detailed explanation of the methodology.\n3. Experimental evaluation: The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed method, including comparisons to existing methods.\n4. Robustness and efficiency: The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method, which is an important aspect of machine learning algorithms.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, the authors could consider the following suggestions:\n1. Provide more intuition: While the paper provides a clear explanation of the methodology, it would be helpful to provide more intuition about why the hierarchical infomax approach works.\n2. Compare to other methods: The paper compares the proposed method to ICA and sparse coding, but it would be interesting to compare it to other methods, such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs).\n3. Provide more details on the optimization algorithm: The paper provides a brief description of the optimization algorithm, but it would be helpful to provide more details on the implementation and hyperparameter tuning.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more intuition about why the hierarchical infomax approach works?\n2. How do you choose the hyperparameters for the optimization algorithm?\n3. Have you considered applying the proposed method to other domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision?"
