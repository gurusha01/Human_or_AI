            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper presents a novel method for visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input, called prediction difference analysis. This method highlights areas in the input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class, overcoming several shortcomings of previous methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on natural images (ImageNet data) and medical images (MRI brain scans), showcasing its potential to improve model interpretability and accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in high-stakes applications.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being that the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their method, including its theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of deep learning, namely, how to interpret the decisions made by complex neural networks. The authors' approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on visualization and interpretability. The method is rigorously evaluated on multiple datasets, including ImageNet and MRI scans, demonstrating its effectiveness in highlighting relevant features and providing insights into the decision-making process of the network. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their approach.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed comparisons with other visualization methods, such as saliency maps and feature importance scores. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more examples of how the prediction difference analysis can be used in practice, such as in medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. The authors may also want to explore the use of more advanced generative models for conditional sampling, as mentioned in the future work section.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on how the conditional sampling method is implemented, particularly with regards to the choice of the multivariate normal distribution?\n2. How do you plan to address the computational resources required for the method, particularly for larger datasets and more complex models?\n3. Can you discuss potential applications of the prediction difference analysis in other domains, such as natural language processing or recommender systems?"
