            "inputText": "The authors propose a conceptually simple method for regularisation of recurrent neural networks. The idea is related to dropout, but instead of zeroing out units, they are instead set to their respective values at the preceding time step element-wise with a certain probability.\nOverall, the paper is well written. The method is clearly represented up to issues raised by reviewers during the pre-review question phase. The related work is complete and probably the best currently available on the matter of regularising RNNs.\nThe experimental section focuses on comparing the method with the current SOTA on a set of NLP benchmarks and a synthetic problem. All of the experiments focus on sequences over discrete values. An additional experiment also shows that the sequential Jacobian is far higher for long-term dependencies than in the dropout case.\nOverall, the paper bears great potential. However, I do see some points.\n1) As raised during the pre-review questions, I would like to see the results of experiments that feature a complete hyper parameter search. I.e. a proper model selection process,as it should be standard in the community. I do not see why this was not done, especially as the author count seems to indicate that the necessary resources are available.\nI want to repeat at this point that Table 2 of the paper shows that validation error is not a reliable estimator for testing error in the respective data set. Thus, overfitting the model selection process is a serious concern here.\nZoneout does not seem to improve that much in the other tasks.\n2) Zoneout is not investigated well mathematically. E.g. an analysis of the of the form of gradients from unit K at time step T to unit K' at time step T-R would have been interesting, especially as these are not necessarily non-zero for dropout. Also, the question whether zoneout has a variational interpretation in the spirit of Yarin Gal's work is an obvious one. I can see that it is if we treat zoneout in a resnet framework and dropout on the incremental parts. Overall, little effort is done answering the question why zoneout works well, even though the literature bears plenty of starting points for such analysis.\n3) The data sets used are only symbolic. It would have been great if more ground was covered, i.e. continuous data such as from dynamical systems. To me it is not obvious whether it will transfer right away.\nAn extreme amount of \"tricks\" is being published currently for improved RNN training. How does zoneout stand out? It is a nice idea, and simple to implement. However, the paper under delivers: the experiments do not convince me (see 1) and 3)). There authors do not provide convincing theoretical insights either. (2)\nConsequently, the paper reduces to a \"epsilon improvement, great text, mediocre experimental evaluation, little theoretical insight\"."
