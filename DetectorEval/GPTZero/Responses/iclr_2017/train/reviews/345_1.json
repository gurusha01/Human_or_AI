            "inputText": "This paper proposes to use an empirical Bayesian approach to learn the parameters of a neural network, and their priors.\nA mixture model prior over the weights leads to a clustering effect in the weight posterior distributions (which are approximated with delta peaks). \nThis clustering effect can exploited for parameter quantisation and compression of the network parameters.\nThe authors show that this leads to compression rates and predictive accuracy comparable to related approaches. \nEarlier work [Han et al. 2015] is based on a three-stage process of pruning small magnitude weights, clustering the remaining ones, and updating the cluster centres to optimise performance. The current work provides a more principled approach that does not have such an ad-hoc multi-stage structure, but a single iterative optimisation process.\nA first experiment, described in section 6.1 shows that an empirical Bayes' approach, without the use of hyper priors, already leads to a pronounced clustering effect and to setting many weights to zero. \nIn particular a compression rate of 64.2 is obtained on the LeNet300-100 model.\nIn section 6.1 the text refers to figure C, I suppose this should be figure 1.\nSection 6.2 describes an experiment where hyper-priors are used, and the parameters of these distributions, as well as other hyper-parameters such as the learning rates, are being optimised using Spearmint (Snoek et al., 2012). Figure 2 shows the performance of the different points in the hyper-parameter space that have been evaluated (each trained network gives an accuracy-compressionrate point in the graph). The text claims that best results lie on a line, this seems a little opportunistic interpretation given the limited data. Moreover, it would be useful to add a small discussion on whether such a linear relationship would be expected or not. Currently the results of this experiment lack interpretation.\nSection 6.3 describes results obtained for both CNN models and compares results to the recent results of (Han et al., 2015) and (Guo et al., 2016).\nComparable results are obtained in terms of compression rate and accuracy. \nThe authors state that their current algorithm is too slow to be useful for larger models such as VGG-19, but they do briefly report some results obtained for this model (but do not compare to related work). It would be useful here to explain what slows the training down with respect to standard training without the weight clustering approach, and how the proposed algorithm scales in terms of the relevant quantities of the data and the model.\nThe contribution of this paper is mostly experimental, leveraging fairly standard ideas from empirical Bayesian learning to introduce weight clustering effects in CNN training.\nThis being said, it is an interesting result that such a relatively straightforward approach leads to results that are on par with state-of-the-art, but more ad-hoc, network compression techniques.\nThe paper could be improved by clearly describing the algorithm used for training, and how it scales to large networks and datasets.\nAnother point that would deserve further discussion is how the hyper-parameter search is performed ( not using test data I assume), and how the compared methods dealt with the search over hyper-parameters to determine the accuracy-compression tradeoff. Ideally, I think, methods should be evaluated across different points on this trade-off."
