            "inputText": "The paper addresses the critical problem of detecting misclassified and out-of-distribution (OOD) examples in machine learning models, presenting a simple baseline approach based on softmax probabilities. The authors claim that correctly classified examples tend to have higher maximum softmax probabilities than misclassified or OOD examples, enabling effective detection. They evaluate this baseline across diverse tasks in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and automatic speech recognition (ASR), demonstrating its utility. Additionally, the paper introduces an auxiliary abnormality module that leverages internal neural network representations to improve detection performance, showcasing its potential for future research.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a compelling case for acceptance due to its practical contributions and strong experimental validation. The proposed softmax-based baseline is simple yet effective, providing a foundational method for error and OOD detection. Furthermore, the introduction of the abnormality module demonstrates innovation and highlights opportunities for further advancements in this underexplored area.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Well-Motivated Problem: The paper tackles a pressing issue in AI safety\"\"detecting when models fail silently with high-confidence predictions. The problem is well-motivated with real-world implications, such as in medical diagnosis and autonomous systems.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors evaluate their methods across multiple domains (vision, NLP, ASR) and datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, IMDB), ensuring robustness and generalizability. Metrics like AUROC and AUPR are appropriately used to assess detection performance, and statistical significance is reported.\n3. Novelty and Practicality: While softmax probabilities have been criticized as unreliable confidence estimates, the paper demonstrates their utility for error and OOD detection. The abnormality module further contributes novelty by leveraging internal network representations to outperform the baseline in some cases.\n4. Encouragement for Future Work: The paper provides clear benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics, encouraging the community to build upon its findings. The discussion of future research directions is thoughtful and constructive.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Baseline Limitations: While the softmax-based baseline is effective, its reliance on softmax probabilities may limit its applicability to architectures or tasks where softmax is not used. The authors could discuss alternative confidence measures or extend their approach to non-softmax models.\n2. Abnormality Module Details: The abnormality module is promising but underexplored. Providing more implementation details and ablation studies would strengthen its contribution. For example, how sensitive is the module to the choice of auxiliary tasks or noise types?\n3. Broader Implications: The paper could elaborate on the broader implications of its findings. For instance, how might these detection methods integrate into real-world systems, and what are the computational trade-offs?\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does the performance of the abnormality module vary with different types of OOD examples or noise levels? Are there cases where it fails to outperform the baseline?\n2. Have you considered extending the baseline to other confidence measures, such as entropy or Bayesian uncertainty, to improve detection?\n3. Could the proposed methods be adapted for real-time or resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices?\nOverall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of AI safety and reliability, providing both a strong baseline and a promising direction for future research."
