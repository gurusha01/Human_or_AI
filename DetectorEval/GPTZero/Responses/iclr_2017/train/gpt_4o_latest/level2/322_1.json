            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThe paper introduces a novel framework termed Nonparametric Neural Networks (NNNs) for dynamically adapting the size of a neural network during a single training cycle. The authors propose a theoretically sound approach that combines unit addition and removal with a fan-in or fan-out regularizer to ensure the network converges to a finite size. Additionally, the paper presents a new optimization algorithm, Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent (AdaRad), which normalizes gradients in a manner suitable for nonparametric networks. The experimental results demonstrate promising performance on benchmark datasets, with NNNs often outperforming parametric networks of similar size. The authors also explore scalability by applying the framework to a large dataset, achieving competitive results.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for acceptance:\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Soundness: The paper addresses a significant challenge in neural network design\"\"automatically determining network size\"\"by introducing a theoretically grounded framework. The proof of convergence to a finite dimensionality under fan-in or fan-out regularization is a strong contribution.\n2. Practical Utility: The proposed framework eliminates the need for expensive hyperparameter searches over network size, making it highly relevant for tasks with limited prior information.\n3. Experimental Validation: The framework is validated on standard benchmarks and a large-scale dataset, showing competitive or superior performance compared to parametric networks.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper makes a compelling case for the utility of nonparametric neural networks in scenarios where prior knowledge about network size is unavailable. By dynamically adding and removing units during training, the framework adapts to the task's complexity, often resulting in smaller yet high-performing networks. The introduction of AdaRad is another highlight, as it addresses the unique challenges of training nonparametric networks, such as ensuring new units learn effectively before being pruned.\nThe experimental results are robust, covering three benchmark datasets and a large-scale dataset. The analysis of network growth and unit survival during training provides valuable insights into the framework's behavior. The comparison with parametric networks, both of the same size and through exhaustive random search, further strengthens the paper's claims.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Presentation: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the proofs in the appendix are dense and could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility.\n2. Broader Dataset Evaluation: The experiments focus on relatively simple datasets. Extending the evaluation to more complex tasks (e.g., ImageNet or large-scale NLP tasks) would strengthen the paper's impact.\n3. Comparison with Recent Methods: The paper briefly discusses related work but does not compare directly with recent advancements in neural architecture search or pruning methods. Including such comparisons would contextualize the contributions more effectively.\n4. Unit Addition Schedule: The authors acknowledge that the unit addition schedule is fixed and suboptimal. Exploring adaptive schedules or learning-based approaches could further enhance the framework.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the performance of AdaRad compare to other optimizers like Adam or RMSprop in training parametric networks? Could AdaRad be generalized for broader use cases?\n2. The experiments suggest that the framework struggles with the convex dataset. Could you elaborate on why this might be the case and how the framework could be improved for such tasks?\n3. Have you considered extending the framework to convolutional or transformer-based architectures, as mentioned in the future work section? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural network optimization by introducing a novel, theoretically sound framework for dynamically adapting network size. While there is room for improvement in terms of clarity and broader evaluation, the core ideas are innovative and well-supported by experiments. I recommend acceptance, as the work has the potential to inspire future research in automated neural architecture design."
