            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel image compression method leveraging nonlinear transform coding, inspired by biological visual systems, and optimized end-to-end for rate–distortion performance. The key contributions include the use of Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) transforms, a relaxation of the quantization process for optimization, and a demonstration of superior rate–distortion performance compared to JPEG and JPEG 2000. The authors also highlight significant improvements in visual quality, supported by MS-SSIM evaluations, and provide a complete entropy coding framework for practical deployment.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted due to its strong contributions to the field of image compression, particularly its innovative use of biologically-inspired nonlinearities and its rigorous optimization framework. The demonstrated improvements in rate–distortion performance and visual quality over established methods like JPEG and JPEG 2000 make this work highly impactful.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Claims and Support: The paper claims to outperform JPEG and JPEG 2000 in rate–distortion performance and visual quality, which is well-supported by empirical results on standard datasets. The use of MS-SSIM and PSNR metrics provides a robust evaluation framework, and the visual examples convincingly demonstrate the qualitative advantages of the proposed method.\n \n2. Novelty and Field Knowledge: The use of GDN transforms, inspired by biological neurons, is a novel approach in image compression. The paper demonstrates a deep understanding of the field, referencing relevant literature on transform coding, variational autoencoders, and perceptual metrics. The authors also position their work effectively against prior methods, such as those by Toderici et al. and Gregor et al.\n3. Completeness and Practicality: The method is presented as a complete pipeline, including an entropy coding scheme, making it deployable in real-world scenarios. The inclusion of actual bit rates rather than entropy estimates further enhances its practical relevance.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity on Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that the method underperforms JPEG 2000 at high bit rates for certain images, a more detailed discussion of these limitations would be valuable. For example, exploring why the method struggles in these cases and how it might be improved would strengthen the paper.\n2. Comparison to Recent Methods: The paper briefly mentions related work by Toderici et al. and Gregor et al., but a more detailed quantitative comparison with these methods would provide additional context for the proposed approach's advantages.\n3. Generalization to Other Metrics: The authors note that optimizing for perceptual metrics like MS-SSIM could yield further improvements, but this is not explored in the current work. A discussion of how the method might adapt to such metrics would be insightful.\n4. Broader Applicability: While the focus is on image compression, the authors suggest potential applications in supervised learning tasks. Expanding on this idea, perhaps with preliminary experiments, could broaden the paper's impact.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the method perform on datasets with different characteristics, such as medical or satellite images, where compression requirements may differ?\n2. Can the proposed framework be extended to video compression, and if so, what challenges might arise?\n3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of λ, and could a single model be trained to operate effectively across a range of rate–distortion trade-offs?\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image compression and demonstrates strong potential for further advancements. The innovative use of biologically-inspired transforms and the rigorous evaluation framework make it a valuable addition to the conference."
