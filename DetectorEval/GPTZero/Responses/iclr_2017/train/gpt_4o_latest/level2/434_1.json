            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel reparameterization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks by incorporating batch normalization (BN) into both input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden transitions, addressing internal covariate shift in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors argue that this approach, contrary to prior findings, improves optimization, accelerates convergence, and enhances generalization across various sequential tasks. They substantiate their claims with empirical results on tasks such as sequential MNIST, character-level language modeling, and question answering, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over baseline LSTMs.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a compelling contribution to the field of RNN optimization by successfully extending batch normalization to hidden-to-hidden transitions, a previously challenging area. The empirical results are robust, demonstrating faster convergence and superior generalization across diverse tasks. The work is well-motivated, addresses a significant problem in training RNNs, and provides a clear advancement over existing methods.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The proposed BN-LSTM introduces a significant innovation by applying batch normalization to hidden-to-hidden transitions, challenging prior hypotheses about its feasibility. This reparameterization is novel and addresses a critical bottleneck in RNN optimization.\n2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental evidence across multiple tasks, including sequential MNIST, Penn Treebank, and Text8. The results consistently show faster convergence and improved performance compared to baseline LSTMs, supporting the paper's claims.\n3. Theoretical Insights: The discussion on proper initialization of batch normalization parameters (e.g., Î³) and its impact on gradient flow is insightful and addresses a key challenge in applying BN to recurrent architectures.\n4. Practical Relevance: The method is applicable to real-world tasks, such as language modeling and question answering, demonstrating its utility beyond synthetic benchmarks.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity on Limitations: While the authors briefly mention challenges such as handling zero-variance activations in sequential MNIST, a more explicit discussion of limitations (e.g., computational overhead of BN or scalability to very large datasets) would strengthen the paper.\n2. Comparative Analysis: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other recent methods for improving RNN training, such as Layer Normalization or other architectural modifications.\n3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: While the authors discuss hyperparameter choices, a more systematic analysis of how sensitive the method is to these parameters (e.g., Î³ initialization) would be valuable for practitioners.\n4. Ablation Studies: Additional ablation studies isolating the contributions of BN in input-to-hidden vs. hidden-to-hidden transitions would help clarify the relative importance of each component.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the computational cost of BN-LSTM compare to baseline LSTMs, particularly for large-scale tasks? Is there a trade-off between performance gains and training efficiency?\n2. Could the proposed method be extended to other RNN variants, such as GRUs, or architectures like Transformers? If so, what challenges might arise?\n3. The paper mentions that BN-LSTM generalizes well to sequences longer than those seen during training. Could you elaborate on the theoretical or empirical basis for this observation?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of RNN optimization, presenting a novel and well-validated approach to improving training efficiency and generalization. While there are areas for further exploration, the work is impactful and merits acceptance."
