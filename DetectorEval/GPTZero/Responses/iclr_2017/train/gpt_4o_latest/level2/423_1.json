The authors claim that GMAN enables reliable training using the original minimax objective without modifications, unlike standard GANs. They propose a generative multi-adversarial metric (GMAM) to evaluate GMAN and demonstrate that GMAN achieves faster convergence and higher-quality results in image generation tasks compared to standard GANs. The paper also introduces GMAN*, a variant that allows the generator to regulate training dynamics automatically. Experimental results on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show that GMAN outperforms traditional GANs in terms of convergence speed, stability, and resistance to mode collapse.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a novel and well-motivated extension to the GAN framework, addressing known issues with GAN training such as instability and mode collapse. The theoretical justification and empirical results are compelling, and the proposed GMAM metric provides a meaningful way to evaluate the performance of multi-discriminator systems. However, there are areas where the paper could be improved, particularly in terms of clarity and reproducibility.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The idea of introducing multiple discriminators to improve GAN training is innovative and well-grounded in theory. The authors explore a range of discriminator roles, from harsh critics to lenient teachers, and provide a detailed analysis of how these roles affect training dynamics.\n2. Experimental Results: The experiments convincingly demonstrate that GMAN achieves faster convergence and higher-quality outputs compared to standard GANs. The use of multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA) strengthens the generalizability of the results.\n3. Practical Utility: The proposed framework addresses practical challenges in GAN training, such as the need for modified objectives and susceptibility to mode collapse. The ability to use the original minimax objective is particularly noteworthy.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense with technical details, which may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with GANs. Simplifying the explanations of key concepts, such as the softmax reformulation and GMAM metric, would improve accessibility.\n2. Reproducibility: While the authors provide some implementation details, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive description of the experimental setup, including hyperparameters and architectural specifics for all datasets.\n3. Comparison with Related Work: Although the authors briefly mention related work, a more detailed comparison with other GAN variants (e.g., WGAN, SAGAN) would contextualize the contributions of GMAN more effectively.\n4. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the computational overhead introduced by multiple discriminators. Including an analysis of training time and resource requirements would provide a more balanced evaluation of the approach.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the computational cost of GMAN scale with the number of discriminators? Is there a trade-off between performance improvement and resource requirements?\n2. Can the GMAN framework be extended to tasks beyond image generation, such as text or audio synthesis? If so, what modifications would be necessary?\n3. How sensitive is GMAN to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of discriminators and the 位 parameter in the softmax formulation?\nConclusion\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling by addressing key limitations of GANs. The proposed GMAN framework is both theoretically sound and empirically validated, making it a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the suggestions above would further enhance the paper's impact and clarity."
