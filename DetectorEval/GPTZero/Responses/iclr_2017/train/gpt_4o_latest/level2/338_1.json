            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel perspective on deep architectures, specifically Highway and Residual networks, by proposing the \"unrolled iterative estimation\" view. This framework challenges the traditional representation view, which assumes that each layer in a neural network computes a new level of abstraction. Instead, the authors argue that layers within a stage iteratively refine the same representation, preserving feature identity. The paper provides mathematical derivations to unify Highway and Residual networks under this perspective and supports its claims with experimental evidence, including empirical tests on estimation error, visualization studies, and comparative case studies in image classification and language modeling.\nDecision: Accept. The paper offers a compelling theoretical framework that unifies two widely used architectures, provides novel insights into their functioning, and opens avenues for further research. The claims are well-supported by mathematical derivations, empirical evidence, and comparative experiments.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The unrolled iterative estimation view is a significant conceptual contribution that challenges and extends the traditional representation view. By unifying Highway and Residual networks, the paper provides a deeper understanding of their design principles and performance.\n2. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct rigorous experiments, including empirical tests on estimation error, visualization studies, and comparative evaluations in image classification and language modeling. These experiments corroborate the proposed framework and address misconceptions about Highway networks.\n3. Clarity and Rigor: The paper is well-written, with clear mathematical derivations and logical arguments. The authors effectively link their theoretical framework to practical design choices, such as the role of batch normalization and gating mechanisms.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Comparative Analysis: While the paper compares Highway and Residual networks, it would be helpful to include more diverse architectures (e.g., DenseNets) to assess the broader applicability of the iterative estimation view.\n2. Limitations: The paper briefly acknowledges limitations, such as the underperformance of Residual networks in tasks requiring dynamic feature replacement. A more detailed discussion of when and why the iterative estimation view might fail would strengthen the paper.\n3. Reproducibility: The experiments are well-documented, but providing open-source code and detailed hyperparameter settings would enhance reproducibility.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does the iterative estimation view apply to architectures with more complex connectivity patterns, such as DenseNets or Transformer models?\n2. Could the iterative estimation framework be extended to explain the behavior of networks trained with unsupervised or self-supervised learning paradigms?\n3. The paper mentions that stage-wise weight sharing does not significantly degrade performance. Could this insight be leveraged to design more parameter-efficient architectures?\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a strong theoretical and experimental foundation for the proposed unrolled iterative estimation view, making it a valuable contribution to the understanding of deep architectures. With minor clarifications and extensions, it has the potential to influence future research and design in deep learning."
