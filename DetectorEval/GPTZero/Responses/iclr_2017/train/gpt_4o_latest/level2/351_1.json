            "inputText": "The paper introduces Diet Networks, a novel neural network parametrization designed to address the challenge of high-dimensional genomic data with limited training samples. The authors propose a multi-task learning framework where a parameter prediction network generates feature-specific parameters for a classifier network, significantly reducing the number of free parameters. This approach is validated on the 1000 Genomes dataset for ancestry prediction, achieving lower misclassification errors compared to standard deep networks and PCA-based dimensionality reduction techniques. The proposed method demonstrates potential for precision medicine applications by improving generalization and reducing overfitting in high-dimensional genomic datasets.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to a critical problem in genomic data analysis. The novelty of the Diet Networks framework, combined with its demonstrated effectiveness on a real-world dataset, makes it a valuable contribution to the field. However, some areas require clarification and additional experimentation to strengthen the work further.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The Diet Networks framework is a significant innovation, leveraging multi-task learning to reduce parameter count in high-dimensional data. This is a meaningful contribution to genomic data analysis, where overfitting due to limited samples is a persistent issue.\n2. Experimental Validation: The authors validate their approach on the 1000 Genomes dataset, a relevant and challenging benchmark. The results show that Diet Networks outperform standard deep networks and PCA-based methods in terms of misclassification error, particularly when using pre-computed feature embeddings.\n3. Practical Relevance: The method has clear implications for precision medicine, where accurate ancestry prediction can improve disease risk assessment and treatment personalization.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Comparison with Baselines: While the paper compares Diet Networks to PCA and standard deep networks, additional comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods (e.g., SVMs or ensemble models) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n2. Feature Embedding Analysis: The paper briefly discusses different feature embeddings (e.g., SNP2Vec, histograms), but a deeper analysis of their relative strengths and weaknesses would be helpful. For instance, why does the histogram embedding outperform SNP2Vec despite its simplicity?\n3. Scalability: The authors should discuss the scalability of Diet Networks to larger datasets with millions of SNPs and whether the parameter prediction network can handle such scenarios efficiently.\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors provide a GitHub link, more details on hyperparameters, training time, and computational resources would enhance reproducibility.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the performance of Diet Networks change with increasing dataset size? Have you tested the method on larger genomic datasets beyond the 1000 Genomes dataset?\n2. Can the parameter prediction network generalize to unseen SNPs in entirely new populations? If so, how robust is this generalization?\n3. How sensitive is the model to the choice of feature embedding? Would combining multiple embeddings improve performance?\nIn summary, the paper addresses an important problem with a novel and well-executed approach. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions and results justify acceptance. Further refinements could make this work even more impactful in genomic data analysis and precision medicine."
