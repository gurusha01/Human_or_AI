            "inputText": "The paper introduces the Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD) framework, a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling that learns dynamic decompositions of output sequences into tokens, informed by both input and output sequences. This is a departure from traditional seq2seq models, which rely on fixed, static decompositions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of LSD on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech recognition task, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 12.9%, a significant improvement over the baseline character model's 14.8% WER. When combined with a convolutional encoder, LSD achieves a state-of-the-art WER of 9.6%.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its innovative contribution to the field of seq2seq modeling and its demonstrated empirical improvements in speech recognition tasks. The key reasons for this decision are the novelty of the LSD framework and its practical utility in improving WER, a critical metric in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The LSD framework introduces a dynamic, learned decomposition of sequences, which is a significant departure from fixed tokenization approaches. This flexibility allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the input and output sequences, addressing limitations of prior methods.\n2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides strong empirical evidence of LSD's effectiveness, with a 12.7% relative improvement in WER over the baseline seq2seq model. The results are further enhanced when combined with a convolutional encoder, achieving a competitive WER of 9.6% without external language models.\n3. Theoretical Rigor: The authors present a well-formulated probabilistic framework and derive an unbiased gradient estimator for training. The use of an -greedy exploration strategy to overcome local minima is a thoughtful addition that enhances the robustness of the approach.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, the mathematical derivations and training procedures could be better explained for accessibility. For instance, the sampling heuristic for latent decompositions could benefit from a more detailed explanation or illustrative examples.\n2. Comparative Analysis: The paper could include a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as those leveraging external language models or task-specific optimizations, to contextualize LSD's performance.\n3. Generalization to Other Tasks: While the results on WSJ are promising, it would strengthen the paper to discuss the potential applicability of LSD to other seq2seq tasks, such as machine translation or text summarization.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does the LSD framework handle cases where the optimal decomposition varies significantly across different input domains? Are there any observed limitations in such scenarios?\n2. Could the authors elaborate on the computational overhead introduced by the LSD framework compared to traditional seq2seq models? How does this scale with larger datasets or more complex token vocabularies?\n3. The paper mentions that the model learns to emit longer n-grams over time. Could the authors provide insights into how this impacts inference speed and memory requirements?\nOverall, the paper makes a compelling case for the LSD framework as a significant advancement in seq2seq modeling, and its acceptance would benefit the AI and speech recognition communities."
