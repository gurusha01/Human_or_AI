            "inputText": "The paper presents SampleRNN, a novel model for unconditional audio generation that operates on raw waveforms, generating one sample at a time. The authors propose a hierarchical architecture combining memory-less modules (autoregressive multilayer perceptrons) and stateful recurrent neural networks (RNNs) operating at different temporal resolutions. The model addresses the challenge of modeling long-term dependencies in high-resolution audio data by leveraging a multi-scale structure. The contributions include (1) a memory-efficient training method, (2) extensive exploration of model variants, and (3) empirical evaluation on three diverse datasets (speech, vocal sounds, and music). Human evaluations indicate that SampleRNN outperforms competing models, including WaveNet, in terms of perceived quality.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons: (1) The paper introduces a significant innovation in audio generation with a hierarchical RNN-based architecture, addressing a critical limitation in existing models. (2) The claims are well-supported by rigorous experiments, including quantitative metrics (negative log-likelihood) and human evaluations, demonstrating the model's superiority.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The hierarchical design of SampleRNN, with modules operating at different clock rates, is a noteworthy improvement over existing approaches like WaveNet. This design allows for efficient modeling of both short-term and long-term dependencies, which is crucial for generating coherent audio.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides comprehensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrating the model's generalizability. The inclusion of human preference tests strengthens the empirical validation.\n3. Practical Utility: The proposed model eliminates the need for handcrafted features, making it adaptable to various audio generation tasks. The open-source code and generated samples further enhance its accessibility and reproducibility.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity in Model Description: While the hierarchical structure is well-motivated, the mathematical formalism (e.g., equations in Section 2) could be simplified for better readability. Including a more intuitive explanation of the upsampling process would help non-expert readers.\n2. Comparison with WaveNet: Although the authors re-implemented WaveNet for comparison, the differences in hyperparameters and architecture should be explicitly discussed to ensure a fair comparison.\n3. Limitations: The paper briefly mentions that SampleRNN struggles with random noise in music generation. A more detailed discussion of failure cases and potential remedies would strengthen the paper.\n4. Memory Efficiency: While the authors highlight memory efficiency during training, it would be helpful to quantify this advantage compared to WaveNet or other baselines.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the model handle highly imbalanced datasets like Onomatopoeia? Are there specific strategies to mitigate the impact of class imbalance?\n2. Given the hierarchical structure, how sensitive is the model to the choice of frame sizes (e.g., FS(1), FS(2))? Would dynamic frame sizes improve performance?\n3. Could the model be extended to conditional audio generation tasks (e.g., text-to-speech)? If so, how would the architecture need to be modified?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of audio generation, with clear novelty and robust empirical validation. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance its impact."
