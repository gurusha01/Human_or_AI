            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to modeling perceptual similarity judgment by fine-tuning a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with object persistence constraints, resulting in the Object Persistence Net (OPnet). The authors claim that OPnet modifies the view-manifold of object representations to improve intra-category object discrimination while maintaining inter-category distinctions. This enables the network to generalize similarity judgments to novel objects and categories, including synthetic and human-like objects, and aligns its similarity judgments more closely with human perception compared to AlexNet. The paper also demonstrates that OPnet outperforms existing methods in instance and categorical retrieval tasks, suggesting the learned feature representations are more abstract and transferable.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its strong contributions to perceptual similarity modeling, its innovative use of object persistence constraints, and its thorough experimental validation. The key reasons for this decision are the novelty of the proposed approach and the significant improvements in performance over baseline methods, particularly in generalizing to novel objects and categories.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a unique application of distance metric learning via a Siamese triplet architecture to incorporate object persistence constraints. This approach is novel and provides a meaningful advancement over traditional DCNNs trained for object classification.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including synthetic objects, novel categories, and human perception benchmarks. The results consistently demonstrate OPnet's superiority in similarity judgment tasks, with significant improvements in mean average precision (MAP) and alignment with human perceptual data.\n3. Relevance and Impact: The work addresses a fundamental problem in cognitive science and computer vision\"\"understanding and modeling perceptual similarity. The findings have potential applications in areas like object recognition, retrieval systems, and cognitive modeling.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Real-World Validation: While the synthetic datasets and controlled experiments are compelling, the paper would benefit from additional testing on real-world datasets with more complex variations, such as lighting and scale, to assess OPnet's robustness in practical scenarios.\n2. Ablation Studies: The paper could include more detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of specific components, such as the margin parameter or the choice of cosine distance, on the network's performance.\n3. Human Perception Ground-Truth: Although the Tenenbaum dataset provides a useful benchmark, further validation with larger-scale human perception data would strengthen the claim that OPnet aligns with human similarity judgments.\n4. Limitations: The paper acknowledges overfitting to ShapeNet's biases and OPnet's reduced performance on datasets without categorical structure. A more detailed discussion of these limitations and potential solutions would enhance the paper's completeness.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does OPnet perform on datasets with significant background clutter or occlusions? Could the object persistence constraint be extended to handle such scenarios?\n2. Can the proposed approach be adapted to incorporate temporal information, such as video sequences, to further enhance similarity judgment?\n3. How sensitive is OPnet's performance to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the margin parameter in the hinge loss function?\nIn summary, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by proposing and validating a novel method for perceptual similarity modeling. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the work outweigh its limitations, making it a valuable addition to the conference."
