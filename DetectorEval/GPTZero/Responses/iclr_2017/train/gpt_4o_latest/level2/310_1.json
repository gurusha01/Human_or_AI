            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for language learning through multi-agent communication, specifically in the context of referential games. Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches that rely on large datasets of static text, the authors propose an interactive setup where agents develop their own communication protocols to coordinate on tasks. The paper demonstrates that two neural networks can successfully learn to communicate and explores how modifications to the game environment can encourage the emergence of semantically meaningful communication. Additionally, the authors propose a strategy to ground the agents' emergent language in natural language, enabling better alignment with human communication. The work is positioned as a step toward developing conversational AI that can interact productively with humans.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel approach to interactive language learning, its rigorous experimental evaluation, and its potential to advance the development of human-interpretable AI communication systems. The key reasons for this decision are the innovative use of multi-agent games to bootstrap language emergence and the successful demonstration of grounding emergent communication in human language.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical limitation of supervised learning approaches for conversational agents by focusing on the functional aspects of communication. The use of referential games as a framework for language emergence is innovative and well-motivated, building on prior work in linguistics, cognitive science, and game theory.\n \n2. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating that agents can successfully coordinate and develop semantically meaningful communication. The use of purity metrics and t-SNE visualizations provides strong evidence for the semantic alignment of the emergent language with human intuitions.\n3. Practical Implications: The proposed grounding strategy, which combines supervised learning with interactive game play, is a promising step toward making AI communication interpretable and usable by humans. The crowdsourced evaluation further highlights the potential for human-agent collaboration.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Scalability: While the referential game framework is compelling, the paper could discuss scalability to more complex tasks or multi-step interactions. How would the approach generalize to larger vocabularies or more diverse datasets?\n2. Human-Agent Interaction: The paper briefly mentions that humans could be added as players in the game. It would be helpful to explore this idea further, particularly in terms of how human feedback could shape the emergent language.\n3. Limitations: The authors should explicitly discuss the limitations of their approach, such as the reliance on pre-trained image representations and the potential challenges of extending the framework to real-world conversational settings.\n4. Interpretability: While the grounding strategy shows promise, the interpretability of the emergent language is still limited. Future work could explore methods to further align the agents' communication with human semantics.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the framework handle ambiguity or polysemy in emergent communication? For example, if multiple symbols can refer to the same concept, how is consistency ensured?\n2. Could the proposed grounding strategy be extended to other modalities, such as audio or video, to enable multi-modal communication?\n3. What are the computational costs of training agents in this interactive setup compared to traditional supervised learning approaches?\nConclusion\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of interactive language learning and AI communication. The proposed framework is innovative, the experiments are well-executed, and the results are promising. With some additional discussion of scalability and limitations, this work has the potential to inspire further research in developing human-compatible conversational agents."
