            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel modification to the texture synthesis method introduced by Gatys et al. (2015a), enabling the incorporation of long-range spatial structure and symmetry constraints into image generation. The authors extend the use of Gram matrices by introducing \"transformed Gram matrices,\" which capture spatial correlations between features at different locations. This approach is shown to improve the rendering of regular textures, inpainting, and style transfer tasks. The paper also explores the use of additional transformations, such as flipping, to enforce symmetry in generated textures. Experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to synthesize structured textures, outperform Gatys et al. in inpainting tasks, and achieve comparable results in style transfer while preserving global coherence.\nDecision: Accept\nKey Reasons for Decision:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a significant and well-motivated extension to the existing texture synthesis framework, addressing a key limitation of the Gatys et al. method\"\"its inability to capture long-range spatial structure. The proposed transformed Gram matrices are a meaningful and innovative contribution to the field.\n2. Experimental Validation: The claims are supported by rigorous experiments across multiple tasks (texture synthesis, inpainting, and style transfer). The results are visually compelling and demonstrate clear improvements in capturing long-range correlations and symmetry.\nSupporting Arguments:\n- The paper is well-placed in the literature, building directly on Gatys et al. (2015a) and related works. The authors demonstrate a strong understanding of the field and provide appropriate citations.\n- The proposed method is practically useful, particularly for applications requiring structured texture synthesis or inpainting. The ability to enforce global coherence and symmetry is a valuable addition.\n- The experiments are thorough, with clear comparisons to Gatys et al. and ablation studies exploring the impact of different parameters (e.g., ÃŽÂ´ values). The inclusion of diverse textures and tasks strengthens the paper's claims.\n- The paper acknowledges computational overhead as a limitation but provides practical guidelines for parameter selection, making the approach accessible.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Clarity: While the technical details are comprehensive, the paper could benefit from a more concise explanation of the transformed Gram matrices and their relationship to traditional Gram matrices. Simplifying the mathematical notation in the main text might improve accessibility for a broader audience.\n2. Reproducibility: The authors provide implementation details and a link to the code repository, which is commendable. However, including a step-by-step guide or pseudocode for the proposed method would further enhance reproducibility.\n3. Broader Impact: The paper focuses primarily on visual quality but does not discuss potential applications beyond image synthesis (e.g., medical imaging or scientific visualization). Highlighting such use cases could broaden the paper's appeal.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does the method scale to higher-resolution images or more complex textures? Are there any practical limitations in terms of memory or computation time?\n2. Could the approach be extended to other types of transformations beyond translation and flipping? For example, could it handle rotational or perspective transformations effectively?\n3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of ÃŽÂ´ values? Could an adaptive or learned approach to selecting ÃŽÂ´ improve performance or reduce computational cost?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of texture synthesis and image generation. The proposed method is innovative, well-supported by experiments, and has clear practical utility. With minor improvements to clarity and broader contextualization, it could have an even greater impact."
