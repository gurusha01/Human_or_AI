            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: \"Attention Transfer for Convolutional Neural Networks\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper explores the use of attention mechanisms to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by transferring attention maps from a powerful teacher network to a smaller student network. The authors propose two novel methods for attention transfer: activation-based and gradient-based attention maps. They demonstrate that these methods lead to consistent performance improvements across various datasets and CNN architectures. Key contributions include:\n1. Defining attention as spatial maps derived from activation and gradient information.\n2. Proposing novel attention transfer methods and demonstrating their effectiveness in improving student networks.\n3. Showing that activation-based attention transfer outperforms full activation transfer and can be combined with knowledge distillation.\n4. Providing experimental results on CIFAR, ImageNet, and fine-tuning tasks, with code and models made publicly available.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to improving CNN performance through attention transfer. The methods are rigorously evaluated and demonstrate significant improvements across diverse datasets and architectures. The work is also practically useful, as it provides a lightweight and computationally efficient way to enhance student networks. Below, I provide detailed reasoning for this decision.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a unique perspective on knowledge transfer by focusing on attention maps rather than full activations. This approach is novel and addresses a gap in the literature, as existing methods like FitNets and knowledge distillation do not explicitly leverage attention mechanisms.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and fine-tuning tasks, showcasing the generalizability of their methods. The results are statistically significant, with consistent improvements across datasets and architectures.\n3. Practical Usefulness: The proposed methods are computationally efficient and easy to implement, making them highly relevant for practitioners looking to optimize smaller networks for deployment.\n4. Reproducibility: The authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility, including public access to code and models.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Gradient-Based Attention Transfer: While the activation-based method is well-explained, the gradient-based approach could benefit from additional clarification, particularly regarding the computational overhead of double backpropagation and its practical implications.\n2. Comparison with Related Work: The paper could include a more detailed comparison with existing knowledge transfer methods, such as FitNets and knowledge distillation, on large-scale datasets like ImageNet.\n3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The authors mention limited tuning of hyperparameters for ImageNet experiments. A more systematic analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity would strengthen the results.\n4. Limitations: While the paper briefly mentions future work, it does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed methods, such as scalability to tasks beyond classification (e.g., object detection).\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the computational cost of gradient-based attention transfer compare to activation-based methods in practice? Is it feasible for large-scale datasets like ImageNet?\n2. Could the proposed methods be extended to non-vision tasks, such as natural language processing, where attention mechanisms are also widely used?\n3. How robust are the methods to variations in teacher and student architectures, particularly when the teacher is significantly deeper or wider than the student?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of knowledge transfer in neural networks by introducing attention-based methods that are both novel and effective. While there are areas for improvement, the overall quality of the work, its practical relevance, and the rigor of the experiments justify its acceptance. I encourage the authors to address the suggested improvements and questions in the final version."
