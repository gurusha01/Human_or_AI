            "inputText": "The paper introduces a novel framework for semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), addressing the challenge of enabling agents to generalize learned behaviors from labeled environments (where reward functions are available) to unlabeled environments (where reward functions are unavailable). The proposed method, Semi-Supervised Skill Generalization (S3G), uses an inverse reinforcement learning-inspired approach to infer reward functions in unlabeled scenarios, leveraging prior experience in labeled environments. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of S3G through experiments on continuous control tasks, showing improved generalization of learned policies compared to baseline methods, including direct supervised learning of reward functions and standard RL approaches.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to reinforcement learning by formalizing the SSRL problem and proposing a practical, scalable algorithm (S3G) that improves policy generalization. The method is well-motivated, novel, and empirically validated on challenging tasks, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper is the first to formalize SSRL and propose a tractable solution using inverse RL principles. The idea of leveraging unlabeled experiences to improve policy generalization is innovative and addresses a critical gap in RL research, particularly for real-world applications.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, spanning multiple tasks with varying levels of complexity. Results consistently show that S3G outperforms baselines, including reward regression and standard RL, in terms of generalization to unseen scenarios.\n3. Practical Relevance: The method is designed with real-world applicability in mind, particularly for robotics. The authors highlight the potential of S3G for lifelong learning, where agents can continuously improve without requiring extensive supervision.\n4. Theoretical Soundness: The algorithm builds on established methods like guided cost learning and maximum entropy RL, ensuring a solid theoretical foundation.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity in Problem Definition: While the paper defines SSRL well, the distinction between SSRL and related paradigms like transfer learning could be made clearer, especially for readers unfamiliar with the nuances of RL.\n2. Scalability to Real-World Systems: While the authors claim that S3G is suitable for physical systems, no experiments on real-world robots are presented. Including such experiments or discussing potential challenges (e.g., sample efficiency, hardware constraints) would strengthen the paper.\n3. Ablation Studies: The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components of S3G, such as the entropy-regularized objective and the iterative reward-policy optimization process.\n4. Comparison with Other IRL Methods: While S3G is compared to reward regression and standard RL, it would be helpful to compare it with other inverse RL methods to better contextualize its performance.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How sensitive is S3G to the quality of the initial policy learned in the labeled environments? Would poor performance in the labeled MDPs significantly degrade generalization in the unlabeled MDPs?\n2. How does S3G handle scenarios with significant domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled MDPs? For example, what happens if the dynamics or state distributions differ substantially?\n3. Can the proposed method be extended to handle sparse rewards in the labeled MDPs, where even the initial supervision is limited?\nConclusion:\nThis paper presents a compelling solution to an important problem in reinforcement learning, with strong theoretical underpinnings and promising empirical results. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are substantial, and the paper is likely to stimulate further research in SSRL and its applications. I recommend acceptance."
