            "inputText": "The paper presents two novel end-to-end neural network models for machine comprehension tasks, specifically targeting the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and the MSMARCO dataset. The proposed models combine match-LSTM, previously developed for textual entailment, with Pointer Networks (Ptr-Net) to address the unique challenges of these datasets, such as variable-length answers and the absence of candidate answer sets. The authors introduce two approaches: a sequence model that predicts answers token-by-token and a boundary model that predicts the start and end tokens of the answer span. The boundary model demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on MSMARCO and competitive results on SQuAD. The paper also provides insights into the attention mechanism and its role in improving answer prediction.\nDecision: Accept\nKey Reasons for Decision:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The integration of match-LSTM with Pointer Networks is innovative, particularly the boundary model, which effectively addresses the early stop prediction problem of the sequence model. This represents a meaningful advancement in machine comprehension.\n2. Empirical Validation: The models are rigorously evaluated on two challenging datasets, with results demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods. The boundary model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MSMARCO and competitive results on SQuAD, supported by detailed ablation studies and qualitative analyses.\nSupporting Arguments:\n- The paper is well-motivated and grounded in relevant literature, with clear explanations of prior work and how the proposed models advance the state of the art.\n- The experiments are thorough, with appropriate metrics (e.g., exact match, F1, BLEU, Rouge-L) and comparisons to baseline methods. The inclusion of ablation studies strengthens the validity of the claims.\n- The visualization of attention weights and analysis of performance across different question types provide valuable insights into the models' strengths and weaknesses.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Reproducibility: While the authors mention making their code available, it would be helpful to include more implementation details, such as hyperparameter tuning and training times, to facilitate reproducibility.\n2. Limitations: The paper acknowledges challenges with multi-sentence reasoning and \"why\" questions but could benefit from a more explicit discussion of these limitations and potential strategies to address them.\n3. Broader Applicability: While the models are tailored to SQuAD and MSMARCO, it would be interesting to explore their generalizability to other machine comprehension datasets or related tasks, such as visual question answering.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How sensitive are the models to hyperparameter choices, such as the dimensionality of hidden layers or the use of pre-trained embeddings?\n2. Could the boundary model's approach to predicting start and end tokens be extended to handle multi-sentence reasoning more effectively? If so, how?\n3. Have you considered incorporating external knowledge sources or pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) to further enhance performance?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of machine comprehension and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. The proposed models are innovative, the experiments are robust, and the insights provided are valuable for advancing future research."
