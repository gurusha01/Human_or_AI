            "inputText": "The paper introduces Sigma-Delta Networks, a novel approach to reduce the computational cost of deep neural networks by leveraging temporal redundancy in input data, particularly video. The key contribution lies in modifying traditional neural networks to communicate only the discretized changes in neuron activations between layers, rather than recomputing activations for every frame. This approach ensures that the computational cost scales with the amount of change in the input, rather than the size of the network. The authors propose an optimization method to convert pre-trained networks into Sigma-Delta networks and demonstrate significant computational savings鈥攗p to an order of magnitude鈥攐n temporally redundant data like video.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper presents a compelling and novel method for improving computational efficiency in neural networks, addressing a critical challenge in processing temporal data. The approach is well-motivated, supported by theoretical analysis, and validated through experiments. However, some aspects require further clarification and refinement.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The Sigma-Delta network introduces a unique mechanism for leveraging temporal redundancy, which is distinct from existing approaches like spiking neural networks or low-precision quantization. The method is innovative and has potential applications in video processing, asynchronous distributed systems, and hardware-efficient neural networks.\n2. Experimental Validation: The experiments on Temporal-MNIST and video data demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, with significant computational savings achieved without sacrificing accuracy. The results are promising, particularly for video data, where the method achieves 4-10x computational savings.\n3. Practical Relevance: The method addresses a pressing need for efficient processing of temporal data, which is increasingly prevalent in real-world applications like video analytics and autonomous systems.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, some sections, particularly the mathematical derivations and algorithms, could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive descriptions. For example, the connection between the Sigma-Delta mechanism and spiking neural networks could be elaborated to help readers unfamiliar with the latter.\n2. Hardware Considerations: The paper acknowledges that current hardware like GPUs may not fully exploit the sparsity introduced by Sigma-Delta networks. A more detailed discussion on how this method could be implemented on specialized hardware (e.g., IBM TrueNorth) would strengthen the practical implications.\n3. Feature Stability Assumption: The authors note that higher-level features in convolutional networks did not exhibit the expected temporal stability. This observation warrants further investigation, as it challenges a key assumption of the method. Future work could explore training networks specifically for temporal stability or adapting the method for features with higher variability.\n4. Reproducibility: The inclusion of code is commendable, but more details on hyperparameters, training procedures, and datasets (e.g., Temporal-MNIST generation) would enhance reproducibility.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the performance of Sigma-Delta networks compare to other state-of-the-art methods for reducing computation, such as pruning or low-precision quantization?\n2. Could the method be extended to handle asynchronous inputs from multiple sources, as hinted in the discussion? If so, what challenges might arise?\n3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of the tradeoff parameter (位) in balancing accuracy and computation? Are there guidelines for selecting this parameter in practice?\nIn summary, the paper makes a strong case for the adoption of Sigma-Delta networks in scenarios involving temporal redundancy. While some areas could be refined, the contributions are significant, and the method holds promise for advancing efficient neural network computation."
