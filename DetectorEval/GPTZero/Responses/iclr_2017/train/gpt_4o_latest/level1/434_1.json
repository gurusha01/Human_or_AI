            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: \"Batch-Normalized LSTM for Recurrent Neural Networks\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel reparameterization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that incorporates batch normalization into both the input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden transitions. The authors argue that this approach reduces internal covariate shift in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), leading to faster convergence and improved generalization. The paper provides theoretical insights into the importance of proper initialization for batch normalization parameters and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Batch-Normalized LSTM (BN-LSTM) across a variety of sequential tasks, including sequence classification, language modeling, and question answering. The empirical results show consistent improvements over baseline LSTM models, with state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for acceptance:\n1. Novelty and Impact: The paper challenges prior assumptions about the limitations of batch normalization in RNNs and demonstrates its successful application in hidden-to-hidden transitions, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The authors provide extensive experimental results across diverse tasks, showing consistent improvements in both convergence speed and generalization performance.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-situated in the literature, addressing a known limitation of batch normalization in RNNs. The authors provide a clear theoretical motivation for their approach, particularly the importance of proper initialization of batch normalization parameters.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments cover a wide range of tasks, including sequential MNIST, character-level language modeling (Penn Treebank and text8), and a challenging question-answering benchmark. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of BN-LSTM over standard LSTM baselines.\n3. Scientific Rigor: The authors provide detailed analyses, such as the impact of initialization on gradient flow and the generalization of their model to longer sequences. These insights strengthen the validity of their claims.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity on Initialization: While the paper emphasizes the importance of initializing the batch normalization parameter Î³, it would be helpful to provide more detailed guidelines or heuristics for practitioners to generalize this initialization across different tasks.\n2. Ablation Studies: The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components, such as the separate normalization of input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden transitions.\n3. Comparison with Recent Work: Although the authors mention related works (e.g., Ba et al., 2016), a more detailed comparison with other normalization techniques for RNNs, such as Layer Normalization, would strengthen the paper.\n4. Scalability: The experiments focus on relatively small-scale tasks. It would be valuable to evaluate the method on larger datasets or more complex architectures (e.g., Transformer-based models) to assess its scalability.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed BN-LSTM compare to other normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization, in terms of computational overhead and performance?\n2. Can the authors elaborate on the challenges of generalizing the proposed method to other recurrent architectures, such as GRUs or bidirectional RNNs?\n3. How sensitive is the performance of BN-LSTM to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the initialization of Î³ and Î²?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks by demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of batch normalization in hidden-to-hidden transitions. The proposed BN-LSTM is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. With minor improvements in clarity and additional comparisons, the paper would be even stronger."
