            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: \"Semi-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Generalizing Skills\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for Semi-Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SSRL), addressing the challenge of generalizing reinforcement learning (RL) policies to diverse real-world scenarios where reward functions are only partially available. The authors propose the Semi-Supervised Skill Generalization (S3G) algorithm, which leverages experience from both \"labeled\" (reward-available) and \"unlabeled\" (reward-unavailable) environments. By incorporating techniques resembling inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), S3G imputes reward functions in unlabeled environments using prior experience, enabling the agent to learn a more generalizable policy. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of S3G through experiments on challenging continuous control tasks, showing superior generalization compared to standard RL and supervised reward regression approaches. This work is a significant step toward real-world lifelong learning systems, where agents can improve autonomously in unstructured environments.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a compelling case for SSRL as a critical extension of RL for real-world applications. The proposed S3G algorithm is well-motivated, novel, and scientifically rigorous, with strong empirical results supporting its claims. The paper is well-placed in the literature, addressing a gap in RL research by combining semi-supervised learning principles with policy generalization. The experimental evaluation is thorough, demonstrating the practical value of the method across multiple tasks.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem and Motivation: The paper tackles a well-defined and important problem\"\"how to enable RL agents to generalize in scenarios where reward functions are only partially available. This is a critical limitation of current RL methods, especially for real-world applications like robotics and dialog systems. The authors effectively motivate the need for SSRL by drawing parallels to semi-supervised learning and lifelong learning.\n2. Novelty and Methodology: The proposed S3G algorithm is novel and builds on established techniques like IRL and guided policy search. The use of agent-generated rollouts from labeled environments as pseudo-demonstrations for reward inference is an innovative and autonomous approach. The iterative reward and policy optimization framework is well-designed and theoretically grounded.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are robust, covering diverse tasks with varying complexity. The results convincingly show that S3G outperforms baseline methods, including standard RL and supervised reward regression, in terms of generalization to unseen scenarios. The paper also provides insightful analysis, such as the role of reward shaping and the impact of unlabeled experience.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, particularly the algorithmic details (e.g., reward update and policy update), are dense and could benefit from additional explanation or visual aids (e.g., flowcharts). Simplifying the mathematical notation in these sections would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.\n2. Comparison with Transfer Learning: Although the paper distinguishes SSRL from transfer learning, a more detailed comparison (e.g., experimental baselines or theoretical discussion) would strengthen the positioning of the work.\n3. Scalability and Real-World Feasibility: While the authors mention potential applications to real-world systems, the experiments are limited to simulated environments. A discussion of the computational overhead and practical challenges of deploying S3G on physical systems (e.g., robots) would be valuable.\n4. Ablation Studies: Additional ablation studies could help isolate the contributions of different components of the S3G algorithm, such as the importance of entropy regularization or the choice of policy optimization method.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the S3G algorithm to the quality and quantity of labeled data? For example, how does performance degrade if the labeled MDPs are highly limited or noisy?\n2. Can the proposed framework handle scenarios with significant domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled MDPs? If not, how could it be extended to address such cases?\n3. Have you considered alternative methods for reward inference in unlabeled environments, such as generative models or self-supervised learning techniques? How would these compare to the IRL-inspired approach used in S3G?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a strong contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by introducing and validating a novel framework for semi-supervised reinforcement learning. The proposed S3G algorithm is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and has significant potential for real-world applications. While there is room for improvement in presentation and additional analysis, the paper meets the standards for acceptance and is likely to stimulate further research in this important area."
