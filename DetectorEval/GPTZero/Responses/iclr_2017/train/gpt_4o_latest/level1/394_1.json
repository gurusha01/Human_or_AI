            "inputText": "The paper introduces Zoneout, a novel regularization technique for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that stochastically preserves hidden units' activations at each timestep. Unlike dropout, which sets activations to zero, Zoneout retains the previous timestep's activations, enabling better gradient and state propagation over time. This approach is shown to improve generalization and robustness to perturbations in the hidden state, addressing challenges like the vanishing gradient problem. The authors conduct extensive experiments on tasks such as language modeling (Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets) and permuted sequential MNIST (pMNIST), demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. Zoneout is also shown to work synergistically with other regularizers like recurrent batch normalization.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, presents a clear and novel contribution to RNN regularization, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims. The combination of theoretical insights and experimental rigor makes it a valuable addition to the field.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Motivation: Zoneout is a creative extension of dropout, tailored specifically for RNNs. By preserving activations instead of nullifying them, it addresses key limitations of dropout in recurrent settings, such as disrupted gradient flow and memory retention. The connection to stochastic depth and identity mappings is well-articulated and grounded in prior literature.\n \n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, covering diverse tasks and datasets. Zoneout achieves state-of-the-art results on pMNIST and competitive performance on Penn Treebank and Text8. The ablation studies (e.g., varying zoneout probabilities) and comparisons with other regularizers (e.g., recurrent dropout) provide strong evidence for its effectiveness.\n3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides detailed explanations of the method, clear experimental setups, and reproducible results (with code availability). The analysis of gradient flow further strengthens the theoretical underpinnings of Zoneout.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: While the authors note that low zoneout probabilities (0.05-0.2) generally work well, a more systematic exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity across tasks would be beneficial. This could help practitioners better understand how to tune Zoneout for their specific use cases.\n2. Comparison with Recent Advances: The paper compares Zoneout to recurrent dropout and other established methods but could benefit from a more detailed comparison with very recent techniques, such as adaptive zoneout or other stochastic regularizers.\n3. Interpretability: While the paper discusses the benefits of identity connections, it would be helpful to provide more intuition or visualizations (e.g., gradient flow dynamics) to illustrate how Zoneout impacts learning in practice.\n4. Scalability: The experiments focus on relatively small-scale datasets and models. It would be interesting to see how Zoneout performs on larger-scale tasks, such as machine translation or speech recognition, where RNNs are commonly used.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does Zoneout interact with other forms of regularization (e.g., weight decay, variational dropout) beyond recurrent batch normalization? Could combining these techniques lead to further improvements?\n2. Did you observe any specific failure modes or limitations of Zoneout, such as tasks where it does not perform well or cases where it increases training instability?\n3. Can Zoneout be extended to other architectures, such as transformers or convolutional RNNs? If so, what modifications would be necessary?\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a compelling and well-executed contribution to RNN regularization. With minor clarifications and additional experiments, it could further solidify its impact. I recommend acceptance."
