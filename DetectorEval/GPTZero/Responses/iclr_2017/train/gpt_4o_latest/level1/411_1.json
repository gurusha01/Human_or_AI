            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: Learning-Based Code Super-Optimization\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper introduces a novel learning-based approach to code super-optimization, a task aimed at transforming programs into more efficient versions while preserving their input-output behavior. Unlike prior stochastic search methods, which rely on fixed, uninformed proposal distributions, the authors propose a reinforcement learning framework to learn the proposal distribution. This approach leverages unbiased gradient estimators to optimize the expected improvement in program efficiency. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the method on two datasets: the \"Hacker's Delight\" benchmark and a more diverse set of automatically generated programs. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art stochastic search-based optimizer, Stoke, in both efficiency and robustness. The authors also highlight the broader applicability of their approach to other stochastic search problems.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, presents a clear and novel contribution, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The proposed learning-based approach addresses a critical limitation of existing stochastic search methods by learning a proposal distribution tailored to the program under consideration.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline in both controlled (Hacker's Delight) and diverse (automatically generated) settings.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Motivation and Placement in Literature: The authors provide a compelling motivation for their work, highlighting the inefficiencies of existing rule-based and stochastic search methods. The comparison to natural language paraphrasing is intuitive and helps contextualize the problem. The related work section is comprehensive, situating the contribution within the broader fields of program optimization and machine learning.\n2. Methodological Soundness: The use of reinforcement learning to optimize the proposal distribution is innovative and well-justified. The authors employ the REINFORCE algorithm to estimate gradients, which is a standard and reliable choice for such tasks. The hierarchical parameterization of the proposal distribution is thoughtfully designed to align with the structure of program transformations.\n3. Experimental Validation: The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. On the Hacker's Delight benchmark, the learned models achieve up to 60% improvement in program efficiency, outperforming Stoke's uniform proposal distribution. On the more challenging dataset, the method generalizes well, with the MLP-based model showing clear advantages over simpler baselines.\nSuggestions for Improvement\nWhile the paper is strong overall, the following points could improve clarity and impact:\n1. Representation of Programs: The authors mention the use of a Bag-of-Words representation for programs but acknowledge its limitations in capturing structural and temporal information. Future work could explore more expressive representations, such as graph-based or sequence-based models, to better capture program semantics.\n2. Scalability: The paper does not explicitly discuss the scalability of the approach to larger programs or more complex instruction sets. Including a discussion or preliminary results on scalability would strengthen the paper.\n3. Ablation Studies: While the paper compares the MLP-based model to simpler baselines, it would be helpful to include ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components, such as the hierarchical parameterization or the specific choice of features.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the learned proposal distribution handle programs with highly irregular or non-standard structures? Would additional training data or domain-specific features be required in such cases?\n2. The experiments focus on runtime as the measure of program efficiency. Could the method be extended to optimize other metrics, such as memory usage or energy consumption?\n3. Have you considered integrating domain knowledge (e.g., compiler heuristics) into the learning process to further guide the proposal distribution?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of code optimization by introducing a learning-based approach to stochastic super-optimization. The methodology is sound, the results are compelling, and the work opens up promising avenues for future research. I recommend acceptance."
