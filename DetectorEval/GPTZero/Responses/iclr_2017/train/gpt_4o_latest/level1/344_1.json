            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces StarCraft micromanagement scenarios as challenging benchmarks for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, focusing on the low-level control of units during battles. The authors propose a novel heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm, termed Zero-Order (ZO) optimization, which combines direct exploration in policy space with backpropagation. The algorithm is designed to address the challenges of large state-action spaces and the lack of obvious feature representations in micromanagement tasks. The paper also presents a deep neural network architecture for state-action value estimation and a normalized reward scheme to improve learning stability. Experimental results demonstrate that ZO outperforms baseline RL algorithms, including Q-learning and REINFORCE, in terms of robustness, sample efficiency, and generalization across scenarios. The authors further analyze learned policies, providing insights into the strategies developed by the models.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its significant contributions to reinforcement learning research. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The introduction of StarCraft micromanagement as a benchmark and the ZO algorithm represent meaningful advancements in RL for multi-agent and high-dimensional domains.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of ZO over established methods, with clear evidence of improved performance and generalization.\n3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides a detailed theoretical foundation, a well-motivated approach, and thorough experimental validation.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Definition and Motivation: The paper effectively positions StarCraft micromanagement as a complex and underexplored domain for RL research. The challenges of large action spaces, delayed rewards, and multi-agent coordination are clearly articulated, making the problem both relevant and compelling.\n2. Algorithmic Contribution: The ZO algorithm is innovative in its structured exploration of policy space, addressing the limitations of random action-space exploration in traditional RL methods. The combination of gradient-free optimization for the last layer and backpropagation for the embedding network is a novel and practical solution.\n3. Experimental Validation: The results are comprehensive, covering both training performance and generalization to unseen scenarios. The comparisons with baseline heuristics and RL algorithms are fair and well-documented, with ZO consistently outperforming alternatives. The analysis of learned policies adds interpretability to the results.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Algorithm Description: While the ZO algorithm is well-motivated, its presentation in Algorithm 1 could be streamlined. For instance, the role of the perturbation vector \\( u \\) and the heuristic update rule for the embedding network parameters could be explained more intuitively.\n2. Generalization to Other Domains: Although StarCraft micromanagement is a compelling testbed, the paper would benefit from a brief discussion or preliminary experiments on how ZO might perform in other RL domains, such as Atari or robotics.\n3. Ablation Studies: The paper could include ablation studies to isolate the contributions of key components, such as the normalized rewards, the greedy MDP formulation, and the specific neural network architecture.\n4. Scalability: While the paper mentions the potential for scaling to larger scenarios, it would be helpful to include a discussion on computational complexity and practical limitations when extending ZO to full StarCraft games or other large-scale environments.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the ZO algorithm to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the perturbation magnitude (\\( \\delta \\)) and learning rate (\\( \\eta \\))? Did you observe any stability issues during training?\n2. Could the normalized reward scheme introduce biases in certain scenarios, particularly when unit counts vary significantly during an episode? How does it compare to other reward normalization techniques?\n3. Have you considered incorporating self-play or adversarial training to further improve the robustness and generalization of the learned policies?\n4. How does the ZO algorithm handle scenarios with heterogeneous unit types or more complex action spaces? Would additional architectural modifications be required?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a strong contribution to reinforcement learning research, particularly in the context of multi-agent and high-dimensional environments. The proposed ZO algorithm is both innovative and effective, and the StarCraft micromanagement benchmarks provide a valuable resource for the community. With minor improvements to clarity and additional experiments, the paper could have an even broader impact."
