            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised learning of representations based on the infomax principle, specifically targeting large-scale neural populations. By leveraging an asymptotic approximation to Shannon's mutual information (MI), the authors propose a hierarchical infomax method to achieve a good initial approximation to the global optimum. This is followed by a fast gradient-descent algorithm to refine the solution. The framework is robust and adaptable to complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete bases, and it demonstrates significant advantages in training speed and robustness compared to existing methods. The authors validate their approach through extensive experiments on natural image datasets and the MNIST dataset, showing that the proposed method outperforms alternatives such as ICA, sparse RBMs, and sparse coding in terms of convergence rate, representation quality, and computational efficiency. The framework also shows promise for applications in training deep networks and image denoising.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for acceptance:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper addresses a long-standing challenge in representation learning\"\"efficiently maximizing mutual information for large-scale neural populations. The hierarchical infomax approach and the proposed optimization techniques are innovative and well-motivated.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are thorough, demonstrating clear advantages over existing methods in terms of training speed, robustness, and the quality of learned representations.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for their method, connecting it to both information theory and biological plausibility. The hierarchical infomax framework is a natural extension of existing infomax-based methods, and the use of asymptotic approximations for MI is a clever way to handle computational challenges.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The paper includes comprehensive experiments comparing the proposed method to state-of-the-art algorithms like ICA, sparse RBMs, and sparse coding. The results consistently show that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and produces high-quality Gabor-like filters, which are biologically interpretable.\n3. Practical Implications: The framework's ability to handle overcomplete bases and its application to image denoising highlight its versatility and practical relevance.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical derivations are detailed, they may be overwhelming for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical background. A high-level summary of the key steps in the hierarchical infomax method and the optimization process would improve accessibility.\n2. Comparison with Deep Learning Models: The paper briefly mentions the potential for extending the method to deep networks but does not provide experimental results in this context. Including such results would strengthen the claim that the framework is suitable for training deep architectures.\n3. Scalability Analysis: While the paper demonstrates efficiency improvements, a more explicit discussion of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method (e.g., in terms of dataset size or number of neurons) would be valuable.\n4. Biological Relevance: The authors claim that the framework incorporates biological constraints (e.g., Poisson spiking neurons, membrane noise). However, the biological implications of the results (e.g., Gabor-like filters) could be discussed in greater depth to strengthen the connection to neuroscience.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Could you elaborate on how the hierarchical infomax method scales with increasing dataset size or the number of neurons in the population? Are there any practical limitations?\n2. Have you tested the framework on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) or in a supervised learning context? If not, what challenges do you anticipate in extending the method to these settings?\n3. How sensitive is the performance of the method to the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., the sparsity control constant, learning rate)? Could you provide guidelines for selecting these parameters?\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised representation learning, and its novel approach and strong experimental results warrant acceptance."
