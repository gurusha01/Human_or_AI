            "inputText": "Review of \"PGQL: Combining Policy Gradient and Q-Learning\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces PGQL, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates policy gradient methods with off-policy Q-learning. The authors establish a theoretical connection between the fixed points of regularized policy gradient algorithms and Q-values, enabling the derivation of Q-values from the policy itself. By leveraging this connection, PGQL incorporates Q-learning updates using off-policy data stored in a replay buffer, enhancing data efficiency and stability. The paper also demonstrates that regularized policy gradient methods can be interpreted as advantage function learning algorithms. Empirical results on Atari benchmarks and a toy grid world show that PGQL outperforms both asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and Q-learning in terms of data efficiency and overall performance.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant theoretical and empirical contribution to reinforcement learning by bridging policy gradient and Q-learning approaches. The proposed PGQL algorithm demonstrates superior performance and data efficiency across a wide range of tasks, including the challenging Atari suite. The theoretical insights and practical implementation details are well-articulated, and the empirical results are compelling.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-grounded in prior literature, addressing a key limitation of policy gradient methods—their inability to leverage off-policy data. The connection between regularized policy gradient and Q-values is novel and provides a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed algorithm.\n \n2. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical claims are supported by detailed derivations, including proofs of convergence for the Bellman residual in the tabular case. Empirical results are robust, with extensive evaluations on the Atari benchmark and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods like A3C and Q-learning.\n3. Empirical Validation: PGQL consistently outperforms baseline methods in most Atari games, achieving higher mean and median normalized scores. The experiments are thorough, with appropriate ablations (e.g., varying the weighting parameter η) and insightful discussions on data efficiency and stability.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: While the paper mentions that PGQL underperforms in some games due to potential overfitting or local optima, a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity to hyperparameters (e.g., η, α, learning rates) would strengthen the empirical claims.\n2. Replay Buffer Prioritization: The paper briefly mentions the potential for prioritizing replay samples but does not explore this in the experiments. Including results with prioritized experience replay could further demonstrate the robustness of PGQL.\n3. Comparison with Recent Methods: While PGQL is compared to A3C and Q-learning, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent algorithms, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to position PGQL in the broader landscape of reinforcement learning.\n4. Clarity in Presentation: The theoretical sections, while rigorous, are dense and could benefit from additional visual aids (e.g., diagrams illustrating the relationship between policy gradient and Q-values) to improve accessibility for a broader audience.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does PGQL perform in continuous action spaces, where Q-learning is traditionally less effective? Have you considered extending the approach to environments like MuJoCo?\n2. Can you elaborate on the choice of η and its impact on the trade-off between policy gradient and Q-learning updates? Is there a principled way to tune this parameter?\n3. Have you explored the impact of different regularization techniques (e.g., KL-divergence) on the performance of PGQL?\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a well-motivated and rigorously evaluated algorithm that advances the state of the art in reinforcement learning. With minor clarifications and extensions, PGQL has the potential to make a significant impact in the field."
