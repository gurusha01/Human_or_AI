            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper addresses the problem of transferring skills between morphologically different agents in reinforcement learning (RL), such as robots with varying numbers of links or actuation mechanisms. The authors propose a novel method for learning invariant feature spaces that enable skill transfer between agents. This approach involves using shared skills (proxy tasks) to train deep neural networks that map agent-specific states into a common feature space, which can then be used to transfer new skills. The authors frame this as a form of \"analogy making\" across domains and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated robotic tasks, such as transferring skills between torque-driven and tendon-driven arms or robots with different link configurations. The paper also compares its method to several baselines, including CCA, kernel-CCA, and direct state mapping, and shows superior performance in sparse reward environments.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, presents a novel approach to a challenging problem, and provides rigorous experimental validation. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The proposed method of learning invariant feature spaces for transfer between morphologically different agents is novel and addresses a significant gap in the RL and robotics literature.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing baselines, especially in sparse reward settings.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-grounded in prior work on transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics. It highlights the limitations of existing methods, such as direct state mappings or linear embeddings, and positions its approach as a more general and scalable solution.\n2. Methodological Rigor: The use of deep neural networks to learn nonlinear mappings into a shared feature space is well-justified, and the inclusion of decoder networks to prevent degenerate solutions adds robustness. The alternating optimization procedure for alignment is a thoughtful addition to improve the method's applicability.\n3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering a range of tasks, morphologies, and state representations (e.g., raw pixels). The comparisons to strong baselines, including kernel-CCA and direct mapping, further validate the method's superiority. The use of sparse reward tasks highlights the practical utility of the approach.\nSuggestions for Improvement\nWhile the paper is strong overall, the following points could enhance its clarity and impact:\n1. Scalability to Real-World Applications: The experiments are conducted in simulation, and it would be helpful to discuss how the method could scale to real-world robotics, where noise, partial observability, and hardware constraints may pose challenges.\n2. Proxy Task Selection: The method relies on shared proxy tasks to learn the invariant feature space. A more detailed discussion on how to select or design these proxy tasks in practice would be valuable.\n3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters, such as the weight of the transfer reward (Î±). Including an ablation study or sensitivity analysis would strengthen the empirical results.\n4. Computational Complexity: Training deep networks for embedding functions and decoders can be computationally expensive. A discussion of the method's computational cost compared to baselines would provide additional context for its practicality.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How robust is the method to noisy or imperfect proxy tasks? For example, what happens if the proxy task trajectories are suboptimal or misaligned?\n2. Can the method handle scenarios where the agents have fundamentally different sensory modalities (e.g., vision vs. tactile sensing)?\n3. How does the method perform when transferring skills between more than two agents or when the agents have highly dissimilar morphologies (e.g., a wheeled robot and a humanoid)?\n4. Have you considered using adversarial training (e.g., GANs) to improve the quality of the learned invariant feature space?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of transfer learning in RL and robotics. With minor clarifications and additional discussions, it has the potential to be a highly impactful work."
