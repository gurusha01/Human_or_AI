By training a denoising auto-encoder on the discriminator's feature space, the authors aim to guide the generator toward producing samples that align with the high-level feature distribution of the training data. This approach addresses common GAN training challenges, such as mode collapse and the lack of recognizable objects in generated images from diverse datasets. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, demonstrating improvements in sample quality and robustness, as evidenced by higher Inception scores and qualitative results. The paper also highlights the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to prior work.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Impact: The proposed denoising feature matching loss is a well-motivated and novel contribution to GAN training, addressing key limitations in unsupervised image synthesis.\n2. Empirical Validation: The method is rigorously evaluated on multiple datasets, showing both qualitative and quantitative improvements over baseline GANs.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for using a denoising auto-encoder to estimate the gradient of the data distribution in the feature space. This builds on prior work (e.g., Alain & Bengio, 2014) and extends it in a meaningful way to GANs.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, covering diverse datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet) and comparing results with established baselines. The use of the Inception score as a quantitative metric aligns with prior work, enabling meaningful comparisons.\n3. Practical Contributions: The method is computationally efficient and robust to common GAN failure modes, such as mode collapse, which is a significant practical advantage.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and could benefit from a more concise and structured explanation of the proposed method. For instance, the mathematical formulation of the denoising feature matching loss could be simplified or accompanied by an intuitive diagram.\n2. Ablation Studies: While the method is evaluated against baselines, ablation studies isolating the contribution of the denoising feature matching loss (e.g., varying 位_denoise) would strengthen the claims.\n3. Non-Stationarity of Features: The authors acknowledge that the non-stationarity of the discriminator features may limit the denoiser's effectiveness. Exploring strategies to mitigate this issue, such as using a moving average of feature distributions, could improve the method further.\n4. Higher-Resolution Experiments: The experiments are limited to low-resolution datasets. Demonstrating the method's effectiveness on higher-resolution images (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256) would enhance its applicability.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly 位_denoise and the architecture of the denoising auto-encoder?\n2. Did the authors observe any trade-offs between the denoising feature matching loss and the traditional adversarial loss in terms of training stability or sample diversity?\n3. Could the method be extended to conditional or semi-supervised GANs, and if so, what modifications would be required?\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to improving GAN training for unsupervised image synthesis and is a strong candidate for acceptance."
