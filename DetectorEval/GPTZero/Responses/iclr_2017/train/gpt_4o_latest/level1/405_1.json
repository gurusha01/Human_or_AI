The authors address key challenges in environment simulation, including computational inefficiency and long-term prediction accuracy, by introducing action-dependent and prediction-independent state transitions. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of training schemes, demonstrating trade-offs between short-term and long-term accuracy. The proposed models are evaluated across diverse environments, including Atari games, 3D car racing, and 3D mazes, showcasing adaptability and improved exploration capabilities. The authors also demonstrate the feasibility of using their simulators for live human interaction and model-based exploration, achieving state-of-the-art results in several tasks.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its significant contributions to the field of environment simulation. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Impact: The introduction of action-dependent and prediction-independent state transitions, along with the detailed analysis of training schemes, represents a substantial advancement in understanding and improving environment simulators.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The models are rigorously tested across diverse environments, providing strong empirical evidence for their effectiveness and adaptability.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper builds on prior work (e.g., Oh et al., 2015) and addresses critical limitations, such as computational inefficiency and poor long-term prediction accuracy. The inclusion of action-dependent transitions is particularly compelling, as it enhances the model's ability to incorporate action information directly.\n2. Rigorous Analysis: The authors provide an extensive evaluation of training schemes, showing how different configurations affect short- and long-term accuracy. This analysis is valuable for guiding future research in the field.\n3. Strong Results: The proposed models outperform existing methods in several tasks, including Atari games and 3D environments. The ability to generalize to live human interaction and model-based exploration further underscores the practical utility of the approach.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is thorough, the dense technical details can be overwhelming. The authors could improve clarity by summarizing key findings in tables or diagrams, particularly for the training scheme comparisons.\n2. Generative Models: The paper acknowledges that the proposed models are deterministic and not designed for noisy environments. Exploring extensions to generative models could make the approach more applicable to real-world scenarios.\n3. Memory Structures: The authors note that alternative memory architectures may improve performance in complex environments like Ms. Pacman. Future work could explore hierarchical or modular memory systems to better capture compositional structure.\n4. Bias in Training Data: The authors highlight limitations due to policy-induced biases in the training data. Incorporating techniques to mitigate these biases, such as data augmentation or adversarial training, could enhance the robustness of the models.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the computational efficiency of the prediction-independent simulator compare to the prediction-dependent simulator in real-world applications? Are there trade-offs in terms of accuracy or scalability?\n2. Could the proposed models be extended to handle stochastic environments? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. The paper mentions that the models struggle with compositional dynamics (e.g., multiple independently moving objects). Could incorporating object-centric representations or attention mechanisms address this limitation?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of environment simulation and provides a strong foundation for future research. The proposed methods and analyses are well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and empirically validated, making this work a valuable addition to the AI community."
