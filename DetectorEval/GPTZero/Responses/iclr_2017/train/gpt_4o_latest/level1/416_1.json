            "inputText": "The paper introduces Maximum Entropy Flow Networks (MEFN), a novel approach to fitting continuous maximum entropy (ME) models by leveraging normalizing flow networks. The authors propose a method that avoids the computational challenges of traditional ME modeling, such as calculating normalizing constants and sampling from Gibbs distributions. Instead, MEFN learns a smooth, invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian) to the desired ME distribution. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of MEFN through simulations, financial applications (risk-neutral asset pricing), and texture synthesis, showcasing its ability to generate diverse samples while maintaining computational efficiency.\nDecision: Accept \nKey reasons: \n1. The paper addresses a significant and well-motivated problem in ME modeling, providing a practical solution to longstanding computational challenges. \n2. The proposed method is innovative, combining constrained optimization with normalizing flows, and demonstrates strong empirical results across diverse applications. \nSupporting Arguments: \nThe paper is well-placed in the literature, building on foundational work in ME modeling and normalizing flows. The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing methods and justify their approach. The use of normalizing flows to avoid biased entropy estimators and enable efficient sampling is particularly compelling. Results are presented rigorously, with comparisons to ground truth in simulations and state-of-the-art methods in applications. For example, the MEFN achieves comparable or superior performance to Gibbs-based methods in financial modeling and demonstrates increased sample diversity in texture synthesis. The inclusion of quantitative metrics (e.g., entropy, MMD, ANOVA-style analysis) strengthens the claims. \nAdditional Feedback: \n1. While the empirical results are strong, the theoretical guarantees of the augmented Lagrangian method for MEFN are not fully established. A more detailed discussion or proof of convergence would enhance the paper's rigor. \n2. The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the computational complexity of MEFN compared to traditional methods, especially for high-dimensional problems. \n3. In the texture synthesis experiments, the authors note a \"negative example\" where MEFN samples exhibit less visual diversity. It would be helpful to explore why this occurs and how hyperparameter tuning mitigates the issue. \n4. The financial application results are promising but could be expanded to include multi-dimensional assets or more complex market scenarios to demonstrate scalability. \nQuestions for the Authors: \n1. Can you provide more details on the computational efficiency of MEFN, particularly in high-dimensional settings? How does it scale with the number of constraints or the complexity of the transformation network? \n2. In the texture synthesis experiments, how sensitive is MEFN to hyperparameter choices? Could you provide guidelines for selecting these parameters? \n3. Could the proposed method be extended to discrete ME problems, or are there fundamental limitations due to the reliance on normalizing flows? \n4. How robust is MEFN to noisy or biased constraints, such as those encountered in real-world financial data? \nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of ME modeling and generative modeling, and I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions to address the above points."
