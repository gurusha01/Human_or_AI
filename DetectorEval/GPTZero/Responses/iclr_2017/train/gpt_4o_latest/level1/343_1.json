            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel statistical model for character-level language modeling, parameterized by a program written in a domain-specific language (DSL) called TChar. The authors claim that their approach combines the interpretability and efficiency of n-gram models with the precision of neural networks. The model is trained in two phases: synthesizing a program from the DSL and estimating probabilities via counting. The paper highlights the advantages of this approach, including fast query times, the ability to dynamically add/remove training samples, and human-readable models. Experimental results on the Linux Kernel and Hutter Prize Wikipedia datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art neural networks, particularly excelling in structured data like source code.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for this decision are the novelty of the approach and its demonstrated effectiveness on structured data. The paper makes a compelling case for the utility of DSL-based models in character-level language modeling, offering a promising alternative to neural networks in specific domains. The experimental results are robust, and the interpretability of the model is a significant contribution.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a well-motivated problem\"\"improving the interpretability and efficiency of language models while maintaining competitive precision. The use of a DSL to parameterize the model is innovative and bridges the gap between program synthesis and machine learning.\n2. Experimental Validation: The results are scientifically rigorous, with thorough comparisons against n-gram models and neural networks. The DSL model outperforms alternatives on structured data, achieving lower bits-per-character (BPC) and error rates on the Linux Kernel dataset. The authors also provide detailed analyses of training time, query speed, and model size, which strengthen their claims.\n3. Practical Contributions: The interpretability of the DSL-based model is a significant advantage over neural networks. The ability to manually inspect and extend the model makes it particularly valuable for domains like source code modeling.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity in DSL Syntax and Semantics: While the paper provides an informal description of the DSL, a more detailed and formal explanation of its syntax and semantics would improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with program synthesis.\n2. Comparison with Advanced Smoothing Techniques: The authors note that the DSL model uses the same smoothing techniques as n-grams. Including experiments with more sophisticated smoothing methods (e.g., Pitman-Yor processes) could further validate the model's robustness.\n3. Unstructured Data Performance: The model performs less effectively on unstructured text (e.g., Wikipedia data). The authors could explore ways to enhance the DSL's expressiveness or combine it with neural methods to improve performance in such cases.\n4. Visualization and Examples: While the authors provide an interactive visualization online, incorporating a few visual examples or diagrams in the paper would help readers better understand the synthesized programs and their behavior.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the DSL model handle out-of-vocabulary characters or rare events, and how does this compare to neural networks?\n2. Can the DSL be extended to handle word-level language modeling, and if so, what modifications would be required?\n3. What are the limitations of the current synthesis procedure, particularly in terms of scalability to larger datasets or more complex DSL instructions?\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to character-level language modeling. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are significant, and the work is a strong candidate for acceptance."
