            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper addresses the problem of image super-resolution (SR), which is inherently an underdetermined inverse problem. It critiques the limitations of traditional methods that rely on pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss, which often produce blurry and implausible outputs. The authors propose a novel approach based on amortized Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that ensures consistency between high-resolution (HR) outputs and low-resolution (LR) inputs through affine subspace projections. They introduce three methods to approximate MAP inference: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), (2) denoiser-guided SR, and (3) a density model trained via maximum likelihood. The paper provides theoretical grounding for these methods, particularly for GANs, and establishes a connection between GANs and variational inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the GAN-based approach (AffGAN) in producing perceptually superior SR results on natural images, grass textures, and faces.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image SR by proposing a theoretically grounded and empirically validated approach to address the limitations of existing methods. The introduction of affine subspace projections and the novel use of GANs for MAP inference are innovative and well-motivated. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly AffGAN, in producing sharp and plausible SR outputs. The paper also provides a strong theoretical foundation and connects adversarial methods to variational inference, which is a novel insight.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-situated in the literature, addressing a critical limitation of existing SR methods. The authors provide a thorough theoretical justification for their approach, particularly the use of MAP inference and affine projections.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering diverse datasets (natural images, grass textures, and faces) and demonstrating the advantages of the proposed methods over traditional MSE-based approaches. The results are robust, with AffGAN consistently outperforming other methods in perceptual quality.\n3. Novelty and Impact: The introduction of affine projections to enforce consistency and the theoretical connection between GANs and variational inference are novel contributions that have the potential to influence future research in SR and related fields.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity on Limitations: While the paper discusses the limitations of MAP inference (e.g., dependence on representation and atypicality of the mode), it would benefit from a more detailed exploration of how these limitations might affect practical applications of the proposed methods.\n2. Comparison with Sampling-Based Methods: The authors suggest that sampling from the posterior might produce more plausible results than MAP inference. Including a comparison with sampling-based methods (e.g., diffusion models) would strengthen the empirical evaluation.\n3. Ablation Studies: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of affine projections, it would be helpful to include ablation studies to quantify their contribution relative to other components of the model.\n4. High-Frequency Noise in GAN Results: The paper notes the presence of high-frequency noise in AffGAN outputs. A discussion of potential strategies to mitigate this issue would be valuable.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the performance of AffGAN compare to state-of-the-art diffusion models or other sampling-based approaches for SR?\n2. Could the affine projection layer be generalized to other inverse problems beyond SR? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. The paper mentions that AffGAN produces sharper results but sometimes introduces high-frequency noise. Could this be addressed through additional regularization or post-processing steps?\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a well-motivated, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated approach to SR. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are significant and warrant acceptance."
