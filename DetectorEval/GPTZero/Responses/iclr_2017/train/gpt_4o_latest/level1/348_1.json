            "inputText": "Review of \"Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper introduces Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a novel framework for designing convolutional networks that are equivariant to transformations such as rotations and reflections. The authors provide a mathematical foundation for steerable representations, demonstrating that any steerable representation can be decomposed into elementary feature types associated with specific symmetries. This decomposition allows for efficient parameter sharing and reduced parameter costs in steerable filter banks. The paper also extends the theory of steerable CNNs to include nonlinearities and proposes a type system for constructing architectures that respect equivariance constraints. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that steerable CNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, showcasing their utility as an inductive bias. The work is positioned as a generalization of prior equivariant CNNs, with potential applications in tasks requiring geometric reasoning.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of deep learning by advancing the understanding and implementation of equivariant neural networks. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Strong Theoretical Foundation: The paper provides a rigorous mathematical framework for steerable CNNs, grounded in group representation theory, and extends the field's understanding of equivariant architectures.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of steerable CNNs over baseline architectures, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, and establish state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in equivariant CNNs and steerable filters. It addresses a critical limitation of existing methods, namely the computational cost of scaling equivariance to larger symmetry groups, and provides a principled solution.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The claims are supported by both theoretical proofs and empirical evidence. The mathematical derivations are detailed and align with established principles in group representation theory. The experiments are thorough, comparing steerable CNNs to strong baselines and exploring different configurations of feature types and capsules.\n3. Practical Impact: The proposed framework is not only theoretically elegant but also practical, with clear guidelines for implementation. The ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters and better performance in low-data regimes is highly impactful.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the mathematical exposition is comprehensive, it may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with group representation theory. Including more intuitive explanations, visualizations, or simplified examples could improve accessibility.\n2. Broader Experiments: The experiments focus primarily on CIFAR datasets. Evaluating steerable CNNs on other tasks, such as pose estimation or medical imaging, would strengthen the claim of general applicability.\n3. Comparison to Other Methods: While the paper compares steerable CNNs to standard CNNs and ResNets, a more detailed comparison with other equivariant architectures (e.g., Group-equivariant CNNs) would provide additional context for the performance gains.\n4. Computational Efficiency: Although the paper discusses parameter efficiency, it would be helpful to include runtime comparisons or memory usage metrics to quantify the computational benefits of steerable CNNs.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive are the results to the choice of feature types and capsule configurations? Could the network automatically learn the optimal feature types?\n2. Can the proposed framework be extended to handle continuous symmetry groups in practice, and if so, what are the computational trade-offs?\n3. How do steerable CNNs perform on tasks requiring fine-grained geometric reasoning, such as 3D object recognition or motion estimation?\nOverall, this paper represents a substantial contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance after addressing the minor suggestions above."
