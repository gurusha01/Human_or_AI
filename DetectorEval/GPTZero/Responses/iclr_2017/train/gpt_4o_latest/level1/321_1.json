            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that addresses challenges in sparse reward and long-horizon tasks. The framework consists of two stages: (1) pre-training a diverse set of skills in an unsupervised manner using Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs) with a proxy reward and an information-theoretic regularizer, and (2) leveraging these skills in downstream tasks by training a high-level policy to select among the pre-trained skills. The use of SNNs enables the learning of multi-modal policies, while the mutual information (MI) bonus encourages skill diversity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on challenging tasks such as maze navigation and object collection, showing significant improvements in exploration and sample efficiency compared to baseline methods.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, makes a significant contribution to hierarchical reinforcement learning, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Impact: The integration of SNNs with MI regularization for skill learning and the hierarchical structure for downstream tasks is a compelling and innovative approach to tackle sparse reward problems.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness across multiple tasks and environments. The results consistently outperform baselines, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed method.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Relevance and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning\"\"sparse rewards and long horizons\"\"by combining intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods. The motivation is well-grounded in the literature, and the proposed solution is positioned as a general framework requiring minimal domain knowledge.\n2. Technical Soundness: The use of SNNs for skill learning is well-justified, as they naturally model multi-modal policies. The MI bonus is an elegant addition to encourage skill diversity, and the hierarchical architecture effectively leverages these skills for downstream tasks.\n3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering both pre-training and downstream tasks. The use of diverse environments, including mazes and object collection tasks, highlights the robustness and generalizability of the approach. The ablation studies further strengthen the claims by isolating the contributions of individual components (e.g., MI bonus, bilinear integration).\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Skill Switching in Unstable Robots: The paper notes challenges in skill switching for unstable agents like the Ant robot. Future work could explore adaptive switching mechanisms or end-to-end training to mitigate this issue.\n2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: While the paper provides some analysis of hyperparameters (e.g., MI bonus, switch time), a more detailed exploration of their impact on performance would be valuable for reproducibility and practical adoption.\n3. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper discusses related work, a more direct comparison with state-of-the-art HRL methods (e.g., Option-Critic) in terms of performance and sample efficiency would strengthen the evaluation.\n4. Scalability to Complex Tasks: The tasks studied are relatively simple compared to real-world applications. Future work could explore the scalability of the framework to more complex, dynamic, or multi-agent environments.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the framework to the choice of the proxy reward during pre-training? Would a poorly designed proxy reward significantly degrade performance?\n2. Have you considered incorporating recurrent architectures for the high-level policy to better utilize temporal information during skill selection?\n3. Can the framework be extended to handle dynamic tasks where the environment changes over time, requiring more adaptive skill switching?\nOverall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of hierarchical reinforcement learning and provides a solid foundation for future research. The proposed framework is both innovative and practical, addressing key challenges in sparse reward settings."
