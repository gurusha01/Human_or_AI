            "inputText": "The paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel method for unsupervised learning and identification of latent Markovian state-space models. The authors leverage Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) to address intractable inference distributions, enabling DVBF to handle complex, high-dimensional, non-Markovian input data such as image sequences without requiring domain knowledge. The key contributions include enforcing state-space model assumptions for reliable system identification, enabling long-term prediction, and scaling to large datasets via stochastic gradient descent. The experiments demonstrate DVBF's superior performance in recovering latent states with full information and generating realistic long-term predictions compared to existing methods like Deep Kalman Filters (DKF).\nDecision: Accept\nThe primary reasons for acceptance are the paper's significant methodological contribution and its empirical validation. DVBF addresses a critical gap in the literature by ensuring that latent states contain full information, which is crucial for downstream applications like control and reinforcement learning. The results convincingly show that DVBF outperforms DKF in recovering latent dynamics and generating stable long-term predictions, particularly in challenging environments such as dynamic pendulums and bouncing balls.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a thorough review of related work, clearly identifying the limitations of existing methods like VAEs, DKF, and E2C. The motivation for DVBF is well-articulated, particularly the need to prioritize latent state transitions over reconstruction for long-term prediction.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The paper rigorously derives the DVBF objective function and demonstrates its theoretical soundness. The use of annealed KL-divergence and locally linear transitions is well-justified and effectively implemented.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering diverse dynamical systems. The results, including quantitative metrics (e.g., RÂ² scores) and qualitative visualizations, strongly support the claims. DVBF's ability to generalize beyond training sequence lengths is particularly noteworthy.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, the dense mathematical exposition could be made more accessible. Adding intuitive explanations or visual aids for key equations (e.g., the reparameterization of transitions) would enhance readability.\n2. Comparison with Additional Baselines: Although the authors justify excluding E2C, including results from other state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the empirical evaluation.\n3. Ablation Studies: It would be helpful to include ablation studies to isolate the impact of key components, such as the annealed KL-divergence and locally linear transitions, on performance.\n4. Scalability Discussion: While the authors claim scalability to large datasets, experiments on larger-scale or real-world datasets would substantiate this claim.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How sensitive is DVBF to the choice of priors on transition parameters? Did you observe any performance degradation with different prior distributions?\n2. Can DVBF handle scenarios with missing or noisy observations? If so, how does it compare to existing methods in such settings?\n3. What are the computational costs of DVBF compared to DKF, particularly in terms of training time and memory requirements?\n4. How does DVBF perform on real-world datasets, such as video sequences or sensor data, beyond the simulated environments tested?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of unsupervised learning for dynamical systems. Addressing the above suggestions would further strengthen its impact."
