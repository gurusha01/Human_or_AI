            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel approach to perceptual similarity judgment by retraining a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with object persistence constraints, resulting in a model called Object Persistence Net (OPnet). The authors demonstrate that OPnet modifies the view-manifold of object representations, enabling it to better discriminate between objects within the same category and generalize to novel objects and categories. The paper claims that OPnet's learned feature representations align more closely with human perceptual similarity judgments than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence may play a key role in shaping human similarity perception. The authors validate their approach through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, novel categories, and human similarity judgment benchmarks, showing significant improvements over baseline models.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted due to its strong contribution to understanding perceptual similarity judgment and its innovative use of object persistence constraints in DCNN training. The work is well-motivated, addresses an important problem, and provides compelling empirical evidence to support its claims. Additionally, the results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, both in terms of generalization to novel objects and alignment with human perception.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper introduces a unique approach by incorporating object persistence constraints into a Siamese triplet architecture, which is both novel and well-motivated. The authors effectively position their work within the literature, highlighting gaps in existing methods and demonstrating how their approach addresses these limitations.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are thorough and scientifically rigorous. The authors evaluate OPnet across multiple datasets, including synthetic objects, novel categories, and human perception benchmarks. The significant improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and the higher correlation with human similarity judgments provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. Broader Implications: The findings have implications beyond computer vision, offering insights into the neural basis of human perceptual similarity judgment. The alignment of OPnet's feature representations with human perception is a particularly compelling result.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, the presentation could be improved. For example, the mathematical notation in the loss function and distance metric learning sections could be explained more intuitively for readers unfamiliar with these concepts.\n2. Real-World Generalization: The authors acknowledge that OPnet's performance on real-world datasets is limited due to factors like lighting and scale variations. Future work could explore how to make the model more robust to such variations, potentially by incorporating additional nuisance variables during training.\n3. Human Perception Validation: While the Spearman correlation with human similarity judgments is promising, the paper could benefit from more extensive validation with human-labeled ground truth data. This would strengthen the claim that OPnet models human perception.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the choice of margin parameter \\( M \\) in the hinge loss function affect the performance of OPnet? Could a dynamic or adaptive margin improve results?\n2. Have you considered testing OPnet on datasets with more complex real-world variations, such as occlusions or cluttered backgrounds? If so, how does it perform?\n3. Could the proposed method be extended to other perceptual tasks, such as texture or material similarity judgment? If not, what are the limitations?\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is a strong candidate for acceptance. The authors are encouraged to address the above suggestions to further enhance the impact and clarity of their work."
