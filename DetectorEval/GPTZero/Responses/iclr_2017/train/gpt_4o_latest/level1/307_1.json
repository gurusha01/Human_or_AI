The authors focus on restaurant reservation tasks, breaking them into five subtasks to evaluate specific dialog capabilities, such as dialog management, querying knowledge bases (KBs), and handling unseen entities. They demonstrate the utility of their testbed by evaluating Memory Networks (MemNNs), a neural architecture, against traditional slot-filling baselines and other methods. The results show that while MemNNs outperform baselines on several tasks, they still struggle with complex operations like interpreting API call results and handling full dialogs. The paper also includes experiments on real-world datasets, such as the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2) and an online concierge service, to validate the generalizability of their findings.\nDecision: Accept \nKey reasons: \n1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces a well-motivated and systematic testbed for evaluating end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented settings, addressing a critical gap in the literature. \n2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough, comparing multiple methods across synthetic and real-world datasets, and the results are clearly presented with insightful analysis. \nSupporting Arguments: \n1. Well-Placed in Literature: The paper builds on prior work in dialog systems and neural architectures, such as Memory Networks, and positions itself as a resource for advancing research in goal-oriented dialog systems. The comparison to traditional slot-filling methods and other baselines is comprehensive and highlights the strengths and limitations of end-to-end approaches. \n2. Claims Supported by Results: The authors provide empirical evidence to support their claims, showing that MemNNs can handle tasks like issuing API calls but struggle with more complex operations. The use of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the validity of their conclusions. \n3. Reproducibility: The testbed and datasets are made publicly available, ensuring that other researchers can build on this work. \nSuggestions for Improvement: \n1. Error Analysis: While the paper identifies areas where MemNNs fall short (e.g., interpreting API results), a deeper qualitative analysis of failure cases would provide more actionable insights for future research. \n2. Model Variants: The paper could explore additional end-to-end architectures or hybrid approaches that combine neural models with rule-based systems to address the observed limitations. \n3. Evaluation Metrics: The reliance on per-response and per-dialog accuracy is reasonable, but incorporating metrics like user satisfaction or task completion time could provide a more holistic evaluation. \nQuestions for Authors: \n1. How does the testbed generalize to other domains beyond restaurant reservation? Could the tasks be adapted to other goal-oriented applications like travel booking or customer support? \n2. Did you experiment with alternative neural architectures, such as transformers or reinforcement learning-based methods, and how do they compare to MemNNs? \n3. Can you elaborate on the scalability of your approach, particularly in handling larger KBs or more complex dialog scenarios? \nConclusion: \nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of goal-oriented dialog systems by providing a systematic testbed and demonstrating its utility through rigorous experiments. While there is room for improvement in addressing the limitations of current models, the work lays a strong foundation for future research and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference."
