            "inputText": "Review\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel variation of Gatys et al.'s CNN-based texture synthesis method by incorporating correlations between spatially shifted feature responses. The proposed approach addresses limitations in capturing long-range structures in textures, a significant improvement over the original method. The authors claim that their method enhances texture synthesis for textures with long-range regular structures, improves performance in texture inpainting tasks, and yields better results in season transfer applications when combined with Gatys et al.'s style transfer. Additionally, the method preserves symmetry properties by matching correlations between spatially flipped feature maps. While the results are promising, the computational cost of the proposed method is significantly higher, which is a notable drawback.\nDecision: Reject\nThe paper presents an interesting and well-motivated extension to Gatys et al.'s work, but it falls short in providing sufficient empirical rigor to support all its claims. The computational expense of the method further limits its practical applicability. Below, I provide detailed reasoning for this decision.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Strengths: \n - The paper addresses a clear limitation in Gatys et al.'s work by incorporating long-range spatial correlations, which is a meaningful contribution to texture synthesis research. \n - The results for structured textures and inpainting tasks demonstrate qualitative improvements over the baseline, particularly in preserving long-range structures and symmetry. \n - The method's ability to preserve symmetry properties is novel and could inspire future work in this area. \n2. Weaknesses: \n - Empirical Validation: While the qualitative results are visually compelling, the paper lacks quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate the improvements. For example, no user studies or perceptual similarity metrics are provided to substantiate claims (a) and (b). \n - Claim (c) - Season Transfer: The claim that the method improves season transfer is weakly supported. The results are described as \"similar\" to Gatys et al., with only a few qualitative examples provided. This does not convincingly demonstrate superiority. \n - Computational Expense: The method's computational cost is a significant drawback, especially given that texture synthesis and style transfer are already resource-intensive tasks. The paper does not propose any strategies to mitigate this limitation. \n - Generality: The method's reliance on specific parameter tuning (e.g., Î´ values) for different textures raises concerns about its generalizability. \nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Quantitative Evaluation: Include quantitative metrics (e.g., perceptual loss, structural similarity index) or user studies to substantiate claims of improvement in texture synthesis, inpainting, and season transfer tasks. \n2. Efficiency: Explore ways to reduce the computational overhead, such as approximations or pruning techniques, to make the method more practical for real-world applications. \n3. Generality: Provide a more systematic analysis of how the method performs across a diverse set of textures and tasks. The current results, while promising, are limited in scope. \n4. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components, such as the spatially shifted Gram matrices and symmetry-preserving terms. This would clarify their individual impact on the results. \n5. Broader Comparisons: Compare the proposed method to other state-of-the-art approaches beyond Gatys et al., particularly for inpainting tasks, where other specialized methods may perform better.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the method perform quantitatively compared to Gatys et al. and other state-of-the-art methods for texture synthesis and inpainting? \n2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost (e.g., runtime, memory usage) and how it scales with image resolution? \n3. How robust is the method to variations in the Î´ parameter? Is there a way to automate its selection for different textures? \n4. Have the authors considered any strategies to reduce the computational overhead, such as using lower-dimensional representations or approximations? \nIn conclusion, while the paper presents a creative and meaningful extension to Gatys et al.'s work, it requires stronger empirical validation, broader comparisons, and a more practical approach to computational efficiency to be suitable for acceptance."
