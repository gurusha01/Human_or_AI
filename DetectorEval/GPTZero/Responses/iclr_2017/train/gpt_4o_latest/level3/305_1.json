The authors employ a cascaded architecture of convolutional layers with biologically-inspired Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) non-linearities, which are optimized jointly with uniform quantization and entropy coding. The approach is grounded in rate-distortion theory and introduces a continuous relaxation of the quantization process to enable stochastic gradient descent optimization. The proposed method outperforms JPEG and JPEG2000 in terms of rate-distortion performance and achieves significantly improved perceptual quality, as evidenced by MS-SSIM metrics and visual comparisons. The paper also provides an entropy coding implementation to ensure practical applicability, reporting actual bit rates rather than entropy estimates. This work represents a substantial advancement in image compression, with the potential for significant impact in the field.\nDecision: Accept\nThe decision to accept this paper is based on two key reasons: (1) the technical rigor and novelty of the proposed framework, which integrates rate-distortion optimization with deep learning in a principled and effective manner, and (2) the empirical results, which demonstrate superior performance compared to established methods (JPEG, JPEG2000) in both objective metrics and subjective visual quality. The paper is well-written, methodologically sound, and addresses a critical challenge in image compression.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Technical Strengths: The use of GDN non-linearities inspired by biological vision systems is innovative and highly effective in Gaussianizing image densities, leading to efficient compression. The continuous relaxation for quantization is a clever solution that enables gradient-based optimization while maintaining practical relevance.\n2. Baseline Comparisons: Unlike many prior works that rely on outdated baselines (e.g., JPEG), this paper includes comparisons with JPEG2000, a more modern and competitive standard. This strengthens the credibility of the reported improvements.\n3. Impact Potential: The proposed method's ability to achieve better perceptual quality at lower bit rates is a significant contribution, especially in applications where visual fidelity is critical (e.g., medical imaging, streaming).\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Additional Results: The inclusion of results on standard benchmark images (e.g., Lena, Barbara, Baboon) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation and facilitate comparison with classical methods.\n2. Positioning Relative to Classical Methods: While the paper demonstrates clear advantages over JPEG and JPEG2000, a more explicit discussion of how neural network-based methods fundamentally differ from and improve upon classical transform coding approaches would enhance the reader's understanding.\n3. Broader Comparisons: Comparisons with other state-of-the-art neural network-based compression methods (e.g., Toderici et al., 2016) would provide a fuller context for the contributions of this work.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method perform on images with high-frequency content (e.g., Baboon) compared to classical methods?\n2. Can the authors provide insights into the computational efficiency of the encoding and decoding processes, particularly for real-time applications?\n3. Have the authors considered optimizing the framework using perceptual metrics (e.g., MS-SSIM) instead of MSE, and if so, what were the results?\nOverall, this paper represents a significant contribution to the field of image compression and is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions to address the above suggestions."
