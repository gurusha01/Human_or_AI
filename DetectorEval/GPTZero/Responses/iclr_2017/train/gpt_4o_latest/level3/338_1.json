            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper provides a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, proposing that these architectures perform \"unrolled iterative estimation\" rather than the traditional hierarchical representation learning. The authors argue that successive layers within a stage iteratively refine a single representation instead of computing entirely new ones. This perspective is supported by theoretical derivations and preliminary experimental evidence. The paper also compares Highway and Residual networks, demonstrating their conceptual similarities and differences, particularly in tasks requiring dynamic feature replacement. The iterative unrolling view is simple, intuitive, and theoretically grounded, offering a unified framework to understand these architectures and their surprising properties, such as resilience to lesioning and mild effects of layer reshuffling.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper introduces a compelling theoretical framework that challenges the conventional representation view of deep networks. While the empirical results are limited, the theoretical contributions and insights into the design of Highway and Residual networks are significant and could inspire further research. The decision to accept is based on the novelty of the perspective and its potential impact on the field.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Theoretical Rigor: The unrolled iterative estimation perspective is a fresh and well-motivated idea, supported by clear theoretical derivations. The paper successfully unifies Highway and Residual networks under this framework, providing a deeper understanding of their mechanisms.\n2. Clarity and Intuition: The iterative unrolling concept is intuitive and effectively visualized in Figure 3, making it accessible to a broad audience. The theoretical results are presented clearly, with sufficient mathematical rigor.\n3. Potential Impact: By challenging the traditional representation view, the paper opens avenues for rethinking the design and analysis of deep networks. The insights into feature identity preservation and iterative refinement are particularly valuable for understanding and improving very deep architectures.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Empirical Validation: The paper would benefit from more extensive empirical evidence to support the iterative estimation view. The experiments are limited to specific tasks, and broader validation across diverse datasets and architectures would strengthen the claims.\n2. Figures 4 and 5: These figures should be combined and enlarged for better clarity, particularly to highlight the effects of batch normalization. This would improve the readability and impact of the visual evidence.\n3. Practical Implications: While the theoretical insights are strong, the paper could elaborate on practical implications for network design, such as guidelines for choosing between Highway and Residual networks in specific applications.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide additional empirical evidence to validate the iterative estimation view across different tasks and datasets? For example, how does this perspective hold in NLP or reinforcement learning settings?\n2. How does the iterative estimation view align with recent advancements in architectures like transformers or vision transformers? Could this perspective be extended to these models?\n3. Could you clarify the role of batch normalization in the iterative estimation framework? Are there alternative normalization techniques that might better support this perspective?\nOverall, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution and provides a fresh perspective on deep network architectures. Addressing the suggested improvements could further enhance its impact."
