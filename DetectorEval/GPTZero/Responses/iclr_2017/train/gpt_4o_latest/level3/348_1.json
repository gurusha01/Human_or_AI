            "inputText": "Review of \"Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper introduces a theoretical framework for Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are designed to achieve equivariance to transformations in input data. The authors leverage group theory to formalize steerability and demonstrate how steerable representations can be decomposed into elementary feature types, enabling efficient parameter sharing. The work builds on foundational concepts from the 1990s in image processing and extends them to modern CNN architectures. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that steerable CNNs outperform standard architectures, particularly in low-data regimes, and achieve state-of-the-art results on full datasets. The paper also highlights the potential of steerable CNNs for future work in continuous transformations and geometrical tasks.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper presents a novel and theoretically grounded approach, the following issues prevent its acceptance in its current form:\n1. Limited Scope of Transformations: The paper restricts its analysis to discrete transformations, which does not fully justify the complexity of the proposed framework. Addressing continuous transformations\"\"a critical challenge in practical applications\"\"is only mentioned as future work.\n2. Unclear Experimental Descriptions: The empirical results are promising, but the lack of clarity in the experimental setup makes it difficult to replicate or validate the findings.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Strengths:\n - The concept of steerability is significant and well-motivated, with clear connections to prior work in image processing and group theory.\n - The theoretical framework is rigorous, and the parameter efficiency of steerable CNNs is a valuable contribution to the field.\n - The empirical results demonstrate the practical utility of steerable CNNs, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.\n2. Weaknesses:\n - The restriction to discrete groups limits the generalizability of the approach. While the authors argue that the theory extends to continuous groups, this is not demonstrated empirically or theoretically in sufficient detail.\n - The experimental section lacks sufficient detail on the architecture, training procedure, and hyperparameter tuning, making it challenging to reproduce the results. For example, the choice of capsule types and their combinations is not adequately justified or explained.\n - The paper does not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art equivariant architectures on the same benchmarks, leaving the relative performance unclear.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Address Continuous Transformations: Extend the theoretical framework and experiments to include continuous transformations, as this would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the work.\n2. Improve Experimental Clarity: Provide detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including hyperparameter choices, architecture configurations, and training protocols. A supplementary section with code or pseudocode would greatly aid reproducibility.\n3. Broader Comparisons: Include comparisons with other recent equivariant architectures, such as Group Equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs), on the same datasets to contextualize the performance gains.\n4. Simplify Presentation: The paper is dense and mathematically complex, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. Consider providing more intuitive explanations and visualizations of key concepts, such as steerability and feature types.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method compare to other equivariant architectures (e.g., G-CNNs) in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy on the same benchmarks?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the choice and combination of capsule types in the experiments? How sensitive are the results to these choices?\n3. What specific challenges do you anticipate in extending the framework to continuous transformations, and how might these be addressed?\nIn conclusion, while the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the limitations in scope and experimental clarity need to be addressed before it can be considered for acceptance."
