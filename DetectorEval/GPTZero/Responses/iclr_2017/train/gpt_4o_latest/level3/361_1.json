            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach to predicting learning curves using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with a specialized learning curve layer. The proposed method generalizes across hyperparameters and employs stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) for improved uncertainty estimation. The authors demonstrate the ability to extrapolate partially observed learning curves and predict unobserved curves across various architectures, including fully connected networks (FC), convolutional neural networks (CNN), logistic regression (LR), and variational autoencoders (VAE). The method shows potential for enhancing Bayesian optimization by integrating learning curve predictions into the Hyperband framework, resulting in faster convergence to optimal hyperparameter configurations. The paper also compares the proposed method against several baselines, including Gaussian processes, random forests, and other Bayesian neural network techniques, showing competitive or superior performance in most cases.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper addresses a well-motivated and practically relevant problem in hyperparameter optimization and contributes a novel method with strong empirical results. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The integration of a specialized learning curve layer into Bayesian neural networks is a meaningful contribution that improves the modeling of learning curves across hyperparameters.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple architectures and datasets, and the comparisons against strong baselines are convincing.\n3. Potential for Impact: The proposed method has clear applications in speeding up hyperparameter optimization, a critical bottleneck in deep learning workflows.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in learning curve prediction and Bayesian optimization while addressing key limitations of existing methods. The use of SGHMC for uncertainty estimation is a thoughtful design choice, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed method outperforms baselines in predicting both partially observed and unobserved learning curves, which are crucial tasks for practical hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, the integration of the model into Hyperband showcases its utility in real-world optimization scenarios, where it achieves faster convergence to optimal configurations compared to traditional Bayesian optimization.\nSuggestions for Improvement\nWhile the paper is strong overall, the following points could further enhance its quality:\n1. Experimentation: The paper would benefit from a direct comparison of the proposed method's advantages over traditional Bayesian optimization in terms of wall-clock time and computational efficiency. This would solidify its claim of practical utility.\n2. Handling Learning Rate Decays: The authors should explore how the method handles learning rate schedules, as this is a common feature in deep learning training protocols.\n3. Evaluation Metrics: Beyond mean squared error (MSE) and log-likelihood (LL), the authors could include metrics that assess the ability to identify the most promising hyperparameter configurations early in the optimization process.\n4. Figure Readability: The figures, particularly Figure 6, need improvement. The fonts are too small, and some lines appear to overlap or are missing, which hampers interpretability.\n5. Extrapolation from Subsets of Data: Exploring the model's ability to extrapolate learning curves from random subsets of data could provide additional insights into its robustness.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method handle learning rate schedules, such as step-wise or exponential decays, which can significantly affect learning curves?\n2. Could the authors provide more details on the computational overhead introduced by the model-based Hyperband extension? How does this compare to the baseline Hyperband in terms of wall-clock time?\n3. Have the authors considered using alternative evaluation metrics, such as precision in identifying top-performing configurations, to assess practical relevance?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of hyperparameter optimization by introducing a novel method for learning curve prediction. With minor improvements and additional clarifications, it has the potential to make a significant impact on both research and practice."
