            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for adaptive, imagination-based optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) systems. The proposed metacontroller learns to balance computational cost and task performance by dynamically deciding how many optimization iterations to perform and which predictive models (experts) to consult. The metacontroller leverages a model-free RL agent to manage a pool of experts, which can include state transition models, action-value functions, or other predictive mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate the framework's ability to adaptively allocate computational resources based on task difficulty, outperforming fixed-policy approaches in terms of cost-effectiveness and performance. The paper also highlights the flexibility of the metacontroller in selecting experts and adjusting computational effort on a per-task basis.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-written, presents an interesting and impactful contribution, and demonstrates strong experimental results. However, there are areas where clarity and connections to existing literature could be improved, as detailed below.\nSupporting Arguments for the Decision\n1. Novelty and Significance: The proposed metacontroller framework addresses a critical challenge in RL\"\"efficient allocation of computational resources. By introducing a mechanism to adaptively balance computation and performance, the paper opens new avenues for resource-constrained RL applications.\n2. Experimental Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the metacontroller's ability to outperform fixed-policy baselines, particularly in scenarios with varying task difficulty. The results also highlight the framework's flexibility in leveraging multiple experts, albeit with some limitations.\n3. Writing and Presentation: The paper is engaging and generally well-structured. The abstract and introduction effectively convey the motivation and contributions, making the work accessible to a broad audience.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Formalism: The formalism in the paper, particularly around Figure 1A, is difficult to follow without concrete examples. Including a step-by-step walkthrough of the metacontroller's decision-making process with a simple example would greatly enhance clarity.\n2. Algorithm Descriptions: The inclusion of algorithm boxes for the metacontroller and its components (e.g., manager, controller, experts) would improve the paper's readability and make the framework easier to reproduce.\n3. Connections to Literature: The paper could better situate its contributions within the context of related work. Specifically, a discussion of how the proposed framework relates to Snoek, Larochelle, and Adams' approach in Practical Bayesian Optimization would strengthen the theoretical grounding.\n4. Exploration of Metaexperts: While the experiments with multiple experts are promising, the results suggest room for improvement in managing experts with varying reliability. A deeper exploration of this aspect, including potential strategies to address the entropy regularization issue, would add value.\n5. Generalization: The paper briefly mentions potential extensions to planning and control tasks but does not explore these in depth. Including a discussion of how the framework might generalize to more complex, multi-step decision-making tasks would broaden its impact.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Could you provide a concrete example or case study to illustrate the metacontroller's decision-making process, particularly in terms of selecting experts and determining the number of iterations?\n2. How does the proposed framework compare to Practical Bayesian Optimization in terms of computational efficiency and adaptability?\n3. Did you explore alternative methods for managing the entropy term in the manager's policy? If so, what were the results?\n4. How might the framework perform with a larger pool of metaexperts, especially if some experts are highly unreliable or computationally expensive?\nAdditional Feedback\n- The experimental results are compelling, but it would be helpful to include a broader range of tasks to demonstrate the framework's generalizability.\n- Consider visualizing the trade-off between computational cost and task performance more explicitly in the results section.\n- The discussion section could benefit from a more detailed exploration of potential limitations and future work, particularly regarding scalability and robustness to noisy experts.\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adaptive RL and is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the above points to improve clarity and situate the work more firmly within the existing literature."
