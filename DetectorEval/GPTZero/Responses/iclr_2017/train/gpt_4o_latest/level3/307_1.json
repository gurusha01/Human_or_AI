            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel public dataset and a set of tasks designed to evaluate goal-oriented dialogue systems, particularly focusing on end-to-end neural models. The dataset, centered around a restaurant reservation scenario, is constructed using rule-based programs and includes synthetic as well as real-world data. The authors break down the goal-oriented dialogue process into subtasks (e.g., issuing API calls, updating API calls, displaying options, etc.) to facilitate error analysis and reproducibility. They compare the performance of various models, including rule-based systems, classical information retrieval methods, supervised embeddings, and Memory Networks, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of these approaches. The paper aims to serve as a testbed for systematically evaluating and improving end-to-end dialogue systems.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper makes a valuable contribution by introducing a new dataset and task framework, it has significant limitations that prevent acceptance in its current form. The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of clarity in evaluating the suitability of deep learning models for the tasks and methodological weaknesses in the baseline comparisons.\nSupporting Arguments for the Decision\n1. Deterministic Nature of the Dataset: The dataset is fully deterministic, which limits its ability to model real-world noisy or ambiguous interactions. This restricts its applicability to real-world dialogue systems, where uncertainty and variability are common.\n2. Baseline Model Weakness: The absence of a non-neural network benchmark model with word order information (e.g., logistic regression with word embeddings and bi-gram features) is a significant oversight. This omission makes neural models appear stronger than they might actually be, as their performance is not compared against simpler, interpretable baselines.\n3. Unclear Suitability of Deep Learning Models: The paper does not convincingly demonstrate whether the performance differences among deep learning models stem from their task-specific capabilities or from regularization techniques. This raises questions about the validity of the reported results.\n4. Inaccurate Claim in the Conclusion: The paper's claim that there is a lack of well-defined performance measures for dialogue systems is incorrect. Established evaluation metrics exist for both task-oriented and non-task-oriented systems, and this oversight undermines the credibility of the conclusions.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Address Dataset Limitations: Introduce noise or ambiguity into the dataset to better reflect real-world scenarios. This would make the dataset more robust and valuable for evaluating dialogue systems in practical settings.\n2. Add Non-Neural Baselines: Include a non-neural benchmark model, such as logistic regression with word embeddings and bi-gram features, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed tasks.\n3. Clarify Model Suitability: Conduct additional experiments to disentangle the effects of regularization techniques from task-specific capabilities in deep learning models. This would provide a clearer understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\n4. Revise the Conclusion: Correct the inaccurate claim about evaluation metrics and acknowledge the existing methods in the literature. This would strengthen the paper's positioning within the field.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do you plan to address the deterministic nature of the dataset to make it more applicable to real-world scenarios?\n2. Why was a non-neural benchmark model with word order information not included in the evaluation? Would you consider adding such a baseline in future work?\n3. Can you provide more evidence to support the claim that the observed performance differences among deep learning models are due to task-specific capabilities rather than regularization techniques?\n4. How do you see your dataset complementing existing resources like the Dialog State Tracking Challenge datasets, which also focus on goal-oriented dialogue?\nIn summary, while the paper introduces a valuable dataset and task framework, its methodological limitations and lack of clarity in evaluating deep learning models hinder its impact. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the paper's contribution to the field."
