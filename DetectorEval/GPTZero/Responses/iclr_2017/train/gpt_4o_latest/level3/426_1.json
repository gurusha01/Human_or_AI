The authors propose a novel approach that combines orthogonal transformations, derived via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), with an innovative \"inverted softmax\" retrieval method to improve translation precision. The paper demonstrates that orthogonal transformations are robust to noise, enabling the construction of bilingual embeddings without expert bilingual dictionaries, using pseudo-dictionaries based on identical character strings. Additionally, the method is extended to sentence-level alignment, achieving competitive results in retrieving sentence translations from large corpora. The authors claim improvements over prior methods, including Mikolov et al. (2013a), with a significant boost in translation precision from 34% to 43% on English-Italian word alignment tasks.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper introduces an innovative and theoretically sound approach, the lack of strong evaluation on downstream tasks and limited experimentation with diverse language pairs weaken its overall impact. The contribution is promising but requires further validation and broader applicability to merit acceptance.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Strengths:\n - The theoretical insight that the optimal linear transformation should be orthogonal is well-argued and supported by rigorous derivations.\n - The inverted softmax is a novel and effective solution to the hubness problem, yielding significant improvements in translation precision.\n - The method's robustness to low-quality dictionaries, demonstrated through pseudo-dictionaries, is a valuable contribution.\n2. Weaknesses:\n - The evaluation focuses primarily on precision metrics for word and sentence translation but lacks experiments on downstream tasks (e.g., cross-lingual text classification or machine translation). This limits the practical relevance of the proposed method.\n - The experiments are restricted to English-Italian and other European languages. Broader testing on typologically diverse language pairs (e.g., English-Chinese or English-Hindi) is necessary to establish generalizability.\n - The paper misses key citations, such as Haghighi et al. (2008) for CCA-based bilingual alignment and Hermann & Blunsom (2013) for multilingual embeddings, which would better contextualize the contributions within existing literature.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Broader Evaluation: Include experiments on downstream tasks to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method. For example, evaluate the bilingual embeddings in cross-lingual sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.\n2. Diverse Language Pairs: Extend experiments to non-European languages, especially those with different scripts and linguistic structures, to validate the method's robustness across diverse settings.\n3. Citations and Context: Cite Haghighi et al. (2008) and Hermann & Blunsom (2013) to provide a more comprehensive overview of related work. Discuss how the proposed approach compares to these methods.\n4. Terminology: Reconsider the use of the term \"translation\" for word alignment, as it may lead to confusion with machine translation tasks.\n5. Orthogonality Discussion: Expand the discussion on orthogonality requirements by connecting them to concepts like Mahalanobis distance or covariance matrices, which could provide additional theoretical grounding.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Have you evaluated the proposed method on any downstream tasks? If not, could you provide insights into its potential performance in such scenarios?\n2. How does the method perform on language pairs with significant morphological or syntactic differences (e.g., English-Finnish or English-Arabic)?\n3. Could you clarify why the inverted softmax performs poorly when translating from Italian to English in sentence retrieval tasks? Would tuning the inverse temperature parameter improve this?\nWhile the paper makes meaningful contributions, addressing the above concerns would significantly enhance its impact and readiness for publication."
