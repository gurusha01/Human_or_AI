            "inputText": "Review\nSummary\nThe paper introduces a novel domain-specific language (DSL), TChar, for character-level language modeling (CLM). The authors claim that their approach combines the interpretability and efficiency of traditional n-gram models with the precision of neural networks. The proposed DSL allows for the synthesis of specialized probabilistic models tailored to specific contexts, offering compactness, faster query times, and human-readability. Experiments on the Linux Kernel and Hutter Prize Wikipedia datasets demonstrate that the DSL-based models are competitive with neural CLMs, particularly excelling in structured data like source code. The paper highlights advantages such as modularity, interpretability, and the ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge.\nDecision: Reject\nThe primary reasons for rejection are the lack of clarity in the approach and insufficient experimental depth. While the idea of using a DSL for CLM is intriguing, the paper fails to convincingly demonstrate its validity as a probabilistic model or provide adequate training details. Additionally, the experimental evaluation is incomplete, leaving critical questions about the model's capabilities unanswered.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Clarity and Probabilistic Validity: The paper does not clearly establish how probabilities are computed or encoded within the DSL framework. While it claims to produce valid probability distributions, the explanation is vague, and the probabilistic nature of the model remains questionable. The training process, particularly the synthesis of programs and optimization, is inadequately explained, leaving readers unable to assess or reproduce the approach.\n2. Experimental Weaknesses: The experiments lack depth and fail to provide crucial insights. For instance, no generative samples are shown, which would help evaluate the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies or structured outputs. The omission of such analysis is a significant oversight, especially when the paper claims advantages in handling structured data. Additionally, the comparison with neural models is limited, and the performance on unstructured text (Wikipedia) is underwhelming.\n3. Target Audience and Accessibility: The paper appears to cater to a niche sub-community familiar with program synthesis and DSLs, making it difficult for a broader audience to engage with the work. The technical exposition is dense, and key concepts, such as the semantics of TChar or the MCMC-based synthesis process, are not sufficiently elaborated.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarify Probabilistic Foundations: Provide a rigorous explanation of how the DSL ensures valid probability distributions. Include formal definitions and derivations to establish the model's probabilistic soundness.\n2. Expand Training Details: Elaborate on the training process, including how the cost function is optimized, how regularization is applied, and how the synthesis process balances efficiency and expressiveness.\n3. Enhance Experimental Analysis: Include generative samples and analyze the model's ability to handle structured and unstructured data. Explore its performance on tasks requiring long-range syntax constraints or other structured dependencies.\n4. Broaden Accessibility: Simplify the presentation of the DSL and its synthesis process to make the paper accessible to a wider audience. Provide more intuitive explanations and examples to illustrate the approach.\n5. Address Practicality: Discuss the scalability of the approach, especially for larger datasets or more complex tasks. Highlight potential use cases where the DSL-based model would outperform existing methods.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed DSL guarantee valid probabilistic outputs? Can you provide a formal explanation or proof?\n2. What specific challenges were encountered during the synthesis of TChar programs, and how were they addressed?\n3. Why were generative samples not included in the experiments? Could you share examples of outputs generated by the model?\n4. How does the DSL handle long-range dependencies compared to neural models? Are there specific cases where it struggles?\n5. Could the approach be extended to word-level or higher-level language modeling tasks? If so, what modifications would be required?\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an innovative idea, it lacks the necessary rigor and depth to justify its claims. Addressing the outlined issues could significantly strengthen the work and make it more impactful."
