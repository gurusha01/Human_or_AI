The authors propose a simple baseline method that utilizes softmax probabilities to distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD examples. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this baseline across diverse tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition. Additionally, the paper introduces an auxiliary \"abnormality module\" that leverages internal network representations to improve detection performance in certain cases. The authors also contribute standard tasks and evaluation metrics to facilitate future research in this domain.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted because it provides a strong baseline for an underexplored but highly relevant problem, and its findings are well-supported by rigorous experiments across multiple domains. While the methods lack significant novelty, the work offers a valuable foundation for future research and practical applications.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Significance of the Problem: The problem of detecting errors and OOD examples is crucial for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications. The paper highlights this importance and positions its contributions as a step toward improving AI safety.\n \n2. Baseline Contribution: The proposed baseline method, based on softmax probabilities, is simple yet effective. The results demonstrate its utility across a range of datasets and tasks, making it a valuable reference point for future research.\n3. Experimental Rigor: The paper evaluates its methods on diverse tasks (e.g., image classification, sentiment analysis, speech recognition) and datasets, using well-defined metrics like AUROC and AUPR. The results are statistically significant and reproducible, lending credibility to the claims.\n4. Community Contribution: By defining standard tasks and metrics, the paper provides a framework for benchmarking future methods, which is a meaningful contribution to the research community.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Novelty: The paper would benefit from a more substantial methodological contribution. While the abnormality module is an interesting addition, it is not explored in sufficient depth to stand out as a novel approach. Future work could focus on developing and evaluating more advanced detection techniques.\n2. Analysis of Limitations: The paper acknowledges that the baseline is sometimes outperformed but does not deeply analyze the failure cases. A more detailed discussion of when and why the baseline fails would provide valuable insights for researchers aiming to improve upon it.\n3. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper is well-placed in the literature, it could include a more detailed comparison with existing methods for OOD detection and confidence estimation. This would help contextualize the contributions and highlight the baseline's relative strengths and weaknesses.\n4. Abnormality Module: The abnormality module shows promise but is underexplored. The authors could provide more experimental results and analysis to better understand its potential and limitations.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the baseline method compare to state-of-the-art OOD detection techniques beyond softmax-based approaches?\n2. Could the abnormality module be adapted for real-time or low-latency applications? If so, what are the computational trade-offs?\n3. What are the key factors that influence the baseline's performance across different tasks and datasets? For example, does the complexity of the dataset or model architecture significantly affect the results?\nIn conclusion, while the paper lacks groundbreaking methodological innovation, it provides a strong and well-validated baseline for an important problem, along with valuable resources for the research community. These merits justify its acceptance."
