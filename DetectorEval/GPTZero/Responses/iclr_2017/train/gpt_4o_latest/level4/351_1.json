While the approach is intriguing, the experimental evaluation is too limited to draw definitive conclusions about the relative strengths of the methods. The presentation would benefit from greater mathematical precision.\n---\nQuality:\nThe central idea of the paper is compelling, and the use of deep learning appears methodologically sound. However, the experimental evaluation is insufficient, as it is restricted to a single dataset and a small number of cross-validation folds. Given the substantial variability in the performance of all methods, it seems likely that the differences among the top-performing approaches are not statistically significant. A more extensive empirical validation would significantly enhance the strength of the paper.\n---\nClarity:\nThe paper is generally well-written, with clear explanations of both the biological and machine learning aspects. However, incorporating more mathematical rigor would improve comprehension of the methods. While the architectures are described intuitively, they would benefit from explicit mathematical definitions. For instance, the \"raw end2end\" model remains unclear\"\"given the limited number of parameters, it cannot operate directly on the raw 300k-dimensional input, but the nature of the embedding used is not specified.\nThe results in Fig. 3 could be made clearer by scaling each class so that its maximum is normalized to 1, thereby avoiding potential confusion caused by differing numbers of subjects across classes. Additionally, the text should adhere to standard formatting conventions, such as using the standard italics math font for symbols like \\( N \\), \\( N_d \\), etc.\n---\nOriginality:\nThe application and the proposed approach appear to be novel.\n---\nSignificance:\nThere is significant interest in applying deep learning to genomics, and this paper addresses some of the key challenges in the field. While it is too early to determine whether the proposed techniques will serve as a definitive solution, the paper introduces intriguing ideas that could inspire further research.\n---\nOther comments:\nReleasing the code as promised is essential."
