In hierarchical RL literature, it is well understood that reusing fixed (e.g., Fernandez & Veloso 2006) or jointly learned policies that apply to specific parts of the state space (e.g., options, Pricop et al.) can be advantageous. However, the challenge of constructing such libraries remains unresolved, and this paper does not provide significant insights into addressing this issue. \nThe transfer tasks chosen effectively showcase the potential of the proposed architecture, but the study does not address negative transfer or compositional reuse in challenging scenarios previously identified in the literature (e.g., Parisotto et al. 2015, Rusu et al. 2015, 2016). \nGiven that the primary contributions are empirical, it would be valuable to see how the results in Figures 6 and 7 compare when plotted against wall-clock time. Data efficiency is not a critical factor for achieving perfect play in Pong (see Mnih et al., 2015), so it would be more informative to evaluate tasks where performance is constrained by data availability. Additionally, it would be interesting to assess whether the presented results could be achieved with reduced computational resources or smaller representation sizes compared to learning from scratch, particularly when one of the source tasks is a policy already trained on the target task. \nFinally, it is somewhat disappointing that the model requires a quarter of the data needed to learn Pong from scratch just to determine that an optimal Pong policy is already present in the expert library. Simply evaluating each expert over 10 episodes and using an average-score-weighted majority vote to combine action choices would likely achieve similar performance with a fraction of the data."
