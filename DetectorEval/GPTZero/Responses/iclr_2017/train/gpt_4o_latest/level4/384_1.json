            "inputText": "The paper addresses the task of identifying the location of an answer to a question within a given text (where the answer is always a part of the input text). To tackle this, the authors propose a method that integrates two existing models: Match-LSTM, which aligns question and text representations, and Pointer Net, which predicts the position of the answer within the text.\nStrengths:\n- The proposed method is well-suited to the task and demonstrates strong performance (though, as the authors acknowledge, recent concurrent works achieve superior results).\n- The approach is evaluated on the SQuAD dataset, showing substantial improvements over previous methods.\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper does not clarify how applicable the method is to other scenarios where the answer is not explicitly contained within the input text.\n2. Experimental evaluation:\n 2.1. It is unclear why Bi-Ans-Ptr, which achieves the best performance in Table 2, is not included in the ensemble.\n 2.2. It would be interesting to explore whether this approach generalizes effectively to other datasets.\nOther (minor/discussion points):\n- The task and method share some conceptual similarities with locating queries in images and visual question answering. The authors may want to reference related works in these areas.\n- It would be worth considering whether this task can be framed as a form of \"guided extractive summarization,\" where the question serves as a guide for the summarization process.\n- Page 6, last paragraph: there is a missing period in the sentence: \"\"¦ searching This\"¦\".\nSummary:\nThe paper introduces an intriguing combination of two existing methods for the task of answer extraction, but the level of novelty is moderate. While the experimental results are promising, it remains uncertain how well the approach generalizes to other settings, as the task itself appears somewhat artificial."
