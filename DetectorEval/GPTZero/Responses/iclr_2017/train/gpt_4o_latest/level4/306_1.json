            "inputText": "This paper introduces an LSTM-based meta-learning framework designed to learn the optimization algorithm of another learning algorithm (in this case, a neural network). \nThe manuscript is generally well-written, and the presentation of the core material is clear. The central idea\"\"drawing an analogy between the Robbins-Monro update rule and the LSTM update rule, and leveraging this connection to address the two key requirements of few-shot learning (1. rapid acquisition of new knowledge, and 2. gradual extraction of generalizable, transferable knowledge)\"\"is both compelling and innovative.\nThe authors incorporate several techniques previously employed by Andrychowicz et al. (2016), such as parameter sharing and normalization, alongside novel design choices, including a specific implementation of batch normalization. These choices are well-justified and thoughtfully integrated into the proposed framework. \nThe experimental results are persuasive, further supporting the claims made in the paper. Overall, this is a strong submission. However, I have a few concerns and questions:\n1. Could using the loss, gradient, and parameters as inputs to the meta-learner be redundant? Have you conducted ablation studies to verify whether simpler input combinations might suffice? \n2. It would be interesting to explore whether other architectural components of the network (e.g., the number of neurons, types of units, etc.) could also be learned in a similar manner. Do you have any thoughts or insights on this possibility? \n3. The related work section, which primarily focuses on meta-learning, feels somewhat superficial. Meta-learning is a well-established field, and similar approaches to solving this problem have been explored in the past, even if they did not explicitly utilize LSTMs. For example:\n - Samy Bengio's PhD thesis (1989) is centered on this topic.\n - The use of genetic programming to discover new learning rules for neural networks (S. Bengio, Y. Bengio, and J. Cloutier, 1994).\n - I am confident that JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber has contributed relevant work in this area\"\"please ensure that it is identified and cited to strengthen the related work section.\nIn conclusion, I find this paper to be a valuable contribution. The ideas presented are likely to resonate with a broad audience at ICLR."
