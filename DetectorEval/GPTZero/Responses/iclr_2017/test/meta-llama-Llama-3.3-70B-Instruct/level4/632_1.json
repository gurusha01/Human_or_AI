Given the existence of competitive benchmarks such as FB15k and WebQuestions for knowledge base completion and KB-based question answering, the reliance on the small WorldCup2014 dataset is unconvincing. Furthermore, the use of template-generated questions, which are far removed from natural language questions, raises questions about the necessity of applying an LSTM in this context. Demonstrating the model's effectiveness on established benchmarks would significantly strengthen the paper.\n- The handling of conjunctive queries assumes that detected entities in questions can be aligned with one or more relations, allowing for conjunctions. This assumption may not always hold true, making it essential to validate this approach using real question answering datasets.\n- The model's naming as \"Gaussian attention\" may be misleading, as it seems more closely related to knowledge base embedding literature than the traditional attention mechanism.\n[Minor comments]\n- Figure 2 is somewhat confusing, with the first row of orange blocks representing KB relations and the second row denoting individual words of the natural language question. Clarifying this representation would be beneficial.\n- In addition to \"entity recognition,\" the importance of an \"entity linker\" component, which connects text mentions to knowledge base entities, should be acknowledged."
