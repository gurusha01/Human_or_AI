The authors conduct a series of experiments on three neural network architectures, analyzing the performance of five popular gradient-descent optimization methods and a new method based on Runge-Kutta integrators. The results provide insights into the types of local minima found by different optimization algorithms, the effects of batch normalization, and the implications for generalization error.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, and the approach is well-placed in the literature.
