The authors investigate the effectiveness of pre-training models on two large-scale datasets, BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, and fine-tuning them on smaller target datasets, including bAbI and SQuAD. The results show that while pre-training alone does not lead to significant improvements, fine-tuning the pre-trained models on a small number of target task examples leads to substantial gains in performance.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it addresses an important research question in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and provides a thorough and well-motivated investigation of the effectiveness of transfer learning in reading comprehension tasks. The paper is well-organized, and the experiments are carefully designed and executed.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of limited training data in NLP tasks and motivates the use of transfer learning as a potential solution. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the methodology and experimental design. The results are well-presented and provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of pre-training and fine-tuning in reading comprehension tasks. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including statistical significance tests and comparisons to state-of-the-art models.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed information about the hyperparameter tuning process and the specific models used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the results, such as plots of the performance curves for each task, to provide a clearer understanding of the trends and patterns in the data. Finally, the authors may want to consider discussing the potential limitations and future directions of their work, including the applicability of their approach to other NLP tasks and the potential for further improvements in performance.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details about the pre-processing steps used to prepare the data for the experiments, including any tokenization, normalization, or feature extraction techniques used?\n2. How did you select the specific hyperparameters used in the experiments, and did you perform any hyperparameter tuning or grid search to optimize the performance of the models?\n3. Can you provide more information about the computational resources and infrastructure used to run the experiments, including the specific hardware and software configurations used?\n4. Have you considered applying your approach to other NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis or machine translation, and if so, what results have you obtained?\n5. Are there any potential limitations or drawbacks to using transfer learning in reading comprehension tasks, and if so, how do you propose addressing these limitations in future work?"
