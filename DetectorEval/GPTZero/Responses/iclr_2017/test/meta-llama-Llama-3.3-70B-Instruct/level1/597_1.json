            "inputText": "The paper \"Neural Combinatorial Optimization\" presents a novel framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. The authors focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and propose a pointer network architecture that learns to predict a distribution over different city permutations. The network is trained using a policy gradient method with a reward signal based on the negative tour length.\nThe paper claims to achieve close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes, outperforming supervised learning approaches and competing with state-of-the-art solvers. The authors also demonstrate the flexibility of their method by applying it to the Knapsack problem, achieving optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items.\nBased on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate the paper as follows:\n1. Specific question/problem tackled: The paper tackles the TSP and Knapsack problems, which are well-known combinatorial optimization problems. The authors propose a novel framework that combines neural networks and reinforcement learning to solve these problems.\n2. Approach motivation and literature placement: The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work in the field. They discuss the limitations of existing methods, such as supervised learning and traditional optimization algorithms, and highlight the potential benefits of using neural networks and reinforcement learning.\n3. Claims support: The paper provides empirical evidence to support its claims, including experimental results on TSP and Knapsack instances. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of their method's performance and compare it to state-of-the-art solvers.\nDecision: Accept\nReasons: The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to combinatorial optimization problems. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper also highlights the potential benefits of using neural networks and reinforcement learning for solving complex optimization problems.\nSupporting arguments:\n* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the potential benefits of the proposed approach.\n* The authors provide a detailed explanation of their method, including the pointer network architecture and the policy gradient training algorithm.\n* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including its ability to achieve close to optimal results on TSP instances and optimal solutions on Knapsack instances.\nAdditional feedback:\n* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, including the time and memory requirements for training and inference.\n* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned policies, including the features and patterns that the network learns to recognize.\n* The paper could be improved by providing more comparisons to other state-of-the-art solvers, including those that use different optimization algorithms or problem-specific heuristics.\nQuestions for the authors:\n* Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method, including the time and memory requirements for training and inference?\n* How do you plan to extend the proposed method to more complex combinatorial optimization problems, such as those with multiple objectives or constraints?\n* Can you provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned policies, including the features and patterns that the network learns to recognize?"
