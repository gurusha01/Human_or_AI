The approach is well-motivated, as the authors provide a clear explanation of the benefits of using eligibility traces and how they can improve learning in environments with sparse rewards. The experimental results are also well-supported, with the authors providing a thorough analysis of the results and discussing the implications of the findings.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors consider providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, as well as a more in-depth analysis of the results. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different Atari games to further demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. I would also like to see more discussion on the potential limitations of the approach and how it can be applied to more complex environments.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How did the authors choose the value of ‰Ωç = 0.8 for the eligibility traces, and what is the sensitivity of the results to this parameter?\n* Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the Adam optimizer, and how it was tuned for the experiments?\n* How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of the frozen network's update frequency, and what are the implications of this for the approach?"
