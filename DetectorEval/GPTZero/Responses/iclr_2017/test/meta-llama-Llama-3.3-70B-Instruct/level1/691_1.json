            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper introduces a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment (RLE), which provides a unified interface for various gaming consoles, including Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Genesis. RLE is designed to be expandable, allowing for easy addition of new games and consoles, and is compatible with Python and Torch. The environment poses significant challenges to current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, including 3D interpretation, delayed rewards, and noisy backgrounds. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RLE by training and evaluating several algorithms on various SNES games, highlighting the need for more advanced algorithms to overcome the challenges presented by RLE.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that it introduces a novel and well-motivated learning environment that addresses a significant gap in the field of reinforcement learning. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the environment and its challenges, and demonstrates the potential of RLE for future research.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the RLE environment, its implementation, and its challenges. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a thorough comparison with existing environments, such as Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and OpenAI Gym. The experiments conducted on RLE provide valuable insights into the challenges posed by the environment and highlight the need for more advanced algorithms. The paper also provides a clear and concise conclusion, summarizing the main contributions and future directions.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of RLE, including the specific emulators used and the process of adding new games and consoles to the environment. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the results of the experiments, including a more detailed comparison of the performance of different algorithms on various SNES games. It would also be helpful to include more visualizations, such as screenshots or videos, to illustrate the challenges posed by RLE and the performance of the algorithms.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:\n* Can you provide more details on the process of adding new games and consoles to RLE, and how easy it is to integrate new emulators and games into the environment?\n* How do you plan to address the challenge of delayed rewards in RLE, and what potential solutions do you propose for this issue?\n* Can you provide more information on the potential applications of RLE, beyond reinforcement learning research, such as game development or robotics?"
