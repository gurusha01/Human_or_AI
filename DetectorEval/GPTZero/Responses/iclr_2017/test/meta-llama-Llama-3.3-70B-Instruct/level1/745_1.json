The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of current parallelization techniques. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and performance.\nSupporting arguments: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the convergence properties of SYMSGD, showing that it retains the same convergence rates as sequential SGD.

The paper also discusses the limitations of current parallelization techniques, such as HOGWILD! and ALLREDUCE, and shows how SYMSGD addresses these limitations.\nAdditional feedback: To further improve the paper, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of SYMSGD, including the specific optimizations used to reduce the overhead of computing the combiner matrix.
