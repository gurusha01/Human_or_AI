            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes the use of Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) for biclustering, a technique used to analyze large datasets by simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a matrix. The authors claim that RFNs overcome the shortcomings of existing biclustering methods, such as FABIA, by efficiently constructing sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data. The paper presents numerical results on multiple synthetic and real data sets, demonstrating the superior performance of RFNs compared to 13 other biclustering methods.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by rigorous experimental results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing biclustering methods and demonstrate how RFNs address these limitations.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a thorough review of the literature on biclustering and clearly explains the advantages of RFNs over existing methods. The experimental results are extensive and well-designed, covering a range of synthetic and real-world data sets. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including statistical tests to demonstrate the significance of the improvements achieved by RFNs.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the interpretation of the results, particularly in the context of the 1000 Genomes Project. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more details on the computational resources required to run the RFN algorithm, as this may be an important consideration for practitioners. Finally, the authors may want to consider providing more guidance on how to choose the hyperparameters of the RFN algorithm, as this may not be straightforward for non-experts.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on how the RFN algorithm is implemented on GPUs, and what specific optimizations were made to achieve efficient computation?\n2. How do you choose the number of hidden units (biclusters) in the RFN algorithm, and what is the effect of this hyperparameter on the results?\n3. Can you provide more insight into the biological interpretation of the results on the 1000 Genomes Project, and how the identified IBD segments relate to the hypothesis of interbreeding between ancestors of humans and other ancient hominins?"
