The authors may also consider comparing their algorithm to other existing methods for polynomial feature expansion on sparse matrices.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the mapping from columns of the input matrix to columns of the expanded matrix, and how it is constructed for higher-degree polynomial expansions?\n2. How does the algorithm handle cases where the input matrix is highly sparse, and the number of non-zero elements is very small?\n3. Can you provide more information on the empirical results, such as the specific hardware and software used to run the experiments, and the exact parameters used to generate the random matrices?"
