The authors propose a simple gated RNN architecture, CFN, and provide a theoretical analysis of its dynamics, showing that it is non-chaotic and has a simple attractor.

Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on other tasks, such as character-level language modeling or machine translation, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the CFN.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more intuition on why the CFN is able to achieve comparable performance to LSTMs and GRUs despite its simple dynamics?\n2. How do you plan to extend the CFN to capture longer-term dependencies, and what are the potential limitations of the current architecture?\n3.
