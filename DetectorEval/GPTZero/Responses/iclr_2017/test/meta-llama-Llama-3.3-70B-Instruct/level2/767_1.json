            "inputText": "The paper proposes an actor-critic algorithm to automatically learn the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms. The algorithm uses a policy network (actor) to determine the learning rate at each step and a value network (critic) to provide feedback on the quality of the learning rate. The authors claim that their method can achieve better convergence and prevent overfitting compared to human-designed learning rate schedules.\nI decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: \n1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in machine learning, which is the sensitivity of SGD to learning rates.\n2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing on recent successes in reinforcement learning.\n3. The paper provides empirical evidence to support its claims, including experiments on two image classification datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nThe supporting arguments for the decision include:\n* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of learning rate control and the proposed solution.\n* The algorithm is well-described, and the use of actor-critic framework is well-justified.\n* The experiments are well-designed, and the results are convincing, showing that the proposed algorithm can achieve better test accuracy and prevent overfitting compared to baseline methods.\nAdditional feedback to improve the paper includes:\n* Providing more details on the implementation of the algorithm, such as the specific architecture of the policy and value networks.\n* Discussing the computational cost of the proposed algorithm and its potential scalability to larger datasets.\n* Considering additional experiments to evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to different hyperparameters and datasets.\nQuestions to the authors include:\n* How did you choose the specific architecture of the policy and value networks, and are there any guidelines for selecting these architectures in general?\n* Can you provide more insights into the behavior of the learning rate controller during training, such as how it adapts to different datasets and models?\n* Have you considered applying the proposed algorithm to other optimization algorithms beyond SGD, and what are the potential challenges and opportunities in doing so?"
