            "inputText": "This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method for training agents to navigate within large and visually rich environments. The authors introduce auxiliary learning targets, specifically depth prediction and loop closure, to provide richer training signals and enhance data efficiency. The approach is validated in challenging maze domains with random start and goal locations, and the results show that the proposed agent architecture achieves human-level performance on some tasks.\nI decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: \n1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of deep reinforcement learning, and the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature.\n2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including detailed analysis of the agent's behavior, its ability to localize, and its network activity dynamics.\nThe supporting arguments for these reasons are as follows: \n* The paper clearly outlines the main claims and contributions, and the approach is well-motivated by the need to improve data efficiency and task performance in reinforcement learning.\n* The evaluation of the proposed method is thorough and well-designed, including a comparison with baseline methods and an analysis of the agent's behavior and network activity dynamics.\n* The paper provides a detailed description of the agent architecture and training procedure, which is helpful for understanding the approach and reproducing the results.\nAdditional feedback to improve the paper includes:\n* Providing more discussion on the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work, such as combining the proposed method with other techniques or applying it to more complex environments.\n* Including more visualizations or illustrations to help understand the agent's behavior and network activity dynamics, such as plots of the agent's trajectory or heatmaps of the network activity.\n* Considering the use of other auxiliary tasks or losses, such as reward prediction or feature reconstruction, to further improve the performance and robustness of the agent.\nQuestions to be answered by the authors include:\n* How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the approach, such as the limited capacity of the stacked LSTM and the potential for overfitting to the auxiliary tasks?\n* Can the authors provide more insight into the learned representations and features of the agent, such as visualizations of the convolutional filters or plots of the network activity dynamics?\n* How do the authors think the proposed method can be applied to more complex environments or tasks, such as procedurally generated mazes or tasks that require more advanced reasoning and planning?"
