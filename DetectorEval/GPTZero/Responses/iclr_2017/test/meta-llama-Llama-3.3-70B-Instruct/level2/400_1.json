            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture, called doubly recurrent neural networks (DRNNs), models the information flow in a tree with two separate recurrent modules: one carrying ancestral information and the other carrying fraternal information. The topology of the tree is modeled explicitly and separately from the label prediction.\nThe paper claims to contribute to the field of neural networks by proposing a new architecture that can generate tree-structured objects from scratch, without relying on special tokens or external classifiers. The authors also claim that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tasks such as mapping sentences to simple functional programs.\nBased on the provided information, I decide to accept this paper. The main reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated architecture that addresses a significant problem in the field of neural networks.\n2. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical formulation and the training procedure.\n3. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture is effective in generating tree-structured objects and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in certain tasks.\nHowever, I would like to see more analysis on the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future work. Some questions that I would like the authors to address are:\n* How does the proposed architecture handle trees with varying depths and widths?\n* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representations and how they relate to the tree structure?\n* How does the proposed approach compare to other methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?\nAdditionally, I would like to suggest some minor improvements to the paper, such as:\n* Providing more details on the dataset used for the experiments, including the size and characteristics of the trees.\n* Including more visualizations of the generated trees to help illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* Considering additional evaluation metrics, such as tree edit distance or node similarity, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed architecture.\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural networks and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. With some minor revisions to address the above-mentioned questions and suggestions, I am confident that this paper will be a valuable addition to the conference proceedings."
