The main claim of the paper is that INQ can achieve lossless low-precision quantization for any pre-trained full-precision CNN model with no assumption on its architecture. The authors support this claim by conducting extensive experiments on the ImageNet large-scale classification task using various deep CNN architectures, including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, and ResNets.\nThe approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing network quantization methods. The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related works. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showing that the quantized CNN models with 5-bit, 4-bit, 3-bit, and even 2-bit ternary weights have improved or comparable accuracy against their full-precision baselines.\nBased on the provided information, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:\n1. The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to network quantization, which addresses the limitations of existing methods.\n2. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showing improved or comparable accuracy against full-precision baselines.\nTo further improve the paper, I provide the following feedback:\n* The authors could provide more details on the computational and power efficiency of the proposed method, as well as its implementation on hardware platforms.\n* The authors could also explore the application of the proposed method to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.\n* Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the distribution of the quantized weights, as shown in Appendix 1, to gain more insights into the behavior of the proposed method.\nI would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:\n* Can the authors provide more details on the weight partition strategy used in the experiments, and how it affects the performance of the proposed method?\n* How does the proposed method handle the case where the pre-trained full-precision CNN model has a large number of parameters, and how does it affect the computational and power efficiency of the method?\n* Can the authors provide more information on the future works mentioned in the paper, such as extending the incremental idea behind INQ to low-precision activations and low-precision gradients?"
