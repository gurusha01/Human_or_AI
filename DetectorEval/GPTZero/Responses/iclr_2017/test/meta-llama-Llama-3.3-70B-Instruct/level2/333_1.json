The main reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to natural texture synthesis, which challenges the conventional wisdom that deep hierarchical representations are necessary for high-quality texture generation, and (2) the authors provide extensive experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology.
