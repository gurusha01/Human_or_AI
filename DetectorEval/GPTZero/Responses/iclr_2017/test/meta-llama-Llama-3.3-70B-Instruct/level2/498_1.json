            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of dropout neural networks by reducing the inference gap between the training and inference phases. The authors formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of a latent variable model and introduce the concept of expectation-linear dropout neural networks. They also propose a regularization scheme to control the inference gap and provide theoretical analysis and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nThe main claims of the paper are:\n1. Dropout can be formulated as a latent variable model, which provides a clean view of parameter sharing and enables further theoretical analysis.\n2. The authors introduce the concept of expectation-linear dropout neural networks, which can be used to quantify and control the inference gap.\n3. The proposed regularization scheme can reduce the inference gap and improve the performance of dropout neural networks.\nThe support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide proofs for several theorems that establish the relationship between the inference gap and the performance of dropout neural networks. They also conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nThe usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident from the experimental results, which show that the proposed approach can improve the performance of dropout neural networks on several benchmark datasets. The approach is also simple and efficient, making it a practical solution for improving the performance of dropout neural networks.\nThe paper reflects common knowledge in the field of deep learning and dropout neural networks. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, and their approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature.\nThe novelty of the paper lies in the formulation of dropout as a latent variable model and the introduction of the concept of expectation-linear dropout neural networks. The authors also provide a new regularization scheme to control the inference gap, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nThe completeness of the paper is good, with clear and concise explanations of the approach and the experimental results. The authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility, including the architectures and hyper-parameters used in the experiments.\nThe limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the approach may not be suitable for all types of neural networks and datasets. They also mention that the inference gap is not the only factor that affects the performance of dropout neural networks, and that other factors such as the choice of hyper-parameters and the quality of the training data also play a significant role.\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and dropout neural networks. The approach is simple, efficient, and effective, making it a practical solution for improving the performance of dropout neural networks.\nDecision: Accept\nReasons for the decision:\n1. The paper provides a novel and significant contribution to the field of deep learning and dropout neural networks.\n2. The approach is simple, efficient, and effective, making it a practical solution for improving the performance of dropout neural networks.\n3. The paper reflects common knowledge in the field and is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature.\n4. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on several benchmark datasets.\nAdditional feedback:\n1. The authors may want to consider providing more details on the implementation of the approach, including the specific architectures and hyper-parameters used in the experiments.\n2. The authors may want to consider providing more analysis on the relationship between the inference gap and the performance of dropout neural networks, including the effects of different hyper-parameters and datasets.\n3. The authors may want to consider exploring the application of the approach to other types of neural networks and datasets, including recurrent neural networks and natural language processing tasks.\nQuestions for the authors:\n1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the approach, including the specific architectures and hyper-parameters used in the experiments?\n2. How does the inference gap affect the performance of dropout neural networks, and what are the effects of different hyper-parameters and datasets on the inference gap?\n3. Can you explore the application of the approach to other types of neural networks and datasets, including recurrent neural networks and natural language processing tasks?"
