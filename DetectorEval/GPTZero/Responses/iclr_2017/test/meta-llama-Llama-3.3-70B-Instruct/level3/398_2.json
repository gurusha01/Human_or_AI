The paper provides a detailed analysis of the CFN's dynamics and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on the Penn Treebank corpus and the Text8 corpus.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and interesting question of understanding and constructing recurrent models that are easier to interpret, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by theoretical and empirical results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of chaotic dynamics in RNNs and motivates the need for a simpler and more interpretable model. The authors propose a simple and elegant solution, the CFN, which is backed by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The experiments demonstrate that the CFN achieves comparable performance to LSTMs and GRUs on word-level language modeling tasks, which is a significant result. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the CFN's dynamics, which sheds light on its behavior and provides insights for future improvements.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more context on the implications of their results for other NLP tasks and applications. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed comparison of the CFN's performance with other RNN architectures, such as vanilla RNNs and GRUs, on a wider range of tasks. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insights on the potential limitations of the CFN and how they can be addressed in future work.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the CFN to more complex tasks that require longer-term dependencies, such as machine translation or question answering? (2) Can the authors provide more insights on the relationship between the CFN's simplicity and its performance on word-level language modeling tasks?
