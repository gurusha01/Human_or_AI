            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to biclustering using Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), which overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly FABIA. RFNs efficiently construct sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data, allowing for the identification of rare and small events. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data.\nDecision\nI decide to Reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with prior work on biclustering, particularly Tamara Berg's group, which is necessary to demonstrate the novelty and contribution of the proposed approach. Secondly, the paper lacks details about the attribute dataset and collection process, including image source, annotation method, and annotator instructions, making it difficult to understand and replicate the results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper presents a well-motivated approach to biclustering, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various datasets. However, the lack of comparison with prior work and the absence of details about the dataset and collection process raise concerns about the validity and reproducibility of the results. Additionally, the paper is missing baselines, such as comparisons to simpler methods like BM or CM, which are necessary to evaluate the results presented in the paper.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more thorough comparison with prior work on biclustering, including Tamara Berg's group. Additionally, the authors should provide more details about the attribute dataset and collection process, including image source, annotation method, and annotator instructions. This will help to increase the transparency and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the authors should consider adding baselines, such as comparisons to simpler methods like BM or CM, to evaluate the effectiveness of RFNs.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. How does the proposed RFN approach compare to other biclustering methods, particularly those proposed by Tamara Berg's group?\n2. Can the authors provide more details about the attribute dataset and collection process, including image source, annotation method, and annotator instructions?\n3. How do the authors plan to address the lack of baselines, such as comparisons to simpler methods like BM or CM, in the experimental evaluation?"
