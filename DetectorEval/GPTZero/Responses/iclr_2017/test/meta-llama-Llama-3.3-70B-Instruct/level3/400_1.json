The architecture, called doubly recurrent neural networks (DRNNs), models the information flow in a tree with two separate recurrent modules: one carrying ancestral information and the other carrying fraternal information. The topology of the tree is modeled explicitly and separately from the label prediction.\nThe paper claims to contribute to the field of natural language processing and machine learning by introducing a new architecture that can generate tree-structured objects, such as parse trees or abstract syntax trees, from encoded representations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several tasks, including synthetic tree recovery, mapping sentences to functional programs, and machine translation.\nI decide to accept this paper because it proposes a novel and well-motivated architecture that addresses a significant problem in natural language processing. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.\nThe key reasons for my decision are:\n1. The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated architecture that addresses a significant problem in natural language processing.\n2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.\n3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed information about the training process, including the hyperparameters used and the convergence criteria. Additionally, the authors could provide more examples of generated trees to illustrate the effectiveness of their approach.\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex tasks, such as generating trees with multiple roots or trees with cycles?\n* How do the authors plan to handle out-of-vocabulary words or unseen tree structures during testing?\n* Can the authors provide more information about the computational resources required to train and test their model?\nOverall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and machine learning, and I recommend it for acceptance."
