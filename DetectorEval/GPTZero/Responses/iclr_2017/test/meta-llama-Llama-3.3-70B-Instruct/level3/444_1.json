            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes a novel method for interpreting Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models by decomposing their predictions into importance scores for words. This approach allows for the extraction of representative phrases that contribute to the LSTM's output, providing insight into the underlying learned patterns. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on sentiment analysis and question answering tasks, achieving competitive accuracies with a normal LSTM on the WikiMovies dataset.\nDecision\nI decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the novelty and potential impact of the proposed approach. The paper tackles a significant problem in the field of natural language processing, namely the interpretability of LSTM models. The authors provide a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical and empirical results. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the decomposition of the LSTM's output into importance scores for words. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on multiple datasets, including sentiment analysis and question answering tasks. The results show that their approach can extract meaningful phrases that contribute to the LSTM's output, providing insight into the underlying learned patterns.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the pattern extraction process, including the specific QA tasks and the softmax prediction. Additionally, the authors could explore the performance of the pattern matching with different cutoff constant values and extend the approach to other tasks, such as sentence-level sentiment classification. It would also be helpful to include more examples of the extracted phrases and their corresponding importance scores to provide a clearer understanding of the approach.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the pattern extraction process, including the specific QA tasks and the softmax prediction?\n2. How do you plan to extend the approach to other tasks, such as sentence-level sentiment classification?\n3. Can you provide more examples of the extracted phrases and their corresponding importance scores to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach?"
