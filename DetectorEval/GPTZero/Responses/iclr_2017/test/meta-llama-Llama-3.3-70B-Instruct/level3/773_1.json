            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes the use of Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) for biclustering, which is a technique for analyzing large datasets by simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a matrix. The authors claim that RFNs overcome the shortcomings of existing biclustering methods, such as FABIA, by efficiently constructing sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data. The paper presents experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data, which demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs in identifying biclusters.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with the main reasons being the poor clarity of the paper and the lack of originality of the work. The writing style is more suitable for an industry white paper than a scientific publication, and the paper requires a complete rewrite to improve its clarity and readability. Additionally, the method proposed in the paper is mostly based on a previous paper by the same authors, and the comparison to similar work is limited.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's presentation problems are significant, with unclear experimental procedures and an over-reliance on a previous NIPS 2015 paper by the same authors. The method's quality is also questionable due to the lack of comparison to similar work and the unclear tuning parameters. The significance of the work is unclear, with strong empirical performance in the authors' own benchmark problems, but lacking code availability and incomplete implementation details.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, the authors should focus on clarifying the presentation, providing more details on the experimental procedures, and comparing their method to similar work in the field. The authors should also make the code available and provide more complete implementation details. Additionally, the authors should consider addressing the shortcomings of FABIA in a more rigorous and systematic way, rather than relying on a previous paper.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more details on the experimental procedures, including the specific datasets used and the parameter settings for each method?\n2. How do you compare your method to similar work in the field, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of your approach?\n3. Can you provide more complete implementation details, including the code and any necessary dependencies?\n4. How do you address the shortcomings of FABIA in a more rigorous and systematic way, and what are the implications of your approach for the field of biclustering?"
