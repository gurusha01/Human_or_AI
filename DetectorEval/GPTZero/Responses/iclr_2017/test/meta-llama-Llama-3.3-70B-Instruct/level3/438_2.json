The authors prove that the CFN has simple, predictable, and non-chaotic dynamics, in contrast to more standard gated architectures, whose underlying dynamical systems exhibit chaotic behavior.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem, namely, the design of a simple RNN that achieves comparable performance to more complex architectures, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by theoretical and empirical results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the proposed CFN architecture is simple and easy to understand. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of the CFN, including a proof that the network has a single attractor, the zero state, and that the hidden states activate and relax toward zero in a predictable fashion. The experimental results demonstrate that the CFN achieves comparable performance to LSTMs and GRUs on the word-level language modeling task, both with and without dropout.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more context on the implications of the CFN's simple dynamics on its ability to capture long-term dependencies. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed comparison of the CFN's performance with other simple RNN architectures, such as the vanilla RNN. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insight into the potential applications of the CFN, beyond word-level language modeling.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more intuition on why the CFN's simple dynamics do not hinder its ability to capture long-term dependencies?\n2. How do you envision the CFN being used in practice, and what potential applications do you see for this architecture?\n3. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup, including the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources used?"
