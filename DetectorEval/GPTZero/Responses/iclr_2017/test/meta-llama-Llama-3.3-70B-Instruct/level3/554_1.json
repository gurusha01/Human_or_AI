            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThe paper proposes an innovative approach to automatically learn learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms using an actor-critic framework from reinforcement learning (RL). The actor network learns to predict the learning rate at each time step, while the critic network provides feedback on the long-term performance of the chosen learning rate. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two image classification datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, and show that it achieves comparable convergence speed to expert-designed optimizers while obtaining better test accuracy.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept the paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in machine learning, namely the automatic adjustment of learning rates for SGD-based algorithms.\n2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, leveraging the strengths of RL techniques to address the challenges of learning rate control.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the actor-critic framework and the training procedure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on two benchmark datasets, and the comparison with other adaptive learning rate methods shows that the proposed method performs better in terms of test accuracy. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of the approach, which demonstrates a good understanding of the research context.\nAdditional Feedback and Suggestions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the following:\n1. Provide more detailed analysis of the learned learning rate schedules and their relationship to the underlying optimization problem.\n2. Consider adding more experiments on different datasets and tasks to demonstrate the generality of the approach.\n3. Provide more discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its potential scalability to large-scale machine learning problems.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more insights into the design of the state function 蠂(路) and its impact on the performance of the actor-critic algorithm?\n2. How do you plan to extend the approach to learn individual learning rates for each parameter, as mentioned in the future work section?\n3. Can you provide more details on the improved version of the algorithm proposed in the appendix, including its potential advantages and limitations?"
