The authors achieve strong results using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, outperforming baselines such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest. The paper addresses a significant problem with potential impact on electronic health records and medication mistakes, and is well-written with clear introduction, motivation, and discussion of related work.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the strong empirical results and the thorough discussion of the approach. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a real-world problem, and provide a detailed analysis of the results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper's strengths include:\n* Strong empirical results: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using RNN models, achieving better results than strong baselines.\n* Thorough discussion: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting promising aspects such as kidney code embedding.\n* Important problem: The paper addresses a significant problem with potential impact on electronic health records and medication mistakes.\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:\n* Unintuitive data preprocessing and experimental design choices, such as using truncated patient sequences.\n* Lack of novelty in methods: The paper proposes no novel methods, which is a weakness for a methods conference like ICLR.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, I suggest the authors:\n* Clarify the data preprocessing and experimental design choices, and provide more justification for these decisions.\n* Discuss the potential impact of the lack of ground truth labels for missing medications on the results.\n* Provide more context on the significance of the gaps between models, and explain the necessary level of performance for the model to be useful in a real clinical setting.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:\n* Can you provide more details on the data preprocessing and experimental design choices, and justify these decisions?\n* How do you plan to address the lack of ground truth labels for missing medications, and what impact do you think this has on the results?\n* Can you provide more context on the significance of the gaps between models, and explain the necessary level of performance for the model to be useful in a real clinical setting?"
