The GCN model uses an efficient layer-wise propagation rule based on a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several network datasets, outperforming recent related methods by a significant margin while being computationally efficient.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data. The experiments are thorough, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Specific question/problem tackled: The paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data, which is a well-defined and important problem in the field.\n2. Approach well-motivated: The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, including a discussion of the limitations of existing methods and the benefits of their proposed method.\n3. Results support claims: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming recent related methods on several datasets.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:\n* Provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and how it compares to existing methods.\n* Discuss potential limitations of the proposed method and avenues for future work.\n* Consider adding more visualizations or examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on how the proposed method handles graphs with directed edges or edge features?\n2. How does the proposed method perform on graphs with varying node degree distributions or community structures?\n3. Are there any plans to extend the proposed method to other graph-based tasks, such as graph classification or link prediction?"
