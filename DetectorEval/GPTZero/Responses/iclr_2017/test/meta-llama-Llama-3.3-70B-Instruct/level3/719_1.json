The authors provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of the CFN, including a proof that the CFN has simple, predictable, and non-chaotic dynamics. The experimental results demonstrate that the CFN achieves performance comparable to LSTMs and GRUs on the word-level language modeling task, both with and without dropout.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more context on the implications of their results for the broader field of RNNs and natural language processing. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the dynamics of the CFN and other RNN architectures to facilitate understanding. The authors may also consider providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources required for the experiments.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:\n1. Can you provide more insight into the design choices behind the CFN architecture, particularly the use of the power function and uniform distribution?\n2. How do you envision the CFN being used in practice, and what are the potential applications of this architecture?\n3. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup, including the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources required for the experiments?"
