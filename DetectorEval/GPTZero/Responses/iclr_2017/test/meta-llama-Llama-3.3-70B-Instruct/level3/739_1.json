            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper\nThe authors propose a novel approach for semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model. The model uses an efficient layer-wise propagation rule based on a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several network datasets, outperforming recent related methods by a significant margin while being computationally efficient.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the paper lacks depth in experiments and applications. While the proposed algorithm is interesting and simple, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims, particularly in terms of its scalability and performance on large-scale graphs.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Lack of depth in experiments: The paper presents results on only a few datasets, and the experimental setup is not comprehensive. The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the model's performance on different types of graphs, such as directed or weighted graphs.\n2. Unclear fit with the main scope of ICLR: The paper's contribution is not clearly aligned with the main scope of the ICLR conference, which focuses on theoretical and empirical advances in deep learning. The paper's methodology and results may be more suitable for a conference focused on graph-based learning or network science.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, the authors should consider the following:\n1. Provide more comprehensive experiments: The authors should conduct more extensive experiments on a variety of graph datasets, including directed and weighted graphs, to demonstrate the model's scalability and performance.\n2. Clarify the paper's contribution: The authors should clearly articulate the paper's contribution to the field of deep learning and its relevance to the ICLR conference.\n3. Address potential limitations: The authors should discuss potential limitations of their approach, such as its sensitivity to hyperparameters or its performance on graphs with varying node degrees.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and its scalability to large-scale graphs?\n2. How does the model perform on graphs with directed or weighted edges?\n3. Can you clarify the relationship between the proposed GCN model and other graph-based learning approaches, such as graph attention networks or graph autoencoders?"
