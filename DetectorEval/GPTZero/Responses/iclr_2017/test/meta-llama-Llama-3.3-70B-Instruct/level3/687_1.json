The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two classification benchmarks, STL-10 and PASCAL VOC 2007, and show that it outperforms existing semi-supervised methods. The CC-GAN model consists of a generator that fills in missing patches in an image and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and fake in-paintings.\nDecision\nI decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the introduction of pruning is not relevant to the paper, and the experiments are not thoroughly conducted. The paper seems to be focused on semi-supervised learning using CC-GANs, but the key points provided mention simplistic pruning algorithms, which are not discussed in the paper.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper lacks a clear connection to the key points provided, which mention pruning algorithms. The experiments conducted in the paper are also limited to two datasets, and the results, although promising, do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the approach. Furthermore, the paper does not provide significant algorithmic, architectural, or mathematical insights, which is expected in a research paper.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer connection to the key points provided and conduct more thorough experiments on multiple datasets. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more insights into the theoretical aspects of their approach and its limitations. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results and a comparison with other semi-supervised learning methods.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on how the CC-GAN approach relates to pruning algorithms, as mentioned in the key points?\n2. How do you plan to extend the approach to larger images and more complex datasets?\n3. Can you provide more insights into the theoretical aspects of the CC-GAN approach and its limitations?"
