            "inputText": "This research paper proposes a novel approach to active learning using pool selection of deep learning mini-batches with an approximation of the Bayesian posterior. The paper presents a theoretical framework, including the Maximum Likelihood Estimation Bayesian inference approach, which is interesting but difficult to follow due to its complexity. The authors also provide an empirical measure as a regularization scheme to explicitly control the inference gap in dropout neural networks.\nThe paper's writing quality is poor, making it sometimes painful to read due to the use of poor English. The presentation of alternative active learning strategies is overly detailed, while the proposed approach's complex approximations and datasets could be improved with more detailed and structured presentation.\nTo evaluate this paper, I will answer the three key questions: \n1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? \nThe paper tackles the problem of controlling the inference gap in dropout neural networks, which is a common issue in deep learning.\n2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? \nThe approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and its significance in the literature. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed review of existing approaches to active learning and dropout neural networks.\n3. Does the paper support the claims? \nThe paper provides empirical evidence to support the claims, including experiments on three benchmark datasets. However, the results could be improved with more detailed analysis and comparison to existing approaches.\nBased on these questions, I decide to reject this paper due to its poor writing quality and overly complex presentation. However, the paper's approach is interesting and well-motivated, and with significant revisions to improve clarity and presentation, it could be a strong contribution to the field.\nTo improve the paper, I suggest the following:\n* Improve the writing quality and clarity of the paper, including using simpler language and providing more detailed explanations of complex concepts.\n* Provide a more detailed review of existing approaches to active learning and dropout neural networks, including a comparison to the proposed approach.\n* Improve the presentation of the proposed approach, including providing more detailed examples and illustrations of the complex approximations and datasets.\n* Provide more detailed analysis and comparison of the empirical results to existing approaches, including a discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.\nI would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:\n* Can you provide more detailed explanations of the complex approximations and datasets used in the proposed approach?\n* How does the proposed approach compare to existing approaches to active learning and dropout neural networks?\n* Can you provide more detailed analysis and comparison of the empirical results to existing approaches?"
