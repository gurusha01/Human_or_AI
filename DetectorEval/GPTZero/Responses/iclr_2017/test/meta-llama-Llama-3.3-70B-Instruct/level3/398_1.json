            "inputText": "Summary\nThe paper proposes a Chaos-Free Network (CFN), a simple gated recurrent neural network that achieves performance comparable to well-known gated architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, on the word-level language modeling task. The authors prove that the CFN has simple, predictable, and non-chaotic dynamics, in contrast to more standard gated architectures, which exhibit chaotic behavior. The experiments validate the claim that chaos is not necessary for RNNs to perform well on certain tasks, providing a new perspective on RNN design principles.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that it tackles a specific and well-motivated question, and provides a clear and well-supported answer. The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the approach is well-motivated, including a thorough analysis of the dynamical systems perspective.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of chaos in RNNs, and motivates the need for a simple and interpretable model. The authors propose a simple and elegant solution, the CFN, which is shown to perform well on the word-level language modeling task. The experiments are well-designed and provide strong evidence for the claims made in the paper. The mathematical analysis of the CFN's dynamics is thorough and provides valuable insights into the behavior of the model.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider exploring more datasets and tasks to determine if chaos is necessary in other cases. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed comparison of the CFN with other RNN architectures, such as vanilla RNNs and GRUs. The authors may also want to consider providing more visualizations of the attractors and trajectories of the CFN and other RNNs to help illustrate the differences in their dynamics.\nQuestions for the Authors\nI would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:\n* How do the authors plan to extend the CFN to more complex tasks and datasets, and what challenges do they anticipate?\n* Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the simplicity of the CFN's dynamics and its performance on the word-level language modeling task?\n* How do the authors think the CFN's simplicity and interpretability can be leveraged in practice, and what potential applications do they see for this type of model?"
