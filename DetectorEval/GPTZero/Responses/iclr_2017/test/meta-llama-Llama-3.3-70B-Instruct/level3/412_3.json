RFNs are shown to overcome the limitations of existing biclustering methods, such as FABIA, by allowing for thousands of code units, achieving decorrelation, and providing exact zero values for membership vectors. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data.\nDecision\nI decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being the significant improvement in biclustering performance demonstrated by RFNs over existing methods, including FABIA. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of RFNs on various datasets and shows promising results.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear motivation for using RFNs for biclustering, highlighting the limitations of existing methods. The authors also provide a detailed explanation of the RFN model and its advantages, such as fast computations on GPUs and the ability to handle thousands of code units. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs in identifying biclusters and outperforming other methods.\nAdditional Feedback\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the interpretation of the biclusters identified by RFNs, particularly in the context of the 1000 Genomes Project data. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of RFNs with other deep learning-based biclustering methods. The authors may also consider providing more details on the computational resources required for RFN training and the potential applications of RFNs in other domains.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for RFNs, particularly the choice of the number of hidden units and the dropout rate?\n2. How do you plan to address the potential issue of overfitting in RFNs, particularly when dealing with large datasets?\n3. Can you elaborate on the biological significance of the IBD segments identified by RFNs in the 1000 Genomes Project data and their implications for our understanding of human evolution?"
