            "inputText": "Summary of the Paper's Contributions\nThis paper presents a novel approach to visualizing the importance of specific inputs in determining the output of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The authors propose a method for decomposing the output of an LSTM into a product of factors, where each term can be interpreted as the contribution of a particular word. They then use these importance scores to extract phrases from a trained LSTM, which are validated through their performance in a simple, rules-based classifier. The approach is demonstrated on both sentiment analysis and question answering tasks, with impressive results.\nDecision and Key Reasons\nBased on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:\n1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question: understanding the importance of inputs in LSTMs, which is a crucial aspect of natural language processing.\n2. The approach is well-supported by empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting meaningful phrases and achieving reasonable performance on various tasks.\nSupporting Arguments\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a thorough explanation of the mathematical formulations and empirical evaluations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over prior work, both in terms of predictive ability and visualization quality. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the extracted phrases, showcasing their qualitative validity.\nAdditional Feedback and Suggestions\nTo further improve the paper, I suggest:\n* Providing more insights into the limitations of the proposed approach, such as its sensitivity to hyperparameters and potential biases in the extracted phrases.\n* Exploring the application of the proposed method to other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation or text summarization.\n* Considering the use of more advanced visualization techniques to facilitate the interpretation of the extracted phrases and their importance scores.\nQuestions for the Authors\nTo clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:\n* Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed approach, particularly in terms of the time and memory requirements for extracting phrases from large LSTMs?\n* How do you plan to address the potential issue of overfitting in the proposed approach, particularly when dealing with smaller datasets or more complex tasks?\n* Can you provide more insights into the relationship between the extracted phrases and the underlying linguistic structures, such as syntax and semantics?"
