            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper addresses the problem of training chatbots using reinforcement learning (RL) in scenarios where rewards are noisy, expensive, and available only in batch settings. The authors propose a novel off-policy batch policy gradient (BPG) method, which is specifically designed to handle these challenges. The key contributions include: (1) a formalization of the chatbot training problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the batch RL setting, (2) the derivation of a policy gradient algorithm that incorporates importance sampling to account for off-policy updates, and (3) empirical validation of the proposed method on both synthetic data and a real-world restaurant recommendation dataset. The paper demonstrates that BPG outperforms existing on-policy and online RL approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and noisy rewards. The work is well-motivated and has practical implications for chatbot development in customer service and other NLP applications.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning for natural language processing by addressing a practical and challenging problem. The proposed method is novel, well-grounded in the literature, and rigorously evaluated. The results demonstrate clear improvements over baseline methods, and the paper provides valuable insights into the trade-offs of different RL approaches in batch settings. The decision to accept is based on the paper's strong methodological contributions and its relevance to real-world applications.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Problem and Approach: The paper identifies a critical gap in RL for chatbots, where noisy and expensive rewards make traditional on-policy and online methods unsuitable. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly position their method as a solution to these challenges.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The derivation of the BPG algorithm is mathematically sound and builds on established RL principles. The use of importance sampling to handle off-policy updates is a thoughtful and necessary addition.\n3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the efficacy of BPG in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. The improvements in chatbot performance, as measured by human evaluations, are compelling and statistically significant in most cases.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, it is dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with reinforcement learning. Simplifying the mathematical exposition and providing more intuitive explanations of key concepts (e.g., importance sampling, ‰Ωç-returns) would improve accessibility.\n2. Comparison with More Baselines: The paper compares BPG with a limited set of baselines. Including additional state-of-the-art methods, such as recent advances in RL for NLP or imitation learning approaches, would strengthen the empirical evaluation.\n3. Error Analysis: The qualitative examples provided are helpful, but a more systematic error analysis would provide deeper insights into the strengths and limitations of the method. For instance, why does BPG occasionally produce grammatically incorrect responses, and how might this be mitigated?\n4. Scalability: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of BPG in detail. Providing an analysis of runtime and memory requirements, especially in comparison to on-policy methods, would be valuable for practitioners.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the BPG algorithm to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the ‰Ωç-return coefficient and the step size? Did you observe any patterns in tuning these parameters across datasets?\n2. The paper mentions that importance sampling can increase the variance of updates. Did you explore alternative variance reduction techniques, and if so, how did they compare to the clipping approach used in this work?\n3. How does the method perform in scenarios with even noisier rewards or fewer labeled examples? Could the approach be extended to semi-supervised or unsupervised settings?\n4. Could you elaborate on how the proposed method might generalize to other NLP tasks, such as machine translation or question answering? Are there any domain-specific challenges that would need to be addressed?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is a valuable addition to the conference. With minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the experimental evaluation, it has the potential to make a significant impact on both research and practice."
