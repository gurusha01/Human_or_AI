            "inputText": "Review\nSummary\nThis paper introduces a novel framework, Neural Combinatorial Optimization, which leverages neural networks and reinforcement learning (RL) to address combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem. The framework employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a pointer network architecture to predict distributions over city permutations and optimizes the network using policy gradient methods. The authors propose two approaches: RL pretraining and active search, and demonstrate that their method achieves near-optimal results on 2D Euclidean TSP instances with up to 100 nodes. The flexibility of the framework is also showcased by applying it to the Knapsack problem, achieving optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items. While not state-of-the-art in all dimensions, the work provides valuable insights into using neural networks as general tools for combinatorial optimization.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel approach to a challenging problem, its well-motivated methodology, and its potential to inspire further research in using neural networks for combinatorial optimization. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The integration of RL and neural networks for combinatorial optimization is innovative and provides an alternative to traditional heuristic-based methods.\n2. Empirical Support: The results, while not fully state-of-the-art, are competitive and demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for generalization across different optimization problems.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Relevance: The paper addresses a fundamental and well-known problem in computer science, the TSP, and extends its applicability to other NP-hard problems like the Knapsack problem. This relevance ensures the work has broad appeal.\n2. Motivation and Literature Placement: The authors provide a thorough review of prior work, situating their approach within the context of existing methods, including heuristic solvers and supervised learning approaches. The use of RL to overcome the limitations of supervised learning is well-justified.\n3. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is clearly described, and the experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple baselines and configurations. The comparison with traditional solvers like Christofides and OR-Tools adds credibility to the results.\n4. Flexibility: The framework's adaptability to different combinatorial problems is a significant strength, as demonstrated by its application to the Knapsack problem.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. State-of-the-Art Comparison: While the authors acknowledge that their method is not state-of-the-art in terms of speed and performance, a more detailed discussion of the gaps and potential avenues for bridging them would strengthen the paper.\n2. Scalability: The experiments are limited to TSP instances with up to 100 nodes. It would be valuable to explore the scalability of the method to larger problem sizes or discuss potential bottlenecks.\n3. Ablation Studies: While the paper explores different configurations (e.g., RL pretraining vs. active search), additional ablation studies on architectural choices (e.g., the impact of attention mechanisms or glimpses) would provide deeper insights.\n4. Real-World Applications: Including examples or discussions of real-world scenarios where the framework could be applied would enhance the practical relevance of the work.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the framework handle instances where the problem constraints (e.g., time windows in TSP) are complex and not easily encoded into the model?\n2. Can the proposed method be extended to non-Euclidean TSP instances or other graph-based optimization problems, such as vehicle routing with multiple constraints?\n3. What are the computational trade-offs of using active search compared to RL pretraining, especially for larger problem instances?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of combinatorial optimization and opens up exciting possibilities for future research. With minor improvements and clarifications, it has the potential to significantly impact the community."
