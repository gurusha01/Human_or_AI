The key innovation lies in approximating the weight matrix as a product of a ternary matrix (values {âˆ'1, 0, +1}) and a real-valued coefficient matrix, while activations are decomposed into binary vectors and a bias term. This approach enables efficient feed-forward propagation using logical operations (AND, XOR, and bit count), making it suitable for deployment on low-power CPUs or specialized hardware. Experiments on three networks\"\"MNIST CNN, VGG-16, and VGG-Face\"\"demonstrate significant acceleration (up to 15Ã—) and memory compression (up to 5.2%) with minimal accuracy loss (e.g., 1.43% increase in top-5 error for VGG-16). The method is presented as a unified framework combining matrix factorization and integer decomposition, requiring no retraining or changes to the training algorithm.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and provides significant contributions to the field of network compression and acceleration. The key reasons for acceptance are:\n1. Novelty and Practicality: The proposed method introduces a unique combination of ternary weight decomposition and binary activation encoding, which is both innovative and practical for real-world deployment.\n2. Strong Empirical Results: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across diverse tasks and architectures with detailed analysis of trade-offs between compression, acceleration, and accuracy.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical problem in deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices, which is highly relevant given the increasing demand for edge AI applications. The motivation is clearly articulated, and the method is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in matrix factorization and integer decomposition.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The proposed method is rigorously formulated, with clear mathematical derivations and a detailed explanation of the optimization process. The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and architectures, and include ablation studies to analyze the impact of key parameters (e.g., kw, kx).\n3. Results: The results convincingly support the claims. The method achieves significant acceleration and memory savings with minimal accuracy degradation, and the comparison with binary constraints highlights the superiority of the ternary approach.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity in Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, the paper could benefit from improved clarity in some sections. For example, the explanation of binary activation encoding (Section 4) is dense and could be simplified for better readability.\n2. Broader Comparison: The paper focuses primarily on comparing its method to binary constraints and a few prior works. Including a broader comparison with state-of-the-art network compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization-aware training, would strengthen the evaluation.\n3. Hardware Validation: While the method is designed for low-power CPUs and specialized hardware, the experiments are limited to a standard CPU. Demonstrating the method's performance on actual hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs or ASICs) would enhance its practical relevance.\n4. Generalization to Other Architectures: The experiments are limited to CNN-based architectures. It would be valuable to discuss how the method might generalize to other architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks.\nQuestions for Authors\n1. How does the method compare with state-of-the-art pruning or quantization-aware training techniques in terms of accuracy, compression, and computational efficiency?\n2. Could the ternary weight decomposition and binary activation encoding be extended to convolutional layers without significant accuracy loss? If so, what are the challenges?\n3. Have you considered hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., FPGA implementation) to further validate the practical benefits of the proposed method?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network compression and acceleration, and I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and broaden the evaluation."
