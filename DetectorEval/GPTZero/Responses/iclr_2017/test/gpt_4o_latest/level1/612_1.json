            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach for next-frame video prediction by modeling transformations between frames rather than directly predicting pixel values. The authors argue that this approach avoids the common issue of blurry predictions and leads to sharper results with a smaller model. Additionally, the paper introduces a new evaluation protocol that uses a classifier trained on ground-truth sequences to assess the plausibility of generated frames, emphasizing the preservation of discriminative features over pixel-level accuracy. The proposed method is computationally efficient and demonstrates competitive performance on the UCF-101 dataset compared to more complex models. The paper also validates its assumptions through qualitative and quantitative experiments and provides a detailed analysis of hyperparameter robustness.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted because it presents a well-motivated and novel approach to video frame prediction that is both computationally efficient and effective. The introduction of a new evaluation protocol is a valuable contribution to the field, addressing a critical limitation of existing metrics. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, and the paper is well-placed in the literature with clear comparisons to prior work.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The idea of operating in the transformation space rather than pixel space is innovative and addresses a key limitation of existing methods (blurry predictions). The motivation for this approach is clearly articulated and supported by experimental results.\n2. Evaluation Protocol: The proposed evaluation metric, which assesses the preservation of discriminative features, is a significant improvement over traditional pixel-space metrics like MSE. This contribution has the potential to influence future research in the field.\n3. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides thorough experiments on both synthetic (Moving MNIST) and real-world (UCF-101) datasets. The results demonstrate that the method outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art models in terms of both qualitative and quantitative metrics.\n4. Efficiency: The computational efficiency of the proposed method is a strong advantage, making it more practical for real-world applications compared to resource-intensive adversarial models.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Underestimation of Motion: The paper acknowledges that using MSE in transformation space leads to underestimation of motion. While this limitation is discussed, the authors could explore alternative loss functions or regularization techniques to mitigate this issue.\n2. Appearance Modeling: The current model does not explicitly separate appearance (\"what\") from motion (\"where\"). Incorporating an appearance model could improve the generalization and representation power of the approach.\n3. Comparison with LSTM-based Models: Although the authors mention that LSTM-based methods do not scale to high-resolution videos, a more detailed discussion or experiments on smaller datasets would strengthen the comparison.\n4. Ablation Studies: While the paper investigates hyperparameter robustness, additional ablation studies on the importance of key components (e.g., patch size, number of input frames) would provide deeper insights into the model's design choices.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the model handle scenarios with complex object interactions or occlusions? Are there qualitative examples of failure cases?\n2. Could the proposed evaluation protocol be extended to other generative tasks, such as image synthesis or text-to-video generation? If so, how?\n3. Have the authors considered incorporating adversarial training or a probabilistic framework to address the underestimation of motion? If not, what are the challenges in doing so?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of video prediction and introduces ideas that are both practical and impactful. With minor improvements, it has the potential to set a new baseline for future research."
