            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing the Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model by leveraging a Riemannian optimization framework. The authors reformulate the SGNS optimization problem as a two-step process: first, finding a low-rank matrix that directly optimizes the SGNS objective, and second, deriving word and context embeddings from this matrix. The key contribution lies in the use of a projector-splitting algorithm for Riemannian optimization, which simplifies the optimization process while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including SGNS optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and SVD over the SPPMI matrix, in terms of both the SGNS objective and linguistic similarity metrics.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, addresses a clear problem in SGNS optimization, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods. The use of Riemannian optimization is novel in this context, and the experimental results convincingly support the claims.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Clear Problem Statement and Motivation: The authors identify a key limitation in existing SGNS optimization approaches, which mix the optimization of the SGNS objective with the derivation of embeddings. This motivates their two-step framework, which is both theoretically sound and practically relevant.\n2. Novel Contribution: The application of Riemannian optimization to SGNS is innovative and addresses the low-rank matrix constraint directly, avoiding the inefficiencies of traditional SGD-based methods.\n3. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed method consistently outperforms baselines on multiple linguistic similarity datasets. The experimental setup is robust, using widely accepted benchmarks and metrics.\n4. Scientific Rigor: The mathematical formulation of the problem and the proposed algorithm are well-grounded in the literature on Riemannian optimization. The authors provide detailed derivations and justify their design choices.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Step 2 Optimization: While the authors acknowledge that Step 2 (deriving embeddings from the low-rank matrix) could be improved, they leave this as future work. Including preliminary experiments or insights into potential improvements for Step 2 would strengthen the paper.\n2. Computational Complexity: The paper briefly mentions the computational efficiency of the projector-splitting algorithm but does not provide a detailed comparison of runtime or scalability against baselines. Including such an analysis would enhance the practical relevance of the method.\n3. Generalizability: The method is evaluated on a single corpus (English Wikipedia). It would be helpful to test its generalizability on other languages or domains to demonstrate broader applicability.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the step size (位) and the number of iterations (K)? Could you provide more insights into how these were tuned?\n2. Have you considered alternative retraction methods for Riemannian optimization, and how do they compare to the projector-splitting algorithm in terms of performance and efficiency?\n3. Can the proposed method be extended to other word embedding models, such as GloVe, or to tasks beyond word similarity?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of word embeddings by introducing a novel optimization framework that improves both theoretical understanding and empirical performance. With minor clarifications and additional experiments, the work could have even broader impact."
