            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: \"Visualizing the Importance of Specific Inputs in LSTMs\"\nSummary of Contributions\nThe paper introduces a novel method for visualizing the importance of specific inputs in Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). By decomposing the LSTM's output into interpretable components, the authors propose a framework to assign importance scores to individual words and extract representative phrases. These patterns are then validated by constructing a simple, rule-based classifier that approximates the LSTM's predictions. The approach is applied to sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks, demonstrating its utility in understanding LSTM behavior. The paper claims that the proposed additive cell decomposition method provides cleaner visualizations and superior predictive ability compared to prior techniques. The authors also highlight the interpretability of their extracted patterns, which offer insights into the decision-making process of LSTMs.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of explainable AI by addressing the opacity of LSTMs, a widely used architecture in natural language processing. The proposed method is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and demonstrates both quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing approaches. The interpretability of the extracted patterns and their validation through a rule-based classifier are particularly compelling contributions.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Significance: The paper tackles the critical problem of interpretability in LSTMs, which has implications for both scientific understanding and practical applications. The focus on extracting meaningful patterns aligns with the growing demand for explainable AI.\n2. Novelty and Rigor: The additive cell decomposition method is a novel contribution that builds on existing literature while addressing its limitations. The paper provides a thorough mathematical formulation and empirical validation, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over prior methods like gradient-based importance scores.\n3. Empirical Validation: The authors evaluate their method on diverse tasks (sentiment analysis and question answering) and datasets, showing that the extracted patterns are both interpretable and predictive. The rule-based classifier achieves reasonable accuracy, validating the utility of the extracted patterns in approximating LSTM behavior.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Mathematical Derivations: While the mathematical formulation is detailed, some sections (e.g., Equations 8\"\"12) could benefit from additional explanation or illustrative examples to make the derivations more accessible to a broader audience.\n2. Comparison with More Baselines: The paper primarily compares its method to gradient-based approaches and cell-difference techniques. Including additional baselines, such as attention-based interpretability methods, would strengthen the evaluation.\n3. Error Analysis: The discussion of approximation errors between the LSTM and the rule-based classifier is insightful but could be expanded. For instance, a deeper analysis of failure cases and potential remedies would provide valuable guidance for future work.\n4. Scalability: The computational feasibility of the phrase extraction process, particularly for larger datasets, is not discussed in detail. Addressing this would enhance the practical applicability of the method.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method scale to tasks with significantly larger datasets or longer sequences? Are there any computational bottlenecks in the phrase extraction process?\n2. Could the extracted patterns be used to improve the training of LSTMs, for example, by incorporating them as priors or constraints?\n3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the threshold \\( c \\) used for candidate phrase selection?\nIn conclusion, the paper offers a well-motivated and rigorously evaluated contribution to the field of explainable AI, particularly for LSTMs. With minor improvements to clarity and additional comparisons, the work has the potential to make a significant impact."
