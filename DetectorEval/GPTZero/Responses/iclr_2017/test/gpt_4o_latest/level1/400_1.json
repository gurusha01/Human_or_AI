            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, the Doubly Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN), designed specifically for decoding tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture incorporates two separate recurrent modules to model both ancestral (parent-to-children) and fraternal (sibling-to-sibling) information flows, enabling it to generate tree structures explicitly and predict node labels simultaneously. The authors propose an innovative approach to topological prediction that avoids the use of artificial padding tokens, resulting in more concise and efficient tree generation. The DRNN is evaluated across three tasks: recovering latent tree structures from sequences, mapping natural language to functional programs, and machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that DRNNs outperform state-of-the-art methods in tasks involving tree generation and exhibit desirable properties such as structural invariance and coarse-to-fine decoding.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for acceptance:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The proposed DRNN architecture addresses a significant gap in the literature by explicitly modeling tree topology and node labels in a unified framework, which is a meaningful contribution to the field of structured data modeling.\n2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides rigorous experimental evidence across diverse tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, with a thorough discussion of related work. The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing methods and how DRNNs address these challenges. For example, the explicit modeling of tree topology is a significant improvement over methods that rely on padding tokens or heuristic classifiers.\n2. Scientific Rigor: The experimental results are robust and scientifically rigorous. The evaluation metrics (e.g., F1-scores for node and edge recovery, production-level accuracy for functional programs) are appropriate for the tasks, and the comparisons to baselines are fair and well-documented.\n3. Generality: The DRNN architecture is tested on a variety of tasks, demonstrating its versatility. The results on synthetic tree recovery, functional program generation, and machine translation highlight the model's ability to handle both tree-specific and sequence-to-sequence tasks effectively.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical details are comprehensive, the paper could benefit from a more concise explanation of the DRNN architecture, particularly in Section 3. The mathematical notation, while precise, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with tree-structured models. A diagram illustrating the forward and backward passes in the DRNN would improve accessibility.\n2. Ablation Studies: The paper would be strengthened by including ablation studies to isolate the contributions of key components, such as the separate ancestral and fraternal recurrences and the explicit topological prediction mechanism.\n3. Scalability Discussion: The authors mention the potential for batch processing on GPUs but do not provide experimental evidence. A brief analysis of the computational efficiency and scalability of DRNNs compared to existing methods would be valuable.\n4. Error Analysis: While the results are promising, a detailed error analysis\"\"especially for tasks like machine translation\"\"would provide insights into the limitations of the model and guide future improvements.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the DRNN perform on larger and more complex datasets, particularly for tasks like machine translation? Are there any scalability bottlenecks?\n2. Can the proposed architecture handle more general graph structures, or is it limited to tree-structured data?\n3. How sensitive is the model to hyperparameter choices, such as the decay parameters for topological prediction?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of structured data modeling and decoding. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, rigor, and empirical validation of the proposed DRNN architecture justify its acceptance."
