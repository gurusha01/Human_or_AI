            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for discovering and articulating design patterns in convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, inspired by principles from architecture and software engineering. The authors identify 14 design patterns that aim to guide both novice and experienced practitioners in designing effective CNNs, particularly for image classification tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces three innovative architectures\"\"Fractal of FractalNet (FoF), Stagewise Boosting Networks (SBN), and Taylor Series Networks (TSN)\"\"that are derived from these patterns. The authors provide experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to validate their architectural innovations and demonstrate their potential for faster training and comparable accuracy to baseline models like FractalNet. The work is accompanied by publicly available code, which enhances its reproducibility and accessibility.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper presents an interesting and creative approach to CNN design, it falls short in providing sufficient empirical evidence to substantiate its claims. The experimental results, while promising, are preliminary and lack rigorous benchmarking against state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the theoretical justification for some of the proposed patterns and architectures is underdeveloped, leaving key questions about their generalizability unanswered.\nSupporting Arguments for Decision\n1. Insufficient Empirical Validation: The experimental results focus primarily on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are relatively small-scale benchmarks. The lack of evaluation on larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet) limits the generalizability of the proposed patterns and architectures. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art architectures, such as DenseNet or EfficientNet, which would help contextualize the performance of the proposed methods.\n2. Theoretical Gaps: While the design patterns are inspired by principles from architecture and software engineering, their theoretical grounding in the context of deep learning is not thoroughly explored. For example, the rationale behind certain patterns, such as \"Freeze-Drop-Path\" and \"Taylor Series Networks,\" is not convincingly justified, and their practical advantages remain unclear.\n3. Preliminary Nature of Results: The authors acknowledge that their results are preliminary and that further exploration is needed to fully evaluate the proposed architectures. This self-admission suggests that the paper is not yet ready for publication in its current form.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Expand Experimental Validation: Evaluate the proposed architectures on larger and more diverse datasets, such as ImageNet, to demonstrate their scalability and generalizability. Include comparisons with state-of-the-art models to provide a clearer picture of the practical benefits of the proposed methods.\n2. Strengthen Theoretical Justifications: Provide a more rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed design patterns, particularly in terms of their impact on model performance and training dynamics. This could include ablation studies to isolate the effects of individual patterns.\n3. Clarify Practical Utility: While the design patterns are interesting, their practical utility for novice practitioners is not fully demonstrated. Consider including case studies or examples that show how these patterns can be applied to real-world problems.\n4. Improve Presentation: The paper is dense and difficult to follow in places. Simplifying the descriptions of the design patterns and providing more visual aids (e.g., diagrams of architectures) could make the work more accessible.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do the proposed architectures compare to state-of-the-art models, such as DenseNet or EfficientNet, in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency?\n2. Can the design patterns be applied to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent or transformer-based architectures? If so, how?\n3. What specific challenges or limitations did you encounter when implementing the proposed architectures, and how might these be addressed in future work?\nIn conclusion, while the paper introduces creative ideas and has the potential to inspire future research, it requires more rigorous empirical and theoretical validation to meet the standards of the conference."
