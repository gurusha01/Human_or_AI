            "inputText": "Review of the Paper: \"Classless Association Learning Inspired by the Symbol Grounding Problem\"\nSummary\nThis paper introduces a novel model, termed Classless Association, to address the problem of learning associations between two instances of the same unknown class without relying on predefined labels. Inspired by the Symbol Grounding Problem and infant sensory association learning, the model employs two parallel Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. The training process aligns the network outputs with a statistical distribution, enabling the networks to agree on pseudo-classes for input pairs. The authors evaluate their model on four classless datasets derived from MNIST and compare its performance against supervised and unsupervised baselines. Results show that the proposed model outperforms unsupervised clustering methods and achieves promising results relative to supervised learning, despite the absence of labels.\nDecision: Accept \nThe paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to an underexplored problem: learning associations in a classless setting. The proposed method is scientifically rigorous, demonstrates clear improvements over unsupervised baselines, and is grounded in relevant literature. The contributions are significant and open new avenues for research in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Problem Significance and Novelty: The paper addresses the unique challenge of learning associations without labels, a scenario inspired by human cognitive development. This is a novel contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in unsupervised learning.\n \n2. Methodological Rigor: The proposed EM-based training rule is well-explained and grounded in prior work (e.g., Symbol Grounding Problem, Siamese Networks). The use of pseudo-classes and statistical constraints is a creative solution to the classless learning problem.\n3. Experimental Validation: The evaluation on four datasets, including transformations like rotation and inversion, demonstrates the robustness of the model. The comparison with supervised and unsupervised baselines provides a clear context for the model's performance, showing its superiority over clustering methods.\n4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written, with detailed descriptions of the methodology, experiments, and results. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the model's learning process and outcomes.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Scalability and Generalization: The paper evaluates the model on relatively simple datasets (MNIST and its variants). Extending the experiments to more complex, real-world datasets (e.g., multimodal datasets) would strengthen the claims of generalizability.\n2. Analysis of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge the model's limitations (e.g., reliance on uniform distributions and known class numbers), a more detailed discussion of how these assumptions impact performance would be valuable. For example, how does the model perform when the number of pseudo-classes is misaligned with the true number of classes?\n3. Comparison with Semi-Supervised Learning: The authors briefly mention plans to explore semi-supervised learning. Including preliminary results or a discussion of how the model might integrate labeled data would enhance the paper's relevance.\n4. Computational Complexity: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of the EM-based training or the large mini-batch size. A comparison of training time with baseline methods would provide a more complete picture of the model's practicality.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the model handle cases where the input distributions are highly imbalanced or non-uniform? Would the uniform distribution assumption limit its applicability in real-world scenarios?\n2. Can the model be extended to handle more than two input streams (e.g., multimodal data)?\n3. How sensitive is the model to the choice of the number of pseudo-classes? Would an adaptive mechanism for determining this number improve performance?\n4. What are the implications of using deeper architectures, as mentioned in the future work section? Have preliminary experiments been conducted in this direction?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel approach to classless association learning. While there are areas for further exploration, the methodology and results are compelling, warranting acceptance to the conference."
