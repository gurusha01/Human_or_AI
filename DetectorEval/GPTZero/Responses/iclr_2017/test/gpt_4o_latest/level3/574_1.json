            "inputText": "The paper presents a large-scale visual search system for fashion products, aiming to address the complex problem of defining similarity among fashion items. By introducing over 90 fashion-related attributes and leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for multi-label classification, the authors propose a novel approach to attribute recognition and inverted indexing for scalable retrieval. The system also incorporates guided ROI detection and visual feature extraction to enhance search precision. The authors highlight the practical application of their system in an e-commerce platform, demonstrating its potential to bridge cutting-edge deep learning research with industry needs.\nDecision: Reject\nKey Reasons for Rejection:\n1. Insufficient Comparison with Prior Work: The paper does not adequately position itself within the existing literature, particularly neglecting comparisons with foundational work by Tamara Berg's group on fashion recognition and attributes. This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.\n2. Incomplete Dataset Details: The paper provides limited information about the fashion-attribute dataset, including the sources of images, annotation processes, and instructions for annotators. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the reproducibility and generalizability of the results.\nSupporting Arguments:\n- While the proposed system is technically interesting and demonstrates a practical application of deep learning in e-commerce, the absence of comparisons with simpler baselines or prior methods limits the clarity of the results. For instance, it is unclear how the RNN-based approach improves over traditional multi-label classification methods or simpler feature-based retrieval systems.\n- The lack of detailed dataset documentation undermines the credibility of the empirical results. Without understanding the dataset's construction, it is challenging to evaluate the robustness of the model or its applicability to other domains.\nAdditional Feedback for Improvement:\n1. Literature Review and Baselines: The authors should include a comprehensive review of related work, particularly from Tamara Berg's group, and provide quantitative comparisons with prior methods. Incorporating simpler baselines would also help contextualize the performance gains of the proposed system.\n2. Dataset Transparency: Detailed information about the dataset, such as the image sources, annotation guidelines, and quality control measures, should be included. This would enhance the paper's reproducibility and allow for fair comparisons in future work.\n3. Evaluation Metrics: The paper should provide a more rigorous evaluation of the system's performance, including metrics that assess both the attribute recognition and retrieval quality. Additionally, qualitative examples should be supplemented with quantitative results to strengthen the claims.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the proposed RNN-based attribute recognition compare to traditional multi-label classification methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy?\n2. Can you provide more details on the annotation process for the fashion-attribute dataset? Were annotators trained, and how was consistency ensured across annotations?\n3. Why were simpler baselines (e.g., binary relevance or label combination methods) not included in the evaluation? How would the system perform relative to these methods?\nIn summary, while the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful system, the lack of comparisons with prior work, insufficient dataset details, and missing baselines significantly weaken its contributions. Addressing these issues would make the paper much stronger and more publication-ready."
