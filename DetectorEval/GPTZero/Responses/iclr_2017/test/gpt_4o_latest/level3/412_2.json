            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel layer-wise optimization algorithm for Piecewise Linear Convolutional Neural Networks (PL-CNNs), which utilize ReLU and max-pooling activations and employ an SVM classifier in the final layer. The authors frame the parameter estimation problem as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, solved iteratively using the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP). By leveraging the structured SVM formulation and the Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm, the proposed method ensures monotonic decreases in the objective function without requiring learning rate tuning. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art backpropagation-based optimizers such as Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. The paper also highlights the scalability of the method and its potential applicability to standard architectures like VGG and ResNet.\nDecision: Reject\nThe decision to reject is based on two primary reasons:\n1. Insufficient Experimental Validation: The experimental setup is limited and does not convincingly demonstrate the broader applicability or significance of the proposed method. The datasets and architectures used are standard, but the evaluation lacks robustness, such as comparisons on more diverse tasks or ablations to isolate the contributions of individual components.\n2. Presentation and Clarity Issues: The paper suffers from unclear derivations and insufficient explanations of key concepts, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the comparisons between backpropagation and CCCP are not appropriately contextualized, weakening the narrative.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Experimental Evaluation: While the results show improvements over backpropagation variants, the experiments are narrowly scoped. For example, the paper does not explore whether the proposed method generalizes to non-image tasks or architectures with non-piecewise-linear activations. The reliance on pre-trained networks with batch normalization fixed at test-time raises questions about the practical utility of the method in real-world scenarios.\n2. Optimization Guarantees vs. Practical Relevance: The emphasis on monotonic decreases in the objective function is theoretically appealing but lacks practical relevance. Real-world optimization often involves mini-batches, where such guarantees are not directly applicable. The paper does not address how the method performs under these more realistic conditions.\n3. Clarity and Comparisons: The derivations of the DC decomposition and the structured SVM formulation are not adequately detailed, making it challenging to grasp the intuition behind the approach. Furthermore, the comparison between backpropagation and CCCP is misleading, as the two methods address fundamentally different optimization paradigms.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Experimental Scope: Extend the experiments to include more diverse datasets, tasks, and architectures. Ablation studies should isolate the contributions of the CCCP optimization, the BCFW algorithm, and the trust-region modifications.\n2. Clarity in Presentation: Provide more detailed explanations of the DC decomposition, CCCP, and structured SVM formulations. Include visual aids or diagrams to illustrate the intuition behind the layer-wise optimization process.\n3. Practical Relevance: Address the limitations of the method in mini-batch settings and explore strategies to adapt the algorithm for such scenarios. Discuss the trade-offs between theoretical guarantees and practical performance.\n4. Related Work: Strengthen the discussion of related work by explicitly contrasting the proposed method with Input-Convex Deep Networks and other layer-wise optimization approaches. Highlight the novelty of the method in this context.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the proposed method perform in mini-batch settings, where monotonic decreases in the objective function are not guaranteed?\n2. Can the algorithm be extended to architectures with non-piecewise-linear activations or tasks beyond image classification?\n3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization weight 位 and the proximal term 碌?\n4. Why were the experimental comparisons limited to Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam? Would comparisons with second-order or natural gradient methods provide additional insights?\nIn summary, while the paper introduces an interesting optimization framework, the limited experimental validation, unclear presentation, and lack of practical relevance undermine its potential impact. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the work."
