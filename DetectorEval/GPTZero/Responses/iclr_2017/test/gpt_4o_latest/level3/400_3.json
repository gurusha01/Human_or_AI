            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, the Doubly Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN), designed for generating tree-structured outputs. The model innovatively separates depth and sibling recurrences, as well as topology and label generation, to address the challenges of tree decoding. Unlike prior methods, it avoids the need for manually annotated subtrees with special tokens, simplifying the decoding process. The proposed architecture is evaluated on both a synthetic dataset and the real-world IFTTT dataset, where it demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The experiments also highlight the model's ability to recover latent tree structures and map natural language to abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Additionally, the paper explores the potential of DRNNs in machine translation, showing promising results in coarse-to-fine decoding and robustness to structural variations.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, methodologically sound, and makes significant contributions to the field of tree-structured decoding. The proposed DRNN architecture is a meaningful advancement over existing methods, offering both conceptual and practical improvements. The results on the IFTTT dataset and synthetic data provide strong empirical evidence of the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, the paper is well-written and provides a solid foundation for future research in this area.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The DRNN architecture addresses key limitations of prior tree-decoding methods, such as reliance on artificial tokens for topology prediction. By explicitly modeling tree topology and separating depth and sibling recurrences, the approach introduces a more natural and efficient framework for tree generation.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, with evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The model outperforms baselines, including SEQ2TREE, on the IFTTT dataset, achieving higher F1 scores and better node accuracy. The additional exploration of DRNNs in machine translation highlights the model's versatility and desirable properties, such as structural invariance.\n3. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with only minor typos. It provides sufficient background, methodological details, and experimental results to support its claims.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Precision Drop in Large Trees: The paper notes a rapid decline in precision with increasing tree size in the synthetic dataset. This raises questions about the encoder's ability to handle long sequences or the tree decoder's tolerance for large structures. Adding an attention mechanism or exploring alternative encoders could mitigate this issue.\n2. Dataset Statistics: Providing more detailed statistics about the IFTTT dataset, such as tree depth, width, and vocabulary size, would help readers better understand the task's complexity.\n3. Beam Search vs. Greedy Decoding: The experiments rely on greedy decoding for tree generation. Testing beam search could improve performance and offer insights into the model's potential for further optimization.\n4. Analysis of Structural Trends: Investigating how precision varies with tree depth, width, and symmetry would provide a deeper understanding of the model's strengths and limitations.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Have you considered adding an attention mechanism to the encoder-decoder framework to address potential limitations with long sequence representations?\n2. How does the model perform when beam search is used instead of greedy decoding? Does it improve precision for larger trees?\n3. Could you provide additional statistics about the IFTTT dataset, such as the average tree depth and vocabulary size, to contextualize the task's difficulty?\n4. Have you explored the impact of varying the weight between topology and label prediction losses during training?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance. The proposed DRNN architecture offers a promising direction for future research in tree-structured decoding and related applications."
