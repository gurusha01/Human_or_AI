The authors propose a novel approach that combines the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm with two auxiliary tasks: unsupervised depth prediction and self-supervised loop closure classification. These tasks are designed to encourage intrinsic spatial and movement representations, which improve the agent's ability to navigate efficiently. The paper demonstrates that these auxiliary tasks significantly enhance data efficiency and task performance, enabling agents to approach human-level navigation in dynamic and visually rich maze environments. The experiments are well-designed, with detailed analyses of agent behavior, localization capabilities, and network activity dynamics. The results convincingly show that the proposed auxiliary tasks accelerate learning and improve navigation performance.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-written, presents a clear and incremental contribution, and provides convincing experimental results. While the contribution is somewhat narrow in scope, focusing specifically on geometry-based auxiliary tasks, the work is a valuable demonstration of how auxiliary tasks can enhance RL for navigation. The decision to accept is based on the scientific rigor of the experiments, the clarity of the paper, and the practical utility of the proposed approach.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The use of auxiliary tasks is well-grounded in prior literature, and the authors clearly articulate how depth prediction and loop closure tasks contribute to navigation. The approach builds on established methods (e.g., A3C) and extends them in a meaningful way.\n2. Rigorous Experiments: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple maze environments with varying levels of complexity. The results demonstrate significant improvements in learning speed and task performance when auxiliary tasks are used.\n3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides detailed analyses of agent behavior, including position decoding and network activity, which strengthen the claims about the benefits of auxiliary tasks.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Broader Analysis: While the paper demonstrates the utility of depth prediction and loop closure, it would benefit from a broader exploration of auxiliary task combinations. For example, how do these tasks compare to other potential auxiliary tasks, such as reward prediction or semantic segmentation? A more general discussion of optimal auxiliary task design could enhance the impact of the work.\n2. Generalization Insights: The paper focuses on specific geometry-based tasks. It would be helpful to discuss whether the proposed approach generalizes to other types of environments or tasks beyond navigation.\n3. Ablation Studies: While the paper includes comparisons of individual auxiliary tasks, more detailed ablation studies could clarify the relative contributions of each task and their interactions.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How sensitive is the proposed approach to the choice of hyperparameters for the auxiliary tasks? Are there specific guidelines for selecting these parameters?\n2. Could the proposed auxiliary tasks be applied to other RL domains beyond navigation? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. How does the performance of the proposed method compare to traditional SLAM-based approaches in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?\nOverall, this paper makes a solid contribution to the field of deep RL for navigation and provides a strong foundation for future work on auxiliary tasks. While there is room for broader analysis and generalization, the current work is scientifically rigorous and practically useful, warranting acceptance."
