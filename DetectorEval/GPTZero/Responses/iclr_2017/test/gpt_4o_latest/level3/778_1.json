            "inputText": "This paper proposes a novel method to reduce the test-time computational load of deep neural networks (DNNs) by introducing a new factorization approach that combines ternary matrix decomposition and binary activation encoding. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on factorizing weight matrices into real-valued components, this approach factorizes both weights and activations into integer and non-integer components, enabling efficient test-time operations using logical operations like XOR and AND. The method demonstrates significant acceleration (up to 15Ã—) and memory compression (down to 5.2%) with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as shown in experiments on MNIST, ImageNet (VGG-16), and VGG-Face datasets. The paper highlights the potential for deploying DNNs on low-power CPUs or specialized hardware without retraining the network.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper should be accepted due to its innovative approach to reducing computational and memory costs in DNNs, which is a critical challenge in deploying models on resource-constrained devices. The results are promising, demonstrating substantial improvements in efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. However, the paper does have limitations, particularly in its lack of comprehensive comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, which could strengthen its claims.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The proposed method is a creative combination of ternary matrix decomposition and binary activation encoding, which bridges the gap between matrix factorization and integer decomposition. This unified framework is a significant step forward in DNN compression techniques.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple datasets and architectures. The reported results, such as 15Ã— acceleration for VGG-16 with only a 1.43% increase in top-5 error, are compelling and demonstrate the practical utility of the method.\n3. Practical Relevance: The method's compatibility with pre-trained models and its ability to operate without retraining make it highly applicable to real-world scenarios, particularly for edge devices.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Comparative Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art compression and acceleration methods, such as XNOR-Net or pruning-based approaches. Including these comparisons would provide a clearer understanding of the method's relative strengths and weaknesses.\n2. Ablation Studies: While the paper explores various parameter settings (e.g., kw and kx), a more systematic ablation study could better elucidate the trade-offs between compression, acceleration, and accuracy.\n3. Broader Evaluation: The experiments focus on specific tasks (classification and face recognition). Testing the method on other tasks, such as semantic segmentation or object detection, would demonstrate its generalizability.\n4. Clarity in Presentation: Some sections, particularly those describing the optimization algorithms, are dense and could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art compression techniques in terms of computational complexity and accuracy trade-offs?\n2. Can the method be extended to other architectures, such as transformers or lightweight models like MobileNet? If so, what are the expected challenges?\n3. How does the choice of kw and kx affect the performance across different layers, particularly convolutional layers versus fully connected layers?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of DNN compression and acceleration. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty and practical relevance of the proposed method justify its acceptance."
