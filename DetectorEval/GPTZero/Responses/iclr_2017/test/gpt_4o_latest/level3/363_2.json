            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper proposes a general \"compare-aggregate\" framework for sequence matching tasks, incorporating word-level matching and CNN-based aggregation. The authors systematically evaluate six comparison functions, including novel element-wise operations (SUB, MULT, SUBMULT+NN), across four diverse datasets: MovieQA, InsuranceQA, WikiQA, and SNLI. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on these datasets, with the SUBMULT+NN comparison function generally performing the best. The paper also highlights the importance of preprocessing and attention layers, providing insights into their role in different sequence matching scenarios. The authors make their code publicly available, which is a valuable contribution to the research community.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-written, presents a novel and generalizable framework, and provides extensive experimental evidence to support its claims. The systematic evaluation of comparison functions and the insights into preprocessing and attention layers are significant contributions to the field of sequence matching in NLP. However, there are minor issues that need to be addressed to improve the paper's clarity and presentation.\nSupporting Arguments for Acceptance\n1. Novelty and Generalizability: The paper extends the \"compare-aggregate\" framework by systematically analyzing six comparison functions, including underexplored element-wise operations. The framework's applicability across four datasets demonstrates its generalizability.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors provide extensive experimental results, including ablation studies, to validate their claims. The findings are well-supported and scientifically rigorous.\n3. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience in the NLP community. The inclusion of publicly available code enhances reproducibility.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Clarification of Preprocessing and Attention Benefits: While the paper discusses the importance of preprocessing and attention layers, it would benefit from additional results showing performance without these components. This would provide a clearer understanding of their individual contributions.\n2. Typographical Error: There is a typo on page 4, line 5: \"including a some\" should be corrected to \"including some.\"\n3. Figure 2 Readability: The quality of Figure 2 needs improvement for better readability, especially in printed form. Enlarging text and increasing contrast would help.\n4. Discussion of Limitations: While the paper demonstrates strong performance, it would be helpful to discuss potential limitations of the approach, such as computational efficiency or scalability to larger datasets.\n5. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper mentions related work, a more detailed comparison of the proposed framework's computational complexity and performance trade-offs with existing models would strengthen the contribution.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. Can you provide quantitative results showing the performance of the model without the preprocessing and attention layers? This would clarify their specific contributions.\n2. How does the computational efficiency of the proposed framework compare to other state-of-the-art models, particularly for large datasets?\n3. Have you considered applying this framework to additional tasks beyond the four datasets studied? If so, what were the results?\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence matching in NLP and is recommended for acceptance, contingent on addressing the minor issues outlined above."
