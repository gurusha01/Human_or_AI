            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper investigates the use of auxiliary task learning in reinforcement learning (RL) to improve navigation in complex 3D environments. The authors propose a multi-task learning framework that augments the primary RL objective with auxiliary tasks, specifically depth prediction and loop closure classification. The paper demonstrates that these auxiliary tasks enhance data efficiency and task performance by encouraging the learning of richer representations. The proposed approach achieves near-human performance in dynamic goal environments and provides detailed analyses of agent behavior, localization capabilities, and network activity dynamics. The paper positions itself as a step toward understanding how navigation can emerge as a by-product of RL when augmented with auxiliary objectives.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper makes a strong case for the utility of auxiliary tasks in RL, supported by rigorous experimentation and insightful analyses. However, the decision is contingent on addressing some definitional inconsistencies and providing additional insights into representation changes.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in deep RL and auxiliary task learning. It extends these ideas to the navigation domain with a clear focus on data efficiency and representation learning.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are robust, with comparisons across multiple baselines and environments. The auxiliary tasks significantly improve learning speed and performance, particularly in dynamic goal scenarios where memory and localization are critical.\n3. Novelty and Impact: The integration of auxiliary tasks like depth prediction and loop closure is novel in the context of navigation. The analysis of agent behavior and position decoding provides valuable insights into the learned representations, which could inform future work in RL and robotics.\nAdditional Feedback for Improvement\n1. Representation Analysis: While the paper discusses position decoding and network activity, it lacks a direct comparison of representations with and without auxiliary tasks. Visualizations or quantitative metrics (e.g., feature similarity) could clarify how auxiliary tasks influence representation learning.\n2. Definitional Issues: The paper conflates supervised and self-supervised learning. Predicting depth from RGB or loop closure from trajectory data relies on externally supplied labels (e.g., depth maps, trajectory similarity), making these tasks supervised rather than self-supervised. Clarifying these definitions would strengthen the paper's conceptual foundation.\n3. Auxiliary Task Selection: The choice of depth prediction and loop closure is well-justified, but the paper could explore or discuss other potential auxiliary tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, reward prediction) to generalize its findings.\n4. Scalability: The paper acknowledges limitations in handling larger environments and procedural generation. Future work could explore architectures with external memory or hierarchical RL to address these challenges.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do the learned representations differ between the baseline RL agent and the agent with auxiliary tasks? Can you provide quantitative or qualitative evidence?\n2. Why are depth prediction and loop closure classified as self-supervised tasks? Would you consider reclassifying them as supervised tasks given the reliance on external labels?\n3. How sensitive is the performance to the weighting of auxiliary losses? Could this impact the generalizability of the approach to other tasks or environments?\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of RL and auxiliary task learning. Addressing the outlined concerns would further solidify its impact and clarity."
