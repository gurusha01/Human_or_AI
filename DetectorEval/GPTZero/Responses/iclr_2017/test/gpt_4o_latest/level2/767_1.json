            "inputText": "Review\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to automatically learn learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using an actor-critic framework from reinforcement learning (RL). The authors claim that their method eliminates the need for manual tuning of learning rates, improves convergence, and prevents overfitting, leading to better generalization performance. The key contributions include the design of an actor-critic algorithm for learning rate control, leveraging long-term rewards for decision-making, and introducing a mechanism to feed different training samples to the actor and critic networks to enhance generalization.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its innovative approach to a well-known problem in machine learning, strong experimental validation, and practical implications for improving SGD-based optimization.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a significant challenge in machine learning—manual tuning of learning rates—which is both tedious and problem-specific. By framing learning rate control as a sequential decision-making problem and leveraging RL, the authors present a novel perspective that is well-motivated and distinct from existing methods like Adam, RMSprop, and vSGD.\n2. Experimental Validation: The experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show comparable convergence speed to baseline optimizers while achieving superior test accuracy, particularly in scenarios prone to overfitting. The ablation study (feeding different samples to actor and critic networks) further validates the design choices.\n3. Practical Usefulness: The proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted, as it automates a critical aspect of model training. The algorithm's ability to generalize across datasets and architectures enhances its practical appeal.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Clarity and Completeness: While the paper is generally well-written, certain sections, such as the algorithm description, could benefit from additional clarity. For instance, the role of the state function χ(·) and its computational efficiency could be elaborated further. Additionally, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the computational overhead introduced by the actor-critic framework compared to traditional methods.\n2. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss limitations. For example, the scalability of the approach to very large datasets or complex models (e.g., transformers) remains unclear. Additionally, the reliance on RL techniques may introduce challenges in hyperparameter tuning (e.g., discount factor γ).\n3. Future Work: The authors mention exploring learning individual learning rates for each parameter and extending the approach to other hyperparameters. These are promising directions, but more concrete details on how these extensions might be implemented would strengthen the paper.\nQuestions for Authors\n1. How does the computational cost of the actor-critic framework compare to traditional optimizers like Adam or RMSprop? Is the additional overhead justified for large-scale tasks?\n2. Have you tested the algorithm on more complex datasets or architectures (e.g., ImageNet or transformers)? If not, what challenges do you anticipate in scaling the approach?\n3. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to the choice of RL hyperparameters, such as the discount factor γ or the architecture of the actor and critic networks?\nOverall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field and has the potential to inspire further research in automated optimization techniques."
