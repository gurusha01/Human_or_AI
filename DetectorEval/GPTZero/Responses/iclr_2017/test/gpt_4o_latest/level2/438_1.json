            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel approach to navigation in complex 3D environments by formulating it as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem augmented with auxiliary tasks. The authors propose combining goal-driven RL with auxiliary depth prediction and loop closure classification tasks to improve data efficiency and task performance. The approach leverages multimodal sensory inputs and employs a stacked LSTM architecture to address memory requirements. The results demonstrate that the proposed method enables agents to achieve near-human-level performance in dynamic environments with frequently changing goals. The authors also provide detailed analyses of agent behavior, localization capabilities, and network activity dynamics, showcasing the emergence of key navigation abilities.\nDecision: Accept\nKey Reasons:\n1. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in learning efficiency and task performance compared to baseline RL models, demonstrating its practical utility in challenging navigation tasks.\n2. Novelty and Contribution: The integration of auxiliary tasks (depth prediction and loop closure) into the RL framework is a meaningful contribution, providing insights into how auxiliary objectives can enhance representation learning and navigation capabilities.\nSupporting Arguments:\nThe paper is well-motivated and grounded in relevant literature, with clear connections to prior work in deep RL and navigation. The use of auxiliary tasks is justified through theoretical and empirical analyses, and the experiments are conducted in diverse, visually rich environments, ensuring robustness. The inclusion of human-level performance benchmarks further strengthens the evaluation. Additionally, the detailed analysis of agent behavior and network dynamics provides valuable insights into the learned representations and navigation strategies.\nThe novelty lies in the specific auxiliary tasks chosen\"\"depth prediction and loop closure\"\"and their integration into an RL framework. The authors convincingly argue that these tasks provide denser training signals, facilitating faster and more effective learning. The results, particularly the ability to achieve near-human-level performance in dynamic environments, underscore the practical impact of the proposed approach.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of its limitations. For instance, the reliance on LSTMs may constrain scalability to larger, more procedurally generated environments, as acknowledged in the conclusion.\n2. While the auxiliary tasks are well-motivated, exploring additional tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or reward prediction) could further validate the generalizability of the approach.\n3. The hyperparameter sensitivity analysis is a valuable addition, but more details on how hyperparameters were tuned for baseline models would enhance reproducibility.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How does the performance of the proposed method compare to SLAM-based approaches in similar environments? Could a hybrid approach combining SLAM and RL be beneficial?\n2. The paper mentions that auxiliary tasks improve data efficiency. Could you provide more quantitative insights into the reduction in training time or samples required compared to baseline models?\n3. How does the method generalize to environments with significantly different visual or structural characteristics than those used in the experiments?\nIn conclusion, the paper makes a strong case for the use of auxiliary tasks in RL-based navigation and provides compelling empirical evidence to support its claims. With minor improvements in clarity and scope, it has the potential to make a significant impact on the field."
