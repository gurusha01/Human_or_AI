            "inputText": "The paper presents a novel off-policy batch policy gradient method (BPG) for reinforcement learning (RL) to improve chatbot performance in scenarios where rewards are noisy and expensive to obtain. The authors argue that existing on-policy and online RL methods are unsuitable for such settings and propose BPG as a more effective alternative. The method leverages historical data, importance sampling, and λ-returns to optimize policies using limited labeled data while initializing with unlabelled data via maximum likelihood training. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through synthetic experiments and a real-world application in restaurant recommendation chatbots, where statistically significant improvements are observed.\nDecision: Accept\nKey Reasons for Decision:\n1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a practical and underexplored problem in RL for natural language processing (NLP)—training chatbots with noisy, expensive rewards in batch settings. The proposed BPG method introduces meaningful innovations, such as the use of importance sampling and λ-returns, which are well-justified and distinct from prior work.\n2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of BPG over existing methods in both synthetic and real-world settings. The use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for evaluation adds credibility to the results.\nSupporting Arguments:\n- The paper is well-motivated, clearly identifying the limitations of existing RL methods for chatbots in batch settings. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the gaps their method addresses.\n- The technical rigor of the proposed method is commendable. The derivation of the BPG algorithm is detailed and supported by theoretical insights, particularly the use of importance sampling to account for off-policy updates.\n- The experimental results are robust, with both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The synthetic experiments highlight the method's advantages in handling noisy rewards, while the restaurant recommendation task demonstrates its practical utility. The paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests provide statistical rigor to the claims.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, the paper could benefit from a more concise explanation of the BPG algorithm to improve accessibility for readers less familiar with RL. A flowchart or diagram summarizing the method would be helpful.\n2. Limitations and Generalization: The paper acknowledges the noisy nature of AMT labels but could further discuss how this might impact the generalizability of the results to other domains. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the computational overhead introduced by importance sampling and whether it scales to larger datasets.\n3. Qualitative Analysis: The qualitative examples provided in the appendix are insightful. Including a few such examples in the main text would enhance the reader's understanding of the practical improvements achieved by BPG.\n4. Future Work: The authors briefly mention potential applications beyond chatbots, such as question answering and machine translation. Expanding on how BPG could be adapted to these tasks would strengthen the paper's broader impact.\nQuestions for Authors:\n1. How sensitive is the BPG method to the choice of λ? Did you observe any trade-offs between variance reduction and convergence speed when varying λ?\n2. Can the proposed method handle scenarios where the behavior policy is unknown or poorly approximated? If so, how robust is it to inaccuracies in the learned behavior policy?\n3. How does the computational complexity of BPG compare to other RL methods, particularly in terms of training time and memory requirements?\nOverall, the paper makes a strong contribution to RL for NLP and has the potential to influence future work in training chatbots and other sequence-to-sequence models in challenging settings."
