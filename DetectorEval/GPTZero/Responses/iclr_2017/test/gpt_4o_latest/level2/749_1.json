            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nThis paper proposes a set of design patterns for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, aiming to provide both novice and experienced practitioners with high-level principles for designing effective networks. The authors identify 14 design patterns derived from recent advancements in deep learning architectures, such as Residual Networks and FractalNet. They also introduce three novel architectural innovations: Fractal of FractalNet (FoF), Stagewise Boosting Networks (SBN), and Taylor Series Networks (TSN). The paper is supported by empirical results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating the potential of these innovations to improve training efficiency and accuracy.\nDecision: Reject\nWhile the paper presents interesting ideas and attempts to address a relevant problem, it falls short in several critical areas. The primary reasons for rejection are: (1) insufficient empirical evidence to validate the proposed design patterns and architectural innovations, and (2) lack of clarity and rigor in connecting the proposed patterns to measurable improvements in performance or generalization.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Claims and Support: The paper claims to identify universal design principles for CNNs and introduces novel architectures. However, the empirical results are limited in scope and do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing architectures. For instance, while the FoF network achieves comparable accuracy to FractalNet, the SBN and TSN architectures underperform, raising questions about their practical utility.\n2. Usefulness and Novelty: The idea of design patterns for CNNs is intriguing and could be valuable for practitioners. However, the patterns themselves are not sufficiently novel, as many (e.g., \"Normalize Layer Inputs\" and \"Proliferate Paths\") are already well-known practices in the deep learning community. The architectural innovations, while creative, lack compelling evidence of their effectiveness.\n3. Completeness and Reproducibility: The paper provides implementation details and makes code available, which is commendable. However, the experiments are narrowly focused on CIFAR datasets, and the results are not robust enough to generalize to other tasks or datasets. Additionally, the paper does not adequately explore the trade-offs or limitations of the proposed approaches.\n4. Positioning in Literature: The paper acknowledges related work but does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from existing literature. For example, the connection between the proposed design patterns and prior work on Residual Networks and FractalNet is not thoroughly explored.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Strengthen Empirical Validation: Conduct more extensive experiments on diverse datasets and tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed patterns and architectures. Compare against a broader range of state-of-the-art methods.\n2. Clarify Contributions: Clearly articulate how the proposed design patterns and architectures differ from or improve upon existing methods. Provide quantitative evidence to support claims of improved training efficiency or accuracy.\n3. Discuss Limitations: Acknowledge the limitations of the proposed approaches, such as the underperformance of SBN and TSN, and suggest potential solutions or areas for future work.\n4. Improve Presentation: Simplify the exposition of design patterns and their connections to empirical results. Highlight the practical implications of the patterns for practitioners.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do the proposed design patterns and architectures perform on larger-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) or tasks beyond image classification?\n2. Can you provide more detailed insights into why SBN and TSN underperform compared to FractalNet? Are there specific scenarios where these architectures might excel?\n3. How do you envision practitioners applying these design patterns in real-world scenarios? Are there guidelines for selecting patterns based on specific applications?\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting direction, it requires significant improvements in empirical validation, clarity, and positioning within the literature to make a strong contribution."
