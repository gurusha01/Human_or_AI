            "inputText": "Review\nThe paper presents a novel algorithm for performing polynomial feature expansion directly on compressed sparse row (CSR) matrices without intermediate densification. The authors claim that their method improves the time complexity to \\(O(dkD^k)\\), where \\(d\\) is the density, \\(D\\) is the dimensionality, and \\(k\\) is the polynomial degree, representing a significant improvement over the standard \\(O(D^k)\\) approach. The algorithm leverages the sparsity of the data, avoiding unnecessary computations for zero-product combinations, and introduces mappings for higher-order polynomial interactions. The authors provide both theoretical complexity analysis and empirical results to support their claims.\nDecision: Accept\nKey reasons for this decision are the novelty of the proposed algorithm and its practical utility. The paper addresses a well-defined problem in polynomial feature expansion for sparse matrices, an area with significant industrial relevance. The proposed method demonstrates clear improvements in computational efficiency, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation. Additionally, the work is well-motivated and grounded in existing literature, with appropriate citations.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The algorithm introduces a novel approach to polynomial feature expansion that directly operates on CSR matrices, eliminating the need for densification. This is a meaningful contribution, as it addresses a long-standing inefficiency in handling sparse data for feature engineering tasks.\n2. Theoretical and Empirical Validation: The authors provide a clear derivation of the algorithm's time complexity and validate it empirically against the standard method implemented in scikit-learn. The results convincingly demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method with respect to matrix density and its superior performance.\n3. Practical Utility: The algorithm has direct applications in machine learning and statistics, particularly in scenarios where sparse data is prevalent. Its ability to handle higher-order polynomial expansions efficiently makes it a valuable tool for practitioners.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, such as the construction of mappings for higher-order interactions, could benefit from clearer explanations or illustrative examples. This would make the work more accessible to a broader audience.\n2. Empirical Comparisons: The empirical evaluation is robust, but it would be helpful to include comparisons with other sparse matrix libraries or frameworks beyond scikit-learn to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the algorithm's performance.\n3. Limitations: The paper briefly acknowledges that the areas it addresses are not \"en vogue,\" but it would benefit from a more explicit discussion of potential limitations, such as the algorithm's applicability to extremely high-dimensional data or its dependence on specific sparse matrix formats.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the algorithm perform on extremely high-dimensional sparse matrices (e.g., \\(D > 10^6\\))? Are there practical memory or computational constraints that arise in such cases?\n2. Could the proposed method be extended to other sparse matrix formats, such as compressed sparse column (CSC) or coordinate (COO)? If so, what modifications would be required?\n3. The empirical results show a language implementation difference with scikit-learn. Could you clarify the programming language or framework used for your implementation, and whether this difference might affect the generalizability of the results?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and should be accepted for presentation at the conference. The proposed algorithm is both innovative and practically useful, with potential for significant impact in machine learning and related areas."
