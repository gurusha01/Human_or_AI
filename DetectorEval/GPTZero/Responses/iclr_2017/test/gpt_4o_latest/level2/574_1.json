            "inputText": "The paper presents a large-scale visual search system for fashion products, leveraging deep learning techniques to address the challenging problem of defining and identifying similarity among fashion items. The authors propose a novel approach by modeling fashion-product similarity through a combination of over 90 fashion-related attributes, which are learned using a ResCeption-LSTM-based framework. These attributes are further utilized in an inverted indexing scheme to enable efficient and scalable retrieval. The system also incorporates ROI-based visual feature extraction for enhanced similarity detection. The contributions include the creation of a large-scale fashion-attribute dataset, the application of RNNs for multi-label classification, and the integration of guided attribute-sequence generation and ROI detection for practical e-commerce use cases.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its practical relevance, technical novelty, and rigorous empirical evaluation. The key reasons for this decision are the innovative application of deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTM for multi-label classification) to a real-world problem and the comprehensive system design that bridges computer vision and e-commerce.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a novel application of RNNs for modeling dependencies among fashion attributes, which is a significant departure from traditional multi-label classification methods. The use of ResCeption as a vision encoder and the integration of guided attribute-sequence generation further enhance the system's practicality and scalability.\n2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental results, including precision and recall metrics for attribute recognition, mAP for ROI detection, and retrieval performance on large-scale datasets. The results demonstrate the system's effectiveness and competitive performance compared to existing methods.\n3. Practical Relevance: The work addresses a pressing need in the e-commerce industry, where fashion-product search is a critical application. The system's ability to handle user-guided queries and its scalability to millions of images make it highly impactful.\nAdditional Feedback:\n1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the technical details are thorough, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of certain components, such as the ResCeption architecture and the rationale behind specific design choices (e.g., binarization of features). Simplifying some sections would make the work more accessible to a broader audience.\n2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed system. For example, the reliance on textual meta-information for certain queries may introduce biases or errors. Additionally, the scalability of the system to even larger datasets or its performance under real-world noisy conditions could be explored further.\n3. Comparison with Baselines: While the paper mentions competitive results, a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods in fashion-product search would strengthen the claims. Including ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components (e.g., ResCeption vs. other encoders) would also be valuable.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the system handle cases where the textual meta-information is incomplete or incorrect? Could this impact the retrieval accuracy?\n2. Can you elaborate on the trade-offs involved in using simple thresholding for feature binarization? Are there alternative methods that could improve performance without compromising scalability?\n3. How does the system perform in scenarios where the query image contains multiple fashion items? Is there a mechanism to prioritize or disambiguate between items?\nOverall, the paper presents a well-motivated and technically sound solution to a relevant problem, with clear potential for practical impact. Addressing the feedback and questions above could further strengthen the work."
