            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach for next-frame video prediction by modeling transformations between frames rather than directly predicting pixel values. This transformation-based approach aims to produce sharper results while being computationally efficient. Additionally, the paper introduces a new evaluation protocol that measures the preservation of discriminative features in generated frames by using a pre-trained classifier, addressing the limitations of traditional pixel-space MSE metrics. The method is validated on the UCF-101 dataset, where it outperforms more complex models in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, presents a novel approach, and introduces a meaningful evaluation protocol. The key reasons for acceptance are: (1) the innovative use of transformation space for video prediction, which addresses common issues like blurriness in pixel-space predictions, and (2) the introduction of a practical evaluation metric that aligns better with real-world use cases. The results demonstrate competitive performance on benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency, making the approach both impactful and accessible.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The transformation-based prediction model is a significant departure from traditional pixel-space approaches. By leveraging affine transformations, the method reduces model complexity and computational cost while maintaining sharpness in generated frames. The proposed evaluation protocol is also a valuable contribution, as it shifts the focus from pixel-perfect reconstruction to preserving discriminative features, which is more aligned with practical applications.\n2. Experimental Validation: The paper provides thorough experiments on both synthetic (moving MNIST) and real-world (UCF-101) datasets. The qualitative and quantitative results support the claims, demonstrating that the proposed model produces plausible sequences and outperforms baselines, including more sophisticated adversarial models, in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency.\n3. Practical Usefulness: The approach is computationally efficient, requiring fewer parameters and operations compared to state-of-the-art methods. This makes it suitable for real-world applications where resource constraints are a concern.\nAdditional Feedback\n1. Limitations and Future Work: While the paper acknowledges limitations, such as the underestimation of motion due to the MSE criterion and the lack of separation between appearance and motion, it would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential solutions. For example, the authors could elaborate on how adversarial training or multi-scale architectures could address these issues.\n2. Evaluation Protocol: The proposed evaluation metric is compelling, but its dependence on a pre-trained classifier raises questions about generalizability. Would the results hold if a different classifier or task were used? Providing additional experiments with alternative classifiers could strengthen the argument.\n3. Reproducibility: While the method is described in detail, the paper would benefit from releasing code or providing more implementation details, particularly for the affine transformation extraction and prediction steps.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the model handle scenarios with significant occlusions or complex motions that cannot be well-represented by affine transformations? Are there plans to extend the approach to handle such cases?\n2. Have you considered evaluating the model on other datasets or tasks to assess its generalizability beyond UCF-101?\n3. Could the proposed evaluation protocol be adapted for other generative tasks, such as image synthesis or 3D motion prediction?\nOverall, the paper presents a strong contribution to the field of video prediction and generative modeling. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, practical relevance, and experimental rigor make it a valuable addition to the conference."
