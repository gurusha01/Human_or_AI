            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper investigates the integration of eligibility traces with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the context of deep reinforcement learning (RL), specifically in the Atari domain. The authors demonstrate that eligibility traces, which balance the bias-variance trade-off in RL, can significantly accelerate learning by propagating rewards across multiple timesteps in a single update. The paper further explores the impact of different optimization methods (RMSprop and Adam) on training performance. Through experiments on two Atari games, Pong and Tennis, the authors show that eligibility traces improve learning stability and performance, while Adam accelerates learning compared to RMSprop. The paper also highlights the importance of hyperparameters and optimization strategies in achieving optimal results.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel exploration of eligibility traces in combination with RNNs, its empirical rigor, and its practical insights into optimization strategies. The key reasons for this decision are:\n1. Novelty and Significance: The integration of eligibility traces with RNNs in deep RL is a relatively unexplored area, and the paper provides clear evidence of its benefits in sparse-reward and partially observable environments.\n2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, with comparisons across multiple configurations (e.g., with/without traces, RMSprop vs. Adam) and detailed analyses of results.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Support for Claims: The experimental results convincingly support the claims. For example, the use of eligibility traces led to faster and more stable learning in Pong, while Adam significantly accelerated learning in both games. The authors also provide plausible explanations for observed phenomena, such as the role of eligibility traces in propagating delayed rewards in Tennis.\n2. Practical Usefulness: The findings are practically useful for RL practitioners, especially those working on environments with sparse rewards or partial observability. The insights into optimization strategies (e.g., Adam's advantages) are also valuable.\n3. Field Knowledge and Completeness: The paper demonstrates a solid understanding of RL concepts and prior literature, with appropriate citations. The methodology is described in sufficient detail to enable reproducibility.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: While the authors discuss the impact of hyperparameters (e.g., frozen network update frequency), more systematic experiments on their sensitivity could strengthen the conclusions.\n2. Broader Evaluation: The experiments are limited to two Atari games. Testing on additional games, especially those with different reward structures, would enhance the generalizability of the findings.\n3. Clarity of Presentation: Some sections, particularly the mathematical formulations, could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for readers less familiar with eligibility traces.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How do eligibility traces perform in partially observable environments, given that the experiments were conducted on fully observable games?\n2. Did you explore alternative values of 位 (e.g., 0.5 or 0.9) to assess the sensitivity of the results to this parameter?\n3. Could the observed instability in models without traces (e.g., in Tennis) be mitigated by alternative regularization techniques or reward shaping?\nConclusion\nThis paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of deep RL by demonstrating the benefits of eligibility traces combined with RNNs and providing practical insights into optimization strategies. While there is room for further exploration and broader evaluation, the work is robust, well-motivated, and impactful. It is a valuable addition to the conference."
