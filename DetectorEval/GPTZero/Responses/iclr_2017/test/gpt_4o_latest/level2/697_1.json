            "inputText": "The paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing the Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model using a Riemannian optimization framework. The authors reformulate SGNS training as a two-step process: first, optimizing the SGNS objective over a low-rank matrix, and second, deriving word and context embeddings from the optimized matrix. The key contribution lies in applying Riemannian optimization to directly optimize the SGNS objective under a low-rank constraint, which addresses limitations in existing methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and SVD over SPPMI matrices. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in terms of both the SGNS objective and linguistic metrics across multiple datasets.\nDecision: Accept\nThe primary reasons for this decision are the novelty of the approach and its demonstrated effectiveness. The paper introduces a well-motivated reformulation of SGNS training, leveraging Riemannian optimization to address known issues in existing methods. The experimental results convincingly show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on most linguistic similarity tasks, particularly at higher dimensionalities. This indicates both the validity and practical utility of the approach.\nSupporting Arguments:\n1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper identifies a critical limitation in existing SGNS optimization methods窶馬amely, the conflation of optimizing the SGNS objective and deriving embeddings. By separating these steps and applying Riemannian optimization, the authors provide a principled solution that is novel and well-grounded in optimization theory.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct thorough experiments on a widely used corpus and evaluate their method against strong baselines. The results consistently highlight the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in achieving higher SGNS objective values and improved linguistic correlations.\n3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology and experimental setup. The inclusion of source code further enhances reproducibility.\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Step 2 Optimization: While the paper focuses on Step 1, a more detailed exploration of Step 2 (deriving embeddings from the low-rank matrix) could strengthen the work. The authors acknowledge this as future work, but even a preliminary analysis or discussion would be valuable.\n2. Computational Efficiency: The paper mentions that the projector-splitting algorithm is computationally efficient, but a detailed comparison of runtime and scalability with SGD and SVD methods would provide a more complete picture of the method's practicality.\n3. Broader Evaluation: The evaluation focuses on semantic similarity tasks. Including additional downstream tasks, such as text classification or machine translation, would demonstrate the broader applicability of the embeddings.\nQuestions for the Authors:\n1. How does the choice of initialization (e.g., SVD-SPPMI embeddings) impact the performance of the Riemannian optimization process? Could other initialization strategies yield further improvements?\n2. Can the proposed method handle larger vocabularies or corpora efficiently, given the computational complexity of Riemannian optimization?\n3. Have you explored alternative retraction methods or step size tuning strategies to further enhance convergence and performance?\nOverall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of word embeddings and optimization, with clear potential for further development and application."
