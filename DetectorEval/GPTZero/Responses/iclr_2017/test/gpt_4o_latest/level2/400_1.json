            "inputText": "Review of the Paper\nSummary of Contributions\nThis paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, the Doubly Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN), designed specifically for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The DRNN incorporates two distinct recurrence mechanisms: one for depth-wise (ancestral) relationships and another for width-wise (fraternal) relationships, enabling it to model hierarchical structures effectively. A key innovation is the explicit modeling of tree topology, decoupling topological decisions from label prediction, which eliminates the need for artificial padding tokens. The authors evaluate the DRNN in three tasks: recovering tree structures from flattened strings, mapping natural language sentences to functional programs, and machine translation. The results demonstrate the DRNN's effectiveness in recovering latent tree structures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in certain tasks, and exhibiting desirable properties such as coarse-to-fine generation and robustness to structural variations.\nDecision: Accept\nThe paper is well-motivated, presents a novel and significant contribution to tree-structured decoding, and provides strong experimental evidence to support its claims. The DRNN architecture is innovative and addresses key limitations of existing methods, such as reliance on artificial tokens for tree topology prediction. The experimental results are compelling, particularly in the synthetic tree recovery and IFTTT program mapping tasks, where the DRNN outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art methods. The paper also demonstrates potential for broader applications, such as machine translation, despite being a preliminary exploration in that domain.\nSupporting Arguments\n1. Novelty and Innovation: The DRNN architecture is a significant improvement over existing tree decoders. Its explicit modeling of tree topology and separate handling of depth and width recurrences are novel and address key challenges in tree-structured decoding.\n2. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides thorough evaluations across multiple tasks, demonstrating the DRNN's effectiveness in recovering tree structures and mapping natural language to programs. The metrics used (e.g., F1-scores for tree recovery) are appropriate and provide a nuanced understanding of performance.\n3. Practical Usefulness: The DRNN's ability to generate tree structures from scratch and its application to program synthesis and machine translation suggest practical utility in a variety of domains.\n4. Clarity and Completeness: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the architecture, training procedures, and experimental setups. The inclusion of synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the evaluation.\nSuggestions for Improvement\n1. Scalability: While the paper mentions the potential for GPU-based batch processing, it does not provide experimental evidence of scalability to larger datasets or more complex tasks. Future work should explore this aspect.\n2. Comparison with More Baselines: The evaluation could benefit from comparisons with additional state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the machine translation task, where the DRNN's performance is only qualitatively assessed.\n3. Ablation Studies: An ablation study to isolate the contributions of the depth and width recurrences, as well as the explicit topology prediction mechanism, would provide deeper insights into the architecture's effectiveness.\n4. Limitations: While the paper acknowledges some limitations, such as exposure bias during training, a more detailed discussion of the challenges and potential failure cases of the DRNN would be helpful.\nQuestions for the Authors\n1. How does the DRNN perform on larger-scale datasets or more complex tasks, such as full-scale machine translation or parsing real-world hierarchical data?\n2. Can the DRNN be extended to handle graph-structured data, where nodes may have multiple parents or more complex relationships?\n3. How sensitive is the DRNN to hyperparameter choices, particularly the decay parameters for depth and width in tree topology prediction?\nOverall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of tree-structured decoding and presents a promising direction for future research. The DRNN architecture is innovative, well-motivated, and supported by rigorous experimentation. With minor improvements and further exploration, this work has the potential to become a foundational approach in the domain."
