            "inputText": "The paper presents a method for semi-supervised learning on graphs that leverages the spectral properties of the graph within a convolutional neural network framework. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and demonstrates strong scalability on large datasets. Comparisons with baseline methods across multiple datasets reveal a significant improvement in performance using the proposed technique.\nThe paper is technically sound and well-written. The algorithm appears to scale effectively, and the results across datasets show clear advantages over the baselines. The method is straightforward, and the training process seems uncomplicated. Regarding originality, the proposed algorithm is essentially a straightforward adaptation of graph convolutional networks (as introduced in Defferrard et al., 2016) to a semi-supervised transductive learning setting. While this is explicitly acknowledged in the paper, the authors could better emphasize the distinctions and novel contributions relative to this prior work. Additionally, the paper does not include comparisons with iterative classification methods, which are known to perform well in terms of both accuracy and training efficiency, particularly in inductive settings. The authors should consider addressing this gap. Below, I provide some references for iterative classification methods that could be relevant for comparison.\nThe authors note that more complex filters could be learned by stacking additional layers but restrict their architecture to a single hidden layer. They should discuss the potential benefits and trade-offs of using deeper architectures for graph classification tasks.\nReferences on iterative classification: \n- Qing Lu and Lise Getoor. 2003.
