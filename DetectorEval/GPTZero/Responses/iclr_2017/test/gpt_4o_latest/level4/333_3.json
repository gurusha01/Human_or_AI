This paper delves into the question of which types of deep or shallow networks are most effective within this framework. A key finding is that very shallow networks, comprising a single filter bank with random weights, perform unexpectedly well. For simple and regular textures, these shallow networks may even produce results that are visually superior to those generated by more complex, data-adapted filters, such as those in architectures like VGG-19. More broadly, the paper offers an insightful and detailed discussion on the strengths and limitations of such methods for texture synthesis.\nFigure 4 illustrates that optimising images with respect to shallow filter banks can yield texture images with a lower VGG-19 loss compared to directly optimising the VGG-19 objective. This result is attributed to the challenges of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19 cost function, which is a plausible explanation. In the newly added supplementary material, the authors demonstrate that better optimisation outcomes can be achieved by using the results of shallow network optimisation as an initialisation for VGG-19-based optimisation. This addition usefully complements the original experiments.\nThe primary limitation of the paper is its lack of a systematic comparison of different methods against a quantifiable objective. It is straightforward to define image statistics that could trivially generate an exact replica of any reference texture, thereby achieving high visual quality. Such trivial statistics would also be very shallow. However, the goal is to capture a texture distribution, and evaluating how well a method addresses this challenge remains an unresolved issue. While the empirical results support the intuition that simple statistics suffice for texture synthesis in terms of both quality and diversity (relative to more complex statistics), it is challenging to conclusively validate this claim.\nThe authors propose that diversity could be quantified using entropy, which is a reasonable suggestion but, as they acknowledge in their responses to questions, difficult to implement in practice. Moreover, this approach would not address the other critical aspect of the problem: visual quality. They also suggest conducting a psychophysical assessment, which may be the most practical way to tackle this challenge, but they consider this to be beyond the scope of the current work and better suited for future research.\nIn conclusion, given the inherent difficulty of evaluating image generation methods, I believe the paper possesses sufficient merit to justify publication at ICLR. Nonetheless, incorporating some form of psychophysical assessment would strengthen the validation of the intuitions, which currently rely solely on visual inspection of the figures presented in the paper and supplementary material."
