The method seems\npotentially quite interesting but the paper has serious problems in\nthe presentation.\nQuality:\nThe method relies mainly on techniques presented in a NIPS 2015 paper\nby (mostly) the same authors. The experimental procedure should be\nclarified further. The results (especially Table 2) seem to depend\ncritically upon the sparsity of the reported clusters, but the authors\ndo not explain in sufficient detail how the sparsity hyperparameter is\ndetermined.\nClarity:\nThe style of writing is terrible and completely unacceptable as a\nscientific publication. The text looks more like an industry white\npaper or advertisement, not an objective scientific paper. A complete\nrewrite would be needed before the paper can be considered for\npublication. Specifically, all references to companies using your\nmethods must be deleted.\nAdditionally, Table 1 is essentially unreadable. I would recommend\nusing a figure or cleaning up the table by removing all engineering\nnotation and reporting numbers per 1000 so that e.g. \"0.475 +/- 9e-4\"\nwould become \"475 +/- 0.9\". In general figures would be preferred as a\nprimary means for presenting the results in text while tables can be\nincluded as supplementary information.\nOriginality:\nThe novelty of the work appears limited: the method is mostly based on\na NIPS 2015 paper by the same authors. The experimental evaluation\nappears at least partially novel, but for example the IBD detection is\nvery similar to Hochreiter (2013) but without any comparison.\nSignificance:\nThe authors' strongest claim is based on strong empirical performance\nin their own benchmark problems. It is however unclear how useful this\nwould be to others as there is no code available and the details of\nthe implementation are less than complete. Furthermore, the method\ndepends on many specific tuning parameters whose tuning method is not\nfully defined, leaving it unclear how to guarantee the generalisation\nof the good performance."
