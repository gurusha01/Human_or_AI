This manuscript presents a novel deterministic approach to dependency parsing, evaluating its performance across multiple languages. The algorithm's foundation lies in a predefined set of rules that dictate permissible dependencies based on part-of-speech (POS) tags. It initiates by employing a slightly biased PageRank algorithm on a graph where edges are defined by these permitted dependencies, thereby ranking the words. As the algorithm progresses through this ranking, each word is connected to the nearest word that maintains a tree structure, adheres to the head rules, and satisfies a directionality constraint.
The paper is engaging and well-structured, although it bears a resemblance to previous work, notably Sogaard (2012), "Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Training", with only minor distinctions. Several aspects warrant further clarification and consideration:
The head rules outlined in Table 1 would benefit from a more in-depth analysis in the context of the corpus. For instance, while Section 3.1 acknowledges that these rules do not always yield a connected graph, it lacks specifics on the frequency of such occurrences and the typical size of the resulting components.
The choice to determine head direction using test data, rather than training or development data, is noteworthy. Although the decision converges rapidly (within 10-15 sentences), making it a minor concern, it is an unexpected approach.
The mechanism for resolving ties among words with identical PageRank scores is not clearly explained. It would be useful to understand whether this affects performance significantly or if such ties are rare enough to be negligible.
The various constraints (head rules, directionality, and distance) impose upper limits on the system's potential performance. Including oracle results for each constraint would provide valuable insights into their impact on the maximum achievable score. This would be particularly beneficial for guiding future modifications to the system by identifying areas of potential improvement.
Minor observations include:
- In Section 4.1, the phrase "we obtain [the] rank" could be rephrased for clarity.
- The column order in Table 5 and Table 7 differs; the arrangement in Table 7 is more intuitive.
- Section 6.1 contains the phrase "isolate the [contribution] of both", which could be slightly reworded for better readability.
