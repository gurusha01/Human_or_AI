The authors have presented an unsupervised approach for Universal Dependencies, eliminating the need for training data. This method leverages PageRank for word tagging, supplemented by a limited set of predefined rules. The paper is meticulously crafted, providing a thorough explanation of the underlying concepts and the rationale behind the incorporation of prior knowledge into the model. In my opinion, the contribution makes a significant impact in the domain of unsupervised parsing, and the potential avenues for future research outlined by the authors pave the way for further investigation.
