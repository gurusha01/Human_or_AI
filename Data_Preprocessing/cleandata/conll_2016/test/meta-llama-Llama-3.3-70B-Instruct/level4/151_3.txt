This paper proposes a method for parsing trees, specifically universal dependency treebanks, using solely part-of-speech (POS) tags and a modified PageRank algorithm that prioritizes meaningful words over stop words.
The concept presented is intriguing, although it bears a strong resemblance to the work of Søgaard (2012). The introduction of a personalization factor that assigns greater weight to the primary predicate is a notable aspect, but its potential could be further explored. Upon examination, the personalization appears to be limited to the main predicate, with an assigned weight of 5 that seems somewhat arbitrary.
In terms of evaluation and detailed analysis, the inclusion of charts would have enhanced the clarity of the results, as the tables can be difficult to interpret at times. Additionally, providing the scores of the POS tagging in prediction mode would have allowed for an assessment of the correlation between the degradation in parsing performance and the degradation in tagging performance, which is a expected relationship.
Overall, while the paper is interesting, its contribution beyond the work of Søgaard (2012) is relatively modest.
