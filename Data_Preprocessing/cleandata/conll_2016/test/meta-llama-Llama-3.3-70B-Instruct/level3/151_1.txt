This paper presents a novel unsupervised dependency parsing algorithm, UDP, which utilizes a combination of personalized PageRank and a set of head-dependent rules to analyze sentence structures across various languages. The algorithm's core mechanism involves ranking words using a biased PageRank and linking each word to the closest word that maintains a tree, following head rules and directionality constraints.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The development of a linguistically sound unsupervised parsing algorithm that requires no training data and is competitive with a delexicalized transfer system.
2. The incorporation of personalized PageRank to improve main predicate identification and the use of a small set of head-dependent rules to define permitted dependencies based on POS tags.
3. The evaluation of the parser on 32 languages, demonstrating its robustness to domain change across languages.
The strengths of this submission are:
1. The parser's ability to achieve competitive performance on all but two UD languages, despite requiring no training data.
2. The use of a simple and linguistically sound rule-based approach, which makes the parser less sensitive to sampling bias and more resilient to domain changes.
3. The evaluation of the parser on three POS setups and across domains, providing a comprehensive understanding of its performance.
The weaknesses of this submission are:
1. The lack of novelty in the algorithm, as it builds upon existing work on rule-aided unsupervised dependency parsing, such as SÃ¸gaard (2012).
2. The need for further analysis of the head rules in relation to the corpus, including frequency and component size when they fail to produce a connected graph.
3. The unclear tie-breaking mechanism for words with the same PageRank score, which may impact the parser's performance.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of novelty in the algorithm, and what potential improvements or extensions could be made to make the parser more distinct from existing work?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the head rules and their relation to the corpus, including frequency and component size, to better understand the parser's behavior?
3. How do the authors plan to clarify the tie-breaking mechanism for words with the same PageRank score, and what impact do they expect this to have on the parser's performance?
