This paper presents an unsupervised dependency parser, UDP, which utilizes a modified PageRank algorithm and a set of head-dependent rules to parse sentences. The parser requires no training data and is competitive with a delexicalized transfer system. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The introduction of a personalized PageRank approach to prioritize meaningful words over stop words, 
2. The use of a small set of head-dependent rules to ensure the leaf status of function words, and 
3. The estimation of adposition direction directly from test data.
The strengths of this paper include: 
1. The parser's ability to achieve competitive performance on all but two UD languages, 
2. Its robustness to domain changes, as evidenced by its lower standard deviation across domains compared to the MSD system, and 
3. Its ability to outperform the MSD system on certain domains, such as Italian.
However, the weaknesses of this paper include: 
1. The lack of novelty in the method, as it builds upon previous work by SÃ¸gaard (2012), 
2. The absence of scores for POS tagging in prediction mode, making it difficult to determine the correlation between parsing and tagging performance, and 
3. The need for improvement in evaluation and analysis, such as the addition of charts to supplement the tables and provide clearer insights.
Some questions to the authors include: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of error propagation from POS tagging to dependency parsing, 
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis on the performance of the parser on different parts of speech, and 
3. How do the authors plan to extend the parser to handle more complex linguistic phenomena, such as multiword expressions and coordination. 
Overall, this paper presents a solid contribution to the field of unsupervised dependency parsing, and with some improvements, it has the potential to be a robust and competitive system.
