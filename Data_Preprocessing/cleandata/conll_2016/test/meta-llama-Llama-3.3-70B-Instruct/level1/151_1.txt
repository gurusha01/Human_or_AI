This paper presents UDP, an unsupervised dependency parser for Universal Dependencies (UD) that leverages personalized PageRank and a small set of head-dependent rules. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Development of a linguistically sound unsupervised parser: The authors propose a parser that requires no training data and relies solely on explicit part-of-speech (POS) constraints imposed by UD.
2. Effective use of personalized PageRank: The authors utilize personalized PageRank to score content words, which improves the parser's performance, particularly in identifying the main predicate of a sentence.
3. Robustness to domain change: The parser demonstrates increased stability to domain change across languages, outperforming a multi-source delexicalized parser (MSD) in some cases.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Competitive performance: UDP achieves competitive performance on all but two UD languages, and even outperforms MSD on Hindi.
2. Robustness to POS tag quality: The parser is less affected by deteriorating POS tags than MSD, with an average drop of 2.2% in performance when using predicted POS tags.
3. Domain robustness: UDP shows higher stability across domains compared to MSD, with a lower standard deviation in performance across languages.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. Limited handling of complex linguistic phenomena: The parser does not handle multiword expressions, coordination, and proper names, which may limit its performance on certain languages or domains.
2. Dependence on UD constraints: The parser relies heavily on the constraints imposed by UD, which may not be applicable to all languages or linguistic formalisms.
3. Room for improvement in edge labeling: The authors only consider unlabeled attachment, and augmenting the system with partial edge labeling could further improve its performance.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the parser to handle more complex linguistic phenomena, such as multiword expressions and coordination?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the performance of the parser on languages with limited resources or non-standard linguistic structures?
3. How do the authors envision the integration of UDP with other NLP tasks, such as semantic role labeling or machine translation?
