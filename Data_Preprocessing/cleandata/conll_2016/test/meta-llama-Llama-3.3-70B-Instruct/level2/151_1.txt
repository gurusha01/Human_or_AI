Summary of the Paper
The paper presents UDP, an unsupervised dependency parser for Universal Dependencies (UD) that uses personalized PageRank and a small set of head-dependent rules. The parser requires no training data and estimates adposition direction directly from test data. The authors evaluate UDP on 32 languages and compare its performance to a multi-source delexicalized parser (MSD). The results show that UDP is competitive with MSD and even outperforms it on some languages.
Main Contributions
1. Unsupervised Dependency Parsing: The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised dependency parsing that uses personalized PageRank and head-dependent rules to parse sentences without requiring any training data.
2. Competitive Performance: The authors demonstrate that UDP achieves competitive performance with MSD on most languages, and even outperforms it on some languages.
3. Robustness to Domain Change: The paper shows that UDP is more resilient to domain changes than MSD, with a lower standard deviation in performance across different domains.
Strengths
1. Novel Approach: The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised dependency parsing that combines personalized PageRank and head-dependent rules.
2. Competitive Performance: The authors demonstrate that UDP achieves competitive performance with MSD on most languages.
3. Robustness to Domain Change: The paper shows that UDP is more resilient to domain changes than MSD, making it a more reliable parser for real-world applications.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Coverage: The paper only evaluates UDP on 32 languages, and it is unclear how well the parser will perform on other languages.
2. Simplistic Head-Dependent Rules: The paper uses a small set of head-dependent rules, which may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of linguistic structures in all languages.
3. No Handling of Multiword Expressions: The paper does not address how UDP handles multiword expressions, which can be a challenging task in dependency parsing.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to extend UDP to handle multiword expressions and other complex linguistic structures?
2. Can you provide more details on how you selected the head-dependent rules used in UDP?
3. How do you think UDP can be improved to achieve even better performance on languages where it currently underperforms?
