Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a model for event coreference resolution that utilizes sentential features from convolutional neural networks, eliminating the need for external semantic features. The model consists of two parts: the first part generates a representation for a single event mention, and the second part calculates a coreference score for a pair of event mentions. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, including a publicly available one.
Main Contributions
1. The paper proposes a novel approach to event coreference resolution that uses sentential features from convolutional neural networks, which does not rely on external semantic features.
2. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, including a publicly available one.
3. The paper provides an error analysis that highlights the challenges of the task, including pronoun resolution and boundary cases.
Strengths
1. The paper presents a novel and effective approach to event coreference resolution that eliminates the need for external semantic features.
2. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.
3. The error analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges of the task and potential areas for improvement.
Weaknesses
1. The paper relies heavily on the quality of the event mention recognition and argument identification, which may not always be accurate.
2. The model may not perform well on datasets with limited training data or diverse domains.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art models, which would be helpful for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the model handle cases where the event mention recognition or argument identification is inaccurate?
2. Can the model be adapted to handle cross-document event coreference resolution?
3. How does the model perform on datasets with limited training data or diverse domains?
