This paper introduces a method for parsing trees (specifically, the universal dependency treebanks) that relies solely on POS tags and employs a modified version of PageRank to assign greater importance to meaningful words (as opposed to stop words).
The proposed approach is intriguing, though it bears strong resemblance to the work presented in SÃ¸gaard (2012). The use of a personalization factor to assign more weight to the main predicate is a nice touch, but it could have been further developed. From what I understand, the personalization is applied exclusively to the main predicate, and the choice of a weight of 5 appears somewhat arbitrary.
In terms of evaluation and detailed analysis, the inclusion of charts would have been helpful, as the tables alone make it difficult at times to grasp the key insights. Additionally, it would have been valuable to report the POS tagging scores in prediction mode to determine whether the observed degradation in parsing performance is strongly linked to a decline in tagging performance (as one might expect).
Overall, the paper is interesting, but the contribution beyond SÃ¸gaard (2012) is relatively modest.
