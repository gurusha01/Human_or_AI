This paper introduces a novel deterministic dependency parsing algorithm and examines its performance across multiple languages. 
The algorithm's foundation lies in a set of rules that define allowable dependencies based on POS tags. It begins by ranking words using a slightly biased PageRank applied to a graph where edges are determined by the permitted dependencies. Progressing through the ranking, each word is connected to the nearest word that maintains a tree structure and adheres to both the head rules and a directionality constraint.
In general, the paper is engaging and well-written, though it appears to differ only marginally from Sogaard (2012), "Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Training." Below are my questions and suggestions:
Head Rules (Table 1): An analysis of these rules in relation to the corpus would be beneficial. For instance, section 3.1 mentions that the rules do not always produce a connected graph, but the frequency of this occurrence and the typical size of the resulting components are not discussed.
I found it surprising that head direction was determined using the test data rather than the training or development data. While this decision converges quickly (within 10-15 sentences) and does not pose a major issue, it is an unconventional choice.
How are ties resolved when words have the same PageRank score? Does tie-breaking significantly affect performance, or are ties infrequent enough to have negligible impact?
The constraints employed (head rules, directionality, distance) inherently impose upper bounds on the system's performance. Including oracle results for each constraint would be insightful, as it would illustrate the extent to which each constraint limits the maximum achievable score. This would also provide valuable guidance for future work on improving the system.
Minor Comments:
- Section 4.1: "we obtain [the] rank"
- Tables 5 and 7: The column order differs between these tables. The arrangement in Table 7 is clearer and more intuitive.
- Section 6.1: "isolate the [contribution] of both"
