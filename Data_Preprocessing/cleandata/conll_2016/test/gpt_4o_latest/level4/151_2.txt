The authors present an unsupervised algorithm for Universal Dependencies that operates without the need for training. The proposed tagging approach leverages PageRank for word ranking alongside a minimal set of hard-coded rules.  
The paper is well-written, highly detailed, and provides a clear explanation of the rationale behind the incorporation of prior information into the model.  
I believe the contribution is significant to the domain of unsupervised parsing, and the future research directions outlined by the authors open up promising avenues for further investigation.
