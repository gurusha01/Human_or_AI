Review
The paper presents UDP, an unsupervised dependency parser for Universal Dependencies (UD) that relies on POS tags and a modified PageRank algorithm. The method incorporates a small set of dependency head rules and estimates adposition directionality directly from test data. While the approach is linguistically sound and robust to domain changes, it offers only incremental improvements over prior work, particularly Søgaard (2012), which it closely resembles.
Summary and Contributions
1. Primary Contribution: The use of personalized PageRank for main predicate identification is a novel addition to rule-based unsupervised parsing. However, the personalization factor (e.g., weighting the first verb) feels arbitrary and underdeveloped.
2. Secondary Contribution: The system's reliance on UD constraints, such as treating function words as leaves, is a practical and linguistically grounded approach.
3. Tertiary Contribution: The parser's ability to estimate adposition directionality on the fly using test data is a useful feature, especially for low-resource languages.
Strengths
1. Robustness to Domain Change: UDP demonstrates resilience to domain shifts, outperforming a supervised multi-source delexicalized parser (MSD) in certain setups, such as Hindi. This robustness is a significant strength, particularly for low-resource or cross-domain applications.
2. Simplicity and Efficiency: The parser is lightweight, requiring no training data, and its reliance on a small set of rules makes it interpretable and easy to implement.
3. Evaluation on Multiple Setups: The authors evaluate UDP across 32 languages and three POS tagging scenarios (gold, predicted, and naive), providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and error propagation.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty: The method closely resembles Søgaard (2012), with the primary innovation being the use of PageRank personalization. However, this addition feels underexplored, and its impact on performance is marginal.
2. Evaluation Clarity: The results are presented in dense tables, which are difficult to interpret. Including visualizations, such as charts, would enhance clarity and accessibility.
3. POS Tagging Correlation: The paper does not analyze the correlation between POS tagging accuracy and parsing performance degradation in sufficient detail. Including POS tagging scores in prediction mode would provide valuable insights.
4. Arbitrary Design Choices: The personalization factor for PageRank (e.g., weighting the first verb five times more) appears arbitrary and lacks theoretical justification or empirical tuning.
5. Typographical Error: There is a minor typo on line 207 ("The the main idea" → "The main idea").
Questions to Authors
1. How was the personalization factor for PageRank (e.g., weighting the first verb) determined? Could alternative weighting schemes improve performance?
2. Have you considered extending the method to handle multiword expressions or coordination? If so, what challenges do you foresee?
3. Could you provide a more detailed analysis of the correlation between POS tagging accuracy and parsing performance degradation?
Recommendation
While the paper presents an interesting approach and demonstrates robustness to domain changes, its limited novelty and underdeveloped aspects of the proposed method reduce its overall impact. I recommend acceptance as a poster, contingent on addressing the clarity and evaluation issues during the revision phase.
