Review
Summary and Contributions:
This paper presents UDP, an unsupervised dependency parser for Universal Dependencies (UD) that leverages personalized PageRank and a minimal set of hard-coded dependency head rules. The parser is entirely training-free and estimates key syntactic traits, such as adposition direction, directly from test data. The authors evaluate UDP across 32 languages and demonstrate its robustness to domain shifts, outperforming a multi-source delexicalized parser (MSD) on certain languages like Hindi. The paper also highlights UDP's resilience to noisy POS tagging and its ability to produce competitive results with minimal linguistic priors.
The key contributions of the paper are:
1. Novel Unsupervised Parsing Approach: The use of personalized PageRank for ranking content words and a two-step decoding algorithm to enforce UD constraints (e.g., function words as leaves) is innovative and effective. This method advances rule-aided unsupervised dependency parsing.
2. Domain Robustness: The parser is shown to be less sensitive to domain shifts compared to supervised cross-lingual systems, making it a strong baseline for real-world multilingual parsing tasks.
3. Practicality and Accessibility: The system is entirely unsupervised, requiring no training data, and is freely available, making it accessible for low-resource languages and practical for diverse applications.
Strengths:
1. Significant Contribution to Unsupervised Parsing: UDP pushes the boundaries of unsupervised dependency parsing by achieving competitive results with minimal linguistic assumptions. Its reliance on UD constraints rather than language-specific parameters is a notable advancement.
2. Robustness to Domain and POS Variability: The parser demonstrates strong cross-domain consistency and resilience to noisy POS tags, outperforming MSD in terms of stability. This robustness is a key strength for practical applications in low-resource and domain-variant settings.
3. Well-Written and Detailed: The paper is clearly written, with a thorough explanation of the methodology, including the intuition behind the use of PageRank and the UD constraints. The experimental setup is comprehensive, covering multiple languages, POS scenarios, and domain shifts.
4. Opens Avenues for Future Research: By highlighting areas for improvement (e.g., handling multiword expressions and coordination), the paper provides a solid foundation for further exploration in unsupervised parsing.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Handling of Complex Linguistic Structures: While the parser performs well overall, it struggles with certain syntactic phenomena, such as relative clauses, coordination, and punctuation attachment. These limitations reduce its applicability for more complex parsing tasks.
2. Dependency on UD Formalism: The reliance on UD-specific constraints may limit the parser's adaptability to other syntactic frameworks or non-UD treebanks.
3. Evaluation on Labeled Parsing: The paper focuses solely on unlabeled attachment scores (UAS). Incorporating labeled attachment scores (LAS) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the parser's performance.
Questions to Authors:
1. How does the parser handle languages with significant syntactic divergence from the UD formalism, such as free word order languages?
2. Could the use of PageRank be extended to directly score dependency edges instead of words? If so, what challenges might arise in implementing this?
3. Have you considered incorporating partial edge labeling to evaluate the parser's potential for labeled parsing tasks?
Conclusion:
This paper makes a strong case for UDP as a robust and practical baseline for unsupervised dependency parsing. Its innovative use of personalized PageRank and minimal linguistic priors is a significant contribution to the field. While there are limitations in handling complex syntactic structures, the parser's robustness to domain shifts and noisy POS tagging makes it a valuable tool for multilingual and low-resource parsing scenarios. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.
