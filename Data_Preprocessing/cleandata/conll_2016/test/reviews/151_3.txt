This paper presents a way to parse trees (namely the universal dependency
treebanks) by relying only on POS and by using a modified version of the
PageRank to give more way to some meaningful words (as opposed to stop words).
This idea is interesting though very closed to what was done in SÃ¸gaard
(2012)'s paper. The personalization factor giving more weight to the main
predicate is nice but it would have been better to take it to the next level.
As far as I can tell, the personalization is solely used for the main predicate
and its weight of 5 seems arbitrary.
Regarding the evaluation and the detailed analyses, some charts would have been
beneficial, because it is sometimes hard to get the gist out of the tables.
Finally, it would have been interesting to get the scores of the POS tagging in
the prediction mode to be able to see if the degradation in parsing performance
is heavily correlated to the degradation in tagging performance (which is what
we expect).
All in all, the paper is interesting but the increment over the work of
SÃ¸gaard (2012) is small.
Smaller issues:
