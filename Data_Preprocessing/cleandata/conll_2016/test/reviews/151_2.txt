The authors proposed an unsupervised algorithm for Universal Dependencies that
does not require training. The tagging is based on PageRank for the words and a
small amount of hard-coded rules.
The article is well written, very detailed and the intuition behind all prior
information being added to the model is explained clearly.
I think that the contribution is substantial to the field of unsupervised
parsing, and the possibilities for future work presented by the authors give
rise to additional research.
