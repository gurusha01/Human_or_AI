Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper proposes a novel graph-based semi-supervised classification algorithm to tag word senses with temporal dimensions (past, present, future, or atemporal). The authors leverage WordNet's semantic structure and unlabeled data, breaking the task into two stages: binary classification (temporal vs. atemporal) and finer-grained classification (past, present, future). A key contribution is the full annotation of WordNet using both prior labeled data and crowd-sourced annotations, creating a fine-grained temporal lexical resource. The proposed method achieves an 11% accuracy improvement over Stanford's SUTime and prior works, using only 400 labeled examples. Additionally, the resource demonstrates a 10% F1 improvement in the TempEval-3 task, showcasing its extrinsic utility. The resource has significant potential for applications in NLP tasks such as temporal relation extraction, information retrieval, and clinical narrative analysis.
Strengths:  
1. Significant Performance Improvement: The proposed method achieves notable accuracy gains over state-of-the-art approaches, including SUTime and TempoWordNet, for both intrinsic evaluation (temporal tagging) and extrinsic evaluation (TempEval-3). The ability to outperform prior works with minimal labeled data highlights the efficiency and robustness of the graph-based semi-supervised approach.  
2. Resource Creation: The paper contributes a high-quality, fine-grained temporal lexical resource, which is a valuable addition to the NLP community. The resource's potential applications in diverse domains, such as clinical narratives and temporal information extraction, underscore its broader impact.  
3. Innovative Methodology: The use of a graph-based minimum cut framework, leveraging WordNet relations and unlabeled data, is a novel and flexible approach. The hierarchical strategy for finer-grained classification (past, present, future) is particularly effective.  
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, demonstrating the utility of the resource in real-world tasks. The feature ablation study further highlights the importance of the proposed resource in improving temporal relation classification.
Weaknesses:  
1. Clarity Issues in Extrinsic Evaluation: The extrinsic evaluation lacks sufficient detail about the TempEval-3 task setup, including the specific features, entity pairs, and label mappings. This makes it difficult to fully assess the experimental rigor and reproducibility.  
2. Relation Mapping and Graph Construction: The rationale for ignoring certain WordNet relations and the complexity of relation mapping remain unclear. Additionally, the choice of macro vs. micro averaging is not specified, which could impact the reported results.  
3. Ablation Study and Feature Redundancy: While the ablation study indicates potential redundancy between Lexica and Entity features, the underlying reasons for this behavior are not explained. This limits the interpretability of the results.  
4. SVM Parameter Optimization: The paper does not provide details on the parameter optimization for the SVM classifier used in the MinCut framework. Including a reference to LibSVM would enhance reproducibility.  
5. Significance Testing: The claim of "significantly better" results in Table 3 lacks statistical validation, as no significance tests or p-values are reported.
Questions to Authors:  
1. Can you clarify the specific features and label mappings used in the TempEval-3 task? How were entity pairs selected?  
2. Why were certain WordNet relations ignored in the graph construction? What makes the mapping "complex"?  
3. Could you elaborate on the redundancy observed between Lexica and Entity features in the ablation study?  
4. How were the SVM parameters optimized, and why was LibSVM not referenced?  
5. Can you provide the number of examples per fine-grained label (past, present, future) and address the ambiguity in temporal words like "present"?
Conclusion:  
This paper presents a significant contribution to temporal NLP by proposing an innovative graph-based classification method and creating a valuable temporal lexical resource. While the methodology and results are promising, addressing the clarity and reproducibility issues would strengthen the paper further. Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, given its impact and novelty.
