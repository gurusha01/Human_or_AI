Summary of the Paper:
The paper proposes a semi-supervised minimum cuts paradigm to associate word senses with their underlying temporal dimensions. The approach uses WordNet definitions, conceptual-semantic and lexical relations to supplement WordNet entries with temporal information. The authors evaluate their approach using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, demonstrating that it outperforms prior semi-supervised non-graph classification approaches.
Main Contributions:
1. Semi-supervised minimum cuts paradigm: The authors propose a novel approach to temporal classification of word senses using a semi-supervised minimum cuts paradigm.
2. Use of WordNet relations: The authors utilize WordNet relations to derive association scores between word senses, allowing for a more accurate temporal classification.
3. Evaluation on temporal relation classification task: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a temporal relation classification task, outperforming the best-performing system in TempEval-3.
Strengths:
1. Improved accuracy: The authors' approach achieves higher accuracy than prior approaches on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.
2. Use of multiple views on the data: The authors' approach combines individual scores and association scores to improve temporal classification accuracy.
3. Publicly available resource: The authors make their temporal lexical resource publicly available, allowing the community to benefit from it.
Weaknesses:
1. Difficulty of the task: The authors acknowledge the difficulty of the task, particularly due to the subjective nature of temporal dimension judgment.
2. Limited scope: The authors' approach is limited to WordNet and may not be directly applicable to other lexical resources.
3. Feature ablation analysis: The authors' feature ablation analysis suggests that some feature types contain redundant information, which may impact the approach's performance.
Questions to Authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the difficulty of the task, particularly in cases where the temporal dimension of a synset is ambiguous?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the construction of the gold standard dataset and the annotation process?
3. How do the authors plan to explore the effect of other graph construction methods on the approach's performance?
