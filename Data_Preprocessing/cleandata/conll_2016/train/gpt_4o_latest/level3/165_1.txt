Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel method for discovering linguistic correspondences across multiple languages using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The proposed approach develops substring-matching rules and formulates an MDL objective that balances model complexity with data description length. The method is implemented using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and is tested on 13 Slavic languages. The results are presented through pairwise distance measures, a phylogenetic tree, and examples of inferred correspondences. The primary contributions of this work are:
1. MDL-Based Framework for Linguistic Correspondence Discovery: The paper introduces a statistically grounded and deterministic framework for identifying string-level correspondences without prior assumptions about their shape or distribution. This is a significant advancement over existing methods that often rely on restrictive assumptions.
   
2. Multi-Language Analysis Capability: Unlike many existing approaches that are limited to pairwise analyses, the proposed method allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple languages, enabling a more detailed quantification of linguistic similarities.
3. Empirical Validation on Slavic Languages: The method is rigorously tested on a diverse dataset of Slavic languages, demonstrating its ability to produce meaningful results, such as phylogenetic trees and granular linguistic correspondences.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Theoretical Rigor: The use of MDL for linguistic correspondence discovery is innovative and well-justified. The paper provides a clear theoretical foundation, linking the MDL objective to Bayesian inference, which adds credibility to the approach.
   
2. Practical Relevance: The method's ability to analyze more than two languages simultaneously is a significant improvement over traditional pairwise approaches, making it highly relevant for historical linguistics and computational phylogenetics.
3. Empirical Results: The experiments are comprehensive, covering both pairwise and multi-language analyses. The inferred phylogenetic tree aligns well with established linguistic classifications, and the discovered correspondences are linguistically meaningful.
4. Flexibility: The framework allows for deterministic results while also enabling the integration of linguistic knowledge and non-deterministic extensions, making it adaptable to various use cases.
Weaknesses
1. Scalability Issues: The current implementation is limited to five languages due to memory and runtime constraints. This raises concerns about the method's scalability to larger datasets or more complex linguistic analyses.
2. Lack of Comparisons to Existing Methods: The paper does not adequately compare its approach to existing methods for borrowing and cognate detection in historical linguistics or tools used in biological phylogeny inference, such as MrBayes or PAUP. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative advantages of the proposed method.
3. Data Representation: The use of orthographic data instead of phonetic transcriptions may obscure linguistic correspondences, especially for languages with complex orthographies. This could limit the method's applicability to datasets where phonetic information is critical.
4. Unclear Derivations: Some steps in the method, such as the merging process in the maximization step and the meaning of "optimal unigram for symbol usages," are not sufficiently explained, which could hinder reproducibility.
5. Neighbor-Joining Method: The use of the neighbor-joining algorithm for phylogenetic tree construction is a limitation, as this method has known drawbacks. More sophisticated methods could provide more robust results.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify the merging process in the maximization step and its role in improving the model?
2. How does the method handle cases where the data includes significant noise or irregularities in linguistic correspondences?
3. Have you considered using phonetic transcriptions instead of orthographic data? If so, what challenges do you anticipate in adapting the method to phonetic datasets?
4. Why was the neighbor-joining method chosen for phylogenetic tree construction, and have you explored alternative methods?
5. Could you provide empirical comparisons to existing tools like MrBayes or PAUP to better contextualize the performance of your approach?
Additional Comments
- A minor typographical correction is suggested for "focus in on" to "focus on."
- The discussion of related work could be expanded to include more detailed comparisons to existing methods and tools.
- Future work could explore the scalability of the method and its application to non-Slavic languages or larger datasets. 
In conclusion, while the paper presents a promising and innovative approach, addressing the outlined weaknesses and questions would significantly strengthen its impact and applicability.
