Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a transition-based graph parser designed to handle the semantico-cognitive annotation scheme of UCCA (Universal Cognitive Conceptual Annotation) corpora. The authors propose three principles for a semantic-based annotation scheme: (1) graph-based structures, (2) non-terminal nodes, and (3) allowance for discontinuous elements. These principles are presented as generalizable beyond UCCA, potentially applicable to syntax or other representation layers. The paper explores two complementary approaches: (a) converting UCCA structures into related formalisms (dependency and constituency trees) and using existing parsers, and (b) developing a novel transition-based parser (BSP) that directly supports UCCA's structural requirements. Experiments are conducted using UCCA-annotated corpora, achieving nearly 70% labeled F-score for primary edges.
The primary contributions of the paper are:
1. Novelty of the Parsing Framework: The introduction of a transition-based parser (BSP) that supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units, tailored for UCCA's structural requirements.
2. Empirical Evaluation: The paper conducts parsing experiments using both conversion-based methods and the proposed BSP, providing insights into the effectiveness of transition-based approaches for semantic parsing.
3. Generalizability of Principles: The proposed annotation principles are not tied to a specific semantic framework, suggesting broader applicability.
Strengths
1. Relevance and Novelty: The paper addresses an important gap in semantic parsing by proposing a parser that directly supports UCCA's unique structural properties. This is a significant step forward for broad-coverage semantic parsing.
2. Empirical Rigor: The authors conduct extensive experiments, including comparisons between conversion-based methods and the proposed BSP. The inclusion of both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations demonstrates robustness.
3. Open-Source Contribution: The promise to make all converters and parsers publicly available enhances the paper's impact and reproducibility, fostering further research in the field.
4. Clarity in Problem Definition: The paper clearly articulates the challenges posed by UCCA's structural requirements and motivates the need for a specialized parser.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not compare BSP's performance against existing graph parsers, which could have provided a stronger empirical justification for its novelty. For example, parsers like Fernandez-Gonzalez and Martins (2015) could have been used as baselines.
2. Limited Error Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed error analysis to identify specific challenges in parsing UCCA graphs, such as handling implicit units or quantifier scope.
3. Ad-hoc Nature of Principles: The three proposed annotation principles, while useful, appear somewhat ad-hoc. A clearer theoretical grounding or motivation for these principles would strengthen the argument.
4. Lossy Conversions: The conversion to surface dependency trees loses significant information, which could have been mitigated by richer conversion methods. This limitation weakens the empirical results for conversion-based approaches.
5. Missing Comparisons with Related Frameworks: The paper does not adequately compare UCCA parsing with other semantic frameworks like AMR, MRS, or DRT, particularly in terms of quantifier scope and implicit units.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify how UCCA graphs handle implicit units with no textual correspondence? Are there plans to extend BSP to model these units?
2. Why were existing graph parsers not included as baselines for comparison? How does BSP differ fundamentally from such parsers?
3. Could you elaborate on the motivation behind the three proposed annotation principles? Are they grounded in linguistic theory or derived empirically?
4. Is there a specific reason why richer conversion methods were not explored for dependency trees?
Recommendation
The paper is interesting and relevant for a conference like CoNLL, given its focus on semantic parsing and UCCA. However, the lack of baseline comparisons, limited error analysis, and ad-hoc nature of the principles weaken its empirical and theoretical contributions. I recommend acceptance with revisions to address these shortcomings.
