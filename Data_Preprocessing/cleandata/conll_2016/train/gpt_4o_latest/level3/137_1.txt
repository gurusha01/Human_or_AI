Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates the task of predicting the compositionality level of English compound nouns using cosine similarity and Spearman correlation for evaluation. The authors compare two approaches: neural embeddings and syntactic-context count vectors, with the latter outperforming the former. The primary contribution of the paper is the exploration of aligned and unaligned vector spaces for compositionality detection, with a hybrid model combining both yielding the best results. The use of anchored packed trees (APTs) to encode syntactic structure is another notable aspect, as it emphasizes the importance of syntactic dependencies in compositionality detection. The authors also demonstrate that integrating syntactic-contextual features into compositional models improves performance over traditional neural embeddings.
Strengths
1. Empirical Performance: The paper demonstrates that syntactic-context count vectors, particularly when using a hybrid model of aligned and unaligned APTs, outperform neural embeddings and previous state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the importance of syntactic structure in compositionality detection.
2. Novelty in Combining Aligned and Unaligned Vectors: While the use of aligned vectors is not entirely novel, the hybrid approach that combines aligned and unaligned vectors shows a slight but consistent improvement, which is an interesting contribution.
3. Clear Introduction and Motivation: The introduction is well-written, providing a clear motivation for the task and situating the work within the broader context of distributional semantics and compositionality detection.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates multiple configurations (e.g., PPMI smoothing, different composition operations) and provides statistically significant results, enhancing the reliability of its findings.
Weaknesses
1. Dataset Limitations: The dataset is small (90 compounds), and its selection process is insufficiently detailed. The lack of discussion on potential frequency biases and the handling of human judgment ties further weakens the robustness of the findings.
2. Clarity Issues: Certain sections, such as 5.1, are difficult to follow due to dense terminology (e.g., "packed anchored tree," "elementary APTs") and insufficient explanation. Including running examples or diagrams would significantly improve readability.
3. Innovation Concerns: The use of aligned vectors, while central to the paper, builds heavily on prior work. The novelty of the hybrid approach is incremental rather than groundbreaking.
4. Baseline Intuition: The rationale behind the FREQ baseline (frequent compounds being compositional) is unclear and suggests potential dataset bias. This could undermine the validity of the results.
5. Parameter Reporting: Critical parameters for the hybrid model (e.g., h and q) are not reported in sufficient detail, and the impact of smoothing PPMI (Î± = 0.75) is not well-explained.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify the process for selecting the 90 compounds in the dataset? Were any frequency thresholds or linguistic criteria applied?
2. How were ties in human compositionality judgments handled during evaluation?
3. What is the intuition behind the FREQ baseline, and how do you address the potential bias it introduces?
4. Could you provide more details on the parameter optimization process for h and q in the hybrid model?
5. How do you envision scaling the APT approach to larger datasets or more complex phrases?
Recommendation
While the paper provides valuable insights into compositionality detection and demonstrates strong empirical results, the incremental nature of its contributions, coupled with dataset and clarity issues, limits its overall impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on improving clarity, addressing dataset limitations, and providing more robust justification for the proposed methods.
