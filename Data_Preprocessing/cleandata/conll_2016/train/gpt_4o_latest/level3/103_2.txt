Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces TBuckets, a novel method for evaluating topic models by clustering top-n topic words into "buckets" based on cosine similarity of word embeddings. The authors propose three distinct approaches for bucket formation: TBuckets-Clustering, TBuckets-SVD, and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, with the latter incorporating a reorganization step to improve coherence. The method is evaluated on three standard datasets (20NG, NYT, Genomics) and a weakly supervised text classification task, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. A key strength of the proposed method is its parameter-free nature for the SVD-based approaches, which simplifies its application.
The paper's contributions can be summarized as follows:
1. Novelty of Method: The introduction of TBuckets as a coherence evaluation framework that leverages word embeddings and clustering techniques to measure topic coherence.
2. Empirical Validation: Demonstration of the method's effectiveness on multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in coherence evaluation and improving weakly supervised text classification performance.
3. Conceptual Simplicity: The method is intuitive and avoids the need for extensive parameter tuning, particularly in the SVD-based approaches.
Strengths
1. Performance: The proposed TBuckets-SVD-Reorg approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on two out of three datasets and matches performance on the third. This is a significant achievement, especially given the parameter-free nature of the SVD-based methods.
2. Practical Utility: The application of TBuckets to weakly supervised text classification highlights its broader utility beyond coherence evaluation. The results demonstrate that selecting high-quality topics using TBuckets improves classification performance.
3. Simplicity and Interpretability: The method is conceptually simple, making it accessible to practitioners. The use of word embeddings and clustering aligns well with human interpretability of topics.
4. Reorganization Step: The reorganization step in TBuckets-SVD-Reorg addresses practical issues in bucket formation, improving the coherence of the largest bucket and enhancing the overall method.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Theoretical Justification: The paper lacks a strong theoretical explanation for why word-word similarity in embedding space is an appropriate proxy for topic coherence. This is particularly important given the contextual mismatch between word embeddings (sequential context) and topics (document context).
2. Sensitivity to Embeddings: The method's reliance on pre-trained word embeddings raises concerns about its sensitivity to different embedding models (e.g., GloVe vs. word2vec). The paper does not explore or discuss this sensitivity, which could impact its generalizability.
3. Writing and Structure: While the paper is generally well-written, Section 3 could benefit from restructuring with subsections for each method to improve clarity. Additionally, there are minor language issues throughout the text.
4. Unused Space: The paper contains unused space that could be better utilized to elaborate on the methods or provide additional examples. For instance, the "trace" on page 3 could be replaced with more informative content.
5. Significance Testing: The results in Table 1 lack statistical significance tests, which would strengthen the claims of superiority over the state-of-the-art.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the method perform with different word embeddings, such as word2vec or contextual embeddings like BERT? Is it robust to such variations?
2. Can you provide a theoretical justification or empirical evidence for why cosine similarity of word embeddings is a reliable measure of topic coherence?
3. How does the method scale with larger datasets or topics with more than 10 words? Are there computational bottlenecks?
Conclusion
This paper presents a promising and practical approach to evaluating topic coherence, with strong empirical results and useful applications. However, its lack of theoretical grounding, sensitivity analysis, and clarity in certain sections limits its overall impact. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
