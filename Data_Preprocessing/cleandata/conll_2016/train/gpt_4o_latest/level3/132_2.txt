Review of "lda2vec: Neural Topic Modeling with Sparse Document Representations"
Summary and Contributions
The paper introduces lda2vec, a neural topic model that combines the strengths of distributed word embeddings (e.g., word2vec) and sparse, interpretable document representations akin to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The proposed model embeds words, topics, and documents into a shared semantic space, enabling interpretable topic mixtures while preserving semantic regularities in word embeddings. The authors claim that lda2vec is simple to implement using automatic differentiation frameworks and demonstrate its application on the Twenty Newsgroups and Hacker News datasets. The primary contributions of the paper are:
1. A hybrid neural topic model that extends word2vec with sparse, interpretable document-topic mixtures.
2. Joint training of word, topic, and document embeddings in a unified space.
3. Empirical demonstrations of topic coherence and word analogy tasks on two datasets.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Conceptual Appeal: The integration of sparse topic modeling with distributed word embeddings is conceptually appealing and addresses the interpretability gap in neural document representations. The proposed model is a promising step toward combining the strengths of probabilistic topic models and neural embeddings.
2. Practical Implementation: The use of automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., Chainer) simplifies model implementation and optimization, making the approach accessible to practitioners.
3. Qualitative Examples: The paper provides several qualitative examples of discovered topics and word analogies, which demonstrate the interpretability and semantic coherence of the learned representations.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Rigorous Empirical Evaluation: The paper relies heavily on qualitative examples and lacks quantitative comparisons with standard or neural topic models (e.g., those by Cao et al., Nguyen et al., and Shamanta et al.). This omission makes it difficult to assess the model's performance relative to existing methods.
2. Evaluation Gap: While topic coherence is reported for the Twenty Newsgroups dataset, there is no evaluation on downstream tasks such as document classification or similarity, which could better demonstrate the utility of the learned representations.
3. Computational Feasibility: The approach of calculating word-topic similarities via pairwise comparisons with the vocabulary may be computationally expensive, especially for large corpora with extensive vocabularies.
4. Anonymity Violation: The inclusion of a GitHub link to the code compromises the anonymity of the submission, which is a significant issue for double-blind peer review.
5. Cherry-Picking Concerns: The selection process for the qualitative examples (Figures 3-6) is unclear, raising concerns about potential cherry-picking of results.
Questions to Authors
1. How does lda2vec compare quantitatively with other neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, perplexity, or downstream task performance?
2. How does the model handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms in unseen documents during inference?
3. Can you clarify the token identification process using SpaCy, particularly how noun chunks and pre-trained embeddings are utilized?
4. What measures are in place to mitigate the computational overhead of pairwise word-topic similarity calculations?
Additional Comments
The finding that 20 topics work best for the Twenty Newsgroups dataset is unsurprising, given the dataset's structure. Further exploration of varying topic counts and their impact on coherence and interpretability would strengthen the analysis. Additionally, the paper contains minor grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent reference formatting, which should be addressed in a revision.
Recommendation
While the conceptual contribution of lda2vec is promising, the lack of rigorous empirical evaluation and the anonymity violation are significant concerns. I recommend a weak reject, with encouragement to address the evaluation gaps and resubmit.
