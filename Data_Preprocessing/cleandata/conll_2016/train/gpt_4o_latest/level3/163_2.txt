Review of Submission
Summary and Contributions:
This paper investigates the relationship between part-of-speech (PoS) tags and word embeddings trained on the British National Corpus (BNC). The authors train classifiers to predict PoS tags based on word embeddings, analyze misclassification errors, and explore how distributional vectors encode PoS information. The main contributions of the paper, as seen from this review, are as follows:
1. Error Analysis for PoS Prediction: The paper provides a detailed analysis of misclassified words, identifying linguistic phenomena such as "soft" or "graded" PoS boundaries and inconsistencies in annotation.
2. Insights into Embedding Features: The authors demonstrate that PoS information is distributed across multiple components of word embeddings, rather than being concentrated in a few dimensions.
3. Potential for Annotation Improvement: The paper highlights how distributional models can detect annotation errors in corpora, suggesting their utility in refining PoS-tagged datasets.
Strengths:
1. Comprehensive Error Analysis: The paper excels in its detailed exploration of misclassification cases, offering insights into linguistic phenomena and annotation inconsistencies. For example, the analysis of proper nouns misclassified as common nouns or adjectives highlights the nuanced nature of PoS boundaries.
2. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their findings across multiple datasets, including the Universal Dependencies Treebank, demonstrating the robustness of their approach.
3. Practical Implications: The work has practical implications for improving PoS-tagged corpora and preliminary tagging in resource-poor languages, where only a small set of manually tagged words is required to bootstrap the process.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Novelty: The claim that "distributional vectors contain information about PoS affiliation" is not novel and has been well-established in prior work over the last 15 years. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its findings from existing literature.
2. Insufficient Related Work Coverage: The paper omits key references in the area of distributional PoS induction, such as Tsvetkov et al. (2015) and other foundational studies. This weakens the contextualization of the work.
3. Missed Opportunity for Parsing Discussion: The paper does not address whether distributional vectors are more beneficial for parsing tasks than traditional PoS tags, which could have reframed the discussion in a more impactful way.
4. Limited Novelty in Results: The results in Section 5, while robust, do not offer significant advancements over prior work that used fewer external constraints.
5. Unclear Methodological Choices: The decision to use Universal PoS (UPOS) tags instead of the original fine-grained tagset is not well-justified. Fine-grained distinctions could have provided deeper insights into PoS boundaries.
Questions to Authors:
1. Why was the decision made to use UPOS tags instead of the original fine-grained BNC tagset? Could this have impacted the granularity of the findings?
2. Could you clarify the role of Brown cluster vectors mentioned in Footnote 3? How do they align with UPOS tags, and what were the criteria for their failed attempts?
3. Have you considered analyzing low-frequency words and classifier errors in the tail? This could provide additional insights into the limitations of distributional features.
Additional Comments:
- The observation that "proper nouns are not much similar to common nouns" is not particularly novel or surprising. It could have been framed more effectively in the context of prior work.
- The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion on how its findings compare to existing state-of-the-art PoS taggers, particularly in terms of practical applications.
- Sentential references should be updated to use `\newcite{}` formatting as per conference guidelines (e.g., "Mikolov et al. (2013b) showed").
Recommendation:
While the paper provides a strong error analysis and practical insights, the lack of novelty and insufficient coverage of related work limit its impact. I recommend rejecting the paper in its current form but encourage the authors to address the weaknesses and resubmit to a future venue.
