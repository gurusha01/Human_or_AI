Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates the performance of delexicalized transfer parsers and minimally supervised dependency parsers on 32 languages from the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebank collection. The authors propose a minimally supervised parser that incorporates handcrafted universal grammatical rules for part-of-speech (POS) tags as external prior probabilities. They compare this approach to delexicalized transfer parsing and unsupervised parsing, with results indicating that the minimally supervised parser performs better for less-resourced, non-Indo-European languages. The primary contributions of the paper are:
1. A comparative evaluation of delexicalized transfer parsing and minimally supervised parsing across a diverse set of languages.
2. The introduction of handcrafted and learned external prior probabilities into an unsupervised dependency parser.
3. Empirical evidence suggesting that minimally supervised parsers are more effective for parsing less-resourced languages.
Strengths
1. Comprehensive Evaluation Across Languages: The paper evaluates its methods on 32 languages, including underrepresented non-Indo-European languages, providing a broad and meaningful analysis.
2. Practical Focus on Low-Resource Languages: The work addresses a critical gap in dependency parsing for less-resourced languages, which often lack annotated treebanks.
3. Novel Use of External Priors: The incorporation of handcrafted and learned external prior probabilities into an unsupervised parser is an innovative approach that bridges the gap between unsupervised and supervised methods.
4. Empirical Insights: The results demonstrate that minimally supervised parsers outperform delexicalized transfer parsers for non-Indo-European languages, offering practical guidance for future research in low-resource language parsing.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Delexicalized Parsing: The delexicalized transfer parsing experiments largely replicate existing methods without significant innovation, relying on established tools like the MST and Malt parsers.
2. Manual Rule Design: The handcrafted rules for external priors, while effective, lack scalability and may require significant effort to generalize to new languages or linguistic phenomena.
3. Incomplete Analysis of Learned Priors: The paper does not thoroughly analyze why direction-dependent learned priors (DDLP) outperform direction-independent ones (DILP) or how these priors could be further optimized.
4. Reproducibility Concerns: While the authors use publicly available tools and datasets, the manual adjustments to the parser code and the lack of detailed parameter settings for some experiments may hinder reproducibility.
Questions to Authors
1. How sensitive are the results to the specific handcrafted rules used for external priors? Could these rules be automatically generated or generalized?
2. Did you evaluate the impact of varying the Î» parameters for combining external priors with the parser's internal probabilities? If so, what were the findings?
3. Could the minimally supervised parser be extended to include additional linguistic features, such as morphological information, to further improve performance?
Conclusion
This paper provides valuable insights into dependency parsing for low-resource languages, particularly through its innovative use of minimally supervised methods. While the work is well-motivated and empirically sound, the lack of novelty in the delexicalized parsing experiments and the reliance on handcrafted rules limit its broader applicability. Nonetheless, the findings are significant for advancing dependency parsing in less-resourced linguistic contexts. I encourage the authors to address the scalability and reproducibility issues in future work.
