Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:
This paper investigates the relationship between word embeddings trained on the British National Corpus (BNC) and part-of-speech (PoS) boundaries. The authors propose a novel approach to analyzing PoS affiliations by training classifiers on word embeddings and using the resulting predictions to identify outliers and inconsistencies in PoS annotations. The main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are as follows:
1. Demonstration of PoS Information in Word Embeddings: The authors provide compelling evidence that word embeddings encode PoS-related information, distributed across multiple vector components. This is supported by high classifier performance (F-scores of 0.91â€“0.99) in predicting PoS tags for words in various datasets.
   
2. Identification of Annotation Inconsistencies: The paper highlights how misclassified words can reveal inconsistencies or errors in PoS annotations, such as systematic tagging errors in the BNC (e.g., adjectives tagged as adverbs).
   
3. Insights into PoS Boundaries: By analyzing misclassified words, the authors uncover linguistic phenomena such as the graded nature of PoS boundaries (e.g., participles behaving like both verbs and adjectives) and the overlap between certain PoS classes.
4. Preliminary PoS Tagging for Resource-Poor Languages: The authors propose a practical application of their method for resource-poor languages, where a small set of manually tagged words could bootstrap PoS tagging using distributional models.
Strengths:
1. Novel Analytical Approach: The use of word embeddings to analyze PoS boundaries and detect annotation inconsistencies is innovative and provides a new perspective on linguistic phenomena.
   
2. Robust Experimental Design: The authors employ multiple datasets (BNC, Universal Dependencies Treebank) and rigorous evaluation metrics (e.g., cross-validation, F-scores) to validate their findings. The classifier's performance is impressive, especially given its reliance solely on distributional features without contextual information.
3. Practical Applications: The proposed method has clear implications for improving PoS tagging in resource-poor languages and refining existing annotated corpora.
4. Error Analysis: The detailed analysis of misclassified words is a major strength, as it not only validates the method but also provides linguistic insights into PoS boundaries and annotation practices.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the application of distributional semantics to PoS tagging is interesting, the core methodology (training classifiers on word embeddings) is not particularly novel. The novelty lies more in the analysis than in the technical approach.
   
2. Insufficient Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of its approach, such as the reliance on high-quality embeddings and annotated corpora, which may not be available for all languages.
3. Overemphasis on English: The experiments are conducted exclusively on English data, limiting the generalizability of the findings. While the authors mention plans to extend the work to other languages, this remains speculative.
4. Sparse Comparison with Existing PoS Taggers: The paper briefly compares its method with the Stanford PoS Tagger but does not provide a thorough evaluation against state-of-the-art PoS tagging systems. This makes it difficult to assess the practical utility of the proposed approach.
Questions to Authors:
1. How does the performance of your method compare to state-of-the-art PoS taggers when contextual information is included?
2. Have you considered how the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., vector size, window size) in the embedding model affects the results?
3. Could the proposed method be extended to handle ambiguous words (e.g., words with multiple PoS tags in different contexts)?
Additional Comments:
Overall, the paper presents an interesting and well-executed study on the relationship between word embeddings and PoS boundaries. While the methodology is not groundbreaking, the insights gained from the analysis are valuable and could inspire further research in linguistics and computational linguistics. However, the authors should address the limitations of their approach and provide more evidence of its applicability to other languages and real-world PoS tagging tasks.
