Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper introduces two novel methods, multiCluster and multiCCA, for estimating multilingual word embeddings using dictionaries and monolingual data, without requiring parallel corpora. These methods are evaluated on embeddings spanning 59 languages. The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, multiQVEC-CCA, which addresses shortcomings of existing intrinsic evaluation methods and demonstrates better correlation with downstream tasks such as multilingual document classification and dependency parsing. Additionally, the paper provides a web portal for evaluating multilingual embeddings, which includes intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics and facilitates reproducibility in this research area.
The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. multiCluster and multiCCA: Two dictionary-based methods for multilingual embeddings that do not rely on parallel data.  
2. multiQVEC-CCA: A novel evaluation metric for multilingual embeddings that aligns better with downstream task performance.  
3. A publicly available evaluation portal to streamline benchmarking and reproducibility in multilingual embedding research.

Strengths:  
1. Novelty of Methods: The proposed methods, multiCluster and multiCCA, are innovative in their reliance on dictionaries and monolingual corpora, which makes them applicable to low-resource languages where parallel corpora are scarce. This is a significant improvement over existing methods.  
2. Evaluation Metric: The introduction of multiQVEC-CCA is a strong contribution, as it addresses key limitations of prior intrinsic metrics (e.g., QVEC) and demonstrates better correlation with extrinsic tasks, which is critical for practical applications.  
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the proposed methods across multiple intrinsic and extrinsic metrics, providing a thorough comparison with existing approaches. The results are well-documented and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each method.  
4. Reproducibility and Accessibility: The web portal for evaluation is a valuable resource for the community, promoting transparency and enabling researchers to benchmark their methods against standardized metrics.  
5. Scalability: The ability to scale the embeddings to 59 languages, including low-resource ones, is a notable achievement and demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Performance on Some Metrics: While multiCCA outperforms multiCluster and some baselines in most evaluations, its performance on certain intrinsic metrics (e.g., word translation) lags behind the translation-invariance method. This suggests that the proposed methods may not fully capture cross-lingual semantic relationships in all scenarios.  
2. Dependence on Dictionaries: The reliance on bilingual dictionaries, while innovative, may limit the applicability of the methods in truly low-resource languages where such dictionaries are unavailable or incomplete. This limitation is acknowledged but not sufficiently addressed in the paper.  
3. Evaluation Scope: Although the evaluation is comprehensive, the experiments focus primarily on three languages (English, Italian, Danish) for intrinsic metrics like multiQVEC-CCA. This raises questions about the generalizability of the results to other language pairs.  
4. Lack of Error Analysis: The paper does not provide a detailed error analysis or qualitative insights into the failure cases of the proposed methods, which could help in understanding their limitations and guiding future improvements.

Questions to Authors:  
1. How do the proposed methods perform in truly low-resource scenarios where bilingual dictionaries are sparse or noisy? Could the methods be adapted to leverage noisy or incomplete dictionaries?  
2. Have you considered extending multiQVEC-CCA to include syntactic properties (e.g., POS tags) for languages where supersense annotations are unavailable?  
3. Could you provide more insights into the computational efficiency of multiCluster and multiCCA compared to parallel corpus-based methods?

Conclusion:  
This paper makes significant contributions to multilingual word embedding research by proposing novel dictionary-based methods and an improved evaluation metric. The work is well-motivated, and the results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approaches, particularly for low-resource languages. While there are some limitations, such as reliance on dictionaries and inconsistent performance on certain metrics, these do not detract from the overall impact of the paper. The evaluation portal further enhances the paper's value by promoting reproducibility and standardization in the field. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the questions and limitations noted above.
