Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces TBuckets, a novel approach for measuring the quality of topics generated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The key idea is to group topic words into thematic "buckets," with a single large bucket indicating high topic coherence. The authors propose three techniques for bucket creation: TBuckets-Clustering, TBuckets-SVD, and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg. The latter two leverage singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify sub-themes among topic words, with TBuckets-SVD-Reorg incorporating a reorganization step to improve bucket coherence. The proposed methods are evaluated on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of correlation with human-annotated coherence scores. Additionally, the paper explores the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification, showing that selecting high-quality topics improves classification accuracy.
The primary contributions of this work are:
1. A novel, parameter-free method (TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg) for measuring topic coherence that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on two datasets.
2. A demonstration of the practical utility of TBuckets in weakly supervised text classification, highlighting its ability to enhance classification performance by selecting high-quality topics.
3. A detailed analysis of the limitations of existing coherence measures and the advantages of the TBuckets approach, particularly its interpretability and computational efficiency.

Strengths
1. Novelty and Innovation: The TBuckets framework introduces a fresh perspective on topic coherence by leveraging thematic grouping and SVD-based techniques. The reorganization step in TBuckets-SVD-Reorg is particularly innovative and addresses a key limitation of the SVD-based approach.
2. Empirical Validation: The evaluation is thorough, with results on three datasets showing that TBuckets-SVD-Reorg achieves higher correlation with human-annotated scores than state-of-the-art methods. The parameter-free nature of the SVD-based techniques is a significant advantage over existing methods, which require extensive parameter tuning.
3. Practical Utility: The application of TBuckets to weakly supervised text classification demonstrates its real-world relevance. The improvement in classification accuracy when using high-quality topics underscores the practical value of the proposed approach.
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper provides detailed explanations of the methods, including the mathematical foundations of SVD and the reorganization step. This level of detail enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Clustering-Based Approach: While TBuckets-Clustering performs well on the Genomics dataset, its reliance on agglomerative clustering with a single parameter (Max Dist) offers limited novelty compared to existing clustering-based coherence measures.
2. Domain-Specific Limitations: The authors acknowledge that the performance of TBuckets could be improved in domain-specific datasets like Genomics. However, no concrete solutions or experiments are proposed to address this limitation.
3. Evaluation Scope: The evaluation primarily focuses on Pearson's correlation with human-annotated scores. While this is a standard metric, additional evaluations (e.g., qualitative analysis of bucket outputs or comparisons with other coherence measures like NPMI) could strengthen the results.
4. Scalability: The computational efficiency of TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg is not explicitly discussed. While parameter-free methods are advantageous, the scalability of SVD-based techniques for large datasets or high-dimensional embeddings remains unclear.

Questions to Authors
1. How does the computational cost of TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg compare to state-of-the-art methods, particularly for large datasets?
2. Have you considered alternative word similarity measures (e.g., contextual embeddings like BERT) to improve performance on domain-specific datasets like Genomics?
3. Could TBuckets be extended to handle multilingual or cross-lingual topic models? If so, what challenges do you foresee?

Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a novel and effective approach to measuring topic coherence, with strong empirical results and practical applications. However, addressing the scalability concerns and exploring domain-specific adaptations would further strengthen the work.
