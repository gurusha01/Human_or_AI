Review
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper investigates compositionality detection for compound nouns, comparing an integrated compositional distributional approach using anchored packed trees (APTs) with state-of-the-art neural word embeddings. The authors leverage the Reddy et al. (2011) dataset of 90 compound nouns with human compositionality judgments to evaluate their methods. The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. Integrated APT Approach: The introduction of a novel compositional method based on APTs, which encodes syntactic structure in contextual features and aligns vector spaces before composition. This method outperforms neural embeddings and previous baselines in compositionality detection.  
2. Hybrid Composition Model: A combination of aligned and unaligned APT representations achieves the best performance, suggesting that different contextual features contribute complementary information.  
3. Comparative Analysis: The paper provides a detailed comparison of APT-based methods, neural word embeddings (e.g., word2vec), and prior baselines, offering insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach.  
Strengths:  
1. Strong Empirical Results: The APT-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, with the hybrid APT model yielding a Spearman correlation of 0.79, significantly outperforming prior baselines (e.g., 0.71 from Reddy et al., 2011). This demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating syntactic structure into compositionality detection.  
2. Thorough Experimental Design: The authors explore a wide range of parameters (e.g., PPMI smoothing, dimensionality of embeddings, subsampling thresholds) and composition operations (e.g., additive, intersective), ensuring a robust evaluation of their methods.  
3. Novelty of APTs: The use of dependency paths and alignment in APTs is a novel and linguistically motivated approach to compositionality. The hybrid model, which combines aligned and unaligned APTs, is particularly innovative and demonstrates the utility of integrating multiple perspectives on context.  
4. Clarity of Results: The paper presents results in a clear and interpretable manner, with detailed tables and statistical significance testing. This transparency strengthens the validity of the findings.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Dataset: The evaluation is restricted to the Reddy et al. (2011) dataset of 90 compound nouns. While this dataset is widely used, its small size limits the generalizability of the results. Testing on larger and more diverse datasets would strengthen the claims.  
2. Focus on Noun Compounds: The study is narrowly focused on noun compounds, which may not generalize to other types of multiword expressions (e.g., verb phrases, idioms). The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide preliminary results on other phrase types.  
3. Sparse Representations: While the authors highlight the sparse nature of APT representations as a potential limitation, they do not explore methods to address this issue (e.g., smoothing or dimensionality reduction). This could be a missed opportunity to further improve performance.  
4. Comparison with Neural Models: Although neural embeddings are included in the comparison, the exploration of neural compositionality methods (e.g., tensor-based models or transformers) is limited. This omission weakens the claim that APTs are superior to neural methods.  
Questions to Authors:  
1. Have you considered evaluating your methods on larger or more diverse datasets to test generalizability?  
2. Could the sparse nature of APT representations be mitigated through dimensionality reduction or smoothing techniques?  
3. How does the APT approach compare to more advanced neural compositionality methods, such as tensor-based models or transformer-based embeddings?  
Conclusion:  
This paper makes a significant contribution to compositionality detection by introducing a novel APT-based approach that incorporates syntactic structure into distributional representations. While the results are promising, the limited dataset and narrow focus on noun compounds constrain the generalizability of the findings. Expanding the evaluation to larger datasets and exploring advanced neural methods would further strengthen the work. Overall, this is a strong submission with clear potential for impact in the field of compositional distributional semantics.
