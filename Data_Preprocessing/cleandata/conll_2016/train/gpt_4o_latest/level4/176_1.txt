This paper introduces a novel (to the best of my knowledge) approach that frames a variety of sentence pair scoring tasks (e.g., Answer Set Scoring, RTE, Paraphrasing, among others) as specific instances of a broader task: understanding semantic relationships between two sentences. Additionally, the authors explore the feasibility of developing neural network models that are broadly applicable across this family of tasks. I find this proposal to be innovative and compelling, meriting both presentation at CoNLL and further exploration and discussion.
However, the paper feels incomplete in its current form. It should only be accepted for publication on the condition that several revisions are made in the final version:  
1. The first results table must be completed.  
2. The written discussion of results is insufficient, especially given the large number of individual results. A more detailed interpretation and analysis of the findings is urgently needed.  
3. The abstract promises the introduction of a new, more challenging dataset, but the paper does not appear to deliver on this claim. This inconsistency must be addressed.  
4. The results vary significantly across tasks. The authors should investigate and discuss why the models succeed in some tasks but fail in others. Even if definitive answers are not found, it would be valuable to hear their perspective on whether these variations stem from modeling limitations or fundamental dissimilarities between the tasks. Does treating these tasks as a unified whole truly hold up?  
5. The paper should include example instances from the various datasets used, showcasing both typical sentence pairs and those that are particularly challenging for classification.  
6. The Ubu. RNN transfer learning model is recommended for new tasks, but is this due to the general nature of the task or the size of the dataset? The authors should explore how this question might be addressed.
Despite its unfinished state, the paper presents an exciting approach that has the potential to spark meaningful discussion. I would be pleased to see it published, provided it undergoes further refinement. I acknowledge, however, that other reviewers may not share this opinion.
Some minor language issues:  
- The terms "weigh" and "weighed" are consistently used where "weight" and "weighted" would be more appropriate.  
- There are multiple misspellings of "sentence" (e.g., "sentene").  
- The term "interpunction" is unclear and should be clarified or replaced.  
- One instance of "world overlap" appears where "word overlap" is intended.
