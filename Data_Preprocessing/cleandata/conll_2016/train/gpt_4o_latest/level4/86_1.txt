The paper does not provide any details about the methods used to generate the results, citing 'non-disclosure restrictions.' Without information on the learning algorithm, training data, or other resources utilized in the approach, the paper offers no value to readers seeking to advance their own sentiment analysis techniques, which is the fundamental purpose of sharing research. As such, this submission cannot be considered a research paper and is not suitable for this conference. It might be more appropriate as a submission to a demo session elsewhere. However, even for a demo paper, more methodological details would need to be disclosed than are currently provided.
