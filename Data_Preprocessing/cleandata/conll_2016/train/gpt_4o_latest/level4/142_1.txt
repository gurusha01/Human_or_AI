The paper investigates the application of probabilistic models, specifically Gaussian Processes (GPs), to regress on the target variable of post-editing time/rates for quality estimation (QE) of machine translation (MT) output. 
The manuscript is well-organized, with an introduction that effectively outlines the challenges of relying on QE point estimates in practical scenarios. I particularly appreciated the discussion on various asymmetric risk scenarios and how they necessitate different estimators. 
For readers already familiar with Gaussian Processes, the paper dedicates a significant portion to revisiting these concepts. However, I believe this effort is justified, as it ensures the ideas are accessible to a broader audience. The explanation of the GP approach, kernel choices, and the use of warping is thorough and easy to follow. Overall, the research questions posed are compelling and well-articulated.
That said, I have a few questions and suggestions regarding the Results and Discussion sections, particularly for the Intrinsic Uncertainty Evaluation:  
- Why were post-editing rates chosen instead of predicting (H)TER? TER is a widely used metric in QE research, and it would have been helpful for the paper to justify this choice.  
- Section 3.2: The first paragraph is unclear to me. What specific trend is observed for fr-en and en-de that is absent for en-es? The paper mentions that NLL and NLPD "drastically" decrease with warped GPs across all three datasets, but this needs clarification.  
- Although the paper explicitly states that advancing state-of-the-art is not its primary goal (given the use of only the standard 17 baseline features), it would have been beneficial to include another point estimate model from prior work in the result tables. This would provide a clearer benchmark for assessing the overall quality of the models.  
- Relatedly, interpreting NLL and NLPD values can be challenging. Readers may naturally gravitate toward MAE in the tables to gauge "how different the predictions are." Since the paper's central argument is that this is not the right approach, it would be valuable to include a qualitative analysis with concrete examples to illustrate what constitutes a significant reduction in NLL/NLPD and why it matters.
Section 4 is particularly well-written and provides an intuitive explanation of the results.
In summary, I find the paper to be a strong contribution, as it highlights the limitations of point estimates in QEâ€”a challenging area where additional information, such as uncertainty, is crucial. While the paper does not advance the state-of-the-art or introduce significant modeling innovations (since GPs have been previously applied), its research questions are clearly defined and executed effectively.
Minor issues:  
- Section 4: Replace "over and underestimates" with "over- and underestimates."  
- Figure 1 caption: The lines are blue and green, not blue and red as stated.  
- If a specific toolkit was used for GP modeling, it would be helpful to reference it in the final version of the paper.
