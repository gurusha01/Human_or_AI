This paper introduces an intriguing approach that leverages cognitive features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. Specifically, it records the eye-movement patterns of human annotators to derive a novel set of features. The authors assert that this is the first study to incorporate cognitive features into the NLP domain.
Strengths:  
1. The paper is generally well-structured and easy to comprehend.  
2. The proposed idea is highly innovative and has the potential to inspire further research in other NLP applications.  
Weaknesses:  
1. The motivation for employing cognitive features in sentiment analysis is not sufficiently justified. While these features might provide insights into reading ease, it is unclear how they contribute to identifying sentiment polarities.  
2. The performance improvement achieved by incorporating cognitive features is minimal, as evidenced by the comparison between Sn+Sr+Gz and Sn+Sr.  
3. Although Section 7 discusses the feasibility of the proposed approach, the explanation is not entirely convincing. In particular, the example provided in Section 7.2 does not clearly demonstrate how this technique would be effective in the described scenario.
