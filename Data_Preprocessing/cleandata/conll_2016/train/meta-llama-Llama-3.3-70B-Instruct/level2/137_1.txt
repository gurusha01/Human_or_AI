Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a study on compositionality detection for compound nouns using an integrated compositional distributional approach. The authors propose a method that combines traditional compositional methods with state-of-the-art low-dimensional word representations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving results. The approach uses Anchored Packed Trees (APTs) to encode syntactic structure within the contextual features of words, which is then central to the compositional process.
Main Contributions
1. The paper introduces a new approach to compositionality detection that combines traditional compositional methods with state-of-the-art low-dimensional word representations.
2. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving results on a dataset of 90 compound nouns.
3. The paper shows that the use of typed contextual features, which encode syntactic structure, is highly informative in the task of determining the compositionality of a noun compound.
Strengths
1. The paper presents a novel approach to compositionality detection that combines the strengths of traditional compositional methods and state-of-the-art word representations.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on a dataset of compound nouns, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving results.
3. The paper highlights the importance of syntactic structure in the fine-grained understanding of language, and demonstrates the benefits of incorporating this information into compositional models.
Weaknesses
1. The paper focuses on a specific dataset of compound nouns, and it is unclear how the proposed approach would perform on other datasets or types of phrases.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art compositional models, which makes it difficult to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other datasets and types of phrases?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art compositional models, including a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations and biases of the proposed approach, including the reliance on syntactic structure and the use of typed contextual features?
