Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures (BSS), which require structural properties beyond those commonly used for syntactic parsing. The authors introduce two transition-based techniques for parsing such semantic structures: (1) applying conversion procedures to map them into related formalisms and using existing state-of-the-art parsers on the converted representations, and (2) constructing a parser that directly supports the full set of properties. The paper experiments with UCCA-annotated corpora and demonstrates the effectiveness of transition-based methods for the task.
Main Contributions
1. Introduction of Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP): The paper proposes a novel transition-based parser, BSP, which supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.
2. Conversion-Based Parsing Approach: The authors explore a conversion-based parsing approach to assess the ability of existing technology to address the task.
3. Experiments on UCCA Parsing: The paper presents the first experiments on UCCA parsing, achieving a primary F-score of 69.2%.
Strengths
1. Effective Transition-Based Approach: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of transition-based methods for BSS parsing.
2. Novel Features and Transitions: The authors introduce novel features and transitions, such as the ratio feature and remote edge transitions, which improve the parser's performance.
3. Robustness to Domain Variation: The paper shows that BSP is robust to domain variation, with out-of-domain results comparable to in-domain results.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Comparison to Existing Parsers: The paper only compares BSP to a limited set of existing parsers, such as UPARSE and MaltParser.
2. No Direct Comparison to Other Semantic Parsing Approaches: The paper does not directly compare BSP to other semantic parsing approaches, such as AMR parsing.
3. Room for Improvement in Performance: The paper acknowledges that there is room for improvement in BSP's performance, particularly in predicting remote edges.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to improve BSP's performance in predicting remote edges?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison of BSP to other semantic parsing approaches, such as AMR parsing?
3. How do the authors plan to extend BSP to support other semantic representation schemes, such as AMR or MRS?
