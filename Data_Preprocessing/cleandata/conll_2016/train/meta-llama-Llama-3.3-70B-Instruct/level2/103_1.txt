Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, to evaluate topic coherence. The approach uses three techniques: TBuckets-Clustering, TBuckets-SVD, and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art results. They also highlight the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a new approach, TBuckets, to measure topic quality, which is based on grouping topic words into buckets.
2. Improved Performance: The authors demonstrate that their techniques outperform state-of-the-art results on three publicly available datasets.
3. Parameter-Free: The techniques TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg require no parameter tuning, making them more practical for real-world applications.
Strengths
1. Effective Evaluation Metric: The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric, TBuckets, which effectively measures topic coherence.
