Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel approach to automatically discovering correspondences between words from two or more languages using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The authors propose an efficient algorithm to infer statistically significant correspondence rules directly from data, without imposing arbitrary assumptions on the distribution or shape of correspondences. The approach is evaluated on a set of Slavic languages, demonstrating its effectiveness in discovering non-trivial associations and quantifying linguistic similarity between languages.
Main Contributions
1. MDL-based approach: The paper introduces an MDL-based approach to discovering correspondences between languages, which provides a statistically well-founded method for identifying the best model for given data.
2. Efficient algorithm: The authors propose an efficient algorithm for inferring correspondence rules, which can handle multiple languages and provides a deterministic solution.
3. Experimental evaluation: The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation of the approach on a set of Slavic languages, demonstrating its effectiveness in discovering correspondences and quantifying linguistic similarity.
Strengths
1. Novel approach: The paper presents a novel approach to discovering correspondences between languages, which addresses the limitations of existing methods.
2. Theoretical foundations: The approach is grounded in the MDL principle, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the method.
