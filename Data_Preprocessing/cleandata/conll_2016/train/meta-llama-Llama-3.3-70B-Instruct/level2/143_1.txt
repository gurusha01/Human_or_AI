Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces two novel methods, multiCluster and multiCCA, for estimating multilingual word embeddings in a shared vector space. The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, multiQVEC-CCA, which addresses the limitations of the existing QVEC metric. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods and evaluation metric through extensive experiments on 59 languages, using a range of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics.
Main Contributions
1. MultiCluster and multiCCA methods: The paper proposes two dictionary-based methods for estimating multilingual word embeddings, which do not require parallel data.
2. MultiQVEC-CCA evaluation metric: The authors propose an improved evaluation metric, multiQVEC-CCA, which addresses the limitations of the existing QVEC metric and obtains better correlations with downstream tasks.
3. Web portal for evaluation: The paper introduces a web portal for evaluating multilingual word embeddings, which provides a suite of evaluation metrics and facilitates sound experimentation practices.
Strengths
1. Effective methods: The proposed multiCCA method consistently outperforms other methods in most evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.
2. Improved evaluation metric: The proposed multiQVEC-CCA metric obtains better correlations with downstream tasks, providing a more reliable evaluation metric.
3. Comprehensive experiments: The paper conducts extensive experiments on 59 languages, using a range of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed methods.
Weaknesses
1. Limited analysis of multiCluster method: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the multiCluster method, which may limit its understanding and adoption.
2. Dependence on dictionary quality: The proposed methods rely on the quality of the dictionaries used, which may affect their performance in practice.
3. Limited comparison to other methods: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison to other existing methods for multilingual word embeddings, which may limit the understanding of the proposed methods' strengths and weaknesses.
