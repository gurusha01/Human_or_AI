The paper introduces a novel word embedding method called positive-only projection (PoP), which utilizes a random projection matrix with a positive expected value. The authors claim that this approach enables the application of Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI), unlike methods with an expected value of 0, and that its efficiency is due to being a random projection method.
However, I have several concerns regarding the paper's clarity:
1. The distinction between the proposed method and existing random projection methods is unclear, making it difficult to understand the advantages claimed by the authors and whether they are substantiated.
2. The paper's arguments, starting from the introduction, are challenging to follow.
3. Certain arguments lack supporting evidence, such as:
- The sentence beginning with "in addition" on Line 114.
- The sentence starting with "Since" on Line 137.
- The sentence starting with "thus" on Line 154.
4. As someone familiar with vector space modeling but not an expert in random projections, I found it difficult to comprehend the underlying logic of this research from the paper alone. I believe a paper should be self-contained and accessible to those with some background in the field.
5. The paper contains numerous English errors (e.g., "To a large extend" on Line 86 and "such PPMI" on Line 142).
Furthermore, I question the decision to evaluate the method solely on the MEN dataset, as there are multiple standard benchmarks (including MEN, WordSim, SimLex, and others) that are typically used for such evaluations. Unless a compelling justification is provided, I think it is insufficient to only evaluate on one dataset.
I suggest that the authors significantly improve the paper's presentation and resubmit it to another conference.
