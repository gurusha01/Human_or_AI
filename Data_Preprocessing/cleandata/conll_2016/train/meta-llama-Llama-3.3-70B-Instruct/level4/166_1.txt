This paper presents a novel approach to multi-lingual named entity recognition, leveraging features extracted from Wikipedia. The method utilizes a cross-lingual Wikifier to identify corresponding English Wikipedia articles for phrases in a target language, and then employs features derived from these articles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new feature in both monolingual and direct transfer settings, where an English model is applied to a target language.
The paper is well-received, as it introduces an innovative feature for named entity recognition and conducts a comprehensive set of experiments to validate its usefulness. The analysis of low-resource languages and non-Latin scripts is particularly noteworthy.
However, it would be beneficial to investigate the impact of the proposed method on named entities not present in Wikipedia, in addition to the results already reported in the paper. An examination of how these entities are affected by the proposed approach would provide further insight.
The success of the proposed method is heavily reliant on the accuracy of the cross-lingual Wikifier. Given the additional complexity introduced by this step, it is essential to quantify the frequency of errors in prediction that can be attributed to errors in the Wikifier.
The poor performance of direct transfer on Tamil and Bengali when lexical features are incorporated raises questions about the potential for regularization of different feature classes. Specifically, it would be interesting to explore whether regularization techniques can be applied to prevent the model from becoming overly dependent on lexical features, particularly in cases where their addition leads to decreased performance.
