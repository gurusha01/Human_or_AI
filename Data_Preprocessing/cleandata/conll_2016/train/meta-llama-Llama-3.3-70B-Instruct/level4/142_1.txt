This paper investigates the application of probabilistic models, specifically Gaussian processes, to predict the target variable of post-editing time/rates for quality estimation of machine translation output. The manuscript is well-organized, with a clear introduction that effectively highlights the limitations of point estimates in quality estimation for real-world applications. The discussion of asymmetric risk scenarios and their corresponding estimators is particularly noteworthy.
The authors provide a thorough explanation of Gaussian processes, which, although lengthy, is a valuable introduction for readers unfamiliar with these concepts. The approach using Gaussian processes, including the selection of kernels and the application of warping, is clearly explained and easy to follow. The research questions posed by the paper are intriguing and well-formulated.
However, several questions and suggestions arise regarding the Results and Discussion sections, particularly in the context of Intrinsic Uncertainty Evaluation:
- The choice of post-editing rates over prediction (H)TER as the target variable warrants justification, as TER is a commonly predicted value in quality estimation research.
- The first paragraph of Section 3.2 is unclear, as it mentions a trend observed for fr-en and en-de that is not seen for en-es, despite the fact that NLL and NLPD values decrease significantly with warped GPs across all three datasets.
- Although the paper explicitly states that it does not aim to advance the state-of-the-art, given the use of standard 17 baseline features, it would be beneficial to include a point estimate model from existing research in the result tables to provide context for the overall quality of the models.
- The interpretation of NLL and NLPD values is challenging, making it tempting to rely on MAE values to gauge prediction differences. Since the paper argues against this approach, a qualitative analysis with concrete examples would help illustrate the significance of reductions in NLL and NLPD.
Section 4 is well-written and effectively explains the results in an intuitive manner.
Overall, the paper is commendable for highlighting the issues with point estimates in quality estimation, a challenging task where additional information, such as confidence intervals, is crucial. Although the submission does not advance the state-of-the-art or introduce significant novelty in modeling, its research questions and objectives are clearly stated and well-executed.
Minor issues include:
- In Section 4, "over and underestimates" should be replaced with "over- and underestimates."
- The caption for Figure 1 incorrectly states that the lines are blue and red, when they are actually blue and green.
- If a specific toolkit was used for Gaussian process modeling, it would be beneficial to cite it in the final paper.
