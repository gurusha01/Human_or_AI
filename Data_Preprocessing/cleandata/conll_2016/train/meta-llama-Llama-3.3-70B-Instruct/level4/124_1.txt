This manuscript presents a novel approach to sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features, specifically eye-movement patterns of human annotators, to create a new feature set. The authors assert that their work is the first to integrate cognitive features into the natural language processing (NLP) community.
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and clear, making it easy to comprehend.
2. The proposed idea has the potential to stimulate research in other NLP tasks due to its innovative nature.
Weaknesses:
1. The rationale behind utilizing cognitive features for sentiment analysis is not adequately substantiated. While these features may indicate reading ease, their utility in detecting sentiment polarities is unclear.
2. The incremental benefit of incorporating cognitive features, as evidenced by the comparison between Sn+Sr+Gz and Sn+Sr, is minimal.
3. Although the authors discuss the feasibility of their approach in Section 7, the justification, particularly the example in Section 7.2, is unconvincing, and it is unclear how this technique would be beneficial in such a scenario.
