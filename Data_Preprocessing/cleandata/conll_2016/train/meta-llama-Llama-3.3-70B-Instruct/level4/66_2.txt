Review - General Comments
========================
This paper proposes a dependency parser that integrates syntactic and semantic transitions, drawing inspiration from Henderson et al.'s (2008) joint parser. The authors highlight two primary distinctions: 
- the utilization of vectorial representations for the parser's entire state, rather than just the top elements of the stack or the last parser configurations
- the employment of a straightforward greedy search algorithm
The core concept revolves around leveraging stack LSTMs to enable the parser's state vector to retain memory of large-scoped syntactic features, which are crucial for semantic role labeling, such as the path between the predicate and the candidate role filler head.
The system's performance is evaluated on the CoNLL 2008 (English) and multilingual CoNLL 2009 datasets. The authors compare their system's results to previously reported performances, demonstrating competitive results compared to 2008 and 2009 systems, although less so compared to more recent proposals (as seen in the bottom of table 3). They note, however, that their system does not require hand-crafted features and is efficient due to the simple greedy algorithm.
The paper is well-written and presents a significant amount of work, building upon the recently popular LSTMs and applying them to the Henderson et al. algorithm, which now appears to have been visionary.
However, I have concerns regarding the choice of the simple greedy algorithm, as it renders the results incomparable to some of the cited works. Providing beam-searched performance would not have required significant additional work or space.
More Detailed Comments/Questions
================================
Section 2:
A clarification on the presence of both A1 and C-A1 links would enhance understanding of the paper's target task. 
A summary of the differences between the set of transitions used in this work and those of Henderson et al. should be provided, as it is currently challenging to discern what is directly reused and what is new or slightly modified.
Section 3.3:
The need for representations that concatenate the word predicate and its disambiguated sense seems redundant, given that disambiguated senses are specific to a predicate.
Section 4:
The organization of sections 4.1 and 4.2 is confusing regarding multilinguality. CoNLL 2008 focused on English, while the CoNLL 2009 shared task extended it to a few other languages.
