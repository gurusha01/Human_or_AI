This paper proposes a transition-based graph parser designed to handle the complex representations of the UCCA corpora, which instantiate a semantico-cognitive annotation scheme. The authors outline the key principles of a semantic-based annotation scheme, including being graph-based, having non-terminal nodes, and allowing discontinuous elements. Notably, these principles are not specific to semantic frameworks and could be applied to syntax or other representation layers. The authors introduce their work within the context of broad-coverage semantic parsing and present three sets of parsing experiments: phrase-based parsing, dependency parsing, and direct parsing of UCCA graphs using their proposed transition-based graph parser.
While I find this work intriguing, I have several concerns regarding the methodology and empirical justifications. The authors claim to be the first to propose a parser for a semantically-oriented scheme like theirs, but their transition sets do not specifically address the unique characteristics of such graphs. Many existing graph parsers, such as those proposed by Almeda and Martins (2014, 2015) and Ribeyre et al. (2014-2015), could be adapted for use on this dataset. I question why these existing parsers were not used as baselines or comparison points. Additionally, the phrase-based experiments using uparse could have been validated using another parser, such as the one proposed by Fernandez-Gonzales and Martins (2015).
The lack of comparison to other models and parsers is a significant limitation of this work. Given the abstract nature of the UCCA scheme, it would have been beneficial to use the same metrics as related shared tasks to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Despite these concerns, I believe this paper should be discussed at a conference like ConLL, as it contributes to the ongoing exploration of semantic parsing.
Some additional notes and suggestions:
* The concept of "grounded semantic" should be introduced earlier in the paper.
* The authors could have explored using constituent trees with rich node labels and propagator traces, trained and parsed with the Berkeley parser, as a baseline.
* The conversion to surface dependency trees may be unnecessary, and a richer conversion, such as the one proposed by Schluter et al. (2014), could be used instead.
* The authors should provide more information or examples to clarify the concept of "UCCA graphs may contain implicit units that have no correspondent in the text."
* The scheme's ability to model quantifier scope information is unclear, and its comparability to other syntax-oriented schemes is limited.
* The three principles devised by the authors seem ad-hoc and could be better motivated within a clearer introduction.
* An error analysis would be useful to understand the challenges of parsing the UCCA scheme and to provide more insight into the results.
