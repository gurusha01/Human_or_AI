This paper lacks transparency regarding its methodology, citing 'non-disclosure restrictions' as the reason. As a result, the learning algorithm, training data, and other utilized resources remain unclear, leaving readers without any actionable insights to inform their own sentiment analysis approaches. The primary purpose of sharing research is to facilitate knowledge exchange and advancement, which is hindered by the absence of crucial details in this submission. Consequently, it does not qualify as a research paper suitable for this conference. A more appropriate outlet might be a demo session, but even in that context, a more detailed explanation of the methods employed would be necessary to justify inclusion.
