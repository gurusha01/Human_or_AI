This manuscript explores the cross-lingual direct transfer of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, leveraging a recently developed cross-lingual wikification model. While the underlying concept may not be highly innovative, as it builds upon existing technologies rather than introducing novel core methodologies, the work is commendable for its coherent narrative, supported by comprehensive experiments and empirical evidence that yield convincing results. The contribution primarily lies in its incremental advancement, combining two significant research trajectories: direct transfer for downstream NLP tasks like NER, parsing, or POS tagging, and recent advancements in cross-lingual wikification technology.
The discussion of related work would benefit from a more detailed analysis of how this research relates to and differs from preceding studies, such as Kazama and Torisawa (2007), and other NER systems that have utilized Wikipedia knowledge. Clarifying these distinctions would enhance the readability and contextual understanding of the manuscript.
The authors' decision to exclude POS tags as features is justified, but conducting and reporting experiments that include POS tags, similar to those by Tackstrom et al., could provide valuable insights into the utility of such features across different languages, particularly where universal POS tags are available.
Incorporating a running example in Section 3.3 could improve clarity, as the current description of the modified model from Tsai and Roth may not be entirely lucid for all readers.
Given the orthogonal nature of the approaches by Tackstrom et al. (2012) and Nothman et al. (2012) to the proposed method, preliminary results combining these models for a selection of languages could enrich the discussion. Similarly, comparing the outcomes with a strong projection baseline would offer a more comprehensive context, highlighting the advantages and limitations of wikification-based approaches.
The observation that Dutch is the best training language for Spanish, and Spanish for Yoruba, warrants further exploration. A deeper analysis of these findings could reveal interesting patterns beyond mere statistical coincidence.
The results presented in Table 4, while sound in concept, show only marginal improvements and not consistently across all scenarios. Conducting and reporting statistical significance tests for these results could bolster the manuscript's claims.
Minor suggestions include:
- Noting in Section 2.1 that projection methods not requiring parallel data, such as those leveraging bilingual semantic spaces, can enhance model applicability, especially for languages with limited resources.
- A thorough proofreading to correct typos and improve clarity, such as the first sentence of Section 3 and other identified instances throughout the manuscript.
