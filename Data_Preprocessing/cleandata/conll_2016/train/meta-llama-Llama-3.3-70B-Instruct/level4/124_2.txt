This manuscript proposes the incorporation of eye-tracking features as a cognitive aspect for sentiment analysis, a notion that I find intriguing. The authors' exploration of features and comparison of feature sets is well-organized and informative, providing clarity on the approach. Additionally, the feasibility of the method is adequately addressed in Section 7.
The discussion on features is clear and helpful, and I appreciate the effort to evaluate the approach's feasibility. However, I suggest that using domain-specific datasets, rather than combining datasets from different domains such as movie reviews and tweets, could enhance the evaluation. This separation might improve the predictive performance for each domain and facilitate easier interpretation of the results. For instance, the results in Table 2 appear modest compared to state-of-the-art results on the Pang and Lee dataset but are more favorable when compared to Twitter data.
I would like to confirm that there are no overlapping snippets between the training and testing data for datasets 1 and 2, as described in Section 3.3, despite originating from the same sources, such as Pang & Lee and Sentiment 140. A minor suggestion is to reconsider the use of bold formatting, as it can be distracting in some instances.
