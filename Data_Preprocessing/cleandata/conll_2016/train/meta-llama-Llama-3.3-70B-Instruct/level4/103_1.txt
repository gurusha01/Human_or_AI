This paper presents a novel approach to assessing topic quality by leveraging word embeddings to compute similarity, either directly or through matrix factorization, yielding impressive outcomes on benchmark datasets.
The proposed approach constitutes a logical and significant advancement in the trajectory of research on topic evaluation. However, the results raised concerns due to the inconsistencies in the performance of different methods across datasets. Although the method achieves state-of-the-art results on all three datasets, no single proposed method consistently outperforms the state of the art, and the SVD-based methods perform notably poorly on the genomics dataset. This inconsistency is a significant concern for practitioners seeking to apply the method to arbitrary datasets. The subpar performance of SVD on the genomics dataset may be attributed to the high proportion of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms, and it is possible to predict the best-performing method based on vocabulary matching with GloVe, but this aspect is not explored in the paper.
Several issues warrant attention:
- The proposed method bears similarities with approaches in the lexical chaining literature, which the authors should investigate and incorporate into future versions of the paper.
- While the method is claimed to be parameter-free, it relies on word embedding methods with a substantial number of implicit parameters, which deserves acknowledgement.
- The paper lacks a clear explanation of how the method handles OOV terms, such as those in the genomics dataset, which are not present in the pre-trained GloVe embeddings. Are these terms simply ignored, and what impact does this have on the method's performance?
Additionally, some low-level concerns need to be addressed:
- The description of word embeddings in Section 2.1 implicitly assumes that vector length is insignificant when using cosine similarity to measure vector similarity. However, this assumption is problematic since word2vec vectors are not inherently unit-length, and the pre-trained vectors have been normalized post-hoc.
- The graphs in Figure 1 are too small to be legible, hindering the interpretation of the results.
