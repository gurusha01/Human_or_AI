This paper explores the application of delexicalized transfer parsers and an unsupervised parser enhanced with external probabilities to the UD treebanks, yielding intriguing results.
To further enhance the paper, several suggestions are proposed. 
Regarding the comparison to McDonald et al. (2011), who reported an average accuracy of 61.7% across 8 languages, it is noted that the current study achieves 70.1% on the same languages using the UD treebanks. However, it should be explicitly stated that McDonald et al. could not utilize the UD treebanks due to their unavailability at the time.
The use of the Malt parser with its default feature set, as mentioned in footnote 9, raises questions. It is recommended to optimize the parser using MaltOptimizer, as this could potentially lead to improved results. Similarly, the MSTParser could also benefit from optimization. Furthermore, the employment of more recent parsers that have demonstrated superior performance on universal dependencies, particularly in leave-one-out setups, is suggested. For instance, the claim that the unsupervised parser excels for languages from less resourced language families could be reassessed using these newer parsers.
The incorporation of external probabilities appears to be an arbitrary decision, as evidenced by Tables 3-4, particularly Table 3. More detailed explanations or a series of experiments are necessary to validate the effectiveness of these probabilities.
Several relevant papers are recommended for consideration, including "Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing with Universal Dependencies and Predicted PoS Labels" by J Tiedemann, and "One model, two languages: training bilingual parsers with harmonized treebanks" by D Vilares, MA Alonso, and C Gómez-Rodríguez, which presents results using MaltParser. Additionally, papers on more recent parsers, such as "Crosslingual dependency parsing based on distributed representations" by Jiang Guo et al., and "Many languages, one parser" by W Ammar et al., could provide valuable insights.
Minor points include the suggestion to remove Table 1, as the information can be referenced in a footnote to the UD website, and potentially retaining Table 2 due to the probabilities presented.
