This paper introduces a novel approach, to my knowledge, by framing various sentence pair scoring tasks, such as Answer Set Scoring, RTE, and Paraphrasing, as specific instances of a broader task focused on understanding semantic relationships between sentences. The authors also explore the potential of developing universally applicable neural network models for this family of tasks. I find this proposal exciting and worthy of presentation at CoNLL, as well as further discussion and investigation.
However, my primary concern with the paper is that it appears incomplete. To be considered for publication, it should be conditional on the inclusion of several updates in the final version:
1. The initial results table must be completed to provide a comprehensive overview.
2. Given the extensive number of individual results, the written discussion is insufficient and requires more in-depth interpretation and analysis.
3. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new, more challenging dataset, which is not delivered in the paper. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.
4. The results exhibit significant variability across different tasks. An investigation into the reasons behind the models' failures and successes in various tasks would be beneficial. Even if no conclusive answer is found, the authors' perspective on whether this discrepancy is due to modeling issues or task dissimilarity would be valuable. It is essential to question whether grouping these tasks into a unified whole is effective.
5. Including example instances of the various datasets, comprising both prototypical and problematic sentence pairs for classification, would enhance the paper.
6. The Ubu. RNN transfer learning model is recommended for new tasks, but it is unclear whether this is due to the nature of the data or the dataset size. Further clarification on how to determine the answer to this question would be helpful.
Despite the paper's unpolished state, its approach has the potential to generate interesting discussions, and I would be pleased to see it published in a more refined form. I acknowledge that other reviewers may not share this opinion.
On a minor note, there are a few language-related issues:
* The consistent use of "weigh" and "weighed" should be replaced with "weight" and "weighted" in the respective contexts.
* Several instances of "sentene" should be corrected to "sentence".
* The term "interpunction" is unclear and requires definition.
* One instance of "world overlap" should be corrected to "word overlap".
