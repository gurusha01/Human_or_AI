This paper presents a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures, which require the representation of multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors propose a transition-based parser, called Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), that supports these criteria and achieves competitive results on the UCCA Wikipedia corpus.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a transition-based parser that can handle broad-coverage semantic structures, which is a significant advancement in the field of semantic parsing.
2. The introduction of a novel set of features that are specifically designed to capture the complexities of broad-coverage semantic structures.
3. The evaluation of the parser on the UCCA Wikipedia corpus, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The parser achieves competitive results on the UCCA Wikipedia corpus, with a labeled F-score of 69.2% on primary edges.
2. The approach is novel and significant, as it addresses a long-standing challenge in semantic parsing.
3. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the parser, including an analysis of the feature sets and their contributions to the results.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The parser's performance on remote edges is relatively low, with a labeled F-score of 13.3%.
2. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other semantic parsing approaches, to provide a clearer understanding of the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
3. The evaluation of the parser is limited to the UCCA Wikipedia corpus, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the parser on other datasets to demonstrate its robustness.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the relatively low performance on remote edges, and what strategies could be employed to improve the parser's ability to predict these edges?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the feature sets and their contributions to the results, to help understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach?
3. Are there any plans to evaluate the parser on other datasets, such as the CoNLL 2008 and 2009 datasets, to demonstrate its robustness and compare its performance with other semantic parsing approaches?
