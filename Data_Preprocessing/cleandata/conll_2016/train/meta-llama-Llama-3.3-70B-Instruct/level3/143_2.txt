This paper proposes a novel approach to cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a cross-lingual wikifier to disambiguate words and phrases to the English Wikipedia. The proposed model is language-independent and can be applied to all languages in Wikipedia, with the only requirement being a Wikipedia dump. The authors evaluate their model on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages, and show significant improvements over strong baselines.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The proposal of a language-independent model for cross-lingual NER using a cross-lingual wikifier.
2. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed model on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages.
3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed model is novel and effective, showing significant improvements over strong baselines.
2. The evaluation is thorough, covering a wide range of languages and settings.
3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features provides valuable insights into the factors that affect the performance of the proposed model.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The proposed model relies on the quality of the cross-lingual wikifier, which may not always be accurate.
2. The model may not perform well on languages with limited Wikipedia coverage.
3. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art models for cross-lingual NER.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of limited Wikipedia coverage for certain languages?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art models for cross-lingual NER?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the accuracy of the cross-lingual wikifier, which is a crucial component of the proposed model?
