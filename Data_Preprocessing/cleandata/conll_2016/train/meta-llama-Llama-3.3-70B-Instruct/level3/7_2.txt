Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics by grouping topic words into thematic groups or buckets. The approach uses three techniques: TBuckets-Clustering, TBuckets-SVD, and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which are evaluated on three publicly available datasets. The results show that TBuckets-SVD-Reorg outperforms the state-of-the-art on two out of three datasets, and the approach is also useful for weakly supervised text classification.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a new approach, TBuckets, to measure topic quality, which is based on grouping topic words into buckets.
2. Evaluation: The approach is evaluated on three publicly available datasets, and the results show that TBuckets-SVD-Reorg outperforms the state-of-the-art on two out of three datasets.
3. Parameter-Free: The techniques TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg require no parameter tuning, which is a significant advantage over the state-of-the-art technique.
Strengths
1. Effective Approach: The proposed approach, TBuckets, is effective in measuring topic quality, as shown by the evaluation results.
2. No Parameter Tuning: The techniques TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg require no parameter tuning, which makes them more practical and easier to use.
3. Useful for Text Classification: The approach is also useful for weakly supervised text classification, as demonstrated by the experiments.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Clarity: The paper lacks clarity in explaining the core difference between the proposed method and previous random projection methods.
2. Difficult to Follow: The paper's arguments are hard to follow, starting from the introduction, and some arguments are not supported with proper evidence or justification.
3. Limited Evaluation: The evaluation is limited to only three datasets, and the paper could benefit from more extensive evaluation on multiple standard benchmarks.
4. English Mistakes: The paper contains numerous English mistakes, which makes it difficult to understand and follow.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more clarification on the core difference between the proposed method and previous random projection methods?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of limited evaluation, and what additional datasets do you plan to use for future evaluation?
3. Can you provide more details on the reorganization step in TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, and how it improves the performance of the approach?
