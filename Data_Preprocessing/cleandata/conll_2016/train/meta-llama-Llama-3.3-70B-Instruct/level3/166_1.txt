This paper proposes a novel approach to cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) using a cross-lingual wikifier to disambiguate words and phrases to English Wikipedia entries. The proposed model is language-independent and can be applied to all languages in Wikipedia, requiring only a multilingual Wikipedia dump.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The development of a language-independent NER model using cross-lingual wikification, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both monolingual and cross-lingual settings.
2. The introduction of wikifier features, which are truly delexicalized and can be used to transfer an NER model directly across languages.
3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages with non-Latin scripts.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on both monolingual and cross-lingual settings.
2. The use of wikifier features provides a novel and effective way to transfer an NER model across languages.
3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size provides valuable insights into the performance of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The dependence of the proposed approach on the accuracy of the cross-lingual wikifier, which may lead to errors in the prediction.
2. The potential limitation of the approach in handling entities not present on Wikipedia.
3. The need for further research to incorporate other techniques for multilingual NER, such as parallel projection and generating training data from Wikipedia automatically.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the approach in handling entities not present on Wikipedia?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the cross-lingual wikifier used in the proposed approach and its accuracy?
3. How do the authors plan to incorporate other techniques for multilingual NER into the proposed approach?
