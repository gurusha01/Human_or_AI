Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The paper evaluates TBuckets on three publicly available datasets and demonstrates better performance than the state-of-the-art results. Additionally, the paper highlights the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.
2. Improved Performance: TBuckets outperforms the state-of-the-art results on two out of three datasets, and its SVD-based techniques require no parameter tuning.
3. Utility in Text Classification: The paper demonstrates the usefulness of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification, where it can help select high-quality topics for human annotation.
Strengths
1. Innovative Idea: The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to measure topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.
2. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance over the state-of-the-art results on two out of three datasets.
3. No Parameter Tuning: The SVD-based techniques of TBuckets require no parameter tuning, making it a more practical and efficient approach.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Clarity: Some sections of the paper are difficult to read and could be improved with rephrasing and running examples.
2. Limited Evaluation: The paper evaluates TBuckets on only three datasets, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its generalizability.
3. Unclear Explanation: The explanation of some concepts, such as the reorganization step in TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, is unclear and requires further clarification.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the selection of compounds, frequency ranges, and judgment procedures in the dataset?
2. Can you clarify the explanation of the reorganization step in TBuckets-SVD-Reorg and provide more examples to illustrate its effectiveness?
3. How do you plan to extend TBuckets to other applications beyond text classification, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
