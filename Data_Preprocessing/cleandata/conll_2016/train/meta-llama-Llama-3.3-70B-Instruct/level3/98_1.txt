This paper presents a comparison of delexicalized transfer parsing and minimally supervised parsing techniques on 32 languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank collection. The authors achieve an average attachment score of 70.1% using a delexicalized transfer parser, which outperforms the minimally supervised parser. However, the minimally supervised parser performs better on non-Indo-European languages, making it a suitable choice for low-resourced languages without existing treebanks.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The evaluation of delexicalized transfer parsers and minimally supervised parsers on a large set of languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank collection.
2. The demonstration that minimally supervised parsers can be competitive with delexicalized transfer parsers, especially for non-Indo-European languages.
3. The introduction of a minimally supervised parser that uses external prior probabilities to improve parsing accuracy.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The use of a large and diverse set of languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank collection, which allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the parsing techniques.
2. The comparison of delexicalized transfer parsers and minimally supervised parsers, which provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
3. The achievement of a high average attachment score of 70.1% using a delexicalized transfer parser, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The comparison with McDonald et al. (2011) is incomplete, as it does not mention that the Universal Dependencies treebanks were not available at that time.
2. The use of MaltParser with default settings may not be optimal, and the authors could have explored other parser settings or more recent parsers.
3. The choice of external probabilities for the minimally supervised parser seems arbitrary and lacks justification, and the authors could have provided more details or experiments to validate their use.
4. The paper could have benefited from a more thorough discussion of related work on cross-lingual dependency parsing and universal dependencies.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of external probabilities for the minimally supervised parser and how they were validated?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of over-training on Indo-European languages and improve the performance of the delexicalized transfer parser on non-Indo-European languages?
3. Can you compare your results with other recent works on cross-lingual dependency parsing and universal dependencies, and discuss the implications of your findings for the field?
