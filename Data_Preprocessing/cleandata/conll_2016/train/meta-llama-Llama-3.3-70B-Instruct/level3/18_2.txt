Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel approach, TBuckets, for measuring the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than the state-of-the-art results.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a new approach, TBuckets, for measuring topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.
2. Parameter-Free Techniques: The authors introduce two parameter-free techniques, TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which outperform the state-of-the-art techniques that require multiple parameter tuning.
3. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance of TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, with TBuckets-SVD-Reorg outperforming the state-of-the-art on two out of three datasets.
Strengths
1. Effective Use of Word Embeddings: The paper effectively uses word embeddings to compute semantic similarities between topic words, which is a key component of the TBuckets approach.
2. Simple and Intuitive Methodology: The TBuckets approach is simple and intuitive, making it easy to understand and implement.
3. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance of TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Evaluation: The paper only evaluates TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, which may not be representative of all possible datasets.
2. Lack of Theoretical Analysis: The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the TBuckets approach, which may make it difficult to understand the underlying principles of the method.
3. Dependence on Word Embeddings: The paper relies heavily on word embeddings, which may not always be available or accurate for all domains or languages.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend TBuckets to other domains or languages where word embeddings may not be available or accurate?
2. Can the authors provide a theoretical analysis of the TBuckets approach to understand its underlying principles and limitations?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate TBuckets on larger and more diverse datasets to demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness?
