Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: TBuckets-Clustering, TBuckets-SVD, and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than the state-of-the-art results. They also highlight the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure topic quality, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.
2. Improved Performance: The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms the state-of-the-art results on two out of three datasets.
3. Parameter-Free Techniques: The paper introduces two parameter-free techniques, TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which require no parameter tuning.
Strengths
1. Effective Use of Word Embeddings: The paper effectively uses word embeddings to compute semantic similarities between topic words.
2. Simple and Intuitive Approach: The TBuckets approach is simple and intuitive, making it easy to understand and implement.
3. Improved Performance on Weakly Supervised Text Classification: The paper demonstrates the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification, which is a significant application of topic modeling.
Weaknesses
1. Inconsistent Performance Across Datasets: The paper reports inconsistent performance across datasets, with none of the proposed methods consistently beating the state-of-the-art.
2. Impact of Out-of-Vocabulary Terms: The paper does not adequately address the impact of out-of-vocabulary terms on the performance of TBuckets.
3. Lack of Comparison with Other Topic Coherence Measures: The paper does not compare TBuckets with other topic coherence measures, such as CUCI and CUMASS.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the inconsistent performance of TBuckets across datasets?
2. Can you provide more insights into the impact of out-of-vocabulary terms on the performance of TBuckets?
3. How do you plan to extend TBuckets to other applications, such as document summarization and sentiment analysis?
