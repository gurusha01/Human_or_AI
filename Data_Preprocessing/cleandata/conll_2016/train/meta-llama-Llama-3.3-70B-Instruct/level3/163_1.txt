This paper presents a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures, which are directed acyclic graphs that support multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. The authors propose two complementary parsing strategies: a conversion-based approach, which converts the semantic structures into existing formalisms such as constituency trees or dependency trees, and a direct approach, which uses a transition-based parser to predict the semantic structures directly.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a novel transition-based parser, called Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), which supports the three criteria of broad-coverage semantic structures.
2. The exploration of a conversion-based parsing approach to assess the ability of existing technology to address the task.
3. The first experimentation on UCCA parsing, which is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation scheme.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The paper presents a clear and well-written description of the problem and the proposed solutions.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including a comparison with existing parsers and an analysis of the feature sets used by the parser.
3. The results show that the proposed parser achieves a high F-score on primary edges and is able to predict some remote edges, which is a significant improvement over existing parsers.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The paper lacks new ideas or methods in NLP or ML, as the proposed approach is based on existing techniques such as transition-based parsing and conversion-based parsing.
2. The authors do not provide an extensive review of the existing literature on POS tagging and POS induction using word embeddings, which is a related area of research.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the parser and the potential ways to improve its performance.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to improve the performance of the parser on remote edges, which is currently lower than on primary edges?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the feature sets used by the parser and how they were selected?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other semantic representation schemes, such as AMR or MRS?
