This paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics by grouping topic words into thematic groups or buckets. The authors explore three techniques for creating buckets of words: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The paper evaluates these techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrates better performance than state-of-the-art results.
Summary of the paper:
The paper introduces the concept of topic quality and its importance in text mining techniques. It proposes the TBuckets approach, which uses word embeddings and three techniques to group topic words into buckets. The authors evaluate the performance of these techniques using Pearson's r correlation coefficient and compare it with state-of-the-art results. The paper also demonstrates the usefulness of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification.
Main contributions:
1. The TBuckets approach, which groups topic words into thematic groups or buckets to measure topic quality.
2. Three techniques for creating buckets of words: clustering-based, SVD, and SVD with reorganization.
3. Evaluation of the techniques on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating better performance than state-of-the-art results.
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a novel approach to measure topic quality, which is a crucial aspect of text mining techniques.
2. The authors evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques on publicly available datasets, making it easy to replicate the results.
3. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification, which is a significant application of topic modeling.
Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks details on the methods used to produce the results due to non-disclosure restrictions, making it difficult for readers to understand and replicate the approach.
2. The absence of information on the learning algorithm and training data limits the paper's usefulness for readers seeking to improve their own sentiment analysis methods.
3. The paper is not suitable for a research conference as it fails to share meaningful research contributions and would be better suited for a demo session.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the methods used to produce the results, such as the learning algorithm and training data?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of non-disclosure restrictions and make the approach more accessible to readers?
3. Can you provide more insights into the applications of TBuckets beyond weakly supervised text classification?
