This paper proposes a language-independent method for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a cross-lingual wikifier to disambiguate words and phrases to the English Wikipedia. The approach is based on the idea of using Wikipedia categories and FreeBase types as language-independent features for NER. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages, and show significant improvements over strong baselines.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The proposal of a language-independent method for NER using a cross-lingual wikifier, which can be applied to all languages in Wikipedia.
2. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages.
3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposal of a novel approach to NER that can be applied to multiple languages, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. The thorough evaluation of the proposed method on a wide range of languages, including low-resource languages, which demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.
3. The analysis of the quality of wikifier features and their dependence on Wikipedia size, which provides insights into the limitations and potential improvements of the proposed method.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The reliance on Wikipedia data, which may not be available or up-to-date for all languages, and may introduce biases in the proposed method.
2. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for NER, which makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method.
3. The limited analysis of the proposed method's performance on different types of entities and languages, which may hide important limitations and areas for improvement.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of Wikipedia data availability and quality for low-resource languages?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for NER, including their strengths and weaknesses?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their method to handle other types of entities and languages, and to improve its performance on low-resource languages?
