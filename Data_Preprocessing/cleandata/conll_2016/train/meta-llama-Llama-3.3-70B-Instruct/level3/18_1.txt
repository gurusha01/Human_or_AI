This paper presents a transition-based graph parser for the UCCA (Universal Cognitive Conceptual Annotation) corpora, which is a semantico-cognitive annotation scheme that allows for graph-based representations with non-terminal nodes and discontinuous elements. The authors propose two parsing strategies: a conversion-based approach that converts UCCA structures to related formalisms (dependency trees and discontinuous constituency trees) and trains existing parsers on the converted structures, and a direct approach that uses a novel transition-based parser, called Broad-coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), which supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.
The paper's main contributions are:
1. The proposal of a transition-based parser for UCCA, which is the first parser to support multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.
2. The exploration of a conversion-based parsing approach to assess the ability of existing technology to address the task.
3. The experimentation with UCCA parsing, which shows that UCCA can be parsed with 69.2% primary F-score.
The strengths of the paper are:
1. The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by proposing a parser for UCCA, which is a widely used annotation scheme.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including a comparison with existing parsers and an analysis of the results.
3. The paper highlights the importance of considering the structural properties of semantic representations, such as multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units.
The weaknesses of the paper are:
1. The authors' claim of being the first to propose a parser for a semantically-oriented scheme is questionable, as there are existing works that could be applied to the UCCA dataset.
2. The use of a specific feature template anchors the model to the UCCA scheme, which may limit its applicability to other semantic representation schemes.
3. The paper lacks a comparison with other graph parsers, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, the authors could:
1. Provide a more detailed comparison with existing graph parsers and semantic representation schemes.
2. Introduce the concept of "grounded semantic" earlier in the paper to provide a clearer motivation for the proposed approach.
3. Use a richer conversion to surface dependency trees to improve the accuracy of the conversion-based approach.
4. Provide more information on implicit units in UCCA graphs, which are currently not addressed by the proposed parser.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of semantic parsing, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other semantic representation schemes. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and limitations of the paper to provide a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of their approach. 
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of implicit units in UCCA graphs, which are currently not addressed by the proposed parser?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other graph parsers and semantic representation schemes, such as MRS and DRT?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other languages, given the cross-linguistically applicable nature of UCCA?
