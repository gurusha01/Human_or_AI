Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than the state-of-the-art results.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a new approach, TBuckets, to measure topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.
2. Parameter-Free Techniques: The authors propose two parameter-free techniques, TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, which outperform the state-of-the-art techniques that require multiple parameter tuning.
3. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance of TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, with TBuckets-SVD-Reorg outperforming the state-of-the-art on two out of three datasets.
Strengths
1. Effective Use of Word Embeddings: The paper effectively uses word embeddings to compute semantic similarities between words, which is essential for grouping topic words into buckets.
2. Simple and Intuitive Approach: The TBuckets approach is simple and intuitive, making it easy to understand and implement.
3. Improved Performance: The paper demonstrates improved performance of TBuckets on three publicly available datasets, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Direct Comparison: The paper lacks a direct comparison to related work in the field, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the contributions.
2. Non-Standard Datasets: The paper uses non-standard datasets for evaluation, which may not be representative of the broader topic modeling community.
3. Error in Figure 1: The paper contains an error in Figure 1, which only shows two lines instead of three, which may indicate a lack of attention to detail.
4. Typos and Clarity: The paper contains typos and lacks clarity in some sections, which may make it difficult for readers to understand the contributions.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide a direct comparison to related work in the field, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?
2. Can you explain why you chose to use non-standard datasets for evaluation, and how you plan to address the lack of representativeness of these datasets?
3. Can you provide more details on the error in Figure 1 and how you plan to correct it?
4. Can you clarify the definition of Kendall's tau used in the paper, as it is not standard and may be unclear to readers?
