Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, called buckets, and computes a coherence score based on the properties of the words in the largest bucket. The approach uses three techniques: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The paper evaluates TBuckets on three publicly available datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness in measuring topic coherence and its usefulness in weakly supervised text classification.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Approach: The paper proposes a new approach, TBuckets, to measure topic coherence, which is based on grouping topic words into thematic groups.
2. Effective Evaluation: The paper evaluates TBuckets on three publicly available datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness in measuring topic coherence.
3. Usefulness in Text Classification: The paper highlights the utility of TBuckets in weakly supervised text classification, where it can be used to evaluate the quality of topics and select high-quality topics for human annotation.
Strengths
1. Simple and Effective: The TBuckets approach is simple and effective in measuring topic coherence, and it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on two out of three datasets.
2. No Parameter Tuning: The SVD-based techniques, TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg, require no parameter tuning, making them more practical and efficient.
3. Useful in Text Classification: The paper demonstrates the usefulness of TBuckets in weakly supervised text classification, which can lead to improved classification performance.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Theoretical Justification: The paper lacks a theoretical justification for the TBuckets approach, which makes it difficult to understand why it works.
2. Limited Evaluation: The paper evaluates TBuckets on only three datasets, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
3. No Comparison with Other Techniques: The paper does not compare TBuckets with other techniques, such as word embeddings-based approaches, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide a theoretical justification for the TBuckets approach and explain why it is effective in measuring topic coherence?
2. How does TBuckets perform on datasets with different characteristics, such as size, domain, and language?
3. Can you compare TBuckets with other techniques, such as word embeddings-based approaches, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
