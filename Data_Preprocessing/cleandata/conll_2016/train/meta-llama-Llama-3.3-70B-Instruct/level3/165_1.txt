This paper proposes a novel approach to parsing broad-coverage semantic structures, which are directed acyclic graphs that represent the semantic meaning of a sentence. The authors introduce a transition-based parser, called Broad-Coverage Semantic Parser (BSP), that supports multiple parents, non-terminal nodes, and discontinuous units. They also explore a conversion-based parsing approach, where existing parsers are used to parse the sentence into a different representation, which is then converted back to the original broad-coverage semantic structure.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a novel transition-based parser, BSP, that supports broad-coverage semantic structures.
2. The exploration of a conversion-based parsing approach, which assesses the ability of existing technology to address the task.
3. The first experimentation on UCCA parsing, which is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation scheme.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the proposed parser and the conversion-based approach.
2. The experimental results show that the proposed parser achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art parsers, and the conversion-based approach provides a useful upper bound for the performance of the parser.
3. The paper highlights the importance of exploring different semantic representations and parsing approaches to improve the performance of semantic parsing tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The paper lacks a thorough comparison with related work on semantic parsing, particularly on the UCCA representation scheme.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by the parser, which could provide insights into the limitations of the approach.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the potential applications of the proposed parser and the UCCA representation scheme.
Some questions to the authors are:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the proposed parser, particularly in terms of handling discontinuous units and non-terminal nodes?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the conversion procedures used in the conversion-based approach, and how they can be improved?
3. How do the authors envision the proposed parser being used in real-world applications, such as machine translation or summarization?
