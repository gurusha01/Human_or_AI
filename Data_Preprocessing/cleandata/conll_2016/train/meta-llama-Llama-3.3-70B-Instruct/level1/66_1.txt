This paper presents a novel approach to joint syntactic and semantic dependency parsing, leveraging recent advances in representation learning to bypass expensive feature extraction. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Joint parsing model: The authors propose a transition-based parser that jointly produces syntactic and semantic dependencies, using a stack LSTM to learn a representation of the entire algorithm state.
2. Greedy inference algorithm: The parser uses a greedy inference algorithm with linear time complexity, making it efficient and scalable.
3. State-of-the-art performance: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL 2008 and 2009 English tasks, outperforming previous joint parsing models.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a new approach to joint parsing, leveraging representation learning to bypass expensive feature extraction.
2. Efficient algorithm: The greedy inference algorithm has linear time complexity, making it efficient and scalable.
3. State-of-the-art performance: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL 2008 and 2009 English tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. Limited comparison: The authors only compare their model to a limited set of previous joint parsing models, and do not provide a comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art models.
2. Lack of analysis: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance, including error analysis and ablation studies.
3. Dependence on pretrained embeddings: The model relies on pretrained word embeddings, which may not be available for all languages or domains.
Questions to authors:
1. How does the model perform on other languages and domains, and what are the limitations of the approach?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance, including error analysis and ablation studies?
3. How does the model compare to other state-of-the-art models, including those that use expert-crafted features and more complex inference algorithms?
