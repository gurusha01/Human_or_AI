Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach, called TBuckets, to measure the quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics learned from text. TBuckets groups topic words into thematic groups, or buckets, and uses the properties of these buckets to compute a coherence score for a topic. The approach uses three techniques for creating buckets: clustering-based, singular value decomposition (SVD), and SVD with reorganization. The authors evaluate their techniques on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art results. They also highlight the utility of TBuckets for weakly supervised text classification.
Main Contributions
1. Novel approach to topic coherence measurement: TBuckets provides a new perspective on measuring topic coherence by grouping topic words into buckets, which is different from existing approaches that rely on word co-occurrence or semantic similarity.
2. Three techniques for creating buckets: The authors propose three techniques for creating buckets, including clustering-based, SVD, and SVD with reorganization, which provides a range of options for measuring topic coherence.
3. State-of-the-art performance: TBuckets outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on two out of three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in measuring topic coherence.
Strengths
1. Novelty of the approach: TBuckets provides a fresh perspective on topic coherence measurement, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Effectiveness of the approach: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TBuckets in measuring topic coherence, which is a crucial aspect of topic modeling.
3. Utility in text classification: The authors highlight the utility of TBuckets in weakly supervised text classification, which is a significant application of topic modeling.
Weaknesses
1. Limited evaluation: The authors evaluate TBuckets on only three datasets, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
2. Lack of parameter tuning: While the authors claim that TBuckets-SVD and TBuckets-SVD-Reorg require no parameter tuning, it is unclear how the techniques would perform with different parameter settings.
3. Limited comparison to existing techniques: The authors compare TBuckets to only one state-of-the-art technique, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of its performance relative to other existing techniques.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend TBuckets to other applications beyond text classification?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of word embeddings and their impact on the performance of TBuckets?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of limited evaluation and provide a more comprehensive understanding of TBuckets' performance?
