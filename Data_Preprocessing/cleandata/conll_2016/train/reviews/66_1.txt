This paper presents a Stack LSTM parser based on the work of Henderson et al.
(2008, 2013) on joint syntactic/semantic transition-based parsing and Dyer et
al. (2015) on stack LSTM syntactic parsing. The use of the transition system
from the former and the stack LSTM from the latter shows interesting results
compared to the joint systems on the CoNLL 2008 and 2009 shared tasks.
I like this paper a lot because it is well-written, well-explained, the related
work is good and the results are very interesting. The methodology is sound
(with a minor concern regarding the Chinese embeddings, leading me to believe
than very good embeddings can be more informative than a very clever model...).
Moreover, the description of the system is clear, the hyperparameters are
justified and the discussion is interesting.
The only thing I would say is that the proposed system lacks originality in the
sense that the work of Henderson et al. puts the basis of semi-synchronised
joint syntax-semantic transition-based parsing several years ago and Dyer et
al. came up with the stack LSTM last year, so it is not a new method, per say.
But in my opinion, we were waiting for such a parser to be designed and so I'm
glad it was done here.
