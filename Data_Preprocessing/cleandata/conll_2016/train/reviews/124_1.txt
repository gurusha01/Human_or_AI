This paper proposed a very interesting idea of using cognitive features for
sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. More specifically, the eye-movement
patterns of human annotators are recorded to derive a new set of features. The
authors claim that this is the first work to include cognitive features into
the NLP community. 
Strength: 
1. The paper is generally well written and easy to follow
2. Very interesting idea which may inspire research in other NLP tasks.
Weakness:
1. The motivation of using cognitive features for sentiment analysis is not
very well justified. I can imagine these features may help reflect the reading
ease, but I don't see why they are helpful in detecting sentiment polarities.
2. The improvement is marginal after considering cognitive features by
comparing Sn+Sr+Gz with Sn+Sr.
3. Although the authors discussed about the feasibility of the approach in
Section 7, but I'm not convinced, especially about the example given in section
7.2, I don't see why this technique is helpful in such a scenario.
