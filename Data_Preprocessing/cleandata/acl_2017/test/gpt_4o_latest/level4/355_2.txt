This paper introduces novel prediction models for the Japanese Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task by leveraging the state-of-the-art English model proposed by Zhou and Xu (2015). Additionally, the authors enhance this model by incorporating the Grid-RNN framework to effectively capture interactions among arguments of multiple predicates.
The evaluation is conducted on a widely recognized benchmark dataset for Japanese SRL, demonstrating a significant performance improvement over the current state-of-the-art system.
Strengths:  
The paper is well-organized and presents a clear motivation for the proposed approach.  
The proposed model achieves higher accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art system.  
Moreover, the Grid-RNN-based model slightly outperforms the proposed single-sequential model, primarily due to its improved handling of zero arguments, which is a central focus of this work.
Weakness:  
From my perspective, the primary contribution of this paper lies in extending the single-sequential model to a multi-sequential one. However, the impact of predicate interactions appears to be somewhat smaller than that reported by Ouchi et al. (2015). Additionally, there exists prior work (Shibata et al., 2016) that extends the model of Ouchi et al. (2015) using neural network techniques. A comparison with this prior work would have been insightful.
