Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces an LSTM-based model for classifying connective uses to determine whether they indicate causal relations. The primary contribution is the novel use of neural encoding to model causality, leveraging LSTMs to capture abstract representations of the context. The authors evaluate their method on the AltLex corpus, demonstrating modest but consistent improvements over baseline methods, including the state-of-the-art system by Hidey and McKeown (2016). The paper also provides TensorFlow-based implementations to facilitate replication, which is a commendable step toward reproducibility.
The secondary contribution is the exploration of the performance of independent versus sequential LSTM architectures, revealing that independent LSTMs perform better for this task. This finding is intriguing and warrants further investigation. Additionally, the paper highlights the limitations of traditional syntactic and lexical approaches to causality classification, arguing for the necessity of contextual encoding.
Strengths
1. Novelty of Approach: The use of LSTMs to encode the causal meaning of relations is a significant departure from traditional feature-based methods. The paper successfully demonstrates the advantages of neural models in handling abstract and context-dependent phenomena like causality.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are well-structured, and the results consistently outperform baselines, including the state-of-the-art. The use of both "non-bootstrapping" and "bootstrapping" versions of the AltLex corpus strengthens the evaluation.
3. Reproducibility: By providing TensorFlow-based implementations, the authors take an important step toward ensuring that their work can be independently verified and extended by others.
4. Insightful Observations: The finding that independent LSTM architectures outperform sequential ones is particularly noteworthy and could inspire future research into architectural choices for similar tasks.
Weaknesses
1. Introduction and Theoretical Clarity: The introduction reads more like a literature review and lacks a clear articulation of the paper's theoretical grounding. The discussion of causation theory is inconsistent, with conflicting references to counterfactual views and insufficient explanation of the adopted framework.
2. Figure 1 and Model Details: The diagram of the "Pair_LSTM" model is vague and lacks critical details about the layers and representations. This undermines the clarity of the proposed architecture.
3. Example Confusion: The interpretation of examples, particularly the one on line 256, is unclear. The paper does not adequately resolve issues related to event division and causal links, which could confuse readers.
4. Hyperparameter Choices: The paper does not provide a clear rationale for the hyperparameter settings that led to the best performance. This lack of interpretability could hinder the reproducibility of the results.
5. Padding and Relevance: The discussion of padding strategies (line 480) is confusing and does not adequately explain its relevance to the model's performance or the task at hand.
6. Validation of Claims: The claim about disambiguating the causal meaning of "which then" is interesting but insufficiently validated. Broader testing with diverse examples is needed to substantiate this claim.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify the theoretical framework of causation you are adopting? How do you reconcile the conflicting references to counterfactual and other views?
2. Could you provide more details about the architecture depicted in Figure 1, including the number of layers, activation functions, and how the inputs are processed?
3. How were the hyperparameters chosen? Was there a systematic search, and if so, what criteria were used to select the final values?
4. Can you elaborate on the significance of the padding strategies and their impact on the model's performance?
Conclusion
This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of causality classification by proposing a novel LSTM-based approach and demonstrating its effectiveness on a challenging dataset. However, the paper suffers from several weaknesses, particularly in its theoretical grounding, clarity of presentation, and interpretability of results. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the impact and usability of the work. While the paper is promising, it requires revisions to address these concerns before it can be fully endorsed for acceptance.
