Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates how neural machine translation (NMT) systems learn linguistic features, particularly morphology, through an analysis of their internal representations. The authors evaluate the quality of these representations using part-of-speech (POS) and morphological tagging tasks. The study explores several dimensions, including word-based vs. character-based representations, encoder depth, the impact of target language morphology, and the division of labor between encoder and decoder components. The paper's primary contributions are:
1. Character-based Representations for Morphology: The study demonstrates that character-based representations significantly outperform word-based ones for learning morphology, especially for rare and unseen words.
2. Layer-wise Analysis of Encoders: It reveals that lower layers of the encoder are better at capturing word structure, while higher layers focus more on semantic meaning.
3. Impact of Target Language Morphology: Translating into morphologically simpler languages results in better source-side representations, offering insights into the interaction between source and target language morphology.
4. Decoder Representations and Attention Mechanism: The analysis shows that the decoder learns impoverished representations of morphology, with the attention mechanism playing a key role in this division of labor.
Strengths
1. Novel Focus on Morphology: The paper extends prior work on NMT and syntax to morphology, addressing an underexplored area. The insights into morphology learning are both theoretically and practically valuable for NMT users.
2. Comprehensive Analysis: The study systematically evaluates multiple factors, such as word vs. character representations, encoder depth, and target language effects, providing a holistic understanding of NMT behavior.
3. Practical Implications: The findings, such as the superiority of character-based representations for rare words and the role of attention in decoder impoverishment, could inform the design of future NMT systems.
4. Quantitative Evaluation: The use of extrinsic tagging tasks as a proxy for representation quality is a robust and data-driven approach.
Weaknesses
1. Character-based Encoder Details: The paper lacks sufficient detail about the character-based encoder, such as its architecture and hyperparameters. This omission raises concerns about the reproducibility and generality of the findings.
2. Limited Language Selection: While the study includes several morphologically-rich languages, it misses out on languages with extreme morphological richness, such as Turkish or Finnish. Including these could have strengthened the analysis and broadened the applicability of the conclusions.
3. Finer-grained Predictions: The analysis could benefit from more granular evaluations, such as examining specific morphological phenomena (e.g., case marking, agreement) rather than general tagging accuracy.
4. Decoder Analysis Depth: Although the paper highlights the impoverished nature of decoder representations, it does not propose or test modifications to address this limitation, leaving the discussion somewhat incomplete.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you provide more details about the architecture and training setup of the character-based encoder? For example, what specific configurations (e.g., filter sizes, embedding dimensions) were used?
2. Why were languages like Turkish or Finnish, which are known for their morphological complexity, excluded from the experiments? Would you expect the trends observed in the current study to generalize to such languages?
3. Did you explore any techniques to improve the decoder's morphological representations, such as removing or modifying the attention mechanism? If not, could this be a direction for future work?
Recommendation
This paper makes significant contributions to understanding how NMT systems learn linguistic morphology and provides actionable insights for improving NMT architectures. However, the lack of detail on the character-based encoder and the limited language selection slightly weaken its generalizability. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on addressing these issues.
