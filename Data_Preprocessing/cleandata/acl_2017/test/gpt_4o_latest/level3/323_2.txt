Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for modeling text coherence using the entity grid representation. The authors argue that their neural adaptation of the entity grid can capture long-range entity transitions and entity-specific features while maintaining generalization through distributed representations. The model is trained end-to-end using a pairwise ranking method, optimizing for task-specific features. The paper evaluates the model on three coherence assessment tasks—discrimination, insertion, and summary coherence rating—and reports state-of-the-art results. The key contributions of this work are:  
1. A neural adaptation of the entity grid that leverages CNNs to model long-range entity transitions.  
2. An end-to-end training framework for coherence modeling, which learns task-specific features.  
3. Demonstration of improved performance over prior methods across multiple coherence evaluation tasks.  
Strengths  
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The use of CNNs for modeling entity transitions is well-justified. The authors clearly explain how convolutional layers can capture long-range dependencies and why distributed representations are advantageous over discrete features.  
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The model is rigorously evaluated on three tasks, with consistent improvements over baselines. The results are particularly strong in the discrimination and insertion tasks, showing significant gains over prior entity grid models.  
3. Simplicity and Reproducibility: The model is a straightforward extension of the entity grid, making it accessible to researchers familiar with the original framework. The release of the code further enhances reproducibility.  
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Innovation in Representation: While the neuralization of the entity grid is valuable, the approach lacks significant novelty in terms of representation or task design. It primarily builds on existing entity grid models with incremental improvements.  
2. Unclear Design Choices: The necessity of using 100-dimensional vectors for grid entries is not adequately justified. Additionally, the impact of transition chain lengths (k=3 vs. k=6) is minimal and could have been explored further.  
3. Writing and Organization: The paper is repetitive in sections, particularly in the introduction to entity grids and related work. Consolidation of these sections would improve readability.  
4. Reproducibility Concerns: The authors were unable to reproduce the results of Li and Hovy (2014), raising questions about the robustness of comparisons.  
Questions to Authors  
1. Can you provide more insights into why 100-dimensional embeddings were chosen for grid entries? Did you experiment with other dimensions?  
2. How sensitive is the model to the choice of transition chain lengths (k)? Would optimizing k for each task yield better results?  
3. Could you elaborate on the challenges faced in reproducing Li and Hovy (2014) and how this might impact the validity of your comparisons?  
Conclusion  
This paper presents a solid contribution to coherence modeling by extending the entity grid framework with CNNs. While the approach is well-motivated and achieves state-of-the-art results, it lacks significant innovation in representation or task design. The paper would benefit from clearer justification of design choices and improved writing. Overall, this work is a valuable step forward in neuralizing traditional coherence models and is suitable for acceptance with minor revisions.
