Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel joint neural modeling approach for Japanese Predicate Argument Structure (PAS) analysis using Grid Recurrent Neural Networks (Grid-RNNs). The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the NAIST Text Corpus without relying on syntactic information, which is a significant departure from previous approaches that heavily depended on syntactic parsers. The key contributions of this work are as follows:
1. Grid-RNN-based Multi-Predicate Interaction Modeling: The paper proposes a multi-sequence model using Grid-RNNs to capture interactions between multiple predicates in a sentence. This is a significant advancement over single-sequence models and demonstrates improved performance, particularly for zero arguments.
   
2. Elimination of Syntactic Dependency: By leveraging word sequence information, the proposed model achieves competitive results without requiring syntactic features, addressing the issue of error propagation from syntactic parsers.
3. Empirical Validation: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the NAIST Text Corpus, with notable improvements in zero argument identification, a challenging aspect of Japanese PAS analysis.
Strengths
1. State-of-the-Art Results: The proposed model outperforms previous approaches, particularly in handling zero arguments, which are notoriously difficult due to the lack of direct syntactic dependencies. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the Grid-RNN architecture in capturing multi-predicate interactions.
2. Innovative Architecture: The use of Grid-RNNs to model multi-predicate interactions is a novel and well-motivated contribution. The results clearly show the benefits of this approach over single-sequence models.
3. Clear Presentation: The paper is well-structured, with helpful figures and detailed explanations of the model architecture, training process, and experimental setup. This makes the work accessible to readers, even those unfamiliar with Japanese PAS analysis.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Discussion on Inter-Sentential Zero Pronouns: While the paper focuses on intra-sentential arguments, it does not discuss how inter-sentential zero pronouns are represented or whether the model could be extended to handle them. This omission limits the generalizability of the approach.
2. Lack of Explicit Modeling of Argument Constraints: The model does not explicitly enforce constraints, such as unique argument types per predicate. An analysis of whether the model learns these constraints implicitly would strengthen the paper.
3. Shallow Analysis of Model Comparisons: The comparison between the Single-Seq and Multi-Seq models in Table 3 could benefit from a deeper analysis of the contexts where the Multi-Seq model excels. This would provide more insights into the specific advantages of the Grid-RNN architecture.
4. No Results for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL): While the authors suggest that the model could be applied to SRL tasks, they do not include any experiments or results to support this claim. Including such results would broaden the impact of the work.
5. Minor Language and Formatting Issues: There are minor grammatical errors and formatting inconsistencies that should be addressed for better readability.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the model handle inter-sentential zero pronouns, if at all? Could the Grid-RNN architecture be extended to address this challenge?
2. Did you observe any implicit learning of argument constraints (e.g., unique argument types per predicate) in the model? If so, could you provide evidence or analysis to support this?
3. Could you elaborate on the specific contexts or sentence structures where the Multi-Seq model outperforms the Single-Seq model? 
Additional Comments
Including experiments on SRL tasks and analyzing the internal representations learned by the model (e.g., attention weights or hidden states) would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. Additionally, addressing the inherent complexity and ambiguity of Japanese PAS analysis more explicitly in the introduction would help contextualize the challenges tackled by the proposed approach.
