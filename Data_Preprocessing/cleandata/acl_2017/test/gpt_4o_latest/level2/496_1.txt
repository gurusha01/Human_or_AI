Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates the internal representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models, focusing on their ability to capture word morphology. The authors analyze representations at various levels of granularity, including word-based vs. character-based encodings, the depth of encoding layers, the impact of the target language, and the division of labor between encoder and decoder. The primary contributions of this work are:
1. Character-based Representations for Morphology: The paper demonstrates that character-based representations outperform word-based ones in learning morphology, particularly for low-frequency and out-of-vocabulary words.
2. Layer-wise Analysis of Encoders: It provides evidence that lower encoder layers capture word structure, while higher layers focus on word meaning.
3. Impact of Target Language: The study reveals that translating into morphologically-poorer languages results in better source-side word representations.
4. Decoder Representations and Attention: The authors show that decoders, particularly with attention mechanisms, learn impoverished morphological representations compared to encoders.
Strengths
1. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper conducts a thorough evaluation across multiple languages with varying morphological richness, making the findings broadly applicable. The use of both word-based and character-based models adds depth to the analysis.
2. Novel Insights: The results provide novel insights into the division of labor between encoder and decoder, as well as the role of attention mechanisms in representation learning. These findings could inform future improvements in NMT architectures.
3. Quantitative Evaluation: The use of extrinsic tasks (POS and morphological tagging) to evaluate representation quality is a robust and data-driven approach. The experiments are well-designed to isolate the effects of different factors, such as encoding layers and target languages.
4. Practical Implications: The conclusions, such as the superiority of character-based representations for rare words and the importance of lower encoder layers for morphology, are actionable for improving NMT systems.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Decoder Analysis: While the paper highlights the limitations of decoder representations, it does not explore ways to improve them. For instance, could alternative architectures or training objectives enhance the decoder's ability to learn morphology?
2. Focus on Morphology: The analysis is restricted to morphological and syntactic tasks (POS and tagging). Extending the evaluation to semantic tasks, such as semantic role labeling or parsing, would provide a more holistic understanding of the representations.
3. BLEU Correlation: The relationship between BLEU scores and representation quality is discussed but not deeply analyzed. For example, why do higher BLEU scores not always correspond to better morphological representations (e.g., in the autoencoder case)?
4. Reproducibility Details: While the methodology is clear, some experimental details (e.g., hyperparameters, dataset splits) are relegated to supplementary material. Including these in the main text would improve reproducibility.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you propose improving decoder representations, especially in the presence of attention mechanisms?
2. Have you considered evaluating the representations on semantic tasks? If not, do you anticipate similar trends for tasks like semantic parsing?
3. Could the findings about encoder layer specialization (structure vs. meaning) generalize to deeper architectures with more than two layers?
Overall Assessment
This paper provides valuable insights into the internal workings of NMT models, particularly their ability to learn morphology. The experiments are well-executed, and the findings are both novel and practically relevant. However, the scope is somewhat narrow, focusing primarily on morphology, and the decoder analysis could be expanded. Despite these limitations, the paper makes a strong contribution to understanding NMT representations and offers actionable guidance for future research and system design. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
