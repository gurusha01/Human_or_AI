The paper presents an enhanced entity grid model, leveraging a convolutional neural network to capture sequences of entity transitions that convey coherence. This approach enables improved generalization over extended sequences of entities compared to the original model's direct estimates of transition probabilities.
This paper is well-structured and clearly written, adopting a valid methodology by building upon existing research and utilizing a neural network to address specific limitations in one step. However, it would be beneficial to expand the comparison with the existing neural coherence model proposed by Li and Hovy. The authors' surprise at the low score achieved by the Li and Hovy model on their task raises questions about potential errors in the experimental setup and whether the performance disparity is corpus-dependent. A more in-depth examination of these factors would significantly strengthen the argument.
The paper's readability is commendable, but it lacks definite articles in numerous places (e.g., lines 92, 132, 174, 488, 490, 547, 674, 764, and possibly others), suggesting the need for proofreading with a focus on article usage. The phrase "...limits the model to do X...", used repeatedly, could be rephrased for clarity, such as "...limits the model's capacity to do X..." or "...prevents the model from doing X...".
Following consideration of the author response, the final recommendation has been adjusted to 4. It is reasonable that difficulties in running others' software should not be held against the authors. The efforts and challenges encountered in testing the Li and Hovy system should be documented in the paper. Additionally, reproducing the results of Li and Hovy on their original datasets as a sanity check (if not already done) would be advisable to verify the functionality of their system.
