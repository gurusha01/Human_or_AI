This paper presents novel predictive models for the Japanese Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task, building upon the state-of-the-art English model introduced by Zhou and Xu (2015). The authors further enhance the model by incorporating the Grid-RNNs framework to capture interactions between arguments of multiple predicates.
The evaluation is conducted on a renowned benchmark dataset for Japanese SRL, yielding significantly improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art system.
Strengths:
The paper exhibits a clear structure and motivation.
The proposed model demonstrates enhanced accuracy relative to the current state-of-the-art system.
Moreover, the Grid-RNNs-based model achieves a marginally better performance than the single-sequential model, primarily due to improved detection of zero arguments, which is a key focus of this study.
Weakness:
In my understanding, the primary contribution of this paper lies in extending the single-sequential model to a multi-sequential model. However, the impact of predicate interactions appears to be somewhat limited compared to the work of Ouchi et al. (2015). Additionally, a previous study by Shibata et al. (2016) has extended Ouchi et al.'s model using neural network modeling, and I would be interested in seeing a comparison between these approaches.
