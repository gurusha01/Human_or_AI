This paper presents a well-structured examination of the role of context in lexical entailment tasks, with a clear and well-defined approach, accompanied by a thorough experimental setup and analysis of results. The idea of incorporating context into lexical entailment is innovative and timely. 
However, there are some areas that require improvement, notably the provision of more detailed information. For instance, table captions could be more descriptive, and a clearer explanation of each word type feature should be provided to enhance understanding.
The proposal to consider context in lexical entailment tasks is well-presented, with experimental results indicating that models informed by context outperform those that are not. A notable strength of the paper is the method of generating negative examples for automatic negative annotations, leveraging WordNet positive examples in two distinct ways, which not only contributes to the creation of a new dataset but also introduces an interesting dataset development method.
Additionally, the approach of transforming existing context-agnostic representations into contextualized ones, through various methods such as mask and context2vec, and testing these across three different datasets, demonstrates a robust approach to ensuring generalizability, both within and across languages.
The motivations behind the experimental design choices are well-articulated, such as the rationale for the split used in CONTEXT-PPDB, indicating a thoughtful and deliberate approach to the research.
To further enhance the paper, it would be beneficial for the authors to briefly explain how class weights were determined and incorporated to address the issue of unbalanced data in the CONTEXT-WN experiments. This clarification is necessary to understand the potential impact on direct comparisons with previous studies.
Minor adjustments are also suggested: changing "directionality 4" to "directionality" as referenced in Table 4, and modifying "is-a hierarchy of WordNet" to "'is-a' hierarchy of WordNet" for consistency. Furthermore, including a representation of "mask" in Figure 1 would contribute to the completeness of the presentation.
The author response has been reviewed, providing additional insights into the research. Overall, the paper offers a valuable contribution to the field of lexical entailment, with its emphasis on context and innovative methodologies for dataset creation and model testing.
