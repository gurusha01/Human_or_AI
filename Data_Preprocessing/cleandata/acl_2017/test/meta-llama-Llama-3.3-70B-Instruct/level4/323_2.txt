The paper presents a novel approach to modeling text coherence using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built upon the established entity grid representation. This methodology is well-justified and clearly explained, with a particularly noteworthy discussion on the rationale behind specific design choices, such as the utilization of CNNs and the section detailing the underlying mechanics of the approach.
An extensive evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over preceding ones. However, the inability to replicate one previous result, specifically the findings related to Li/Hovy (2014), suggests a potential implementation or modeling flaw that warrants attention.
Despite its merits, the model can be seen as a relatively straightforward neural adaptation of the entity grid model. The necessity of 100-dimensional vectors for representing a four-dimensional grid entry (or slightly more in the extended grid scenario) is not entirely clear. While optimizing directly for coherence ranking can lead to a better model, the distinction in transition chains for up to k=3 sentences versus k=6 sentences may not yield a substantial difference, especially considering the brevity of many WSJ articles.
The writing could be more concise, as certain sections are repetitive. For instance, the introduction to entity grids is repeated, and section 2 also covers related work, making the first two-thirds of section 6 redundant and eligible for deletion or integration into section 2. The remainder of section 6 could be appended to section 2 under a subsection, potentially renaming section 2 to "Related Work" for clarity.
In summary, this paper offers a robust implementation of a neural network model applied to entity-grid-based coherence. However, given the consolidation of previous work, one might expect more innovative representations or tasks from a full paper.
Minor suggestions include:
- Proofreading by a native speaker to address missing articles and minor grammatical errors.
- Correcting the figure reference on page 1 from "Figure 2" to "Figure 1".
- Adjusting the transition words on page 1 from "Firstly/Secondly" to "First, Second".
- Revising the phrase "limits the model to" to "prevents the model from considering" for clarity.
- Considering the removal of the final paragraph in section 1, as it follows a standard format that may not be necessary for a paper of this length.
