This paper showcases a highly advanced application of Grid-type Recurrent Neural Networks in determining predicate-argument structures (PAS) in Japanese, achieving superior performance to current state-of-the-art systems that incorporate syntactic structure, without relying on explicit syntactic information. The authors provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the implementation and results, with particular attention to the challenging cases of dropped arguments and zero pronouns prevalent in Japanese. Notably, their multi-sequence model, which considers all predicates in a sentence, yields the best results for these examples. The paper's clarity and detailed writing are significant strengths.
One of the minor weaknesses of the paper is the presence of typos that could be corrected to enhance English fluency. Additionally, illustrating the concept of PRED, including context around the "predicate," with an example such as the one from Figure 6 where the accusative marker is included with the verb in the PRED string, could further clarify this point. The use of boldface in Table 2 on page 7 is also not clearly explained.
Regarding specific corrections, several typos and minor adjustments can be made: on page 1, "error propagation" does not require the definite article "the," and "multi-predicate interactions" should not be preceded by "the." On page 2, "As an solution" should be corrected to "As a solution," and both "single-sequence model" and "multi-sequence model" should be preceded by the indefinite article "a." The example in Figure 4 on page 3 contains a minor error, where "She ate a bread" should be corrected to "She ate bread." On page 4, "assumes the independence" should be "assumed independence," and the references to "the multi-predicate interactions" and "the multi-sequence model" should be adjusted to "multi-predicate interactions" and "a multi-sequence model," respectively. On page 7, "the residual connections" and the repeated references to "the multi-predicate interactions" should be corrected to "residual connections" and "multi-predicate interactions." Lastly, on page 8, "NAIST Text Corpus" should be "the NAIST Text Corpus," and "the state-of-the-art result" should be "state-of-the-art results."
After reviewing the author's response, I am satisfied with the clarifications and adjustments provided.
