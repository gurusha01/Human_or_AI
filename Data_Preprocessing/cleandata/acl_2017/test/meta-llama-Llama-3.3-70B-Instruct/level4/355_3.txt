This paper presents a novel joint neural modeling approach for PAS analysis in Japanese, leveraging Grid-RNNs and comparing its performance to a traditional single-sequence RNN method. The paper is well-executed, tackling a well-established task in Japanese and achieving state-of-the-art results, while also providing a largely accessible presentation of the task for non-experts in Japanese. However, the complexity of the task could be further emphasized, such as discussing the inherent ambiguity between NOM and ACC arguments in Figure 1, and highlighting the differences between this task and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), particularly with regards to the ambiguity of zero pronouns. Additionally, providing statistics on the proportion of zero pronouns that can be resolved intra-sententially would further complicate the task and highlight the need to distinguish between intra- and inter-sentential zero anaphors. 
One aspect that requires clarification is the representation used for inter-sentential zero pronouns as arguments of a given predicate. The current understanding is that no marking is used, which may lead to a defective representation and impact the model's ability to capture zero pronouns. A discussion on this point would be beneficial. Furthermore, certain constraints, such as a predicate typically having only one argument of a given type and an argument filling only one slot for a given predicate, are not explicitly captured in the model. An analysis of the model's output to assess its ability to learn these constraints would be valuable. 
The comparison between the Single-Seq and Multi-Seq models in Table 3 raises questions about the relative differences in their outputs. A discussion on the contexts in which differences between the two models are observed and an analysis of the internals of the models would strengthen the paper. The presentation is clear, with helpful figures, although some minor language issues were noted, including errors in wording and casing in references. Addressing these points, particularly the analysis of the model's internals and the inclusion of results for SRL, would elevate the paper from solid to strong. 
Specifically, the language issues identified include: "the error propagation" (l19), "an solution" (l190), "a bread" (l264 and Figure 2), "the independence" (l351), "the good" (l512), "from their model" (l531), "significent" (l637), and "both of" (l638), as well as inconsistent casing in references (e.g., "japanese", "lstm", "conll", "ilp").
