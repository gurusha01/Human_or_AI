Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long-range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without losing generalization power. The authors present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a target task and learn task-specific high-level features. The evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that the model achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.
Main Contributions
1. Neural Coherence Model: The paper proposes a neural architecture for coherence assessment that can capture long-range entity transitions along with arbitrary entity-specific features.
2. Pairwise Ranking Approach: The authors present a pairwise ranking approach to train the model on a target task and learn task-specific features.
3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different coherence assessment tasks, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.
Strengths
1. Effective Use of Distributed Representation: The model effectively uses distributed representation to capture long-range entity transitions and entity-specific features.
2. End-to-End Training: The pairwise ranking approach allows for end-to-end training of the model, enabling it to learn task-specific features.
3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different coherence assessment tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Analysis of Hyperparameters: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the hyperparameters used in the model, which could be useful for understanding the model's behavior.
2. No Comparison with Other Neural Models: The paper does not compare the proposed model with other neural models for coherence assessment, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
3. Limited Evaluation on Other Tasks: The paper only evaluates the model on three coherence assessment tasks, and it would be useful to evaluate the model on other related tasks to demonstrate its generalizability.
