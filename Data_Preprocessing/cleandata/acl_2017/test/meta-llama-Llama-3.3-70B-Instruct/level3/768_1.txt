This paper proposes a novel approach to lexical entailment in context, which involves using exemplar sentences to ground the meaning of words being considered for entailment. The authors introduce two new datasets, CONTEXT-PPDB and CONTEXT-WN, to evaluate their models. The key contributions of this work are:
1. Contextualized word representations: The authors propose a method to transform context-agnostic word representations into contextualized representations, which capture the salient properties of the context.
2. Word-context similarity features: The authors introduce similarity features to capture the non-directional relation between words and contexts, which are used in conjunction with the contextualized word representations.
3. Improved performance on lexical entailment tasks: The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms context-agnostic baselines on both monolingual and cross-lingual datasets, and improves the state-of-the-art on a related task of detecting semantic relations in context.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Well-defined approach: The authors propose a well-defined approach to examining the use of context in lexical entailment tasks, with good analysis of the results.
2. Effective use of contextualized word representations: The authors demonstrate that their contextualized word representations are effective in capturing the nuances of word meaning in context.
3. Improved performance on challenging datasets: The authors show that their approach improves performance on challenging datasets, such as CONTEXT-WN, which is designed to test the sensitivity of models to changes in context.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Lack of descriptive table captions: The authors could provide more descriptive captions for their tables to facilitate easier understanding of the results.
2. Unclear descriptions of word type features: The authors could provide clearer descriptions of the word type features used in their experiments.
3. Need for clarification on class weights determination: The authors could provide more details on how they determined the class weights for their experiments.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, and the authors' approach has the potential to improve performance on a range of lexical semantic tasks. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, this paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on how you determined the class weights for your experiments?
2. How do you plan to extend your approach to other lexical semantic tasks, such as lexical substitution and paraphrase ranking?
3. Can you provide more analysis on the performance of your approach on different types of word pairs, such as hypernym-hyponym pairs and synonym pairs?
