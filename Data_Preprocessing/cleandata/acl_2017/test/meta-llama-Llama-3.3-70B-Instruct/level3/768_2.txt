This paper proposes a method for detecting lexical entailment in context, which is a crucial task for various NLP applications. The authors introduce a novel approach to represent words in context by transforming context-agnostic word type representations into contextualized representations. They also propose a set of similarity features to capture the non-directional relation between words and contexts.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Contextualized word representations: The authors propose a method to construct vector representations of words in context by applying a filter to word type representations, which highlights the salient dimensions of the exemplar context.
2. Similarity features: The authors introduce a set of similarity features to capture the non-directional relation between words and contexts, including cosine similarity, dot product, and Euclidean distance.
3. Evaluation on novel datasets: The authors evaluate their approach on two novel datasets, CONTEXT-PPDB and CONTEXT-WN, which are designed to test the sensitivity of models to changes in context and entailment direction.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Improved performance: The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms context-agnostic baselines on both monolingual and cross-lingual datasets.
2. Robustness to context changes: The authors show that their model is sensitive to changes in context and can capture the directionality of entailment.
3. Generalizability: The authors demonstrate that their approach can be applied to different languages and datasets.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. Lack of novelty: The authors' approach is based on existing methods, and the novelty of the paper lies in the combination of these methods and the evaluation on novel datasets.
2. Overreliance on similarity features: The authors' results suggest that the similarity features have a greater impact on performance than the contextualized word representations.
3. Limited analysis: The authors provide limited analysis of the results and do not discuss the potential limitations of their approach.
Overall, this paper presents a solid contribution to the field of NLP, and the authors' approach has the potential to improve the performance of lexical entailment models in context. However, further analysis and evaluation are needed to fully understand the strengths and limitations of this approach.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the annotation process for the cross-lingual dataset?
2. How do you plan to address the overreliance on similarity features in future work?
3. Can you provide more analysis on the results, including error analysis and discussion of potential limitations?
