This paper proposes a joint neural modeling approach to Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis using Grid-RNNs, achieving state-of-the-art results without relying on syntactic information. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The introduction of a neural model that effectively captures multi-predicate interactions using Grid-RNNs, which leads to improved performance in PAS analysis, particularly for zero arguments.
2. The demonstration that the proposed model can achieve high performance without syntactic information, which is a significant advantage over previous approaches that rely heavily on syntactic parsing.
3. The provision of a detailed analysis of the model's performance on different argument types and case roles, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
The strengths of this paper include: 
1. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the NAIST Text Corpus 1.5, outperforming previous models that rely on syntactic information.
2. The use of Grid-RNNs allows the model to effectively capture multi-predicate interactions, which is beneficial for PAS analysis, particularly for zero arguments.
3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance on different argument types and case roles, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement: 
1. The paper could have better highlighted the complexity of the task, such as the ambiguity between NOM and ACC arguments, and provided more statistics on zero pronouns.
2. The representation of inter-sentential zero pronouns in the model is not clear, and it is unclear whether they are marked as empty arguments or not.
3. The paper lacks analysis of the model's ability to learn constraints, such as a predicate having only one argument of a given type, which could be an important aspect of PAS analysis.
4. The presentation of the paper is good, with helpful figures, but there are some low-level language issues and casing inconsistencies in references that need to be corrected.
Some questions to the authors include: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of inter-sentential zero pronouns, which are not currently handled by the model?
2. Can the authors provide more analysis on the model's ability to learn constraints, such as a predicate having only one argument of a given type?
3. How do the authors plan to exploit large-scale unlabeled data to learn the neural models, as mentioned in the conclusion? 
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Japanese PAS analysis, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses and questions mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
