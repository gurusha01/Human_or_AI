Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long-range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without losing generalization power. The authors present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a target task and learn task-specific high-level features. The evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that the model achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.
Main Contributions
1. Neuralization of Entity Grid Models: The paper proposes a neural architecture that neuralizes the popular entity grid models, allowing for the capture of long-range entity transitions and incorporation of entity-specific features without losing generalization power.
2. Convolutional Architecture: The authors introduce a convolutional architecture to model entity transitions, which enables the model to capture sufficiently long entity transitions without overfitting.
3. Pairwise Ranking Approach: The paper presents a pairwise ranking approach to train the model on a target task and learn task-specific features, which allows for end-to-end training and improves the model's performance.
Strengths
1. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different coherence assessment tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing local coherence.
2. Flexibility and Generalization: The neural architecture and convolutional approach enable the model to capture long-range entity transitions and incorporate entity-specific features, making it flexible and generalizable to different tasks and datasets.
3. End-to-End Training: The pairwise ranking approach allows for end-to-end training, which simplifies the training process and improves the model's performance.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Interpretability: The neural architecture and convolutional approach may make it challenging to interpret the model's decisions and understand the underlying factors that contribute to its performance.
2. Dependence on Hyperparameters: The model's performance may depend on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of filters, window size, and pooling length, which can be time-consuming to tune.
3. Limited Comparison to Other Models: The paper primarily compares the proposed model to existing entity grid models, and a more comprehensive comparison to other coherence models and neural architectures would be beneficial.
Questions to Authors
