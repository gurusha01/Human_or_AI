This paper proposes a novel approach to detecting lexical entailment in context, which is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP). The authors argue that previous work has focused on entailment between words out of context, and propose to address this limitation by providing exemplar sentences to ground the meaning of words being considered for entailment.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Contextualized word representations: The authors propose a method to transform context-agnostic word representations into contextualized representations that highlight salient properties of the context. This is achieved by applying a filter to word type representations to emphasize relevant dimensions of the exemplar context.
2. Word-context similarity features: The authors introduce similarity features to capture the non-directional relation between words and contexts. These features are based on cosine similarity, dot product, and Euclidean distance between contextualized word representations.
3. Evaluation on novel datasets: The authors evaluate their approach on two novel datasets, CONTEXT-PPDB and CONTEXT-WN, which are designed to test the sensitivity of models to changes in context and entailment direction.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Improved performance: The authors demonstrate significant improvements over context-agnostic baselines on both monolingual and cross-lingual datasets.
2. Robustness to context changes: The authors show that their model is sensitive to changes in context, which is essential for detecting entailment in context.
3. Directionality detection: The authors demonstrate that their model can detect the directionality of entailment, which is a crucial aspect of lexical entailment.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Complexity of the model: The authors' approach involves multiple components, including contextualized word representations, word-context similarity features, and a logistic regression classifier. This complexity may make it challenging to interpret the results and identify the key factors contributing to the model's performance.
2. Limited analysis of errors: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by their model, which could help identify areas for improvement.
3. Comparison to other approaches: The authors do not compare their approach to other state-of-the-art methods for detecting lexical entailment in context, which makes it difficult to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the annotation process for the CONTEXT-PPDB and CONTEXT-WN datasets?
2. How do you plan to address the complexity of the model and provide more interpretable results?
3. Can you compare your approach to other state-of-the-art methods for detecting lexical entailment in context and discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach?
