This paper proposes new prediction models for Japanese SRL task by adopting the
English state-of-the-art model of (Zhou and Xu, 2015).
The authors also extend the model by applying the framework of Grid-RNNs in
order to handle the interactions between the arguments of multiple predicates.
The evaluation is performed on the well-known benchmark dataset in Japanese
SRL, and obtained a significantly better performance than the current state of
the art system.
Strengths:
The paper is well-structured and well-motivated.
The proposed model obtains an improvement in accuracy compared with the current
state of the art system.
Also, the model using Grid-RNNs achieves a slightly better performance than
that of proposed single-sequential model, mainly due to the improvement on the
detection of zero arguments, that is the focus of this paper.
Weakness:
To the best of my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is an
extension of the single-sequential model to the multi-sequential model. The
impact of predicate interactions is a bit smaller than that of (Ouchi et al.,
2015). There is a previous work (Shibata et al., 2016) that extends the (Ouchi
et al., 2015)'s model
with neural network modeling. I am curious about the comparison between them.
