- Strengths:
This paper presents a sophisticated application of Grid-type Recurrent Neural
Nets to the task of determining predicate-argument structures (PAS) in
Japanese.  The approach does not use any explicit syntactic structure, and
outperforms the current SOA systems that do include syntactic structure.  The
authors give a clear and detailed description of the implementation and of the
results.  In particular, they pay close attention to the performance on dropped
arguments, zero pronouns, which are prevalent in Japanese and especially
challenging with respect to PAS. Their multi-sequence model, which takes all of
the predicates in the sentence into account, achieves the best performance for
these examples.  The paper is detailed and clearly written.
- Weaknesses:
I really only have minor comments. There are some typos listed below, the
correction of which would improve English fluency. I think it would be worth
illustrating the point about the PRED including context around the "predicate"
with the example from Fig 6 where the accusative marker is included with the
verb in the PRED string.  I didn't understand the use of boldface in Table 2,
p. 7.
- General Discussion:
Typos:
p1 :  error propagation does not need a "the", nor does "multi-predicate
interactions"
p2: As an solution -> As a solution, single-sequence model -> a single-sequence
model,                    multi-sequence model -> a multi-sequence model 
p. 3 Example in Fig 4.                    She ate a bread -> She ate bread.
p. 4 assumes the independence -> assumed independence, the multi-predicate
interactions -> multi-predicate interactions, the multi-sequence model -> a
multi-sequence model
p.7: the residual connections -> residual connections, the multi-predicate
interactions -> multi-predicate interactions (twice)
p8 NAIST Text Corpus -> the NAIST Text Corpus, the state-of-the-art result ->
state-of-the-art results
I have read the author response and am satisfied with it.
