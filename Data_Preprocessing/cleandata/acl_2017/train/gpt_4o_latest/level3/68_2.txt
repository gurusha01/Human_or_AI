Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a new dataset and proposes a formula for assessing text readability in Vietnamese, a resource-poor language for natural language processing (NLP). The authors construct a corpus of 996 documents categorized into three readability levels (easy, normal, and difficult) and use features such as sentence length, word length, and the percentage of difficult words to develop a readability formula. The paper claims that the proposed formula achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting text readability.
The primary contribution of this work is the creation of a new, larger corpus for Vietnamese text readability, addressing the lack of resources in this domain. The secondary contribution is the development of a formula for readability prediction, which builds on traditional features used in readability studies.
Strengths
1. New Dataset for a Resource-Poor Language: The creation of a new corpus for Vietnamese text readability is a significant contribution, as it addresses the scarcity of resources for this language. The dataset is larger and more diverse than previous efforts, which were limited to small corpora of 20â€“54 documents.
2. Focus on Vietnamese: The paper highlights an underexplored area in NLP by focusing on Vietnamese, a language with limited prior research in readability assessment. This aligns with the broader goal of advancing NLP for resource-poor languages.
Weaknesses
1. Incomplete Related Work and Lack of Comparisons: The related work section is limited to older studies and fails to reference more recent methods in readability assessment, particularly those leveraging modern machine learning approaches. Additionally, the paper does not compare its proposed formula with existing methods, making it difficult to evaluate its relative performance.
2. Outdated Approaches and Limited Technical Contribution: The proposed formula relies on traditional statistical features and regression analysis, which are outdated compared to modern NLP techniques such as neural networks or transformer-based models. The technical novelty is minimal.
3. Weak Experimental Design: The experiments lack baseline comparisons with established metrics or methods for readability assessment. Without such comparisons, the reported accuracy of 81% is not contextualized and may not be meaningful.
4. Simplistic Readability Classification: The coarse-grained readability categorization (easy, normal, difficult) limits the applicability and interest of the proposed metric. A more granular classification or domain-specific evaluation would have been more impactful.
5. Grammatical Errors and Readability Issues: The paper contains several grammatical errors and readability issues, which detract from its overall quality and clarity.
General Feedback
The paper is premature and requires significant improvements before it can be considered for acceptance. While the dataset contribution is noteworthy, the lack of technical novelty, incomplete related work, weak experimental design, and coarse readability classification limit the impact of this work. The authors should address these issues by incorporating modern methods, providing stronger baselines, and refining their readability metric. Additionally, the paper would benefit from a thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors.
Questions to Authors
1. Why were modern machine learning methods (e.g., neural networks, transformers) not considered for readability prediction?
2. How does the proposed formula compare with existing readability formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) when applied to Vietnamese text?
3. Are there plans to expand the corpus to include more granular readability levels or domain-specific texts?
Recommendation
Reject. While the dataset contribution is valuable, the paper lacks sufficient technical depth and experimental rigor to warrant acceptance in its current form.
