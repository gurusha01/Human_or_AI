Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces morph-fitting, a novel retrofitting method that incorporates morphological constraints into distributional word vector spaces. The method leverages simple language-specific rules to generate "attract" and "repel" constraints, pulling inflectional forms of the same word closer together while pushing derivational antonyms apart. Unlike prior retrofitting methods that rely on curated semantic lexicons, morph-fitting is resource-light and applicable across multiple languages. The authors demonstrate consistent improvements in both intrinsic evaluations (e.g., SimLex-999, SimVerb-3500) and a downstream task (dialogue state tracking), particularly for morphologically rich languages like German and Italian. The paper's primary contributions are:
1. Morph-fitting Framework: A language-agnostic retrofitting method that injects morphological knowledge into word vector spaces using simple, rule-based constraints.
2. Empirical Validation: Convincing evidence of consistent improvements across multiple languages and vector spaces, with significant gains in downstream dialogue state tracking tasks.
3. Portability: The method's reliance on lightweight, rule-based constraints makes it applicable to languages and domains lacking curated resources.
Strengths
1. Clear Application of Linguistic Ideas: The paper effectively bridges linguistic theory and distributional semantics, addressing challenges specific to morphologically rich languages. The use of "attract" and "repel" mechanisms is intuitive and well-motivated.
2. Robust Empirical Results: The method demonstrates consistent improvements across intrinsic benchmarks (e.g., SimLex-999, SimVerb-3500) and extrinsic tasks (dialogue state tracking). Gains in downstream tasks, particularly for German (+6%) and Italian (+4%), highlight the practical utility of morph-fitting.
3. Language-Agnostic Design: The approach is portable and does not rely on curated lexicons, making it broadly applicable to under-resourced languages. The inclusion of multiple languages (English, German, Italian, Russian) strengthens the paper's claims.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors evaluate their method across a wide range of vector spaces and provide detailed analyses, including qualitative examples and comparisons with baselines.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the morph-fitting approach is well-executed, it is conceptually a straightforward extension of existing retrofitting methods (e.g., ATTRACT-REPEL). The novelty lies more in its application to morphological constraints than in the underlying methodology.
2. Insufficient Baselines: The evaluation would benefit from additional baselines, such as character-level embeddings or models that explicitly incorporate morphology during training. These comparisons would provide a stronger context for the reported improvements.
3. Potential Overfitting to Morph-SimLex: The introduction of the Morph-SimLex dataset raises concerns about alignment with the model's assumptions. This synthetic dataset may exaggerate the method's performance by favoring its design principles.
4. Limited Analysis of Vector Space Geometry: While the method shows empirical gains, the paper lacks a deeper exploration of how morph-fitting alters the geometry of the vector space. For example, analyzing whether the transformations lead to meaningful clustering or separation of word groups would provide additional insights.
Questions to Authors
1. How does morph-fitting compare to character-level embedding models or subword-based approaches (e.g., FastText) in terms of both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations?
2. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of morph-fitting, particularly for large vocabularies?
3. How robust is the method to noisy or incomplete morphological rules? Would errors in rule generation significantly degrade performance?
Additional Comments
- The inclusion of a character embeddings baseline would strengthen the evaluation and address concerns about the method's relative performance.
- The Morph-SimLex dataset, while interesting, should be framed as a supplementary evaluation rather than a primary benchmark due to its alignment with the model's assumptions.
- Future work could explore extending morph-fitting to other morphologically rich languages and tasks, such as machine translation or parsing.
Recommendation
This paper presents a well-executed application of linguistic insights to improve word vector spaces, with strong empirical results and practical relevance. However, the limited novelty in methodology and the absence of key baselines slightly weaken its impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the concerns about baselines and dataset alignment during the rebuttal phase.
