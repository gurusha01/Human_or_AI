Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces an innovative framework for interactively building a natural language interface to a programming language, addressing the challenge of bridging the gap between the expressivity of programming languages and the accessibility of natural language interfaces. The authors propose a method called "naturalization," which allows users to incrementally teach a system to understand their preferred language constructs by defining new syntax and concepts interactively. The system, Voxelurn, is implemented in a voxel world, where users collaboratively expand the language while building complex structures. The key contributions of the paper are:
1. Interactive Naturalization Framework: The paper introduces a novel approach that combines direct supervision (definitions) and indirect supervision (user interactions) to incrementally evolve a programming language into a more natural and user-friendly interface.
2. Grammar Induction Algorithm: A tailored grammar induction algorithm is proposed to generalize user-defined constructs while maintaining precision, addressing challenges of scalability and ambiguity in interactive settings.
3. Community-Driven Language Evolution: The system demonstrates how a community of users can collaboratively teach and refine a language, leading to a significant shift from the core programming language to the naturalized language in user interactions.
Strengths
1. Originality and Impact: The idea of interactively naturalizing a programming language through user-driven definitions is both novel and impactful. It addresses an important problem in making programming more accessible to non-programmers, with potential applications in diverse domains such as robotics, data analysis, and natural language processing.
2. Broad Applicability: The proposed framework is not limited to the voxel world but can be extended to other domains like querying semi-structured data or controlling robots, making it a versatile contribution.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper provides strong empirical evidence of the system's effectiveness, demonstrating that 74.7% of the last 10,000 accepted utterances in the study were in the naturalized language. This highlights the system's ability to evolve and adapt based on user input.
4. User-Centric Design: By allowing users to define syntax and concepts interactively, the system lowers the barrier to entry for non-programmers while maintaining the precision and power of a programming language.
Weaknesses
1. Language and Presentation Issues: The paper contains numerous typos, language errors, and missing text in Section 6, which detracts from its overall readability and professionalism. A thorough proofreading by a native English speaker is necessary.
2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper demonstrates the system's strengths, it does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations, such as scalability to more complex domains, the risk of conflicting user definitions, or the challenges of generalizing induced grammar rules.
3. Evaluation Metrics: The evaluation primarily focuses on the percentage of naturalized language usage and program length. Additional metrics, such as task completion time or user satisfaction, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the system's usability and effectiveness.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the system handle conflicting or ambiguous definitions provided by different users? Is there a mechanism to resolve such conflicts?
2. Could you elaborate on the scalability of the grammar induction algorithm to more complex domains or larger user bases?
3. How does the system ensure that the induced grammar rules generalize well without introducing errors or inconsistencies?
Recommendation
This paper presents a highly original and impactful idea with strong empirical validation, making it a valuable contribution to the field. However, the language and presentation issues need to be addressed, and a deeper discussion of limitations and broader evaluation metrics would strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
