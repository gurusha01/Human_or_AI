Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper proposes a novel method for distinguishing literal and metaphoric adjective-noun pairs using a geometric approach based on word-context matrices with Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) scores and vector representations. The authors claim their model achieves state-of-the-art performance while being effectively zero-shot, as it does not require pre-built phrase representations. The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. The introduction of a geometric framework for metaphor identification, leveraging contextualized subspaces and geometric properties, such as vector lengths and triangulations, to classify adjective-noun pairs.  
2. A claimed reduction in supervision, as the model relies only on individual word vectors and not on labeled phrase data, making it applicable to unseen phrases.  
3. A detailed experimental evaluation, comparing the proposed method with existing approaches and demonstrating competitive performance.  
Strengths  
1. Contextual Dynamism and Simplicity: The model's ability to dynamically generate subspaces based on input pairs is a significant strength. This contextual flexibility aligns well with theoretical insights into the situational nature of language and metaphor processing.  
2. Zero-Shot Potential: The method's independence from pre-built phrase vectors is a notable advantage, allowing for the analysis of truly unseen adjective-noun pairs. This is a step forward compared to competing methods that require phrase-level observations.  
3. Interpretability: The geometric framework provides interpretable features, such as vector lengths and triangulations, which can be analyzed using standard classification techniques. This interpretability is valuable for understanding the underlying mechanisms of metaphor classification.  
Weaknesses  
1. Supervision and Zero-Shot Claim: Despite the authors' claims, the approach still relies on supervised classification (logistic regression) and pre-existing word vectors. The "zero-shot" claim is therefore overstated, as the method requires prior training on labeled data and is not fully unsupervised.  
2. Feature Predictiveness and Dataset Bias: The noun vector length (BO) emerges as the most predictive feature, likely due to the dataset's structure. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach to other datasets or tasks. The reliance on dataset-specific biases undermines the model's broader applicability.  
3. Theoretical Shortcomings: While the paper references theoretical insights into metaphor processing, the proposed method does not provide substantial theoretical contributions to our understanding of metaphoricity. The geometric properties used (e.g., vector length) lack clear justification or grounding in metaphor theory.  
4. Limited Novelty: The vector representation method is similar to prior work, with the primary novelty being the use of geometric properties for classification. This contribution, while interesting, is incremental rather than groundbreaking.  
5. Performance Analysis: The intuition behind the geometric features, such as vector normalization and their relationship to metaphor, is unclear. Furthermore, normalized vectors do not seem to improve performance, raising questions about the utility of this aspect of the approach.  
Questions to Authors  
1. Can you clarify how the proposed method qualifies as "zero-shot" when it relies on supervised logistic regression and pre-trained word vectors?  
2. What theoretical justification supports the use of geometric properties, such as vector lengths, for metaphor classification? How do these properties align with linguistic or cognitive theories of metaphor?  
3. Given the dataset-specific predictiveness of the noun vector length, how would the model perform on datasets with different structures or in tasks beyond adjective-noun classification?  
Conclusion  
While the paper introduces an interesting geometric approach to metaphor classification, its claims of reduced supervision and zero-shot learning are overstated. The reliance on dataset-specific features and the lack of theoretical grounding limit its generalizability and broader impact. The method's simplicity and interpretability are commendable, but the novelty is incremental. Further work is needed to address these limitations and provide stronger theoretical and practical contributions.
