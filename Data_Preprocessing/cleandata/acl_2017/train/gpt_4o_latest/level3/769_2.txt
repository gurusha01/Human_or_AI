Review
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper introduces a novel framework, DynoNet, for symmetric collaborative dialogue agents, leveraging dynamically updated knowledge graph embeddings to model dialogue states. The primary contribution is the innovative integration of structured knowledge graphs with unstructured dialogue history, enabling agents to handle both goal-directed and open-ended conversations. The authors also present a new dataset of 11K human-human dialogues in a collaborative task setting, which highlights diverse linguistic and strategic phenomena. Lastly, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DynoNet through comprehensive evaluations, including automatic metrics, bot-bot, and bot-human interactions, as well as human and third-party evaluations.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty in Dialogue Representation: The proposed dynamic knowledge graph embeddings bridge the gap between structured task-oriented systems and open-ended chat systems. This hybrid approach is innovative and well-suited for the symmetric collaborative dialogue task. The ablation studies further validate the importance of the dynamic updates and entity abstraction.  
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of DynoNet, comparing it to baseline neural and rule-based systems. The results demonstrate clear advantages in terms of task success, human-likeness, and strategic behavior, supported by both automatic and human evaluations.  
3. Dataset Contribution: The creation of a large-scale, publicly available dataset with rich linguistic and strategic phenomena is a significant contribution to the dialogue research community. The dataset enables the study of complex conversational strategies and pragmatics.  
4. Strategic Insights: The analysis of human strategies, such as prioritizing attributes with fewer unique values, adds depth to the study and demonstrates the model's ability to replicate human-like behavior.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Lack of Mathematical Clarity: The mathematical formulation of the graph embedding computation, particularly the recursive node embeddings and message-passing mechanism, lacks sufficient clarity and detail. This makes it challenging for readers to fully understand and reproduce the method.  
2. Limited Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not compare DynoNet with reinforcement learning (RL)-based dialogue managers, which are commonly used in task-oriented dialogue systems. Such a comparison would provide a stronger baseline and contextualize the model's performance.  
3. Scalability Concerns: The scalability of DynoNet to more complex tasks or larger knowledge bases is not addressed. For example, the computational cost of dynamic graph updates and message passing in real-time dialogue scenarios remains unclear.  
4. Dataset-Specific Design: While the model performs well on the proposed dataset, its generalizability to other dialogue tasks or domains is not demonstrated.  
Questions to Authors:  
1. Could you provide more detailed mathematical explanations of the recursive node embeddings and message-passing mechanism?  
2. How does DynoNet compare to RL-based dialogue managers in terms of performance and scalability?  
3. What are the computational costs of dynamic graph updates, and how do they scale with larger knowledge bases or more complex tasks?  
4. Have you tested DynoNet on other datasets or tasks to evaluate its generalizability?  
General Verdict:  
This paper presents a promising contribution to the field of dialogue systems, particularly in bridging task-oriented and open-domain dialogue. The novelty of the approach, combined with the dataset and evaluation, makes it a valuable addition to the research community. However, the lack of mathematical clarity, limited baseline comparisons, and scalability concerns need to be addressed for stronger acceptance. Overall, it is a good paper with potential, and with improvements in theoretical presentation and broader comparisons, it could make a significant impact.
