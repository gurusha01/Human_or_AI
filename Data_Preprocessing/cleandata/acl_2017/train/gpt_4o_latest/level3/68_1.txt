Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper addresses the underexplored domain of Vietnamese text readability by developing a new readability formula based on a self-constructed, large-scale corpus. The authors claim that their formula achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting text readability across three difficulty levels (easy, normal, and difficult). The key contributions of this work are:  
1. The creation of a new, well-annotated corpus of 996 Vietnamese documents spanning diverse readability levels, evaluated by experts.  
2. The development of a novel readability formula tailored to Vietnamese, incorporating features such as sentence length, word length, and the percentage of difficult words.  
3. Validation of the formula's performance, demonstrating its applicability in educational and communicative contexts.  
Strengths:  
1. Extension to Vietnamese: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending readability research to Vietnamese, a language with limited prior work in this area. The creation of a large, annotated corpus is particularly valuable, as it addresses the limitations of earlier studies that relied on small datasets.  
2. Well-validated Formula: The proposed formula is grounded in statistical analysis and achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 81%, making it a practical tool for assessing Vietnamese text readability.  
3. Potential Applications: The work has clear utility in education, communication, and content creation, as it can guide the drafting of texts suitable for specific audiences.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Relevance to Computational Linguistics: While the work is useful for practical applications, its relevance to computational linguistics as a field is limited. The methodology relies on traditional statistical approaches rather than advancing state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing (NLP).  
2. Clarity and Comparisons: The paper lacks clarity in discussing how the proposed formula compares to prior Vietnamese readability measures. A more detailed performance comparison with existing formulas (e.g., Nguyen and Henkin's) would strengthen the argument for its novelty and effectiveness.  
3. Grammatical Errors: The paper contains minor grammatical errors, which detract from its overall readability and professionalism. A thorough proofreading is recommended.  
General Discussion:  
The release of the constructed corpus and its associated labels would significantly enhance the paper's impact. Open access to this resource would enable broader applications and foster further research in Vietnamese NLP. Additionally, incorporating machine learning methods, as mentioned in the future work section, could make the approach more aligned with modern computational linguistics practices.  
Questions to Authors:  
1. Could you provide a more detailed comparison of your formula's performance with prior Vietnamese readability measures?  
2. Are there plans to release the corpus and labels to the research community? If not, what are the barriers to doing so?  
3. How does your formula perform on domain-specific texts (e.g., legal or medical documents) compared to general texts?  
Conclusion:  
This paper makes a meaningful contribution to Vietnamese text readability research and has practical applications in education and communication. However, its limited relevance to computational linguistics and lack of clarity in performance comparisons are notable weaknesses. Addressing these issues and releasing the corpus would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
