Review of Submission
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper presents a novel approach to creating a language interface that bridges the gap between natural language and programming languages, enabling users to incrementally "naturalize" a core programming language. The system, Voxelurn, allows users to define new syntax and concepts, facilitating a collaborative evolution of the language. The authors demonstrate this approach in a voxel-based world where users collaboratively build complex structures while teaching the system their preferred language constructs. The key contributions of the paper are:  
1. A novel interactive language learning framework that combines user-defined definitions with grammar induction to expand the system's understanding.  
2. A community-driven approach to language evolution, where user contributions generalize across the system.  
3. Empirical evidence from a large-scale user study showing that users increasingly prefer the naturalized language over the core language, with 74.7% of the last 10,000 accepted utterances using the naturalized language.  
Strengths:  
1. Novelty of Approach: The paper introduces an innovative concept of "naturalization," where users collaboratively define and refine a language interface. This approach is promising for creating more accessible and expressive interfaces for non-programmers.  
2. Recursive Definitions for Generalization: The focus on enabling users to create recursive definitions for complex command creation is a significant strength. The motivating example of generating a palm tree showcases the potential of this approach.  
3. Grammar Induction for Scalability: The use of grammar learning to handle new cases is a compelling solution to the challenge of scaling language understanding in interactive systems.  
4. Empirical Validation: The study involving 70 users and 230 structures provides strong evidence of the system's effectiveness, with clear metrics demonstrating the increasing use of the naturalized language.  
5. Community-Driven Learning: The collaborative aspect of the system, where user-defined rules generalize across the community, is an important contribution to the field of interactive AI systems.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Lack of Novelty Clarification: The paper does not clearly differentiate its contributions from prior work, particularly the ACL 2016 paper on a similar topic. This omission weakens the claim of novelty.  
2. Missing Related Work Section: The absence of a dedicated related work section makes it difficult to contextualize the contributions within the broader literature. A comparison with prior research would strengthen the paper.  
3. Unclear Role of Social Features: While social features are mentioned as part of the learning process, their specific impact on outcomes is not well-explained. This leaves a gap in understanding the system's personalization capabilities.  
4. Limited Explanation of Collaborative Language Creation: The paper does not sufficiently elaborate on how users collaborate to create a shared language or how conflicts in definitions are resolved.  
5. Generalizability Beyond Voxelurn: While the authors suggest applicability to other domains, there is limited discussion or evidence to support this claim.  
Questions to Authors:  
1. How does this work specifically advance beyond the ACL 2016 paper? Could you clarify the novel contributions in comparison?  
2. Can you provide more details on the role and impact of social features in the learning process?  
3. How does the system handle conflicting or redundant definitions provided by different users?  
4. Are there any plans to evaluate the approach in domains beyond Voxelurn to demonstrate generalizability?  
Recommendation:  
While the paper introduces a promising and innovative approach, the lack of clarity on novelty and insufficient contextualization within prior work are significant weaknesses. Addressing these issues during the author response period could substantially strengthen the submission.
