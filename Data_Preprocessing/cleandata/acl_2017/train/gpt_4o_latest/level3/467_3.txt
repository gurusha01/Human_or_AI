Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a self-learning framework for bilingual word embeddings that iteratively refines bilingual lexicons and mappings until convergence. The key innovation lies in encoding the seed lexicon as a binary matrix, enabling global optimization without explicit reliance on the lexicon. The method demonstrates robustness, achieving competitive results with as few as 25 word pairs or even a list of numerals as the seed lexicon. The authors claim that their approach is particularly advantageous for resource-scarce languages, where bilingual resources are limited. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the optimization objective and demonstrates the method's effectiveness through experiments on bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity.
The primary contributions of this work are:
1. Self-Learning Framework: A simple yet effective iterative approach that reduces reliance on large bilingual dictionaries while ensuring convergence and competitive performance.
2. Seed Lexicon Encoding: Encoding the lexicon as a binary matrix, which facilitates global optimization and reduces dependence on the lexicon size.
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on multiple language pairs, including resource-scarce scenarios, showing the method's robustness and generalizability.
Strengths
1. Practical Utility for Low-Resource Languages: The method's ability to work with minimal bilingual evidence (e.g., 25 word pairs or numeral lists) is a significant strength, addressing a critical gap in multilingual NLP for resource-scarce languages.
2. Theoretical Insight: The analysis of the implicit optimization objective provides a solid theoretical foundation for the method, enhancing its credibility and interpretability.
3. Competitive Performance: The approach achieves results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods that rely on richer bilingual resources, as demonstrated in both bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity tasks.
4. Efficiency: The use of efficient analytical methods for embedding mapping and dictionary induction ensures scalability, even for large vocabularies.
5. Reproducibility: The authors provide detailed experimental settings and promise to release code and resources, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Core Techniques: While the self-learning framework is novel in its application, the core methods for embedding mapping and dictionary induction build heavily on existing techniques, limiting the methodological novelty.
2. Evaluation Scope: The evaluation focuses primarily on bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity. Additional tasks, such as downstream applications (e.g., machine translation or cross-lingual classification), could strengthen the paper's claims about practical utility.
3. Dependence on Structural Similarity: The method assumes structural similarity between embedding spaces, which may not hold for all language pairs, especially those with significant typological differences. This limitation is acknowledged but not thoroughly explored.
4. Convergence Analysis: While the authors claim convergence to a local optimum, the paper lacks a rigorous analysis of the quality of these optima, especially in cases where the initial seed dictionary is highly noisy or sparse.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the method perform on typologically distant language pairs where structural similarity between embedding spaces may be weaker (e.g., English and Chinese)?
2. Could the authors elaborate on the choice of the convergence criterion and its impact on performance? Would a more dynamic or adaptive criterion improve results?
3. Have the authors considered evaluating the method on downstream tasks, such as cross-lingual transfer learning, to better demonstrate its practical utility?
Additional Comments
Overall, the paper presents a compelling and practical approach to learning bilingual word embeddings with minimal bilingual resources. While the methodological novelty is somewhat limited, the paper's focus on resource-scarce languages and its strong empirical results make it a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the weaknesses and expanding the evaluation scope could further strengthen the paper.
