Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a general framework for Cross-Context Lexical Analysis (CCLA), enabling the study of term meaning variations across different contexts. The authors apply the framework to three tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation. The primary contributions of this work are:
1. General Framework for CCLA: The paper formalizes a versatile framework that accommodates various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations, making it adaptable to diverse applications.
2. Applications of CCLA: The framework is applied to three distinct tasks, demonstrating its utility in analyzing semantic change, identifying context-sensitive and context-insensitive terms, and evaluating the stability of word embeddings.
3. Practical Utility: The results, including the identification of ambiguous terms and stable embeddings, provide insights that are valuable for downstream tasks like feature selection, transfer learning, and domain adaptation.
Strengths
1. Innovative Framework: The CCLA framework is a significant contribution, offering a flexible and generalizable approach to lexical analysis across contexts. Its ability to work with any type of context or annotation is particularly commendable.
2. Comprehensive Applications: The paper demonstrates the framework's utility across three well-motivated tasks, each supported by detailed experiments and insightful results.
3. Reproducibility: The authors provide source code and datasets, ensuring that the work can be reproduced and extended by the community.
4. Impact on Future Research: The framework's adaptability and the insights from its applications make it a valuable tool for future studies in NLP, particularly in areas like sentiment analysis, domain adaptation, and word sense disambiguation.
Weaknesses
1. Overly General Statements: Some sections, especially in the introduction and related work, contain broad or "empty" statements that could be made more precise. For example, the claim that CCLA "opens up interesting new directions" could be substantiated with more specific examples or preliminary results.
2. Initial Sections Lack Novelty: While the background provided in the initial sections is necessary, it feels reminiscent of older methods and does not immediately highlight the novelty of the proposed framework. This might detract from the reader's initial impression of the work.
3. Clarity Issues: The reference to "multiple methods" in line 278 is unclear and should be elaborated. Additionally, a missing word or punctuation in line 264 disrupts the flow and should be corrected.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed framework compare computationally (e.g., runtime, scalability) to traditional methods for semantic change detection or topic modeling?
2. Could you elaborate on the choice of scoring functions (e.g., cosine similarity, NDCG) and their potential limitations in specific contexts?
3. Have you considered extending the framework to multilingual or cross-lingual settings? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?
Recommendation
This paper is a solid, well-written contribution that introduces a flexible and impactful framework for lexical analysis. Despite minor weaknesses in clarity and overly general statements, the innovative framework and its demonstrated utility make the submission worthy of presentation at ACL. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
