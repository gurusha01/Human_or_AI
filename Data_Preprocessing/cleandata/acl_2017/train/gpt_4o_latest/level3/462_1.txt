Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper investigates the use of sentiment analysis on 10-K annual disclosures for financial volatility prediction, combining textual data with factual market data. The primary contributions of the work are as follows:  
1. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in volatility prediction, significantly outperforming prior methods. This is achieved through innovative use of Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models, which extend lexicon term weights to similar terms using word embeddings.  
2. The study effectively combines textual sentiment features with factual market data (e.g., GARCH models and current volatility) through various fusion techniques, with stacking emerging as the most effective.  
3. The paper provides a sector-specific analysis of risk factors, highlighting the shared and unique characteristics of financial sectors, and demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed model across sectors.  
Strengths:  
1. State-of-the-Art Performance: The proposed method achieves superior results compared to existing approaches, both in text-only and text-plus-market feature settings. The use of advanced IR term weighting models and word embeddings is particularly impactful, as evidenced by the significant improvement in rÂ² scores.  
2. Effective Fusion of Data Modalities: The study explores multiple fusion techniques for combining textual and market data, with stacking showing clear advantages. This demonstrates a thoughtful approach to integrating heterogeneous data sources for improved prediction.  
3. Sector-Specific Insights: The paper provides valuable insights into sector-specific risk factors and demonstrates the robustness of the general model across sectors. This analysis adds depth to the study and highlights the potential for future improvements with larger sector-specific datasets.  
4. Thorough Evaluation: The experiments are well-designed, with 5-fold cross-validation and comparisons across multiple baselines. The use of both cross-validation and real-world scenarios strengthens the validity of the results.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the proposed approach achieves strong results, it lacks significant novelty in terms of model architecture or feature engineering. The core innovation lies in applying existing IR term weighting models and word embeddings to sentiment analysis, which may not be sufficient for a high-impact contribution.  
2. Insufficient Literature Comparison: The paper does not adequately compare its approach to deep learning-based methods, which are widely used in sentiment analysis and have demonstrated strong performance with minimal feature engineering. This omission limits the contextualization of the results within the broader field.  
3. Sector-Specific Model Limitations: Although the paper explores sector-specific models, the analysis does not fully address the potential for domain-specific improvements if larger datasets were available. This limits the practical implications of the sector-specific findings.  
Questions to Authors:  
1. How does the proposed method compare to recent deep learning-based approaches for sentiment analysis, such as transformer models (e.g., BERT or FinBERT)? Could these methods further improve performance?  
2. Did you explore alternative dimensionality reduction techniques beyond PCA, such as autoencoders, which might better capture the semantic structure of the data?  
3. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed method, particularly in comparison to deep learning-based approaches?  
Conclusion:  
This paper presents a well-executed study that achieves state-of-the-art results in financial volatility prediction using sentiment analysis of 10-K reports. While the approach is effective, its methodological novelty is limited, and the lack of comparison to deep learning methods is a notable gap. Nonetheless, the strong empirical results and sector-specific insights make this a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the weaknesses and providing additional comparisons to deep learning methods.
