Review of the Submitted Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper explores the application of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for normalizing German historical texts, addressing the challenge of limited training data by incorporating a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. The auxiliary task of grapheme-to-phoneme mapping is introduced to improve normalization accuracy. The authors claim that the MTL approach can obviate the need for explicit attention mechanisms by implicitly learning to focus attention during decoding. The paper also attempts to establish a statistical correlation between MTL-derived weights and attention-based models, providing insights into the relationship between these approaches. The authors evaluate their models on 44 Early New High German texts and report a 2% improvement over the state-of-the-art.
The primary contributions of the paper, as interpreted by this reviewer, are:
1. The novel use of grapheme-to-phoneme mapping as an auxiliary task in an MTL framework, which significantly improves normalization accuracy.
2. A detailed analysis of the interplay between MTL and attention mechanisms, offering insights into their functional similarities.
3. The application of seq2seq models to historical text normalization, a domain with limited prior work using neural architectures.
Strengths
1. Innovative Use of Grapheme-to-Phoneme Mapping: The auxiliary task is well-motivated and demonstrates clear benefits in improving normalization accuracy. The authors provide evidence that this approach is effective even in low-resource settings, which is a significant contribution to the field of historical text processing.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The models are evaluated across 44 datasets, which is commendable given the scarcity of annotated historical text corpora. This breadth of evaluation strengthens the validity of the reported improvements.
3. Insightful Analysis of MTL and Attention: The paper's exploration of how MTL implicitly learns attention-like mechanisms is thought-provoking and could inspire further research into the relationship between these two paradigms.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Exploration of Attention Failures in MTL: While the authors observe that attention mechanisms degrade MTL performance, they do not provide a thorough investigation into why this occurs. A deeper analysis or proposed modifications to address this limitation would enhance the paper's impact.
2. Lack of References to Related MTL Work: The paper does not adequately situate its contributions within the broader context of seq2seq MTL research. For instance, prior work such as [2] and [3], which also avoid attention mechanisms, is not cited or compared against.
3. Single-Language Focus: The experiments are limited to a single German dataset. Evaluating the proposed approach on additional languages or datasets would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation or hypothesis for why attention mechanisms degrade MTL performance in your experiments? Are there specific characteristics of the dataset or task that might contribute to this?
2. Have you considered testing your approach on other historical languages or datasets? If not, what challenges do you foresee in extending your method to other languages?
3. How does your work compare quantitatively and qualitatively to prior seq2seq MTL approaches that avoid attention mechanisms, such as [2] and [3]?
Recommendation
While the paper presents a novel application of MTL and provides valuable insights into the relationship between MTL and attention mechanisms, its limited novelty in the seq2seq domain, lack of exploration into attention failures, and single-language focus reduce its overall impact. I recommend a score of 3 (Weak Accept), contingent on the authors addressing the weaknesses during the rebuttal phase.
