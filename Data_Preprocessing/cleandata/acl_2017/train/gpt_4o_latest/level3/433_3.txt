Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of low-resource language processing and creole linguistics by introducing a dependency treebank for Singlish, annotated under the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. The dataset consists of 1,200 Singlish sentences, making it a valuable resource for studying creole languages and advancing NLP tools for low-resource languages. The authors propose a novel approach to improve part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing for Singlish by leveraging English syntactic knowledge through neural stacking. The experimental results demonstrate a 36% relative error reduction in dependency parsing accuracy, achieving 84.21% UAS. The paper also provides a detailed linguistic analysis of Singlish-specific constructions, such as topic prominence, copula deletion, and discourse particles, and evaluates how these are handled by different parsing models. The dataset, trained models, and source code are made publicly available, further enhancing the paper's impact.
Strengths
1. Dataset Contribution: The creation of a Singlish dependency treebank annotated with UD is a substantial resource for the NLP community, particularly for low-resource languages and creoles. The dataset is well-documented, and its public release ensures reproducibility and further research.
2. Innovative Approach: The integration of English syntactic knowledge via neural stacking is a novel and effective method for improving POS tagging and dependency parsing for Singlish. The approach is well-motivated, given the linguistic overlap between Singlish and English.
3. Clear Experimental Setup: The experiments are rigorously designed, with clear baselines and comparisons. The significant performance improvements achieved by the proposed method are supported by strong empirical evidence.
4. Linguistic Insights: The paper provides a thorough analysis of Singlish-specific grammatical constructions, such as NP deletion and discourse particles, and their treatment within the UD framework. This adds depth to the study and highlights the challenges of adapting English-trained models to Singlish.
5. Practical Implications: The work has practical applications for downstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and information extraction, in Singlish-speaking regions.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Cross-Language Comparison: The paper does not adequately compare the Singlish UD annotations with those of other non-English languages, raising concerns about potential inconsistencies in annotation practices.
2. Training Data Size Analysis: The impact of the size of the Singlish training data on model performance is not thoroughly analyzed. It remains unclear how much Singlish data would be required to make English data unnecessary.
3. Baseline Simplification: The authors do not include a baseline experiment where a single model is trained on concatenated English and Singlish datasets. This could provide a simpler alternative to neural stacking and serve as a more direct comparison.
4. Inter-Annotator Agreement: The inter-annotator agreement scores for the Singlish treebank are lower than those reported for UD English, but the paper does not sufficiently address the reasons for this discrepancy or its implications for the dataset's reliability.
5. NP Deletion Performance: The neural stacking model underperforms slightly on NP deletion cases, but the paper does not provide a detailed analysis or propose potential improvements for this issue.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the Singlish UD annotations align with those of other non-English languages? Are there any notable inconsistencies or deviations from UD guidelines?
2. Have you considered training a single model on concatenated English and Singlish datasets as a baseline? If so, how does its performance compare to the neural stacking approach?
3. What is the impact of increasing the size of the Singlish training data on model performance? Is there a point at which English data becomes redundant?
4. Could you provide more details on the annotation process for borrowed words and their POS tagging in Singlish? How were disagreements resolved?
5. Why does the neural stacking model slightly underperform on NP deletion cases, and what potential solutions could address this?
Additional Comments
- The paper would benefit from providing English glosses for the Singlish examples to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the language.
- The discussion on Singlish topic prominence and its alignment with UD's "dislocated" label could be expanded for clarity.
- The typo "pre-rained" should be corrected to "pre-trained."
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to low-resource language NLP and creole research. While there are some areas for improvement, the strengths of the dataset, methodology, and analysis outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
