Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces MORSE, a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that incorporates semantic information alongside orthographic features. The key contribution is the use of morpho-syntactic regularities captured in word representations to evaluate morphological relationships both locally and across the vocabulary. Unlike previous methods, MORSE leverages vector differences to assess semantic confidence, which allows it to address over-segmentation issues inherent in orthography-only approaches. The authors also highlight deficiencies in existing benchmarking datasets and propose a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) to better evaluate morpheme segmentation systems. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including a significant improvement over Morfessor, particularly in English and Turkish.
Strengths
1. Innovative Use of Morphological Compositionality: The idea of leveraging semantic vector differences for morpheme segmentation is novel and addresses key limitations of orthography-only methods. This approach effectively reduces over-segmentation errors, particularly for non-compositional words.
2. Clear Motivation and Structure: The paper is well-motivated, clearly articulating the shortcomings of existing methods and datasets. It is also well-structured, with a logical flow from problem definition to experimental results.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors validate MORSE across multiple languages and datasets, including the introduction of a new dataset (SD17) that adheres to compositionality principles. This strengthens the claim that MORSE is a robust and semantically aware segmentation framework.
Weaknesses
1. Handling Rule Ambiguity: The paper does not adequately address how MORSE resolves ambiguities in transformations, such as orthographically identical but semantically distinct rules (e.g., "null -> er"). This is a critical limitation that could impact performance in languages with high morphological ambiguity.
2. Inference Stage Inefficiency: The greedy inference approach is computationally suboptimal and prone to error propagation. This limits the scalability of the method and its applicability to languages with complex morphology.
3. Restriction to Known Words: The reliance on predefined rules and known word pairs restricts MORSE's ability to generalize to unseen words or low-resource languages with sparse data. This limitation is particularly evident in morphologically rich languages like Finnish, where MORSE underperforms compared to Morfessor.
4. Lack of Analysis on Threshold Sensitivity: The paper does not explore how the choice of similarity thresholds or hyperparameters impacts performance. This omission makes it difficult to assess the robustness of MORSE across different datasets and languages.
Questions to Authors
1. How does MORSE handle cases where multiple valid segmentations exist (e.g., "strafe-d" vs. "straf-ed")? Is there a mechanism to prioritize one segmentation over another?
2. Could you clarify how the semantic confidence scores are computed in cases of ambiguous transformations (e.g., "-er" as an agentive suffix vs. a comparative marker)?
3. Have you considered alternative inference strategies, such as beam search, to mitigate the limitations of the greedy approach?
Recommendation
While the paper presents a promising approach to morpheme segmentation and achieves state-of-the-art results, the unresolved issues related to rule ambiguity, inference inefficiency, and generalization to unseen words are significant. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided the authors address the handling of ambiguous transformations and offer more clarity on the impact of hyperparameter choices. Additionally, discussing potential improvements to the inference stage would strengthen the paper's contributions.
