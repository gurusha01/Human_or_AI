Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper presents a systematic comparison of subword modeling approaches for language modeling across ten languages with diverse morphological typologies. The key contributions of the paper are as follows:  
1. The introduction of a novel character trigram subword modeling method, which, when composed with bi-LSTMs, outperforms traditional approaches in six out of ten languages.  
2. A comprehensive analysis of subword modeling approaches, demonstrating that morpheme-based models are more effective than character-based models, particularly in handling rare words, as evidenced by perplexity reduction.  
3. A typology-based analysis of languages, which provides valuable linguistic insights into the interaction between morphological typologies and subword representations.  
4. An exploration of the limitations of character-level models, particularly in capturing root-and-pattern morphology and reduplication, highlighting the need for explicit morphological analysis in some cases.  
Strengths  
1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough comparison of subword modeling approaches, including character, character trigram, BPE, and morpheme-based models, across multiple languages with varying morphological typologies. This breadth of evaluation is a significant strength.  
2. Novelty of Character Trigrams: The proposed character trigram method, combined with bi-LSTMs, achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple languages, demonstrating its effectiveness. This novel approach addresses some limitations of existing character-based models.  
3. Linguistic Insights: The typology-based analysis is a valuable addition, offering insights into how different morphological processes (e.g., concatenative vs. non-concatenative) influence the effectiveness of subword representations.  
4. Rare Word Handling: The analysis of perplexity reduction for rare words highlights the practical utility of morpheme-level models, which is particularly relevant for morphologically rich languages.  
5. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers from both computational and linguistic backgrounds.  
Weaknesses  
1. Motivation for Character Trigrams: The choice of character trigrams over other n-grams is not well-justified. The authors should clarify why trigrams were selected and whether higher-order n-grams were considered.  
2. Root-and-Pattern Morphology: The paper acknowledges the limitations of character-level models for root-and-pattern morphology but does not propose solutions or alternatives for unvocalized datasets like Arabic and Hebrew.  
3. Reduplication Analysis: The separation of reduplication from other morphological typologies is questionable. The rationale for treating it as a distinct category needs further justification.  
4. Embedding Dimensionality: The use of 200-dimensional embeddings for characters seems excessive given the size of the character vocabulary. A discussion on the impact of embedding size on performance and efficiency would strengthen the paper.  
Questions to Authors  
1. Why were character trigrams chosen over other n-grams? Were higher-order n-grams (e.g., 4-grams) tested, and if so, how did they perform?  
2. Could the authors elaborate on potential approaches to address the limitations of character-level models for root-and-pattern morphology in unvocalized datasets?  
3. What is the justification for treating reduplication as a separate morphological typology rather than incorporating it into broader categories?  
4. Did the authors experiment with lower-dimensional embeddings for characters? If so, how did this affect model performance?  
Conclusion  
This paper makes significant contributions to the field of subword modeling and language modeling, particularly through its novel character trigram approach and typology-based analysis. However, the lack of justification for certain design choices and the limited exploration of solutions for identified weaknesses slightly diminish its impact. Addressing these concerns could further strengthen the paper's contributions. Overall, the paper is a valuable addition to the field and merits consideration for acceptance.
