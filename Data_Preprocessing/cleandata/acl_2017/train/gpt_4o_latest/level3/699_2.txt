Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel approach for keyphrase prediction by dividing keyphrases into "present" (those appearing in the source text) and "absent" (those not explicitly present) categories. The authors propose an RNN-based generative model, enhanced with a copy mechanism, to address the limitations of traditional extraction-based methods. The model captures the semantic meaning of the text while also leveraging syntactic features to predict keyphrases. Key contributions of the paper include:
1. The introduction of a generative model for keyphrase prediction that incorporates a copy mechanism, enabling the prediction of rarely-occurring or out-of-vocabulary phrases.
2. The first systematic study of absent keyphrase prediction for scientific publications, with empirical results demonstrating up to 20% recall for absent keyphrases.
3. A comprehensive evaluation across six datasets, showing significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines for present keyphrase extraction.
Strengths
1. Novel Problem Formulation: The division of keyphrases into "present" and "absent" categories is a fresh perspective, addressing a critical gap in existing keyphrase extraction methods.
2. Readable Presentation: The paper is well-written and accessible, making the methodology and results easy to follow for readers.
3. Innovative Use of RNNs and Copy Mechanism: The integration of RNNs with a copy mechanism is an innovative approach that effectively combines semantic understanding with syntactic extraction. This design significantly improves performance, especially for absent keyphrases.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including a newly introduced large-scale dataset (KP20k), providing robust evidence of the model's effectiveness.
Weaknesses
1. Convergence and Reproducibility: The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the convergence of the joint learning process for RNN and CopyRNN. This omission makes it difficult for others to reproduce the results reliably.
2. Evaluation Gaps: The evaluation does not directly compare the model's performance on "present" keyphrases with state-of-the-art benchmarks, leaving the extent of improvement unclear in some cases.
3. Impact of Document Size: The effect of document size on keyphrase extraction is not thoroughly analyzed. The model underperforms on the Inspec dataset, which raises questions about its robustness across varying document lengths.
4. Incomplete Dataset Details: The training dataset details are insufficient, and not all documents are used for training baselines. This raises concerns about the fairness and reproducibility of the comparisons.
5. Limited Semantic Comparisons: The paper does not compare the RNN-based model's semantic capabilities with other semantic-based systems, such as Ref-[2], which could provide additional insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Include a detailed discussion on the convergence behavior of the joint learning process for RNN and CopyRNN to enhance reproducibility.
2. Directly compare the model's performance on "present" keyphrases with state-of-the-art benchmarks to provide a clearer picture of its relative strengths.
3. Analyze the impact of document size on keyphrase extraction and address the model's limitations on datasets like Inspec.
4. Provide complete details about the training dataset and ensure all documents are used for training baselines to improve the fairness of comparisons.
5. Evaluate "absent" keyphrases using alternative methods like tf-idf, Normalized Google Distance, or PMI to validate the model's semantic capture capabilities.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the convergence behavior of the joint learning process for RNN and CopyRNN? Did you observe any specific challenges during training?
2. Why does the model underperform on the Inspec dataset, and how do you plan to address this limitation in future work?
3. How does your model compare with other semantic-based systems, such as Ref-[2], in terms of capturing semantic meaning?
Conclusion
The paper presents a novel and promising approach to keyphrase prediction, particularly for absent keyphrases, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods. However, the lack of detailed discussions on convergence, dataset usage, and evaluation comparisons limits its reproducibility and interpretability. Addressing these weaknesses would strengthen the paper's contributions and impact.
