Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a new formula for assessing Vietnamese text readability, developed using multiple regression analysis with three features: average sentence length in characters (ASLC), average word length in characters (AWLC), and the percentage of difficult words (PDW2). The authors also present a new annotated corpus of 1,000 Vietnamese documents categorized into three readability levels: easy, normal, and difficult. The paper claims an overall accuracy of 81% in predicting text readability using the proposed formula. The primary contributions of this work are:
1. The creation of a larger annotated corpus for Vietnamese text readability, addressing the limitations of prior studies that relied on very small datasets.
2. The development of a new readability formula tailored to Vietnamese text, incorporating modern statistical techniques.
Strengths
1. Corpus Creation: The creation of a new annotated corpus with 1,000 documents is a significant contribution, as it provides a more robust foundation for future research in Vietnamese text readability. The authors also ensure moderate inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.422), which adds credibility to the dataset.
2. Feature Selection and Formula Development: The use of multiple regression analysis to identify key features (ASLC, AWLC, and PDW2) and create a readability formula demonstrates a systematic approach. The inclusion of cross-validation ensures some level of reliability in the results.
3. Focus on Vietnamese: The paper addresses a clear gap in the literature by focusing on Vietnamese text readability, a language with limited prior research in this area.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Justification for a New Formula: The need for a new formula is not convincingly justified. Existing Vietnamese readability formulas (e.g., Nguyen and Henkin, 1982, 1985) are mentioned but not critically evaluated or compared against the proposed method. This omission weakens the novelty claim of the paper.
2. Insufficient Experimental Analysis: The experimental section lacks comparisons with prior work, making the reported 81% accuracy difficult to contextualize. Without benchmarking against existing formulas, it is unclear whether the proposed method offers any improvement.
3. Limited Feature Analysis: The paper does not analyze how individual features (e.g., ASLC, AWLC, PDW2) contribute to the model's predictions or how they align with human perceptions of readability. This limits interpretability and practical insights.
4. Unclear Methodology for Vietnamese Text Processing: The handling of Vietnamese syllable-based text to identify "words" is inadequately explained. Given the complexity of Vietnamese morphology, this is a critical oversight.
5. Practical Applications and Examples: The paper does not demonstrate practical applications of the proposed formula with real-world examples, which would strengthen its relevance and usability.
6. Writing and Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from language issues, inconsistent capitalization, and errors in equations, which detract from its overall readability and professionalism.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed formula compare to existing Vietnamese readability formulas in terms of accuracy and feature selection?
2. Can you provide more details on how Vietnamese syllable-based text was processed to identify "words"? Were there any challenges or limitations in this approach?
3. What are the practical applications of the proposed formula, and can you provide examples of its use in real-world scenarios?
Recommendation
While the creation of a new corpus is a valuable contribution, the lack of critical evaluation of prior work, insufficient experimental analysis, and unclear methodology limit the impact of this paper. Significant revisions are needed to address these weaknesses before it can be considered for acceptance.
