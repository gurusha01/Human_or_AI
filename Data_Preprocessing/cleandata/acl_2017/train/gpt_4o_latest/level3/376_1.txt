Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the critical problem of extracting and analyzing geopolitical relationships (alliances and oppositions) between countries from news text. The authors propose a supervised, structured neural network approach, specifically leveraging recursive neural networks (RNNs), to classify sentence-level relations as positive (POS), negative (NEG), or neutral (NEU). The main contributions of the paper are:  
1. Annotated Dataset: The authors provide a new sentence-level annotated dataset for country relationship extraction, which could be a valuable resource for future research if made publicly available.  
2. Recursive Neural Network Models: The paper introduces event-centered recursive neural network (EC-RNN) models tailored to the task, which outperform baseline methods, including LSTMs and rule-based systems like TABARI.  
3. Relation Aggregation and Visualization: The paper proposes a temporal smoothing function to aggregate sentence-level relations into time-series data and visualizes geopolitical trends using graphs and time-series plots.
Strengths
1. Dataset Contribution: The annotated dataset is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a resource for studying geopolitical relationships. The dataset's focus on explicit relations and its annotation methodology are well-motivated.  
2. Modeling Contribution: The event-centered recursive neural network (EC-RNN) model is a novel adaptation of recursive neural networks for event-based relation extraction. The model's precision-oriented cost function is a thoughtful addition that aligns with the task's requirements.  
3. Improved Performance: The EC-RNN model demonstrates improved accuracy and precision over baselines, showcasing its effectiveness for the task.  
4. Timely Problem: The paper addresses an important and timely problem of extracting and analyzing international relations from unstructured text, which has applications in political science and international studies.
Weaknesses
1. Reproducibility Issues: The paper lacks sufficient detail in describing the models, baselines, and experimental setup. For example, training details for the recursive neural networks, such as hyperparameter tuning and optimization, are missing. Additionally, the provided code does not include implementations for the baselines, hindering reproducibility.  
2. Unclear Problem Definition: The paper does not clearly articulate why the task of extracting geopolitical relationships is particularly challenging or how it compares to related tasks like sentiment analysis or event extraction.  
3. Insufficient Baseline Explanation: The baselines (e.g., sentiment lexicon and LSTM classifier) are inadequately described, making it difficult to assess the significance of the proposed model's improvements.  
4. Visualization Limitations: The visualization methods lack innovation and fail to provide meaningful insights. The force-directed graph approach is ad-hoc, and the temporal smoothing function is not well-justified.  
5. Evaluation Gaps: The paper does not evaluate the system using external datasets like the MID dataset, which would have strengthened the claims about the model's generalizability. Additionally, the process for selecting and evaluating peaks in the time-series data is vague, with no examples or inter-annotator agreement rates provided.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the training process for the recursive neural network models, including hyperparameter settings, optimization methods, and early stopping criteria?  
2. Why were baselines like the sentiment lexicon and LSTM classifier not included in the provided code?  
3. How does the proposed task differ from related tasks like sentiment analysis or event extraction, and why is it particularly challenging?  
4. Can you clarify the mapping of CAMEO/TABARI categories to positive/negative relations and its impact on model performance?  
5. Why was external validation using datasets like MID omitted, and how do you justify the reliability of your evaluation?
Recommendation
While the paper addresses an important problem and makes valuable contributions in terms of dataset creation and modeling, the lack of clarity and reproducibility in the experimental setup, as well as the limited evaluation, significantly weaken its impact. I recommend major revisions before acceptance.
