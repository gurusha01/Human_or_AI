Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel supervised neural network model for keyphrase generation using an encoder-decoder architecture with an RNN and an attention mechanism. The key innovation lies in the incorporation of a copy mechanism, which allows the model to generate keyphrases absent from the source text. The authors claim three primary contributions: (1) the application of an RNN-based generative model with a copy mechanism for keyphrase prediction, (2) the first exploration of absent keyphrase prediction in scientific publications, and (3) a comprehensive evaluation across six datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods. The model's ability to generate absent keyphrases is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses a key limitation of prior extraction-based approaches.
Strengths
1. Novelty in Keyphrase Generation: The proposed model is innovative in its ability to generate absent keyphrases, a task that traditional extraction-based methods cannot handle. This capability is well-demonstrated through empirical results, where the model outperforms baselines in both present and absent keyphrase prediction tasks.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the model on six datasets, including a newly introduced large-scale dataset (KP20k). The results convincingly show the superiority of the CopyRNN model over both unsupervised and supervised baselines, with significant improvements in F1 scores.
3. Incorporation of the Copy Mechanism: The integration of the copy mechanism is a strong technical contribution, enabling the model to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and generate keyphrases that are semantically relevant but absent from the source text.
4. Generality Across Domains: The transferability of the model to news articles demonstrates its potential to generalize beyond the scientific domain, highlighting its broader applicability.
Weaknesses
1. Dataset Consistency in Evaluation: The paper does not clearly specify whether all evaluated models were trained and tested on the same datasets. This raises concerns about the fairness of the comparisons, particularly for supervised baselines.
2. Unclear Explanation of the Copy Mechanism: The description of the copy mechanism is somewhat ambiguous and lacks sufficient justification for its advantage over the basic RNN model. For instance, the mechanism's role in handling absent keyphrases could be better explained with more detailed examples or ablation studies.
3. Ambiguity in Terminology: The distinction between "out-of-vocabulary (OOV)" words and "absent keyphrases" is unclear, and the inconsistent use of terms like "OOV" and "unknown words" adds to the confusion. A more precise definition and consistent terminology would improve clarity.
4. Word Embedding Initialization: The paper does not specify how word embeddings are initialized, which is a critical detail for reproducibility and understanding the model's performance.
5. Correlation Among Keyphrases: While the paper mentions that the model does not account for correlations among target keyphrases, this limitation is not explored in depth. This could be a significant drawback in scenarios where keyphrases are interdependent.
Questions to Authors
1. Were all evaluated models (including baselines) trained and tested on the same datasets? If not, how were the datasets split, and how does this impact the fairness of the comparisons?
2. Could you provide more details or examples to clarify the copy mechanism's role in generating absent keyphrases? How does it specifically improve over the basic RNN model?
3. How were word embeddings initialized in the model? Were they pre-trained or learned from scratch during training?
4. Can you elaborate on the inconsistent use of terms like "OOV" and "unknown words"? How do these terms relate to absent keyphrases in your context?
Recommendation
While the paper demonstrates strong empirical results and introduces a novel approach to keyphrase generation, the aforementioned weaknesses, particularly the lack of clarity in key methodological aspects, need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the authors providing additional clarity on dataset usage, the copy mechanism, and terminology.
