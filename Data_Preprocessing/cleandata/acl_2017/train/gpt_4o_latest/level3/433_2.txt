Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper tackles the underexplored area of dependency parsing for Singlish, a creole-like language based on English, by constructing a Singlish dependency treebank and leveraging English syntactic knowledge to improve parsing performance. The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. Singlish Dependency Treebank: The creation of a high-quality annotated dataset of 1,200 Singlish sentences under the Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme. This resource is valuable for future research in low-resource languages and creoles.  
2. Neural Stacking for Knowledge Transfer: The application of neural stacking to integrate English syntactic knowledge into a Singlish parser, achieving a 36.51% error reduction and a strong performance of 84.21% UAS.  
3. Empirical Insights: The investigation into the linguistic characteristics of Singlish and the demonstration of the effectiveness of domain-specific embeddings (ICE-SIN) over general English embeddings, highlighting the distributional differences between Singlish and English.  
Strengths:  
1. Dataset Contribution: The Singlish dependency treebank fills a significant gap in resources for creole-like languages, enabling further research in this domain. The dataset adheres to the UD scheme, ensuring compatibility with existing multilingual resources.  
2. Strong Experimental Results: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of neural stacking in low-resource scenarios, achieving substantial error reductions in both POS tagging and dependency parsing. The use of ICE-SIN embeddings further underscores the importance of domain-specific resources.  
3. Relevance and Novelty: The focus on Singlish, a linguistically and computationally challenging language, is timely and relevant, especially given the increasing use of Singlish in online communication.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Positioning within Literature: While the paper builds on prior work in transfer learning and low-resource parsing, the techniques employed (e.g., neural stacking) are not novel and closely resemble existing methods. The contributions could have been better contextualized within the broader literature to emphasize the novelty of the work.  
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments are restricted to Singlish, and no comparative baselines are provided for other small treebanks (e.g., Irish or Haitian Creole). This limits the generalizability of the findings.  
3. Missed Opportunities in Domain Adaptation: The authors could have explored domain-adaptation techniques to further improve performance, especially given the availability of related resources like ICE-SIN.  
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Broaden the scope of experiments by including results for other small treebanks to validate the generalizability of the approach.  
2. Explore domain-adaptation techniques to enhance the parser's performance further.  
3. Provide a more detailed discussion of how this work advances the state of the art in low-resource parsing and transfer learning, beyond the application to Singlish.  
Final Recommendation:  
The paper makes a solid contribution by introducing a valuable dataset and achieving strong results for Singlish parsing. While the methods lack novelty, the empirical findings and dataset release make this work a useful resource for the NLP community. I recommend acceptance with a score of 4, contingent on addressing the broader positioning of the work within the literature and expanding the experimental scope.
