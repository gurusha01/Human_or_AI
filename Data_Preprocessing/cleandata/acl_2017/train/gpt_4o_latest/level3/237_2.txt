Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions  
This paper addresses the challenge of determining word polarity orientation in an unsupervised and semi-supervised manner using vector space models (VSMs) and word embeddings. The authors propose a novel approach to identify a sentiment dimension within high-dimensional vector spaces, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction in the unsupervised setting. The paper compares its methods against the PMI-IR algorithm (Turney, 2002) and evaluates performance using two datasets: IMDB and Stanford Sentiment Treebank. The authors claim their approach is more practical, data-efficient, and robust to data sparsity compared to PMI-IR.  
The main contributions of the paper are:  
1. A novel unsupervised methodology using word embeddings (Word2Vec and GloVe) to identify sentiment orientation, outperforming the PMI-IR baseline.  
2. A semi-supervised methodology that incorporates external polarity information, achieving higher accuracy than the unsupervised approach.  
3. A comparative analysis of word embedding models (Word2Vec vs. GloVe) and their effectiveness in sentiment analysis tasks.  
Strengths  
1. Novelty in Approach: The use of PCA to extract a sentiment dimension from word embeddings is an innovative application of dimensionality reduction techniques in sentiment analysis. This approach provides a fresh perspective on leveraging distributional semantics for unsupervised tasks.  
2. Comparison with Existing Methods: The paper offers a direct comparison with the PMI-IR algorithm, demonstrating clear improvements in accuracy and robustness to data sparsity. This strengthens the case for the proposed methodology.  
3. Practicality and Data Efficiency: The unsupervised Word2Vec-based method achieves competitive results using smaller datasets, highlighting its practicality for real-world applications where large labeled datasets may not be available.  
4. Insightful Observations: The authors provide valuable insights into the limitations of collocation-based methods (e.g., PMI-IR and GloVe) and the advantages of paradigmatic relations exploited by Word2Vec.  
5. Reproducibility: The paper describes the experimental setup and datasets in detail, making it easier for future researchers to replicate the results.  
Weaknesses  
1. Lack of Rigorous Justification: The choice of PCA and vector averaging is primarily justified through intuition rather than theoretical or empirical evidence. The paper does not explore alternative dimensionality reduction techniques or vector operations that might improve performance.  
2. Limited Real-World Applications: While the approach is promising, the paper does not demonstrate its utility in real-world sentiment analysis tasks beyond the movie review datasets. Broader applications would strengthen its impact.  
3. Insufficient Baseline Comparisons: The study compares its methods only to PMI-IR, an older baseline. Comparisons with more recent unsupervised or semi-supervised sentiment analysis methods would provide a stronger evaluation of the proposed approach.  
4. Performance Gap: The reported accuracy (66% for the semi-supervised Word2Vec model) falls short of state-of-the-art supervised methods, which typically exceed 80%. This limitation should be addressed or contextualized more thoroughly.  
5. Limited Exploration of Parameters: The paper does not explore the sensitivity of the results to hyperparameters (e.g., context window size, number of point words), which could provide deeper insights into the robustness of the approach.  
Questions to Authors  
1. Why was PCA chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique? Have you considered alternatives such as t-SNE or UMAP?  
2. How does the proposed method perform on datasets from other domains (e.g., product reviews, social media posts)?  
3. Could the performance gap between unsupervised and semi-supervised methods be reduced by refining the selection of point words or reference vectors?  
Conclusion  
This paper presents a promising approach to unsupervised sentiment analysis using word embeddings and dimensionality reduction. While the methodology is innovative and demonstrates clear improvements over PMI-IR, the lack of broader applications, rigorous justification, and comparisons with recent baselines limits its impact. With additional experiments and refinements, this work has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
