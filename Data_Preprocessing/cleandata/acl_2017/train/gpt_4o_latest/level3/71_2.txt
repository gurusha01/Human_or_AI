Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions
This paper presents a fully automatic framework for cross-lingual name tagging and linking across 282 languages, leveraging Wikipedia as a multilingual resource. The system identifies name mentions, assigns entity types, and links them to an English Knowledge Base (KB). The key contributions of this work are:
1. Comprehensive Multilingual Resource: The framework supports 282 languages, making it one of the most ambitious multilingual name tagging and linking systems to date. It generates "silver-standard" annotations through cross-lingual entity transfer, self-training, and topic selection, eliminating the need for manual annotations or language-specific resources.
   
2. Evaluation Across Diverse Data: The system is evaluated on both Wikipedia and non-Wikipedia data, demonstrating competitive performance compared to supervised models trained on manually annotated datasets. This highlights the robustness and scalability of the proposed approach.
3. Novel Techniques for Low-Resource Languages: The framework introduces innovative methods, such as deriving morphology features from Wikipedia markups and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links, which are particularly beneficial for low-resource and morphologically rich languages.
Strengths
1. Scalability and Automation: The framework's ability to operate across 282 languages without manual annotations is a significant achievement, addressing the critical need for multilingual NLP tools in low-resource settings.
   
2. Strong Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation, comparing the system's performance to state-of-the-art supervised models on both Wikipedia and external datasets. This demonstrates the system's practical utility and generalizability.
3. Scientific Rigor: The authors contextualize their results well, comparing their approach to manual-resource-based methods and adhering to good scientific practices.
4. Resource Contribution: The release of resources, including annotations, morphology analyzers, and the end-to-end system, is a valuable contribution to the NLP community.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper suffers from poor organization and lacks a clear exposition of its motivations and contributions. For instance, the problem definition and high-level goals are not articulated effectively, making it challenging for readers to grasp the significance of the work.
2. Over-reliance on Wikipedia: While the use of Wikipedia is innovative, the system's reliance on this resource may limit its applicability to domains or languages with sparse Wikipedia coverage. This limitation is not adequately discussed.
3. Insufficient Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not sufficiently address the challenges or limitations of the proposed approach, such as the quality of "silver-standard" annotations or the performance drop in languages with limited mentions.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the system handle languages with extremely sparse Wikipedia coverage or no Wikipedia presence at all? Are there plans to extend the framework to such languages?
2. Could you elaborate on the impact of noisy "silver-standard" annotations on the system's performance, particularly for low-resource languages?
3. How does the framework adapt to domain-specific texts outside Wikipedia, such as highly informal or specialized corpora?
Overall Recommendation
This paper presents a significant contribution to cross-lingual name tagging and linking, demonstrating scalability, automation, and strong performance across a wide range of languages. Despite its organizational shortcomings, the work is of high importance to the NLP community, particularly for low-resource language processing. I recommend acceptance at ACL 2017, provided the authors address the clarity and presentation issues in the final version.
