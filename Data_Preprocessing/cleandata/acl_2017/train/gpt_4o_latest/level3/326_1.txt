Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the challenge of Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) across multiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria by proposing an adversarial multi-criteria learning framework. The authors introduce three shared-private models (parallel, stacked, and skip-layer) under a multi-task learning paradigm, leveraging adversarial training to ensure the shared layer extracts criterion-invariant features. The approach is evaluated on eight diverse datasets, including both simplified and traditional Chinese corpora, making it the largest-scale evaluation of its kind in this domain. The key contributions of the paper are:
1. The application of adversarial multi-criteria learning to CWS, introducing three novel shared-private architectures.
2. The integration of adversarial training to enforce criterion invariance in shared features, accompanied by a new objective function.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrating performance improvements across eight datasets, with insights into cross-linguistic transfer between simplified and traditional Chinese.
Strengths
1. Novel Application of Adversarial Learning: The use of adversarial strategies to enforce criterion-invariant feature extraction is a notable innovation, particularly in the context of multi-criteria CWS. This approach has broader implications for other NLP tasks with varying definitions of correctness.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates its models on eight datasets, covering both simplified and traditional Chinese, which is a significant scale for CWS research. The results demonstrate consistent improvements, with adversarial training providing additional gains.
3. Cross-Linguistic Insights: The analysis of knowledge transfer between simplified and traditional Chinese datasets is a valuable contribution, highlighting the potential for shared features to improve performance across related linguistic domains.
Weaknesses
1. Unclear Problem Framing: The paper lacks a clear and concise definition of the problem it addresses. The term "multi-criteria" is ambiguous, and "elusive gold standard" might better capture the issue of inconsistent annotation criteria.
2. Narrow Motivation: While the authors focus on CWS, the "elusive gold standard" problem is prevalent across many NLP tasks (e.g., machine translation, part-of-speech tagging). The paper misses an opportunity to generalize its findings and emphasize broader applicability.
3. Reader Accessibility: Assumptions about readers' familiarity with Chinese and the complexity of CWS may alienate non-Chinese researchers. The exposition could be improved to make the work more accessible to a broader audience.
4. Terminology Issues: The use of "adversary" may be misleading, as the differences in segmentation criteria are not inherently adversarial. A more neutral term might better reflect the nature of the problem.
5. Exposition and Clarity: The paper suffers from minor English errors and larger exposition issues, making it difficult to follow in places. For example, Table 4 lacks clarity regarding key metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F-measure, OOV), and the claims about significant improvements are not always well-supported by the data.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify how the adversarial loss function (entropy-based) compares to other alternatives, such as negative cross-entropy, in terms of effectiveness and computational cost?
2. How do the proposed models generalize to other NLP tasks with similar multi-criteria challenges, such as machine translation or part-of-speech tagging?
3. Could you provide more detailed error analysis for datasets where performance dropped (e.g., MSRA in some cases) to better understand the limitations of the approach?
Recommendation
While the paper makes meaningful contributions to multi-criteria learning for CWS and introduces innovative adversarial strategies, it requires improvements in problem framing, exposition, and generalization to broader NLP contexts. With revisions, this work has the potential to make a significant impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions.
