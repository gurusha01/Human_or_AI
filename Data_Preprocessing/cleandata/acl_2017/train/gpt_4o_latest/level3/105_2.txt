Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel encoder-decoder model with a hard attention mechanism that explicitly enforces monotonicity in sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) tasks. The key contributions of the paper are:
1. A new architecture that decouples alignment and transduction, leveraging monotonic alignments for tasks like morphological inflection generation.
2. State-of-the-art performance on three morphological datasets (CELEX, Wiktionary, and SIGMORPHON 2016), particularly excelling in low-resource settings.
3. A detailed analysis of the learned alignments and representations, comparing the hard attention model to soft attention mechanisms, and highlighting the advantages of monotonicity in certain linguistic contexts.
Strengths
1. Novelty in Architecture: The proposed model introduces a hard attention mechanism that explicitly enforces monotonicity, which is a natural fit for tasks like morphological inflection. The decoupling of alignment and transduction is a key innovation, allowing for simpler training and better performance in low-resource settings.
2. Performance in Low-Resource Scenarios: The model outperforms both neural and non-neural baselines on the CELEX dataset, demonstrating its robustness with limited training data. This is a significant contribution, as many neural models struggle in such scenarios.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the model on three diverse datasets, covering different languages and morphological phenomena. This broad evaluation strengthens the claim of general applicability.
4. Insightful Analysis: The analysis of learned alignments and representations provides valuable insights into how the model captures linguistic features and positional information, shedding light on the advantages of hard attention over soft attention in monotonic tasks.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Task Scope: The model is only evaluated on morphological inflection tasks. While the authors suggest its applicability to other monotonic Seq2Seq tasks (e.g., transliteration, summarization), no experiments are conducted to validate these claims.
2. Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not compare the proposed model to simpler monotonic alignment-based baselines, such as neural taggers or models like Schnober et al. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative complexity and performance trade-offs.
3. Greedy Alignment Limitation: The reliance on greedy alignment during training could limit the model's ability to handle more complex alignments. A comparison with approaches that marginalize over all alignments (e.g., Yu et al.) would have been insightful.
4. Linguistic Feature Explanation: The role of linguistic features (e.g., part-of-speech tags) in the model is not well-explained. It remains unclear how these features influence performance and whether they are essential for the model's success.
5. Clarity and Formatting Issues: Several equations, figures, and textual explanations lack clarity, which may hinder reproducibility. For example, the description of the training process and control mechanism could be more concise and precise.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the model perform on other monotonic Seq2Seq tasks, such as transliteration or summarization? Can you provide experimental results to support its generalizability?
2. Why were simpler monotonic baselines (e.g., neural taggers) not included in the comparisons? How does the proposed model compare in terms of complexity and performance?
3. Could the greedy alignment approach be replaced with a more robust method (e.g., marginalizing over alignments)? If so, how would this impact performance and training complexity?
Recommendation
While the paper introduces a novel and effective approach for morphological inflection generation, its limited scope and lack of comparisons with simpler baselines raise concerns. I recommend acceptance with revisions, provided the authors address the evaluation scope and baseline comparison issues during the rebuttal phase.
