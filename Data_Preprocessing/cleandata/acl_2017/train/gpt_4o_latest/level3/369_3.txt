Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the challenge of morphology generation in Chinese-to-Spanish machine translation (MT) by proposing a deep learning-based classification architecture to handle gender and number morphology. The authors adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, decoupling translation from morphology generation. The proposed architecture combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify gender and number from simplified Spanish text. The authors report high classification accuracies (98.4% for gender and 93.7% for number) and a modest improvement of up to 0.7 METEOR in translation quality.
The primary contributions of the paper are:
1. A novel neural network-based classification architecture for gender and number morphology generation.
2. An evaluation of the proposed method in the challenging Chinese-to-Spanish MT task, which involves translating from a morphologically simple language to a morphologically rich one.
3. A pipeline that integrates morphology simplification, classification, and postprocessing for full-form generation.
Strengths
1. Focused Problem Addressed: The paper tackles a specific and challenging aspect of MT—morphology generation in a morphologically rich target language—which is a known bottleneck in translation quality.
2. Neural Architecture Design: The proposed CNN+LSTM architecture is well-motivated and achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to standard machine learning techniques like SVMs and random forests.
3. Improved Translation Quality: The reported METEOR improvement of up to 0.7 demonstrates the potential of the approach, particularly in a low-resource language pair like Chinese-Spanish.
4. Choice of METEOR Metric: The use of METEOR, which better accounts for linguistic features like morphology, is appropriate for this task and appreciated.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Morphology Generation: The focus on only gender and number is too narrow to claim a general-purpose "morphology generation" method, especially for morphologically rich languages like Spanish. The lack of broader morphological features (e.g., tense, mood, case) limits the impact of the work.
2. Insufficient Comparison with State-of-the-Art: The paper does not compare its method with other state-of-the-art morphology generation approaches, such as those using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or recent neural MT systems that incorporate morphology-aware models. This omission weakens the persuasiveness of the results.
3. Evaluation Clarity and Reproducibility: The evaluation section lacks critical details, such as preprocessing steps, dataset preparation, and the specific METEOR version used. This hinders reproducibility.
4. Overstated Contributions: The use of deep learning and the choice of the Chinese-to-Spanish language pair are not inherently novel. Prior work has explored similar architectures and language pairs, albeit with different focuses.
5. Simplified Spanish Process: The method for simplifying Spanish morphology is unclear, and its impact on the results is not well-explained. This step appears to be a black box in the pipeline.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify the process of simplifying Spanish morphology? How does this simplification impact the translation and classification tasks?
2. Why was METEOR chosen over BLEU for evaluation, and which version of METEOR was used?
3. How does the proposed method compare to state-of-the-art morphology generation approaches, such as CRFs or neural MT systems with explicit morphology modeling?
4. Could you elaborate on the role of handcrafted rules in the rescoring step? How significant are they in achieving the reported results?
Conclusion
While the paper addresses an important problem and demonstrates promising results, its limited scope, lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods, and insufficient clarity in evaluation reduce its overall impact. The work would benefit from a broader focus on morphology generation, more rigorous evaluation, and clearer justification of its contributions. I recommend a weak reject, as the paper requires significant revisions to address these concerns.
