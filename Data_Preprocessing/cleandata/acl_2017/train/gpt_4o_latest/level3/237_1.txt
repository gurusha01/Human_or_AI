Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper tackles the challenging problem of unsupervised sentiment analysis by proposing a novel approach using vector space models (VSMs) to measure the sentiment orientation of words. The authors explore both unsupervised and semi-supervised methodologies, leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques and word embeddings (Word2Vec and GloVe). The key contribution is the introduction of a sentiment dimension within a high-dimensional vector space, which is used to classify movie reviews. The paper claims that the proposed unsupervised Word2Vec-based method outperforms the PMI-IR approach (Turney, 2002) in terms of accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, the semi-supervised method demonstrates further improvements, albeit with limited gains. The visualizations, particularly Figure 2, effectively illustrate the sentiment dimension and its correlation with annotated data.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty in Approach: The paper introduces a novel application of dimensionality reduction (PCA) to identify a sentiment dimension in vector space, which is a creative and theoretically grounded extension of distributional semantics.  
2. Visualization: Figure 2 provides a clear and compelling visualization of the sentiment dimension, aiding in the interpretability of the results. This is a strong point in demonstrating the methodology's potential.  
3. Comparison with Baseline: The direct comparison with the PMI-IR method highlights the advantages of the proposed approach, particularly in overcoming data sparsity issues inherent to collocation-based methods.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Experimental Depth: The experiments lack depth, as the study compares only a few techniques (Word2Vec, GloVe, and PMI-IR). The absence of F1-score measurements and other evaluation metrics limits the robustness of the results. Additionally, the accuracy achieved (66% at best) is significantly lower than supervised methods, raising questions about practical utility.  
2. Methodological Justification: The methodology is poorly organized and insufficiently justified. For instance, the choice of dimensionality reduction (PCA) and the specific parameters (e.g., context window sizes) are not adequately explained. The reliance on vector averaging for reference vector construction is simplistic and may not fully capture sentiment polarity.  
3. Weak Analysis of Results: The analysis of results is shallow, with limited exploration of why certain models (e.g., GloVe) perform poorly or why semi-supervised methods do not yield substantial improvements. Key assumptions, such as the effectiveness of point word selection, are not rigorously validated.  
4. Generalizability Concerns: The study focuses solely on movie reviews, and there is no discussion of how the proposed methods would generalize to other domains or languages.  
Questions to Authors:  
1. Why was PCA chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, and how does it compare to other methods like t-SNE or UMAP for this task?  
2. How were the parameters (e.g., context window size, number of dimensions) for Word2Vec and GloVe determined? Were they optimized for the task?  
3. Could you provide F1-scores or other evaluation metrics to complement the accuracy results?  
Recommendation:  
While the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to unsupervised sentiment analysis, the lack of experimental rigor, weak results, and insufficient methodological justification significantly limit its impact. I recommend rejection at this stage, but the work has potential if the authors address the methodological and experimental shortcomings in future revisions.
