Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions  
This paper presents a novel neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on the dual tasks of extracting links between argument components (ACs) and classifying their types. The authors propose a joint model based on a modified Pointer Network (PN) architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets: a persuasive essay corpus and a microtext corpus. The key contributions of this work are:  
1. A thorough review of prior work in argument mining, situating the proposed approach within the context of existing methods.  
2. The adaptation of Pointer Networks with effective modifications, including a joint optimization for link prediction and AC type classification.  
3. Empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model over baseline and prior methods, particularly in handling small datasets and learning structural relationships.  
Strengths  
1. Thorough Literature Review: The paper provides a comprehensive overview of prior work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and motivating the use of Pointer Networks for argument mining. This contextualization strengthens the paper's contribution.  
2. Effective Model Design: The proposed joint model leverages the strengths of Pointer Networks while introducing modifications, such as bidirectional LSTMs and joint optimization, which are well-justified and effective. The ablation study further validates the importance of these design choices.  
3. State-of-the-Art Results: The model achieves impressive performance on both datasets, particularly in link prediction, even with limited training data. The results demonstrate the model's ability to learn structural cues and outperform prior methods that explicitly encode tree constraints.  
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Scope of Argument Mining Subtasks: The paper focuses only on subtasks 2 (AC type classification) and 3 (link prediction), neglecting subtasks 1 (AC identification) and 4 (link type classification). While this is acknowledged, integrating these subtasks could provide a more holistic solution.  
2. Clarity Issues in Model Presentation: The paper lacks clarity in certain technical details, such as the pooling methods (line 397) and the interpretation of Equation (7) (line 472). These ambiguities hinder reproducibility.  
3. Dataset and Evaluation Details: Table 4 does not specify the dataset used, and Table 2 lacks clarity on baseline evaluations and model distinctions. Clearer presentation of these details would improve the paper's readability and rigor.  
4. Hyperparameter and Inference Details: The paper does not provide sufficient explanation for hyperparameter selection, early stopping criteria, and test-time inference, which are critical for reproducibility.  
Questions to Authors  
1. Could you clarify the pooling methods used for embedding representations and their role in the model's performance?  
2. How were hyperparameters (e.g., dropout, Î±) selected, and how sensitive is the model to these choices?  
3. Could you elaborate on the early stopping criteria based solely on link prediction accuracy and its impact on type classification performance?  
4. What dataset was used for the experiments in Table 4, and why was this not specified?  
Additional Comments  
- The use of the elu activation function should be explained and cited.  
- Labels such as "MC," "Cl," and "Pr" should be clarified in the text for accessibility.  
- Minor typos (e.g., "which is show" on line 161, "Minimum" instead of "Maximum" on line 684) should be corrected.  
- The surprising performance with limited training data warrants further discussion, particularly in comparison to other models.  
Recommendation  
This paper makes a significant contribution to argument mining by introducing a novel and effective neural architecture. However, the issues with clarity, dataset specification, and reproducibility need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the authors addressing the weaknesses and clarifying the questions raised.
