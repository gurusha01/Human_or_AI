Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates techniques for enhancing the robustness of parsing with Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), specifically focusing on the English Resource Grammar (ERG). The authors evaluate five approaches: baseline ERG, bridging, Pacman (pacnv), PCFG approximation (csaw), and a hybrid method combining PCFG and ERG. The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. A systematic comparison of robust parsing techniques for HPSG, including both grammar-internal (bridging, pacnv) and external (PCFG-based) approaches.  
2. The introduction of hybrid methods that integrate PCFG-derived analyses with precision grammar parsing, achieving higher coverage and semantic accuracy than standalone techniques.  
3. An evaluation methodology that leverages datasets with varying levels of grammar coverage, though limited by dataset representativeness and reliance on intrinsic metrics like EDM F1.
Strengths
1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and provides a detailed explanation of the methods and their implementation, making it accessible to readers familiar with precision grammars.  
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The study evaluates multiple techniques across four datasets, offering insights into the trade-offs between coverage, speed, and accuracy. The hybrid methods, in particular, show promise for balancing these factors.  
3. Focus on Robustness: The paper addresses an important challenge in precision grammar parsing—handling out-of-coverage inputs—by exploring diverse approaches, including novel hybrid techniques.  
Weaknesses
1. Limited Comparison Across Frameworks: The study focuses exclusively on ERG, with no comparison to robustness techniques used in other precision grammar frameworks like CCG, LFG, or Alpino. This limits the broader applicability of the findings.  
2. Dataset Limitations: The datasets used (e.g., semcor, wsj00ab) are biased toward sentences that newer ERG versions can parse but older ones could not. A more representative dataset, including truly out-of-grammar sentences, would provide a clearer picture of the techniques' effectiveness.  
3. Insufficient Detail for Reproducibility: Key implementation details and metrics rely on an unpublished paper, making it difficult for others to replicate the results. Terms like "EDM" and "reverseability" are used without adequate explanation.  
4. Disappointing Results: Parsing speed is often slower than the baseline, especially for csaw-ww and hybrid-ww, which are computationally expensive. Additionally, the faster csaw-tb method is less accurate and lacks novelty.  
5. Lack of Extrinsic Evaluation: The paper does not evaluate the impact of robust parsing techniques on downstream tasks, which would provide stronger evidence of their utility.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the proposed techniques compare to robustness methods in other precision grammar frameworks like CCG or LFG?  
2. Can you provide more detail on the unpublished metrics and techniques referenced in the paper, such as EDM and reverseability?  
3. Have you considered evaluating the methods on a dataset that includes both in-coverage and truly out-of-grammar sentences to better assess their real-world applicability?  
4. What are the prospects for improving the speed of csaw-ww and hybrid-ww methods, given their computational expense?  
Recommendation
While the paper addresses an important problem and introduces promising hybrid methods, its limited scope, dataset bias, and lack of extrinsic evaluation weaken its impact. I recommend major revisions to address these issues, particularly by expanding comparisons to other frameworks, providing more implementation details, and including a more representative dataset.
