Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the critical problem of identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using speech transcript analysis, leveraging three datasets in both English and Portuguese. The authors propose a graph-based method that models transcripts as complex networks (CN) enriched with word embeddings, extracting features based on lexical, syntactic, and graph-theoretic properties. The study evaluates the approach using multiple machine learning classifiers and ensemble/multi-view learning, reporting results via 5-fold cross-validation. The primary contributions of this work are:  
1. The introduction of complex network-based features enriched with word embeddings for MCI detection, which outperform traditional linguistic features in certain cases.  
2. A comparative evaluation of the proposed method across three datasets, demonstrating its adaptability to different languages and narrative structures.  
3. The exploration of ensemble and multi-view learning to improve classification accuracy, achieving notable performance gains on specific datasets.
Strengths
1. Focus on a Significant Problem: The paper tackles a well-defined and impactful problemâ€”early detection of MCI, which has implications for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment. The use of speech transcripts is a practical and non-invasive approach.  
2. Novel Methodology: The use of complex networks enriched with word embeddings is innovative and provides a lightweight, language-independent representation, addressing challenges like disfluencies in transcripts.  
3. Evaluation Across Multiple Datasets: The inclusion of three datasets from different languages and contexts adds robustness to the study, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed method.  
4. Improved Performance: The ensemble and multi-view learning approaches demonstrate measurable improvements, particularly on the Cinderella and ABCD datasets, with up to 10% accuracy gains.  
5. Potential for Automation: The proposed method avoids manual preprocessing, making it scalable for large-scale assessments, which is a significant advantage in clinical settings.
Weaknesses
1. Language and Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from poor grammar and spelling, making it difficult to read and understand. Substantial language editing is required to improve clarity and professionalism.  
2. Unclear Problem Formulation: The machine learning problem is poorly described, with inconsistent dataset details (e.g., varying class distributions) and unclear motivations for enriching the graph with embeddings.  
3. Lack of Domain-Specific Tools: Despite the biomedical nature of the datasets, no domain-specific tools or features are utilized, which could have enhanced the model's relevance and interpretability.  
4. Evaluation Metrics and Statistical Testing: The reliance on accuracy as the primary metric is insufficient given the unclear class distributions. Metrics like F1-score would be more appropriate. Additionally, the absence of statistical significance testing undermines the validity of the reported improvements.  
5. Limited Exploration of Alternatives: The paper does not explore alternative graph representations or embedding techniques, which could have provided valuable insights into the robustness of the proposed method.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify the class distributions for each dataset and justify the use of accuracy as the primary evaluation metric?  
2. What motivated the choice of cosine similarity for enriching the networks, and were other similarity measures (e.g., Euclidean distance) considered?  
3. Why were domain-specific features or tools (e.g., linguistic markers specific to MCI) not incorporated into the model?  
4. Could you provide statistical significance testing for the reported results to validate the performance improvements?  
5. How does the proposed method compare to state-of-the-art approaches for MCI detection in terms of computational efficiency and interpretability?
Recommendation
While the paper addresses an important problem and introduces a novel methodology, the weaknesses in presentation, unclear problem formulation, and lack of rigorous evaluation metrics significantly detract from its impact. I recommend major revisions before acceptance, with a focus on improving clarity, addressing evaluation concerns, and exploring domain-specific enhancements.
