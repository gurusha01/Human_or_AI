Review of the Submitted Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper presents a novel approach to interpreting Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks by adapting methods from experimental psychology. The authors propose a hypothesis-driven framework to query the model with carefully constructed stimuli, allowing for a high-level understanding of the model's predictions. The study focuses on analyzing gender-specific writing characteristics in values-affirmation essays, demonstrating that male and female students differ in their use of self-focused and other-focused justifications. The main contributions of the paper are:
1. Novel Interpretability Framework: The paper introduces a method for interpreting LSTM predictions at a high level of abstraction, bypassing the need to analyze hidden states or gate activations. This approach is both innovative and practical, especially for applied quantitative scientists.
   
2. Application to Psychological Hypotheses: The authors extend psychological literature by analyzing gendered self-construal in the context of values-affirmation essays, providing modest empirical support for existing theories.
3. Improved Model Performance: The LSTM model outperforms a baseline SVM classifier in predicting essay categories, demonstrating the utility of the proposed architecture.
Strengths
1. Well-Written and Comprehensive: The paper is well-written and provides a thorough comparison of its approach to prior work, situating its contributions within both machine learning and psychological research.
   
2. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The authors openly discuss the modest support for their hypotheses and the limitations of their findings, which adds credibility to the work.
3. Interdisciplinary Impact: The paper bridges machine learning and psychology, offering a framework that could be adapted for other hypothesis-driven studies in the social sciences.
Weaknesses
1. Unclear Main Goal: The paper lacks clarity in articulating its primary objective. While the interpretability framework and psychological application are both valuable, the paper does not clearly prioritize one over the other, leading to some confusion about its main focus.
2. Imbalanced Section Lengths: Sections 1 and 2 are overly lengthy, providing excessive background at the expense of Sections 3 and 4, which contain the core contributions. This imbalance detracts from the paper's overall readability and focus.
3. Repetitive Clauses and Minor Errors: The paper contains minor grammatical errors and repetitive phrasing, which could be addressed with careful proofreading.
4. Suboptimal Figures and Tables: Table 1 should be reformatted to a single-column width for better readability. Figures 3, 5, and 6 require two-column widths to improve clarity and visual impact.
General Discussion
While the paper makes meaningful contributions, its clarity and structure need significant improvement. The authors should streamline the introduction and related work sections, focusing more on their novel contributions. Additionally, the figures and tables should be reformatted to enhance the paper's visual presentation.
Questions to Authors
1. Could you clarify whether the primary contribution of the paper is the interpretability framework or the psychological insights derived from the essays?  
2. How generalizable is the proposed interpretability method to other types of neural networks or datasets?  
3. Did you explore the potential impact of essay length or other confounding factors on the model's predictions?  
Recommendation
This paper has strong potential and makes valuable contributions to both machine learning and psychology. However, its structural and clarity issues, as well as the unclear prioritization of contributions, need to be addressed before acceptance. I recommend a major revision to improve the paper's focus, readability, and presentation.
