Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the challenging problem of extracting commonsense physical knowledge from unstructured text, focusing on relative physical attributes of objects and the implications of actions. The authors propose a novel joint inference model that integrates object-object relations and action-object implications across five dimensions: size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed. Their contributions are threefold: (1) introducing a new task of commonsense knowledge extraction centered around physical attributes and actions, (2) proposing a factor graph model to jointly infer object and action knowledge, and (3) developing and releasing a new dataset, VERBPHYSICS, which compiles crowd-sourced knowledge of actions and objects. The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods on two tasks: inferring knowledge about actions and predicting object pair relations.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Problem Importance: The paper tackles the underexplored problem of extracting implicit physical knowledge from text, which is crucial for advancing AI systems in reasoning, robotics, and vision. The joint inference approach is innovative and well-motivated, addressing the interplay between object-object and action-object relations.
2. Model Design: The factor graph model is thoughtfully constructed, leveraging semantic similarities, selectional preferences, and cross-knowledge correlations. This design effectively addresses the sparsity of textual evidence and reporting bias.
3. Empirical Results: The proposed model achieves strong performance on both tasks, outperforming baselines, particularly in scenarios with limited seed knowledge. The ablation study further highlights the importance of specific components, such as action-object compatibility and object embeddings.
4. Dataset Contribution: The creation of the VERBPHYSICS dataset is a significant contribution, as it provides a valuable resource for future research in this domain.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Examples: The paper does not provide sufficient concrete examples of object pairs, action verbs, or predicted attribute relations, which would help clarify the model's outputs and its practical implications. Additionally, an analysis of model errors is missing, which could provide insights into its limitations.
2. Dataset Size and Scalability: The dataset includes only 3656 object pairs, which raises concerns about the scalability of the approach and its ability to generalize to a broader range of object categories and action frames.
3. Unclear Factor Selection: The selection criteria for frame similarity and attribute similarity factors are not well-explained. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the robustness and generalizability of the model.
4. Comparison with Prior Work: The paper does not compare its method against direct approaches for mining attributes or attribute distributions, such as Davidov and Rappoport (ACL 2010). This omission makes it challenging to contextualize the proposed approach within the broader literature.
5. Minor Typos: The paper contains several minor typos and inconsistencies, such as mismatched dimensions and grammatical errors, which detract from its overall readability.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more examples of object pairs, action verbs, and predicted attribute relations to illustrate the model's outputs?
2. How do you plan to address the scalability of the dataset and the model to accommodate a larger number of object categories and action frames?
3. Could you elaborate on the criteria used for selecting frame similarity and attribute similarity factors? How sensitive is the model to these choices?
4. How does your approach compare quantitatively and qualitatively to direct attribute mining methods, such as Davidov and Rappoport (ACL 2010)?
Recommendation
While the paper makes significant contributions to commonsense knowledge extraction and introduces a novel dataset and model, the lack of examples, limited dataset size, and insufficient comparisons with prior work are notable weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided the authors address these concerns, particularly by adding examples, clarifying factor selection, and including a comparison with direct attribute mining methods.
