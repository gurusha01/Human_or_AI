Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel corpus of annotated essay revisions, designed for analyzing student revision behavior and enabling automatic revision identification. The primary contributions of the work are:
1. Annotated Corpus for Revision Analysis: The paper provides a well-annotated dataset of argumentative essays with three drafts per essay, aligned at the sentence level. Each revision is labeled with a purpose, using a detailed annotation scheme inspired by argument mining and discourse analysis. This is a valuable resource for studying the writing process and revision behaviors.
   
2. Applications of the Corpus: The authors demonstrate two applications: (1) statistical analysis of student revision behaviors, revealing insights into how feedback and linguistic background influence revisions, and (2) training an SVM-based classifier to predict revision purposes, replicating and extending prior work on revision classification.
3. Open Access Resource: The corpus, along with metadata and annotations, will be made freely available for research purposes, which is a significant contribution to the NLP and educational technology communities.
Strengths
1. Relevance and Novelty: The focus on between-draft revisions fills a gap in writing-related NLP research, which has traditionally focused on single-draft analysis. The corpus is particularly relevant for researchers studying argument mining, discourse analysis, and educational applications.
   
2. Annotation Quality: The paper describes a rigorous annotation process, achieving high inter-annotator agreement (Îº = 0.84 for high-level categories). The inclusion of both native and L2 speakers enhances the diversity and applicability of the dataset.
3. Demonstrated Utility: The two applications convincingly showcase the potential of the corpus. The behavior analysis highlights meaningful differences in revision patterns across linguistic groups, while the classification task demonstrates the feasibility of automatic revision identification.
4. Open Resource: The authors' commitment to releasing the corpus for public use is commendable and will likely encourage further research in this area.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Corpus Statistics: The paper does not provide essential corpus statistics, such as the total number of documents, tokens, sentences, or revisions. This omission makes it difficult to assess the scale and utility of the dataset.
2. Small Corpus Size: The corpus includes only 60 essays, which is relatively small for NLP tasks. This limits its generalizability and utility for training robust machine learning models, particularly for fine-grained revision categories.
3. Limited Exploration of Applications: While the two applications are useful, the paper could have explored additional potential applications, such as Native Language Identification (NLI), which seems feasible given the inclusion of L2 speakers.
4. Minor Writing Issues: There are minor redundancies in phrasing (e.g., "the SVM classifier was used as the classifier" on p. 7) and unclear terminology (e.g., "unigram" should be specified as "word unigram" on p. 7).
Questions to Authors
1. Could you provide a table summarizing key corpus statistics, such as the number of documents, sentences, tokens, and revisions per category?
2. Do you have plans to expand the corpus in the future to address its current size limitations?
3. Have you considered additional applications, such as NLI or stylistic analysis, using the corpus?
Additional Comments
- The authors are encouraged to address the redundancy and terminology issues mentioned above for clarity.
- Expanding the corpus with more essays and annotations would significantly enhance its utility for the broader NLP community.
Recommendation
While the paper has notable strengths, the small corpus size and lack of detailed statistics are significant drawbacks. This work may be more appropriate for a specialized workshop or conference rather than a major NLP venue. However, the resource itself is valuable, and the authors' commitment to open access is commendable. With revisions addressing the weaknesses, this work has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to writing process studies and educational NLP.
