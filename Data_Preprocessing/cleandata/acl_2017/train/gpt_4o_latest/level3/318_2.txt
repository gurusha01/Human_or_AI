Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel approach to Word Representation Learning (WRL) by incorporating sememe information from HowNet, a manually annotated linguistic knowledge base. The authors propose three models—Simple Sememe Aggregation (SSA), Sememe Attention over Context (SAC), and Sememe Attention over Target (SAT)—to integrate sememe information into WRL. The SAT model, in particular, leverages an attention mechanism to select appropriate word senses based on context, addressing the polysemy challenge in WRL. The paper evaluates these models on word similarity and word analogy tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods. The authors also provide case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of their approach in word sense disambiguation (WSD).
The primary contributions of the paper are:
1. The first application of sememe information from HowNet to improve WRL, addressing the polysemy issue.
2. The development of attention-based models (SAC and SAT) for context-aware word sense disambiguation and representation learning.
3. Extensive experimental validation showing the superiority of the proposed models, especially SAT, in capturing semantic relationships and improving WRL performance.
Strengths
1. Novelty of Approach: The use of sememe information from HowNet to enhance WRL is innovative and addresses a critical limitation of existing methods—handling polysemy. The attention-based models, particularly SAT, are well-designed to leverage sememe annotations effectively.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments on word similarity and word analogy tasks are comprehensive and demonstrate clear improvements over strong baselines like Skip-gram, CBOW, and GloVe. The SAT model consistently outperforms others, showcasing its robustness.
3. Interpretability: The use of sememes provides a more interpretable framework for WRL, as sememes explicitly encode semantic relationships. The case studies further illustrate the practical utility of the proposed models in word sense disambiguation.
4. Relevance: The work is highly relevant to the NLP community, as WRL is a foundational task for many downstream applications.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Contribution: While the use of HowNet and sememe information is novel, the overall contribution may not justify a long paper. The methodology primarily builds on existing frameworks like Skip-gram and attention mechanisms, with limited theoretical innovation.
2. Insufficient Comparisons: The paper does not adequately compare its models with other works that utilize manually developed resources like WordNet. This omission weakens the claim of the proposed method's superiority.
3. Language and Clarity: The English in the paper, while understandable, is occasionally awkward and could benefit from significant revision for better clarity and readability. For example, some sentences are overly verbose, and technical explanations could be streamlined.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare to other knowledge-based approaches that utilize WordNet or similar resources? Could you provide additional experimental results or qualitative comparisons?
2. Have you considered the computational efficiency of the SAT model compared to simpler baselines like Skip-gram? How does the attention mechanism impact training time?
3. How generalizable is the proposed approach to languages other than Chinese? Have you explored using sememe-like annotations in other linguistic resources?
Recommendation
While the paper presents a novel and promising approach to WRL using sememe information, the limited scope of contribution and lack of thorough comparisons with related works slightly diminish its impact. However, the empirical results and practical relevance make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance as a short paper, provided the authors address the issues of comparison and clarity during the revision phase.
