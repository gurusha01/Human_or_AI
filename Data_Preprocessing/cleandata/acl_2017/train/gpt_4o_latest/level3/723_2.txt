Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces MORSE, a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that integrates morpho-syntactic regularities captured by word embeddings with orthographic features. Unlike prior approaches, MORSE evaluates morphological relationships both locally and at a vocabulary-wide level, leveraging difference vectors in word embeddings to assess semantic consistency. The authors also highlight deficiencies in existing benchmarking datasets, particularly the Morpho Challenge (MC) dataset, and propose a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) to address these limitations. The key contributions of this work are:  
1. A novel minimally supervised framework for morpheme segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art results on English and Turkish datasets.  
2. The introduction of a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) for evaluating morpheme segmentation, which emphasizes compositionality and addresses weaknesses in existing datasets.  
3. A detailed analysis of the role of semantic cues in morpheme segmentation, demonstrating their importance in avoiding over-segmentation errors common in MDL-based approaches like Morfessor.  
Strengths
1. Innovative Evaluation Framework: The paper introduces multiple evaluation methods for segmentation hypotheses, particularly the use of semantic difference vectors, which could inspire further research in morpheme segmentation and related tasks.  
2. Strong Empirical Results: MORSE demonstrates convincing performance on English and Turkish datasets, outperforming Morfessor and achieving state-of-the-art results. The inclusion of a semantically driven dataset (SD17) strengthens the evaluation by addressing compositionality.  
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and well-structured, with a thorough discussion of related work, methodology, and results. The extensive bibliography provides a solid foundation for the research.  
4. Reproducibility: The submission includes software for testing the English MORSE model and small datasets, facilitating reproducibility and adoption by the community.  
5. Novel Dataset: The creation of SD17 is a significant contribution, as it highlights the limitations of existing datasets and provides a more robust benchmark for future research.  
Weaknesses
1. Incremental Contribution: While MORSE introduces semantic evaluation at scale, the method is largely incremental and lacks a meaningful comparison to prior work, particularly in terms of limitations and novelty.  
2. Compounding Language Performance: MORSE struggles with segmenting compounds in morphologically rich languages like Finnish, leading to unfair comparisons with Morfessor. This limitation undermines claims of language-agnosticity.  
3. Hyperparameter Tuning Bias: Hyperparameter tuning is inconsistent across methods, favoring MORSE over Morfessor, which may inflate the reported performance gains.  
4. Evaluation Gaps: Some evaluation details, such as morpheme-level evaluation and dataset differences in Table 7, are unclear or missing, reducing the transparency of the results.  
5. Limited Software Utility: The provided software only supports testing, not training, which limits its utility for researchers aiming to extend or adapt the framework.  
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the specific Morfessor variant and implementation used in the experiments?  
2. How do you address the issue of hyperparameter tuning bias, and could you clarify the tuning process for MORSE and Morfessor?  
3. What steps can be taken to improve MORSE's performance on highly compounding languages like Finnish?  
4. Could you elaborate on the computational efficiency and scalability of MORSE, particularly in comparison to Morfessor?  
Additional Comments
- The abstract should explicitly state that the method is minimally supervised to set accurate expectations for readers.  
- Section 3 should clarify that Ï† represents an empty string to avoid ambiguity.  
- The dataset format could be improved for broader applicability, and references should be corrected for capitalization and missing details (e.g., Narasimhan et al., 2015).  
Recommendation
While the paper presents a novel framework with promising results and valuable contributions, the incremental nature of the method, lack of robust comparisons, and evaluation gaps warrant a weak accept. Addressing the weaknesses and clarifying the evaluation details during the author response period could strengthen the case for acceptance.
