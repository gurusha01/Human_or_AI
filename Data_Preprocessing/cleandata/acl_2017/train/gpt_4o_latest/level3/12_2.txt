Summary and Contributions  
This paper introduces SynTime, a simple, rule-based method for time expression recognition that leverages syntactic types and heuristic rules. The authors analyze time expressions across four datasets and observe that they are typically short, expressed with a small vocabulary, and exhibit similar syntactic behavior. These insights are used to define a syntactic type system for time tokens, modifiers, and numerals, which forms the foundation of SynTime. The method is lightweight, expandable, and runs in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that SynTime outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based and machine learning methods on benchmark datasets and achieves particularly strong results on tweets. The paper claims three main contributions: (1) a detailed analysis of time expressions supporting the principle of least effort, (2) the introduction of SynTime as a type-based approach for time expression recognition, and (3) experimental validation of SynTime's effectiveness.
Strengths  
1. Strong Empirical Performance: SynTime achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly on tweets, where it demonstrates significant improvements in recall and F1 scores. This highlights its robustness in handling informal text.  
2. Simplicity and Efficiency: The proposed method is lightweight, does not require training, and can be expanded easily by adding new keywords. Its real-time performance makes it practical for applications requiring fast processing.  
3. Novel Observations: The analysis of time expressions across diverse datasets is insightful and provides a strong foundation for the proposed approach. The connection to the principle of least effort adds theoretical depth to the work.  
4. Generality of the Approach: By focusing on syntactic behavior rather than semantic meaning, SynTime introduces a flexible and extensible framework for rule-based time expression recognition.
Weaknesses  
1. Generality Concerns: The primary limitation is the potential overfitting of SynTime to the datasets used for rule design and evaluation. The lack of testing on an unseen, distinct corpus raises questions about its broader applicability.  
2. Overlap Analysis: The paper does not provide statistics or discussions on overlaps in time expressions across the observed corpora. This omission weakens the argument for the generality of the proposed method.  
3. Dependence on Preprocessing: SynTime relies on accurate tokenization and POS tagging, which may introduce errors in real-world applications where preprocessing tools are imperfect.  
4. Limited Domain-Specific Adaptation: While SynTime is expandable, the manual addition of domain-specific keywords may limit its scalability for highly specialized or diverse domains.
Questions to Authors  
1. Could you provide additional experiments on a new, unseen corpus to better demonstrate SynTime's generality?  
2. How does SynTime handle ambiguous cases where time tokens overlap with other syntactic roles (e.g., "May" as a month vs. a modal verb)?  
3. Can you elaborate on the computational efficiency of SynTime compared to machine learning methods in terms of runtime and resource usage?  
Conclusion  
Overall, this paper presents a compelling and practical approach to time expression recognition, with strong empirical results and a clear theoretical foundation. However, concerns about generality and reliance on preprocessing tools should be addressed to strengthen its contributions. The paper is a valuable addition to the field and merits consideration for acceptance, provided the authors address the outlined weaknesses.
