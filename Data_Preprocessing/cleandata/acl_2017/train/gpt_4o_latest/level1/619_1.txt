Review of the Submission
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel corpus for analyzing revisions in argumentative essays, focusing on between-draft revisions. The corpus is annotated with revision purposes, categorized using a schema inspired by argument mining and discourse analysis. The dataset includes three drafts of essays written by college students, with sentence-level alignment and manual coding for revision purposes. The authors demonstrate the utility of the corpus through two applications: (1) an analysis of student revision behaviors and (2) the development of a supervised classifier for automatic revision purpose prediction.
The primary contributions of this paper are:
1. Development of a New Annotated Corpus: The creation of a publicly available corpus of argumentative essay revisions is the most significant contribution. The corpus is meticulously designed, with sentence-level alignment and detailed revision annotations, enabling research in revision analysis, argument mining, and writing improvement.
2. Empirical Studies on Revision Behaviors: The analysis of revision behaviors provides insights into how feedback and linguistic background influence revision patterns, offering valuable implications for writing pedagogy and feedback systems.
3. Evaluation of Automatic Revision Classification: The paper replicates and extends prior work on automatic revision classification, demonstrating the applicability of the corpus for training and testing machine learning models.
Strengths
1. Novel and Valuable Resource: The corpus fills a significant gap in NLP resources for revision analysis, particularly for argumentative essays. Its focus on sentence-level alignment and detailed revision purposes makes it a versatile dataset for various NLP tasks.
2. Well-Designed Corpus Creation Process: The authors provide a thorough description of the corpus design, including participant demographics, annotation schema, and inter-annotator agreement. The inclusion of both native and L2 speakers enhances the dataset's diversity and applicability.
3. Demonstrated Applications: The two applications convincingly showcase the corpus's potential. The analysis of revision behaviors offers actionable insights, while the automatic classification experiments validate the corpus's utility for machine learning research.
4. Public Release: The commitment to releasing the corpus for research purposes is commendable and will likely benefit the broader NLP and education research communities.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Automatic Classification: While the replication of prior work on revision classification is useful, the methodological contributions in this area are minimal. The experiments largely confirm existing findings rather than introducing new techniques or insights.
2. Small Sample Size for Behavioral Analysis: The behavioral analysis is based on a relatively small participant pool (60 participants), which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, some hypotheses (e.g., H1) are inconclusive due to insufficient statistical power.
3. Lack of Evaluative Data: The absence of evaluative measures for the quality of revisions (e.g., improvement in essay quality) is a missed opportunity. Such data could have strengthened the analysis of revision behaviors and the validation of the automatic classification system.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the limited generalizability of the behavioral analysis findings in future work? Are there plans to expand the participant pool or include more diverse writing prompts?
2. Could you elaborate on why certain revision categories (e.g., Claim, Evidence) showed no significant improvement in classification performance? Do you attribute this to data sparsity or other factors?
3. Are there plans to include evaluative measures (e.g., essay quality scores) in future versions of the corpus? How might this enhance the utility of the dataset?
Additional Comments
The paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the corpus creation process and its applications. While the automatic classification experiments could have been more innovative, the corpus itself is a valuable contribution that will likely spur further research in revision analysis and writing improvement systems.
