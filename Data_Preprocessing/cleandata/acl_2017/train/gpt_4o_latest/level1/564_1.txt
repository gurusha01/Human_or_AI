Review of the Paper: "Grid Beam Search (GBS) for Lexically Constrained Decoding"
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper introduces Grid Beam Search (GBS), a novel decoding algorithm designed to incorporate pre-specified lexical constraints into the output of sequence generation models. The authors demonstrate the generality of GBS, which can be applied to any model generating sequences token-by-token, without requiring modifications to model parameters or training data. The paper evaluates GBS in two key scenarios: interactive machine translation (MT) post-editing and domain adaptation for neural machine translation (NMT). The main contributions of the paper, as I see them, are as follows:
1. Algorithmic Contribution: The primary contribution is the development of the GBS algorithm, which extends traditional beam search to handle lexical constraints. The algorithm is well-detailed, with clear pseudo-code and visualizations, and supports both single-token and multi-token constraints. This is a significant advancement for constrained decoding in sequence generation tasks.
2. Practical Applications: The paper demonstrates the utility of GBS in two practical scenarios: (a) interactive post-editing, where user-provided corrections are incorporated iteratively, and (b) domain adaptation, where domain-specific terminologies are integrated as constraints. Both applications show substantial improvements in BLEU scores, underscoring the effectiveness of the approach.
3. Generalizability: The authors emphasize the broad applicability of GBS across various text generation tasks, such as summarization, dialog generation, and image captioning. While the experiments focus on MT, the potential for broader impact is compelling.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty and Generality: GBS is a novel extension of beam search that is both flexible and general. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on explicit input-output alignments or structural assumptions, making it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks.
2. Strong Experimental Results: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of GBS in improving translation quality, particularly in interactive post-editing (+20 BLEU points after four iterations) and domain adaptation (+13.73 BLEU for EN-PT).
3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the algorithm, detailed pseudo-code, and thorough experimental setups. This makes the work accessible and reproducible for the research community.
4. Efficiency Considerations: The authors address the computational complexity of GBS and propose parallelization strategies, ensuring the algorithm remains practical for real-world use.
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the authors claim broad applicability, the experiments are limited to MT. Evaluating GBS on other sequence generation tasks, such as summarization or dialog generation, would strengthen the claim of generality.
2. Scalability Concerns: The runtime complexity of GBS increases with the number of constraints, which may limit its scalability in scenarios with a large number of constraints. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how performance degrades with increasing constraints.
3. Comparison with Alternatives: The paper does not compare GBS to other recent constrained decoding methods, particularly those designed for neural models. Such comparisons would provide a clearer picture of the relative strengths and weaknesses of GBS.
Questions to Authors:  
1. Have you considered applying GBS to tasks beyond MT, such as summarization or dialog generation? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?  
2. How does GBS perform in scenarios with a large number of constraints (e.g., >10)? Are there strategies to mitigate potential performance degradation?  
3. Could you provide a comparison with other constrained decoding techniques, such as those incorporating soft constraints or secondary attention mechanisms?
Conclusion:  
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of constrained decoding, with a novel algorithm that is both flexible and effective. While the experimental scope could be expanded, the results are compelling, and the potential for broader impact is clear. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the scalability concerns and providing additional comparisons with alternative methods.
