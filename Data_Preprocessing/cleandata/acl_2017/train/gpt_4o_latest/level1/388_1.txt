Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
The paper introduces UDEPLAMBDA, a semantic interface for Universal Dependencies (UD), which maps natural language to logical forms in a language-agnostic framework. The authors extend the DEPLAMBDA framework, originally designed for English, to support cross-linguistic applications by leveraging the multilingual nature of UD annotations. UDEPLAMBDA is evaluated on the task of semantic parsing for question answering against Freebase, with experiments conducted in English, German, and Spanish. The authors also provide multilingual translations of two benchmark datasets, WebQuestions and GraphQuestions, facilitating cross-lingual evaluation. Results demonstrate that UDEPLAMBDA outperforms strong baselines across languages and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraphQuestions dataset for English.
The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. Development of UDEPLAMBDA: A novel, language-independent semantic interface for UD that produces logical forms using minimal language-specific knowledge. This is a significant advancement over DEPLAMBDA, which was limited to English.  
2. Multilingual Evaluation: The authors provide German and Spanish translations of two benchmark datasets, enabling cross-lingual evaluation of semantic parsing systems.  
3. Empirical Results: UDEPLAMBDA achieves competitive performance on WebQuestions and sets a new state-of-the-art on GraphQuestions for English, while also demonstrating robust performance for German and Spanish.  
Strengths  
1. Cross-Linguistic Generalization: The paper successfully extends semantic parsing to multiple languages by leveraging the universality of UD annotations. This is a strong contribution to multilingual NLP research.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The evaluation is thorough, with experiments conducted on three languages and two datasets. The results are clearly presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of UDEPLAMBDA over baselines.  
3. Resource Contribution: The provision of German and Spanish translations for WebQuestions and GraphQuestions is a valuable resource for the community, encouraging further research in multilingual semantic parsing.  
4. Task-Agnostic Design: The framework's reliance on UD annotations rather than language-specific features makes it broadly applicable to other natural language understanding tasks.  
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Handling of Lexical Semantics: The framework sacrifices semantic specificity for language independence. For example, it cannot disambiguate active vs. passive constructions or canonicalize relations like "broke" in different syntactic contexts. This limitation could hinder its applicability in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding.  
2. Dependency on UD Quality: The performance of UDEPLAMBDA is heavily dependent on the quality of UD parsers. The lower results for German highlight this limitation, as parsing errors propagate to the semantic representation.  
3. Evaluation Scope: While the paper focuses on question answering, it would have been beneficial to evaluate UDEPLAMBDA on additional tasks (e.g., entailment or summarization) to demonstrate its broader utility.  
Questions to Authors  
1. How does UDEPLAMBDA handle languages with significantly different syntactic structures, such as morphologically rich or low-resource languages?  
2. Could you elaborate on the potential impact of UD parsing errors on downstream tasks, and how these might be mitigated?  
3. Are there plans to incorporate lexicalized semantic features or external resources to address the framework's limitations in handling lexical semantics?  
Conclusion  
The paper presents a significant step forward in multilingual semantic parsing by introducing a language-independent semantic interface for UD. While there are limitations in handling lexical semantics and dependency on UD quality, the contributions are substantial, and the work is likely to have a lasting impact on the field. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.
