Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a novel approach to relation extraction by framing it as a reading comprehension task. The authors introduce a method that associates natural-language questions with relation slots, enabling the use of neural reading comprehension techniques to extract relations. The approach allows for zero-shot learning, where new relations can be defined at test time without requiring labeled training examples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on a Wikipedia-based slot-filling task, showing strong generalization to unseen entities, paraphrased questions, and even previously unseen relations. The paper also introduces a large-scale dataset of over 30 million question-sentence-answer examples, created using a cost-efficient crowdsourcing process.
Main Contributions
1. Reduction of Relation Extraction to Reading Comprehension: The primary contribution of the paper is the novel framing of relation extraction as a reading comprehension problem. This allows the use of state-of-the-art machine reading models and facilitates zero-shot learning for unseen relations.
2. Large-Scale Dataset Creation via Schema Querification: The authors present an efficient and scalable method to generate a massive dataset of question-sentence-answer examples by annotating relations rather than individual instances. This dataset is a valuable resource for future research.
3. Zero-Shot Relation Extraction: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of extracting relations that were not observed during training, setting a benchmark for zero-shot relation extraction tasks.
Strengths
1. Innovative Problem Formulation: The reduction of relation extraction to reading comprehension is a creative and impactful idea, bridging two important areas of NLP. This formulation enables the reuse of advances in machine reading for relation extraction tasks.
2. Scalability and Cost Efficiency: The schema querification process is highly scalable and cost-effective, producing a large dataset with minimal annotation costs. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the data bottleneck in supervised relation extraction.
3. Strong Empirical Results: The experimental results are compelling, showing high accuracy on unseen entities and paraphrased questions, as well as reasonable performance on unseen relations. The zero-shot learning capability is particularly noteworthy.
4. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors provide a thorough analysis of their model's performance, including error analysis and insights into the types of cues the model uses to generalize. This adds depth to the evaluation and highlights areas for future improvement.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Model Innovation: While the problem formulation is novel, the model itself is a relatively straightforward adaptation of an existing reading comprehension model (BiDAF). There is limited methodological innovation in the modeling approach.
2. Dependence on Pre-Trained Embeddings: The model's ability to generalize to unseen relations heavily relies on pre-trained word embeddings. This dependence may limit its applicability to domains with less lexical overlap or specialized vocabularies.
3. Evaluation on Narrow Domains: The experiments are conducted on a Wikipedia-based dataset, which may not fully represent the challenges of real-world relation extraction tasks, such as those involving noisy or domain-specific text.
4. Negative Example Generation: The method for generating negative examples is relatively naive and may not fully capture the complexity of distractors in real-world scenarios. This could inflate the model's performance on negative examples.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the model perform on domains with specialized vocabularies or limited overlap with pre-trained embeddings (e.g., medical or legal text)?
2. Can the schema querification process be extended to handle more complex relations that require reasoning or aggregation (e.g., temporal or causal relations)?
3. How does the model handle cases where the answer is implicit or requires multi-sentence reasoning?
Additional Comments
Overall, this paper presents a creative and impactful approach to relation extraction, with strong empirical results and a valuable dataset contribution. However, the reliance on existing models and pre-trained embeddings, as well as the narrow evaluation domain, leave room for further exploration and improvement.
