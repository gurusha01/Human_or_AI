Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper presents a novel cross-lingual transfer learning method for paradigm completion, leveraging an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The authors aim to address the challenge of paradigm completion in low-resource languages by transferring morphological knowledge from high-resource languages. The method is evaluated across 21 language pairs from four language families, demonstrating significant performance improvements, including up to 58% higher accuracy in low-resource settings. The paper also explores zero-shot and one-shot learning scenarios and investigates the impact of language relatedness on transfer effectiveness.
The primary contributions of this work are:  
1. Cross-lingual Transfer for Morphological Paradigm Completion: The authors propose a multi-task learning framework that ties parameters between high-resource and low-resource languages, enabling the transfer of morphological knowledge. This is a significant step forward in addressing the scarcity of annotated data for low-resource languages.  
2. Empirical Validation Across Diverse Language Families: The experiments span multiple language families (Romance, Slavic, Uralic, and Semitic), providing robust evidence of the method's generalizability. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and edit distance, particularly for related languages.  
3. Analysis of Language Relatedness and Zero-/One-Shot Learning: The paper provides valuable insights into the role of language relatedness in transfer learning and establishes that zero-shot and one-shot learning are feasible for paradigm completion. This expands the applicability of the method to extremely low-resource scenarios.
Strengths:  
1. Significant Performance Gains: The method achieves up to 58% improvement in accuracy for low-resource languages, which is a substantial contribution to the field of low-resource NLP. The results are consistent across multiple language families, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.  
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct experiments on 21 language pairs, providing a thorough analysis of the method's effectiveness. The inclusion of diverse language families and scripts (e.g., Cyrillic and Latin) strengthens the paper's claims.  
3. Insightful Analysis: The paper offers a detailed investigation into the impact of language relatedness, showing that closely related languages yield better transfer results. The exploration of ciphering experiments to disentangle regularization effects from true transfer is particularly insightful.  
4. Practical Relevance: The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in NLP—paradigm completion for low-resource languages—and demonstrates its utility in real-world scenarios, including zero- and one-shot learning.
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Novelty in Architecture: While the application of encoder-decoder RNNs to cross-lingual transfer is effective, the architecture itself is not novel. The contribution lies more in the application and analysis rather than methodological innovation.  
2. Sparse Discussion of Failure Cases: Although the paper provides some error analysis, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of failure cases, particularly for unrelated languages (e.g., Arabic as a source language). This would help clarify the method's limitations.  
3. Scalability to Larger Language Sets: The paper focuses on pairs of languages, but it does not explore how the method scales when multiple high-resource languages are used simultaneously. This could be an important direction for future work.  
4. Limited Exploration of Subtag Universality: The universality of subtags is assumed but not deeply analyzed. A more detailed discussion of how subtag mismatches (e.g., between distant languages) impact performance would strengthen the paper.
Questions to Authors:  
1. How does the method perform when multiple high-resource languages are used simultaneously for transfer?  
2. Could the model be extended to handle languages with highly divergent morphological systems (e.g., agglutinative vs. fusional languages)?  
3. How sensitive is the method to the size of the high-resource language dataset? Would reducing the high-resource data significantly impact performance?  
4. Could you elaborate on how the universality of subtags was validated across the languages used in the experiments?
Conclusion:  
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of low-resource NLP by introducing a cross-lingual transfer learning method for paradigm completion. While the architectural novelty is limited, the empirical results and analysis are compelling, and the method has significant practical implications. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above.
