Review
Summary
This paper introduces MORSE, a novel framework for unsupervised morpheme segmentation that incorporates both orthographic and semantic features. Unlike prior approaches, MORSE evaluates morphological relationships not only locally but also at a vocabulary-wide level by leveraging difference vectors in distributed word representations. The authors also critique existing benchmarking datasets, particularly the Morpho Challenge (MC) dataset, for their lack of semantic compositionality, and propose a new dataset, SD17, to address these deficiencies. The framework is validated across multiple languages (English, Turkish, and Finnish) and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, particularly in languages with less complex morphology.
Contributions
1. Novel Framework for Morpheme Segmentation: The primary contribution of MORSE lies in its integration of vocabulary-wide semantic knowledge with orthographic features. This dual-level evaluation addresses over-segmentation issues prevalent in prior methods and achieves state-of-the-art results in English and Turkish.
2. Critical Analysis of Existing Datasets: The paper identifies significant weaknesses in the widely-used MC dataset, such as its failure to enforce semantic compositionality and its inclusion of trivial segmentation cases. The authors introduce SD17, a semantically driven dataset, which better evaluates the interplay between orthographic and semantic features in morpheme segmentation.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors provide comprehensive experiments that not only benchmark MORSE against existing systems but also highlight its robustness in handling semantically non-compositional words, a key limitation of MDL-based methods like Morfessor.
Strengths
1. Innovative Use of Semantic Features: The integration of semantic difference vectors into morpheme segmentation is a compelling advancement. By evaluating morphological relationships at both local and vocabulary-wide levels, MORSE addresses key limitations of prior methods that relied solely on orthographic features.
2. State-of-the-Art Performance: MORSE demonstrates significant improvements over Morfessor and other state-of-the-art systems, particularly in English and Turkish. The results on SD17 further validate the importance of semantic compositionality in morpheme segmentation.
3. Dataset Contribution: The introduction of SD17 is a valuable contribution to the field. By addressing the deficiencies in MC datasets, SD17 provides a more reliable benchmark for future research.
4. Flexibility Through Hyperparameters: The framework allows users to trade off precision and recall based on downstream task requirements, adding practical utility to the system.
5. Potential for Broader Applications: The ability of MORSE to identify lemmas makes it adaptable for tasks like lemmatization and stemming, broadening its applicability in NLP.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Performance on Rich Morphology: MORSE underperforms on Finnish, a morphologically rich language, due to vocabulary sparsity and limitations in handling non-concatenative morphology. This restricts its applicability to languages with simpler morphological structures.
2. Dependency on Word Representations: The reliance on distributed word representations makes MORSE vulnerable to noise, particularly for rare words, which could degrade its performance in low-resource settings.
3. Greedy Inference: The sequential, greedy inference approach can propagate errors, leading to suboptimal segmentations. A more global optimization strategy could improve performance.
4. Minimal Supervision Requirement: While the authors argue that MORSE requires only minimal supervision, the need for a tuning dataset introduces a dependency that fully unsupervised systems like Morfessor do not have.
5. Computational Overhead: The training stage of MORSE is computationally intensive, particularly due to the reliance on large-scale word representations and vocabulary-wide evaluations, which may hinder its adoption.
Questions to Authors
1. How does MORSE handle cases where word representations are noisy, particularly for rare or out-of-vocabulary words? Could pre-trained embeddings mitigate this issue?
2. Have you considered extending MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology, such as templatic morphology in Semitic languages?
3. Could the greedy inference stage be replaced with a beam search or other global optimization techniques to improve segmentation accuracy?
Additional Comments
The paper is well-written and provides a thorough evaluation of MORSE, both intrinsically and against state-of-the-art systems. The introduction of SD17 is a particularly valuable contribution, as it addresses key deficiencies in existing benchmarks. However, addressing the limitations in handling rich morphology and computational efficiency would further strengthen the framework.
