Review of the Submission
Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces a novel task in the domain of multi-document summarization (MDS), termed concept-map-based MDS, which aims to generate summaries in the form of concept maps rather than traditional textual summaries. To support this task, the authors present a new dataset comprising 30 topics, each with a collection of approximately 40 web documents and corresponding gold-standard concept maps. The dataset was created using a novel low-context importance annotation crowdsourcing scheme, which efficiently determines the importance of propositions within large document clusters. The authors also provide an evaluation protocol and a baseline system for the proposed task, making the dataset and resources publicly available.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Task Definition: The introduction of concept-map-based MDS as a new summarization task is the paper's primary contribution. This task aligns with observed user behaviors, where individuals often organize information into structured, graph-like representations rather than prose summaries.
2. Dataset Creation: The authors present a large-scale, high-quality dataset for concept-map-based MDS, addressing the lack of suitable evaluation corpora for this task. The dataset is notable for its large and heterogeneous document clusters, which pose a significant challenge for summarization systems.
3. Crowdsourcing Methodology: The paper proposes a novel low-context importance annotation scheme for crowdsourcing, which effectively balances scalability, cost, and annotation quality. This methodology could be useful for other summarization tasks as well.
4. Baseline and Evaluation Protocol: A baseline system and evaluation metrics are provided, offering a starting point for future research on this task.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Relevance: The concept-map-based MDS task is a creative and practical extension of traditional summarization tasks, addressing real-world needs for structured and navigable summaries. This work fills a clear gap in the field.
2. High-Quality Dataset: The dataset is well-constructed, with rigorous quality control measures and detailed analysis of its characteristics. The use of heterogeneous web documents adds significant value, as it reflects real-world challenges in summarization.
3. Scalable Crowdsourcing Approach: The low-context importance annotation scheme is an innovative and efficient solution to the challenges of crowdsourcing large-scale annotations. The authors demonstrate its reliability through pilot studies and agreement metrics.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The inclusion of multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., strict matching, METEOR, ROUGE-2) and a baseline system provides a solid foundation for benchmarking future work.
5. Public Availability: The open release of the dataset, baseline, and evaluation scripts under a permissive license is commendable and will likely encourage adoption and further research.
Weaknesses
1. Baseline Performance: The baseline system performs poorly, with low coverage of gold-standard concepts and weak relation extraction. While this highlights the difficulty of the task, it also limits the immediate utility of the baseline as a meaningful benchmark.
2. Limited Generalization of Crowdsourcing Method: While the low-context importance annotation scheme is effective for this specific task, its applicability to other domains or tasks with less structured outputs remains unclear.
3. Evaluation Metrics: The proposed evaluation metrics focus primarily on proposition-level matching. However, they may not fully capture the quality of the overall graph structure (e.g., coherence, connectedness), which is crucial for concept maps.
4. Scalability of Expert Annotations: The final step of concept map construction relies on expert annotators, which may limit the scalability of the dataset creation process for larger or more diverse datasets.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed low-context importance annotation scheme compare to traditional document-level annotation methods in terms of cost and efficiency?
2. Are there plans to explore more advanced baselines (e.g., neural models) to address the limitations of the current system, particularly in relation to relation extraction?
3. Could the evaluation metrics be extended to assess the structural quality of the generated concept maps (e.g., graph coherence or usability)?
4. How well does the dataset generalize to other domains beyond educational topics?
Additional Comments
This submission makes a significant contribution to the field of summarization by proposing a novel task and providing high-quality resources to support it. While the baseline system and evaluation metrics leave room for improvement, the paper lays a strong foundation for future research in concept-map-based summarization.
