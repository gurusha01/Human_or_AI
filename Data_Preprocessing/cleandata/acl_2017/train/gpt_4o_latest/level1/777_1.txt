Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper introduces a novel approach to model inter-topic preferences of Twitter users by leveraging linguistic patterns and matrix factorization. The authors propose a method to extract user-topic preferences from tweets using high-quality linguistic patterns and hashtags, and then represent these preferences in a user-topic matrix. Matrix factorization is employed to map users and topics into a latent feature space, enabling the prediction of missing preferences and the discovery of inter-topic relationships. The primary contributions of the paper, as I see them, are:  
1. Novel Modeling of Inter-Topic Preferences: The paper formalizes the task of modeling inter-topic preferences using matrix factorization, which is a significant advancement over previous stance detection methods that focus on single topics or limited axes (e.g., liberal vs. conservative).  
2. High-Quality Data Extraction: The authors design and manually curate linguistic patterns to extract user preferences from a large corpus of Japanese tweets, resulting in a rich dataset of user-topic interactions.  
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results demonstrate strong performance in predicting missing preferences (80â€“94% accuracy) and show that the learned topic vectors encode meaningful inter-topic relationships, validated through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
Strengths  
1. Innovative Problem Formulation: The paper tackles the challenging problem of modeling inter-topic preferences, which has broad applications in public opinion analysis, election prediction, and stance detection. The use of matrix factorization to capture latent user and topic features is well-motivated and novel in this context.  
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide thorough evaluations, including prediction accuracy for missing preferences and correlation between topic vector similarities and human-annotated inter-topic preferences. These experiments convincingly demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach.  
3. Scalability and Generalizability: The method is scalable to large datasets (e.g., 35 billion tweets) and is language-agnostic, making it applicable to other languages and domains beyond the Japanese corpus used in this study.  
4. Real-World Relevance: The work has clear practical implications, such as improving stance detection across topics and understanding public opinion dynamics on social media.
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Comparison with Baselines: While the paper compares its method to a majority baseline, it lacks comparisons with other advanced methods for stance detection or recommendation systems, such as neural collaborative filtering or graph-based approaches. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative performance and novelty of the proposed method.  
2. Dependence on Manual Pattern Curation: The reliance on manually curated linguistic patterns may limit the scalability of the approach to other languages or domains. The authors could explore automated or semi-supervised methods for pattern generation.  
3. Subjectivity in Inter-Topic Preference Evaluation: The evaluation of inter-topic preferences using crowdsourcing is subjective and may not fully capture the nuances of the learned topic vectors. A more robust evaluation framework would strengthen the claims.  
4. Focus on Japanese Corpus: While the authors claim generalizability, the experiments are conducted exclusively on Japanese tweets. Demonstrating the method's effectiveness on datasets in other languages would enhance its impact.
Questions to Authors  
1. How does the proposed method compare to more recent neural approaches for stance detection or recommendation tasks?  
2. Could automated methods (e.g., distant supervision or weak labeling) be used to reduce the reliance on manual pattern curation?  
3. Have you considered applying this method to datasets in other languages or domains to validate its generalizability?  
Overall Assessment  
This paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in social media analytics with a well-designed and empirically validated approach. While there are some limitations in baseline comparisons and generalizability, the contributions are significant, and the work has strong potential for real-world applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.
