Review
Summary
This paper introduces a novel symmetric collaborative dialogue setting where two agents, each with private knowledge, must collaborate to identify a shared item through open-ended dialogue. The authors present a new dataset of 11K human-human dialogues collected via crowdsourcing, which captures rich linguistic and strategic phenomena. To address the challenges of this setting, the authors propose DynoNet, a neural model that dynamically updates knowledge graph embeddings as the dialogue progresses. The model combines structured knowledge with unstructured dialogue history to generate contextually relevant utterances. The paper evaluates DynoNet using both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrating its superiority over baseline neural and rule-based models in terms of task success, fluency, and human-likeness.
Contributions
1. Dataset Creation: The most significant contribution is the introduction of a large-scale dataset (11K dialogues) for symmetric collaborative dialogue. The dataset is rich in linguistic diversity and strategic phenomena, pushing the boundaries of existing dialogue systems.
2. Dynamic Knowledge Graph Network (DynoNet): The proposed model integrates structured knowledge (via knowledge graphs) with unstructured dialogue history, offering a novel approach to representing open-ended dialogue states. The dynamic updating of graph embeddings is a key innovation.
3. Evaluation Framework: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, including bot-bot and bot-human interactions, partner evaluations, and third-party evaluations, which highlight the model's strengths and limitations.
Strengths
1. Novel Dataset: The dataset is a valuable resource for the research community, enabling the study of pragmatic and strategic aspects of dialogue. Its scale and diversity make it a significant contribution.
2. Innovative Model Design: DynoNet's use of dynamic knowledge graph embeddings is a compelling approach to bridging the gap between task-oriented dialogue systems and open-domain chat systems. The ablation studies convincingly demonstrate the importance of the model's design choices.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The use of multiple evaluation metrics, including human evaluations, provides a robust assessment of the model's performance. The partner evaluation results, in particular, highlight the model's ability to cooperate effectively with humans.
4. Strategic Insights: The analysis of human strategies (e.g., prioritizing attributes with fewer unique values) and the model's ability to replicate these strategies is a noteworthy contribution to understanding dialogue behavior.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Generalization to Other Domains: While the dataset and model are well-suited to the symmetric collaborative setting, it is unclear how well the approach generalizes to other dialogue tasks, such as negotiation or multi-party conversations.
2. Evaluation Bias: The discrepancy between partner and third-party evaluations raises questions about the reliability of human-likeness metrics. Additional analysis or standardization of evaluation criteria would strengthen the results.
3. Scalability of DynoNet: The computational complexity of dynamically updating knowledge graph embeddings is not discussed in detail. Scalability to larger knowledge bases or more complex tasks may be a concern.
Questions to Authors
1. How does DynoNet perform in scenarios with significantly larger knowledge bases or more complex attribute structures? Are there scalability limitations?
2. Could the dataset and model be extended to handle multi-party dialogues or asymmetric collaboration settings?
3. How does the model handle ambiguous or conflicting utterances, and is there a mechanism to resolve such conflicts dynamically?
Overall Assessment
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of dialogue systems by introducing a novel dataset, an innovative model, and a comprehensive evaluation framework. While there are some concerns about generalizability and scalability, the work provides a solid foundation for future research in collaborative dialogue. I recommend acceptance.
