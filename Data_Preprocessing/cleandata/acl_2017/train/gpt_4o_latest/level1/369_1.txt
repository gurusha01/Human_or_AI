Review of the Paper
Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of morphology generation in machine translation (MT), particularly for the Chinese-to-Spanish language pair. The authors propose a novel approach that decouples the translation process from morphology generation, simplifying the target language morphology during translation and restoring it in a post-processing step. The core contribution is a new neural network architecture that combines convolutional and recurrent layers for classifying gender and number, achieving high accuracy in morphology generation. The proposed method demonstrates improvements in translation quality, with a reported gain of up to 0.7 METEOR.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Neural Network Architecture for Morphology Generation: The primary contribution is the design of a neural network architecture combining convolutional and LSTM layers for morphology classification. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (98.4% for gender and 93.7% for number on the small dataset) compared to traditional machine learning methods like SVMs and random forests.
   
2. Decoupling Morphology Generation from Translation: The paper introduces a divide-and-conquer approach to MT by first translating into a morphologically simplified target language and then restoring full morphology in a post-processing step. This modular approach is particularly effective for morphologically rich languages like Spanish.
3. Empirical Improvements in Translation Quality: The proposed method yields measurable improvements in translation quality, with a gain of up to 0.7 METEOR on the large dataset. The integration of rescoring further enhances the results.
Strengths
1. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed architecture significantly outperforms baseline methods in morphology classification and demonstrates tangible improvements in translation quality. The results are well-supported with detailed experiments on both small and large datasets.
   
2. Novelty in Architecture Design: The combination of convolutional and LSTM layers for morphology classification is innovative and well-motivated, leveraging the strengths of both architectures to capture local patterns and sequential dependencies.
3. Practical Relevance: The focus on Chinese-to-Spanish translation, a relatively underexplored language pair, adds practical value to the work. The modularity of the proposed approach makes it generalizable to other language pairs with similar morphological challenges.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, comparing it against multiple baselines and alternative approaches. The inclusion of rescoring and rule-based corrections further demonstrates the robustness of the system.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Decoupling Approach: While the decoupling of translation and morphology generation is effective, it is not entirely novel, as similar strategies have been explored in prior works (e.g., Toutanova et al., 2008; Formiga et al., 2013). The paper could better position its contribution relative to these earlier efforts.
2. Rescoring Integration: The rescoring step is not fully integrated into the classification process, as it is only applied to number classification. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide a clear roadmap for addressing it.
3. Generalization to Other Language Pairs: While the authors claim that the approach is language-independent, the experiments are limited to Chinese-to-Spanish. Additional experiments on other language pairs with different morphological characteristics would strengthen the generalizability claim.
4. Complexity and Scalability: The proposed architecture, while effective, may face scalability challenges for larger datasets or real-time applications. The paper does not discuss the computational cost or potential optimizations for deployment.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform on other morphologically rich languages (e.g., Russian, Arabic) or language pairs with different morphological challenges?
2. Can the rescoring step be extended to integrate both number and gender classification scores? If so, how would this impact the overall performance?
3. What are the computational requirements of the proposed architecture, and how does it scale with larger datasets or real-time translation systems?
Additional Comments
The paper is well-written and provides a strong empirical foundation for its claims. Addressing the scalability and generalization concerns in future work could further enhance the impact of this research.
