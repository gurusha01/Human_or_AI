Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper addresses the problem of discourse structure analysis by proposing a unified macro-micro discourse representation schema. The authors focus on the primary-secondary relationship, which they argue has been overlooked in prior research, and integrate it into a hierarchical discourse structure. The key contributions of the paper, as I see them, are as follows:
1. Macro-Micro Unified Representation Schema: The paper introduces a novel schema that combines micro-level rhetorical structures with macro-level pragmatic functions. This schema expands discourse analysis from intra-paragraph relationships to the overall discourse structure, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding discourse organization.
2. Construction of the Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB): The authors annotate 97 Chinese news wire articles using their proposed schema, creating a resource that bridges the gap between micro and macro discourse analysis. This corpus is a valuable contribution to the field, particularly for Chinese discourse analysis, where resources are limited.
3. Preliminary Experiments: The paper evaluates the proposed schema and corpus through tasks such as discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition. The experiments demonstrate the utility of the schema and corpus, achieving reasonable performance despite challenges like data imbalance.
Strengths  
1. Novelty of the Unified Schema: The integration of micro and macro discourse structures is a significant theoretical advancement. By incorporating pragmatic functions at the macro level, the schema provides a richer representation of discourse than existing approaches.
2. Resource Contribution: The creation of the MCDTB is a substantial contribution, as annotated corpora are critical for advancing discourse analysis. The detailed annotation process and quality assurance measures enhance the credibility of the resource.
3. Practical Relevance: The focus on primary-secondary relationships has practical implications for downstream NLP tasks such as summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. The schema's hierarchical nature aligns well with real-world discourse structures.
4. Evaluation and Insights: The preliminary experiments provide useful insights into the challenges of discourse relation recognition, such as imbalanced data and semantic similarity between relations. These findings can guide future research.
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Corpus Size: While the MCDTB is a valuable resource, its size (97 articles) is relatively small, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Expanding the corpus is necessary for broader applicability.
2. Evaluation Metrics and Comparisons: The paper lacks a comparison with existing discourse parsers or schemas, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach. Including such comparisons would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Imbalanced Data in Experiments: The experiments suffer from significant class imbalance, particularly in primary-secondary relation recognition. While the authors use resampling, additional techniques like data augmentation or advanced modeling approaches could improve performance.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and occasionally difficult to follow, particularly in the description of the schema and annotation process. Simplifying the narrative and providing more visual aids could enhance readability.
Questions to Authors  
1. How does the proposed schema compare to existing discourse representation frameworks, such as RST or PDTB, in terms of performance and applicability?  
2. What are the specific challenges faced during the annotation process, and how were disagreements resolved?  
3. Do you plan to extend the MCDTB to other genres or languages, and if so, how would the schema adapt to these contexts?  
4. Could the schema be applied to non-hierarchical discourse structures, such as conversational data?
Conclusion  
This paper makes a meaningful contribution to discourse analysis by proposing a unified macro-micro schema and introducing the MCDTB. While the work is promising, addressing the weaknesses—particularly the corpus size and evaluation—would enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
