Review of the Paper
Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) across heterogeneous segmentation criteria by proposing an adversarial multi-criteria learning framework. The authors introduce three shared-private Bi-LSTM models (parallel, stacked, and skip-layer) to integrate shared and criterion-specific features, enhanced by an adversarial training strategy to enforce criterion-invariant feature extraction. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, including both simplified and traditional Chinese, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models, achieving significant performance improvements over single-criterion baselines.

Contributions:
1. Adversarial Multi-Criteria Learning for CWS: The primary contribution is the novel application of adversarial training to enforce the separation of shared and criterion-specific features in multi-criteria learning. This approach ensures that the shared layer captures criterion-invariant features, which is a meaningful advancement over prior multi-task learning methods for CWS.
   
2. Three Shared-Private Architectures: The paper introduces and evaluates three distinct shared-private architectures (parallel, stacked, and skip-layer), providing a comprehensive exploration of how shared and private layers can interact to improve performance across heterogeneous datasets.
3. Extensive Evaluation Across Eight Datasets: The authors conduct experiments on eight CWS datasets, the largest number of datasets simultaneously used for this task to date. They also explore the interplay between traditional and simplified Chinese, demonstrating the transferability of shared features across linguistic variations.

Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The use of adversarial training in multi-criteria learning for CWS is novel and addresses a meaningful gap in the literature. The paper is well-motivated, as it tackles the underutilization of heterogeneous datasets with incompatible segmentation criteria.
   
2. Comprehensive Experiments: The evaluation is thorough, covering eight datasets with diverse segmentation criteria. The results are consistent and demonstrate clear improvements over baselines, with detailed analyses of convergence speed, error distributions, and the impact of adversarial training.
3. Practical Implications: The findings have practical significance, particularly the demonstrated ability to transfer knowledge between simplified and traditional Chinese datasets. This could reduce annotation costs and improve performance in resource-scarce settings.
4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the models, training procedures, and experimental setups. The inclusion of error analysis and qualitative examples further strengthens the paper.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Justification for Model Choices: While three architectures are proposed, the rationale for their design and differences in performance is not deeply explored. For instance, why Model-I consistently outperforms the others is not fully explained.
2. Marginal Gains from Adversarial Training: Although adversarial training is a key contribution, its performance improvements are relatively modest. The authors acknowledge this but do not provide a detailed analysis of why the adversarial strategy does not yield more significant gains.
3. Efficiency Concerns: The adversarial training process increases training time by 60%, which may limit the practicality of the approach for large-scale applications. The authors could have discussed potential trade-offs between performance and computational cost.
4. Generalization Beyond CWS: While the paper focuses on CWS, it would be valuable to discuss the broader applicability of the proposed framework to other sequence labeling tasks with heterogeneous criteria, such as part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing.

Questions to Authors:
1. Can you provide more insights into why Model-I consistently outperforms Model-II and Model-III? Are there specific characteristics of the parallel architecture that make it more effective for CWS?
   
2. The adversarial training strategy improves performance only slightly. Have you considered alternative adversarial objectives or architectures that might yield greater benefits?
3. How does the proposed framework handle datasets with significantly imbalanced sizes (e.g., AS vs. NCC)? Does the performance improvement vary depending on dataset size?
4. Could the shared-private architecture be applied to other NLP tasks with heterogeneous annotations, such as named entity recognition or dependency parsing? If so, what modifications might be necessary?

Overall Assessment:
This paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to multi-criteria learning for CWS, with strong empirical results and practical implications. While there are some limitations in the analysis of model choices and the marginal gains from adversarial training, the contributions are significant and relevant to the field. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses and provide additional insights into the proposed architectures and training strategies.
