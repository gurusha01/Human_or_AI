Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the challenge of morphology generation in machine translation (MT), particularly for the Chinese-to-Spanish language pair, by proposing a novel approach that decouples translation from morphology generation. The authors introduce a deep learning-based classification architecture to handle morphological simplifications in gender and number, achieving significant improvements in translation quality. The main contributions of the paper are as follows:
1. Decoupling Translation and Morphology Generation: The paper proposes a two-step approachâ€”first translating into a morphologically simplified target language and then applying a morphology generation module. This modular approach is shown to improve translation quality.
   
2. Novel Neural Architecture for Morphology Classification: The paper introduces a neural network combining convolutional and recurrent layers (CNN + LSTM) to classify gender and number with high accuracy (over 98% for gender and 93% for number).
3. Translation Quality Improvement: The proposed method achieves a METEOR improvement of up to 0.7, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing translation quality for a challenging language pair.
Strengths
1. Clear Problem Identification: The paper effectively highlights the challenges of translating between morphologically divergent languages, such as Chinese and Spanish, and provides a well-motivated solution.
   
2. Innovative Methodology: The proposed CNN + LSTM architecture is novel and well-suited for the task of morphology classification, leveraging both local and sequential context effectively.
   
3. Strong Experimental Results: The authors provide comprehensive experiments, comparing their approach against baseline MT systems and alternative classification methods. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, with significant improvements in both classification accuracy and translation quality.
4. Practical Contributions: The modular nature of the proposed approach makes it generalizable to other language pairs and morphological simplifications, increasing its practical applicability.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges some challenges (e.g., domain-specific vocabulary affecting classification accuracy), it does not sufficiently explore other potential limitations, such as scalability to more complex morphological systems or computational overhead.
2. Rescoring Step Underexplored: The rescoring step, while shown to improve results, is not thoroughly analyzed. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how rescoring interacts with the classification models and its impact on computational efficiency.
3. Evaluation Metrics: The paper relies heavily on METEOR as the primary evaluation metric. Including additional metrics, such as BLEU or TER, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of translation quality.
4. Reproducibility Concerns: While the architecture and experimental setup are described in detail, the paper does not provide access to code or pre-trained models, which could hinder reproducibility.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform when applied to other morphologically rich languages, such as Russian or Arabic? Is the architecture generalizable beyond Chinese-to-Spanish?
2. Could the rescoring step be extended to include both number and gender simultaneously? If not, why?
3. What is the computational cost of the proposed architecture compared to the baseline MT system? Is it feasible for real-time applications?
Additional Comments
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of machine translation by addressing a critical challenge in morphology generation. While there are areas for improvement, such as a more thorough discussion of limitations and reproducibility, the proposed methodology and results are promising and merit further exploration. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
