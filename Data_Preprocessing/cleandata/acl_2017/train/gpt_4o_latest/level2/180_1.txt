Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the challenging task of identifying products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, a domain characterized by significant cross-domain variation. The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. Dataset Creation: The authors introduce a novel dataset of 93,924 posts from four distinct cybercrime forums, annotated with token-level product references. This dataset is a valuable resource for studying domain adaptation in noisy, fine-grained domains.  
2. Task Formulation: The paper defines a hybrid task that combines slot-filling information extraction and named entity recognition (NER), tailored to the unique challenges of cybercrime forum data.  
3. Empirical Analysis: The authors systematically evaluate supervised, semi-supervised, and domain adaptation techniques, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in handling fine-grained domain differences.  
Strengths
1. Novel Dataset: The dataset is a significant contribution to the NLP and cybersecurity communities, providing a much-needed testbed for studying domain adaptation in noisy, real-world text. The detailed annotation process and inter-annotator agreement metrics lend credibility to the dataset's quality.  
2. Task Relevance: The hybrid task formulation is well-motivated and addresses a practical need in cybersecurity research. The focus on token-level annotations with context-sensitive criteria is a thoughtful design choice that balances generality and specificity.  
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates multiple baseline and learning-based methods, including domain adaptation techniques, providing a thorough analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. The inclusion of both token-level and post-level metrics is commendable.  
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Methods: While the dataset and task are novel, the methods employed (e.g., SVMs, Brown clusters, gazetteers) are relatively standard. The paper does not propose fundamentally new approaches to domain adaptation, which limits its methodological contribution.  
2. Insufficient Cross-Domain Insights: Although the paper identifies challenges in cross-domain adaptation, the analysis of why certain methods fail (e.g., Brown clusters, gazetteers) is somewhat superficial. A deeper exploration of domain-specific stylistic and lexical differences could strengthen the findings.  
3. Scalability Concerns: The reliance on token-level annotation and the need for domain-specific gazetteers may limit the scalability of the proposed approach to new forums or domains. The authors could discuss alternative annotation strategies or unsupervised methods to address this limitation.  
Questions to Authors
1. Could you provide more details on why Brown clusters and gazetteers failed to significantly improve cross-domain performance? Were there specific patterns in the errors made by these models?  
2. Did you explore the use of pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) for this task? If not, how do you anticipate such models would perform compared to your current methods?  
3. How do you envision the dataset being used by other researchers? Are there specific downstream tasks or applications you believe it could enable?  
Overall Assessment
This paper makes a valuable contribution by introducing a novel dataset and task in the underexplored domain of cybercrime forums. However, the methodological contributions are limited, and the analysis of domain adaptation challenges could be more detailed. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the scalability and methodological limitations in their revision.
