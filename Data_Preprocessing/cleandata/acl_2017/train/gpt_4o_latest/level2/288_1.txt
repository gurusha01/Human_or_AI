Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates how different writing tasks influence writing style and demonstrates that measurable stylistic variations arise from task constraints. Using the story cloze task as a case study, the authors show that a simple linear classifier based on stylistic features can distinguish between three types of writing tasks: writing an entire story, writing a coherent ending, and writing an incoherent ending. The classifier achieves high accuracy (64.5â€“75.6%) without relying on story context, highlighting the impact of task framing on writing style. Additionally, the authors adapt their style-based classifier to the story cloze task, achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.2%, surpassing previous deep learning models. The paper makes three key contributions: (1) it sheds light on how cognitive load affects writing style, (2) it highlights the importance of task design in NLP datasets, and (3) it establishes a new benchmark for the story cloze challenge.
Strengths
1. Novel Insights into Writing Style and Cognitive Load: The paper provides compelling evidence that writing tasks impose measurable stylistic changes, offering valuable insights into the relationship between task framing, cognitive processes, and linguistic expression. This is a novel contribution to both computational linguistics and cognitive science.
2. State-of-the-Art Results: By leveraging stylistic features, the authors achieve a significant improvement in the story cloze task, outperforming deep learning models. This demonstrates the practical utility of their approach and its potential to complement neural models.
3. Methodological Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, with clear baselines and comparisons. The use of stylistic features such as word and character n-grams is grounded in prior work, and the analysis of feature importance adds interpretability to the results.
4. Implications for NLP Dataset Design: The paper raises important concerns about biases introduced by task framing in dataset creation. This is a critical contribution to the broader discussion on dataset quality and reproducibility in NLP.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Generalization Beyond the Case Study: While the findings are compelling within the context of the story cloze task, the paper does not explore whether the observed stylistic variations generalize to other writing tasks or domains. This limits the broader applicability of the results.
2. Over-Reliance on Simple Features: Although the simplicity of the linear classifier is a strength in terms of interpretability, it may not fully capture more nuanced stylistic differences. Incorporating additional linguistic or semantic features could enhance the analysis.
3. Lack of Discussion on Ethical Implications: The ability to detect task-induced stylistic changes raises potential ethical concerns, such as privacy or misuse in surveillance. The paper does not address these implications, which would have strengthened its societal relevance.
Questions to Authors
1. Have you considered applying your approach to other datasets or writing tasks to test the generalizability of your findings?
2. Could the stylistic differences observed in this study be influenced by factors such as individual author variability or cultural background? How do you control for these confounding factors?
Additional Comments
This paper makes a strong case for the impact of task framing on writing style and its implications for NLP. The findings are both theoretically and practically significant, though future work should explore broader generalization and ethical considerations. Overall, this is a valuable contribution to the field.
