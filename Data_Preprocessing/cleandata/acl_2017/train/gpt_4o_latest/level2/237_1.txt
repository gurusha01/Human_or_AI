Review
Summary and Contributions:
This paper introduces a novel approach to measuring the sentiment orientation of words using Vector Space Models (VSMs). The authors propose both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct sentiment dimensions in high-dimensional vector spaces, leveraging word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe. The sentiment orientation of a word is calculated as the difference in cosine distances from positive and negative reference vectors. The proposed methods are evaluated on movie review datasets and compared against the PMI-IR algorithm (Turney, 2002). The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. A novel unsupervised methodology for sentiment analysis that outperforms the PMI-IR algorithm while addressing data sparsity issues.  
2. A semi-supervised approach that incorporates external polarity information to further improve performance.  
3. A comparative analysis of Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings in the context of sentiment classification, highlighting the advantages of paradigmatic relations in dense vector spaces.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practicality: The proposed unsupervised approach is a significant improvement over the PMI-IR method, achieving higher accuracy (61% vs. 57%) with smaller datasets. This demonstrates its robustness and practical applicability in resource-constrained scenarios.  
2. Thorough Evaluation: The paper provides a detailed comparison of Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings, showing that paradigmatic relations in Word2Vec are more effective for sentiment analysis. This insight is valuable for future research in sentiment modeling.  
3. Reproducibility: The methodology is well-documented, with clear descriptions of the experimental setup, datasets, and evaluation metrics, making it feasible for replication and further exploration.  
4. Addressing Data Sparsity: The paper effectively highlights the limitations of collocation-based methods like PMI-IR and demonstrates how dense vector models overcome these challenges.  
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Performance: While the proposed methods outperform PMI-IR, their accuracy (66% for semi-supervised Word2Vec) falls short of supervised approaches, which typically achieve over 80%. This limits the practical utility of the methods in high-stakes applications.  
2. Suboptimal Reference Vector Construction: The use of simple vector averaging to construct reference vectors may not fully capture the sentiment domain, as acknowledged by the authors. This limits the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  
3. Insufficient Exploration of GloVe: The paper provides limited analysis of why GloVe underperforms compared to Word2Vec. A deeper investigation into the differences between collocation- and paradigmatic-based embeddings could strengthen the findings.  
4. Lack of Generalization: The experiments are limited to movie review datasets, raising questions about the generalizability of the approach to other domains or languages.  
Questions to Authors:
1. How does the performance of the proposed methods compare when using alternative dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE or UMAP, instead of PCA?  
2. Could the inclusion of domain-specific point words improve the performance of the unsupervised approach?  
3. Have you considered alternative methods for constructing reference vectors, such as supervised fine-tuning of embeddings?  
Additional Comments:
The paper presents a promising direction for unsupervised sentiment analysis, but further work is needed to improve performance and generalizability. Exploring more sophisticated methods for reference vector construction and testing on diverse datasets could significantly enhance the impact of this research. Encouragingly, the authors acknowledge these limitations and provide a roadmap for future improvements. Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field and lays the groundwork for further advancements in unsupervised sentiment analysis.
