Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, specifically targeting the tasks of extracting links between argument components (ACs) and classifying their types. The authors propose a joint model based on a Pointer Network (PN) architecture, which simultaneously optimizes for both tasks. The key contributions of this work are:  
1. A joint neural model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets (persuasive essays and microtexts) by leveraging the PN architecture to enforce tree-like structures in argumentation.  
2. A demonstration of the importance of joint optimization for link prediction and type classification, showing that the dual-task approach significantly outperforms single-task models.  
3. An ablation study that highlights the importance of feature representations (e.g., bag-of-words, embeddings, structural features) and pooling strategies for the model's performance.  
Strengths
1. State-of-the-Art Performance: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple metrics across two datasets. Its ability to outperform models with explicit structural constraints (e.g., ILP Joint Model, MP+p) is particularly noteworthy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PN architecture.  
2. Joint Optimization: The paper makes a compelling case for the importance of joint optimization in argumentation mining. The results convincingly show that optimizing for both link prediction and type classification leads to better performance on both tasks, particularly for link prediction.  
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation, including comparisons with strong baselines, an ablation study, and an analysis of performance across different sequence lengths. This adds credibility to the claims and provides valuable insights into the model's behavior.  
4. Novel Application of Pointer Networks: The adaptation of PNs to argumentation mining is innovative, particularly the use of bidirectional LSTMs and the modifications to handle tree structures. This demonstrates a creative application of existing architectures to a new domain.  
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope: While the model achieves impressive results on subtasks 2 and 3, it does not address subtasks 1 (AC identification) and 4 (link type classification). Integrating these subtasks into the pipeline would make the approach more comprehensive and practically useful.  
2. Dependence on Predefined ACs: The model assumes that ACs have already been identified, which is a non-trivial task in real-world scenarios. This limits the applicability of the approach to cases where high-quality AC annotations are available.  
3. Scalability Concerns: The reliance on bidirectional LSTMs and fully connected layers may pose scalability challenges for longer texts or larger datasets. The performance drop observed for longer sequences suggests that the model may struggle with more complex argument structures.  
4. Feature Engineering: Despite being a neural model, the approach still relies heavily on hand-crafted features (e.g., bag-of-words, structural features). This somewhat limits the generalizability of the model to new domains or datasets without similar feature engineering efforts.  
Questions to Authors
1. Have you considered integrating subtask 1 (AC identification) into the model? If so, what challenges do you foresee in doing so?  
2. How does the model perform on datasets with more complex argument structures, such as those with non-tree-like graphs or cross-paragraph links?  
3. Could the model benefit from pretraining on larger, unlabeled argumentative datasets to improve generalization?  
Additional Comments
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed model and its contributions. However, the authors could further strengthen the work by addressing the limitations mentioned above, particularly by exploring ways to integrate subtasks 1 and 4 into the pipeline. Overall, this is a strong submission that makes a significant contribution to the field of argumentation mining.
