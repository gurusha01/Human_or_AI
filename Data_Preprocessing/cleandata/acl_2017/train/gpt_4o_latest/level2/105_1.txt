Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper introduces a neural model for morphological inflection generation that employs a hard attention mechanism tailored for nearly-monotonic alignments between input and output sequences. The authors claim three primary contributions: (1) the development of a hard attention model for nearly-monotonic sequence-to-sequence tasks, (2) state-of-the-art performance on three morphological inflection generation datasets, and (3) an analysis of the learned representations and alignments in comparison to soft attention models. The model is evaluated on the CELEX, Wiktionary, and SIGMORPHON 2016 datasets, demonstrating superior performance in low-resource settings and competitive results in high-resource scenarios.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty and Relevance: The hard attention mechanism is a significant innovation for morphological inflection generation, addressing the limitations of soft attention models in low-resource settings. By leveraging pre-computed alignments, the model effectively simplifies the training process while maintaining competitive performance.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the model across three diverse datasets, including both low-resource and high-resource scenarios. The results convincingly demonstrate the model's robustness and adaptability to different morphological phenomena.
3. Insightful Analysis: The comparison between hard and soft attention models offers valuable insights into the learned representations and alignments. The visualization of character encodings and alignments strengthens the paper's claims about the advantages of hard attention in capturing monotonic dependencies.
4. Practical Impact: The model's ability to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in low-resource settings is particularly impactful for morphologically rich languages where annotated data is scarce.
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Generalization Beyond Morphology: While the model is well-suited for morphological inflection generation, its applicability to other sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., machine translation or abstractive summarization) is not thoroughly explored. The paper briefly mentions potential extensions but does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical justification for these claims.
2. Dependence on Pre-computed Alignments: The reliance on external alignment tools introduces a dependency that may limit the model's applicability in scenarios where such alignments are unavailable or unreliable. A discussion on the limitations of this approach and potential alternatives would strengthen the paper.
3. Comparative Analysis with Soft Attention: Although the paper highlights the advantages of hard attention, it does not fully explore scenarios where soft attention might outperform hard attention (e.g., languages with complex non-monotonic dependencies). A more balanced discussion of trade-offs would provide a clearer picture of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
4. Reproducibility Details: While the authors mention that the code is available on GitHub, the paper lacks sufficient implementation details (e.g., hyperparameters, training time, and computational resources) to ensure reproducibility.
Questions to Authors:  
1. How does the model perform on tasks with non-monotonic alignments, such as languages with complex morphological phenomena (e.g., templatic morphology)?  
2. Could the reliance on pre-computed alignments be mitigated by integrating alignment learning into the model, and if so, how might this affect performance?  
3. Have you explored the potential of the hard attention mechanism in other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as abstractive summarization or transliteration?  
Conclusion:  
This paper presents a well-motivated and impactful contribution to morphological inflection generation, particularly in low-resource settings. While there are some limitations regarding generalizability and reliance on external alignments, the proposed hard attention mechanism is a promising direction for sequence-to-sequence learning. With minor revisions and additional exploration of broader applications, this work has the potential to make a significant impact on the field.
