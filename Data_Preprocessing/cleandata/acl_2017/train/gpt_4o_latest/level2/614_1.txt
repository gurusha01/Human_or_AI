Review of the Submitted Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel method for improving lexical substitution rankings by integrating word sense inventories into existing models. The authors propose a multi-view clustering algorithm that generates substitutable sense clusters tailored to lexical substitution tasks. The main contributions of the paper are:
1. Sense Clustering with Substitutability in Mind: A multi-view clustering approach that incorporates diverse views (context substitutability, paraphrase similarity, shared translations, and WordNet synsets) to create sense clusters that are more substitutable and coherent than previous methods.
2. Improved Lexical Substitution Rankings: The proposed sense clusters are used as a filter to enhance rankings generated by existing lexical substitution models, achieving significant improvements in GAP scores.
3. Evaluation Metric for Substitutability: The paper introduces an extended B-Cubed F-Score to measure the substitutability of sense inventories, providing a robust evaluation framework.
Strengths
1. Novelty of the Approach: The multi-view clustering algorithm is a well-motivated and innovative solution for generating substitutable sense clusters. The inclusion of diverse views, such as translation probabilities and context substitutability, adds depth to the clustering process.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides thorough evaluations using both oracle and practical filtering experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed sense clusters outperform existing baselines (e.g., WordNet and PPDBClus) in terms of substitutability and lexical substitution performance.
3. Practical Utility: The proposed method has clear practical applications in improving lexical substitution tasks, which are critical for downstream NLP tasks like machine translation and semantic representation.
4. Scalability: The method is designed to be scalable, leveraging large paraphrase resources like PPDB and avoiding reliance on manually annotated datasets.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Performance for Nouns: The proposed method underperforms for nouns compared to the TWSI baseline. This suggests that the clustering approach may require part-of-speech-specific optimizations, which are not explored in detail.
2. Simplistic WSD Method: The word sense disambiguation (WSD) method used for filtering is overly simplistic, relying on the top-5 ranked substitutes. This likely limits the practical effectiveness of the sense-filtering approach.
3. Interpretability of Clusters: While the clusters are evaluated quantitatively, there is limited qualitative analysis of the resulting sense clusters. Examples of cluster coherence or substitutability could strengthen the paper.
4. Dependency on PPDB: The method heavily relies on PPDB paraphrases, which may introduce noise or limit applicability to languages or domains where PPDB coverage is sparse.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the clustering method handle cases where paraphrases are highly ambiguous or belong to multiple senses?
2. Could the WSD method be improved by incorporating additional features, such as syntactic or semantic context?
3. Have you considered evaluating the method on other lexical substitution datasets, such as SemEval-2007, to test its generalizability?
Recommendation
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of lexical substitution by proposing a novel clustering approach that improves substitutability and ranking performance. While there are some limitations, particularly for nouns and WSD, the strengths of the approach outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the interpretability of clusters and explore potential improvements to the WSD method.
