Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper investigates the impact of task-specific corpora on word embeddings for sentiment analysis, proposing a novel approach to quantify corpus subjectivity and combining task-specific and generic datasets to improve sentiment classification. The key contributions of the paper are as follows:
1. Quantification of Subjectivity: The authors introduce a method to measure the subjectivity of a corpus using OpinionFinder, demonstrating that subjectivity can predict the appropriateness of a dataset for sentiment analysis.
2. Combination of Datasets: The paper explores three methods (appending, splicing, and concatenation) to combine task-specific and generic datasets, showing that concatenation consistently outperforms other approaches.
3. Under-Resourced Languages: The authors extend their method to under-resourced languages, demonstrating its utility for Catalan sentiment analysis using limited task-specific data.
4. Task-Specific Data Approximation: The study proposes extracting subjective sentences from generic corpora to approximate task-specific data, which is particularly beneficial for low-resource settings.
Strengths
1. Novelty: The work is novel in its focus on corpus subjectivity as a metric for improving word embeddings, which has not been explored in prior research. The idea of approximating task-specific data from generic corpora is particularly innovative.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed methods are highly relevant for under-resourced languages, addressing a critical gap in the field. The results on Catalan sentiment analysis highlight the practical applicability of the approach.
3. Comprehensive Experiments: The paper evaluates its methods on multiple datasets (Rotten Tomatoes, OpeNER, Catalan Aspect-level Sentiment Dataset) and provides detailed comparisons of different techniques for combining datasets.
4. Clear Results: The experiments demonstrate that concatenating embeddings trained on separate datasets consistently improves performance, providing actionable insights for practitioners.
5. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient details about the datasets, preprocessing steps, and experimental setup, making it easier for others to replicate the work.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Generalization Beyond Sentiment Analysis: While the paper suggests that the proposed techniques could be applied to other tasks, no experiments are conducted to validate this claim. This limits the broader impact of the work.
2. Overemphasis on Concatenation: The concatenation method, while effective, is not deeply analyzed in terms of why it outperforms other approaches. A theoretical explanation or ablation study would strengthen the findings.
3. Subjectivity Metric Limitations: The reliance on OpinionFinder for subjectivity quantification may not generalize well to other domains or languages. The paper does not discuss the potential biases or limitations of this tool.
4. Missing Error Analysis: While the paper qualitatively examines missing words, a more detailed error analysis (e.g., failure cases in sentiment classification) would provide deeper insights into the limitations of the proposed methods.
5. Scalability Concerns: The concatenation approach doubles the dimensionality of embeddings, which could pose computational challenges for larger datasets or resource-constrained environments. This issue is not addressed in the paper.
Questions to Authors
1. Have you considered using polarity (positive/negative sentiment) as a filtering metric instead of subjectivity? How do you anticipate this would compare to your current approach?
2. Can you provide more insights into the computational overhead of the concatenation method, particularly for high-dimensional embeddings or large-scale datasets?
3. Do you have plans to extend your methods to tasks beyond sentiment analysis? If so, which tasks do you believe would benefit most?
Recommendation
The paper presents a novel and practically useful approach to improving sentiment analysis using task-specific corpora and subjectivity metrics. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to address the scalability of the concatenation method and provide additional theoretical insights into its effectiveness.
