Summary of the Paper
This paper introduces a novel annotated corpus for analyzing revisions in argumentative essays, focusing on between-draft revisions. The corpus includes three drafts of essays written by college students, with sentence-level alignment and manual coding of revision purposes using a schema inspired by argument mining and discourse analysis. The authors demonstrate the utility of the corpus through two applications: (1) analyzing student revision behaviors and (2) training a supervised classifier to predict revision purposes. The corpus is publicly available and includes metadata such as participant demographics and survey responses.
Contributions
1. Annotated Corpus for Revision Analysis: The primary contribution is the creation of a comprehensive corpus that enables detailed analysis of revisions in argumentative essays. It fills a gap in the field by focusing on between-draft revisions, which are underexplored compared to single-draft analyses.
2. Applications of the Corpus: The paper demonstrates the corpus's utility through two applications: (a) statistical analysis of revision behaviors, revealing insights into the impact of feedback and linguistic background on revision strategies, and (b) training a classifier for automatic revision purpose prediction, extending prior work to college-level essays.
3. Public Release: The authors make the corpus freely available, along with metadata and annotations, fostering future research in revision analysis and related fields.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Relevance: The focus on between-draft revisions in argumentative essays is novel and addresses an important gap in writing-related NLP research. The corpus is well-designed, with detailed annotations and a clear schema that aligns with established discourse analysis frameworks.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide robust evaluations of the corpus's utility, including statistical analyses of revision behaviors and experiments on automatic revision classification. These applications demonstrate the corpus's potential for advancing research in both educational and computational domains.
3. Practical Usefulness: The corpus has broad applicability, from improving writing pedagogy to enhancing NLP systems for revision analysis. The inclusion of metadata and participant demographics adds value for user behavior studies.
4. High Annotation Quality: The inter-annotator agreement scores (Kappa = 0.84 for high-level categories) indicate reliable annotations, which are critical for reproducibility and downstream applications.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Applications: While the two applications are useful, they are relatively narrow in scope. For instance, the classifier experiments primarily replicate prior work with minor extensions. Additional applications, such as evaluating the impact of revisions on essay quality, would strengthen the paper.
2. Small Sample Size: The corpus includes essays from only 60 participants, which may limit the generalizability of findings. A larger dataset would provide more robust insights, especially for underrepresented categories like "Rebuttal" and "Evidence."
3. Interface Design Limitations: The study on revision behaviors highlights some limitations of the feedback interfaces, particularly for L2 speakers. The authors could have explored alternative interface designs or provided more detailed feedback to participants.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the limited sample size in future iterations of the corpus? Are there plans to include more diverse participants or essay types?
2. Did you evaluate the impact of revisions on the overall quality of essays? If not, how might this be incorporated into future work?
3. Could the annotation schema be extended to include sub-sentential revisions or evaluative measures? What challenges do you foresee in doing so?
Additional Comments
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of writing-related NLP by introducing a well-annotated corpus for revision analysis. While there are some limitations in scope and scale, the corpus has the potential to drive future research in both educational and computational contexts. The authors are encouraged to explore additional applications and expand the dataset to enhance its impact.
