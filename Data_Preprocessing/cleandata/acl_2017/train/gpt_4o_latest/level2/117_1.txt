Summary and Contributions  
This paper addresses the challenge of relation detection in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems, proposing a novel hierarchical recurrent neural network enhanced by residual learning (HR-BiLSTM). The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. A hierarchical matching approach that combines relation-level and word-level representations to improve relation detection.  
2. The introduction of residual learning to facilitate hierarchical sequence matching, enabling deeper and more abstract question representations.  
3. A simple KBQA pipeline that integrates the proposed relation detection model to achieve state-of-the-art results on both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA benchmarks.  
The paper demonstrates that the HR-BiLSTM model significantly outperforms existing baselines in relation detection tasks and improves KBQA performance by incorporating entity re-ranking and constraint detection steps.

Strengths  
1. Novelty and Innovation: The hierarchical matching approach, which combines relation-level and word-level representations, is a novel contribution to the field. The use of residual learning to address training difficulties in hierarchical architectures is well-motivated and effective.  
2. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed HR-BiLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SimpleQuestions and WebQSP datasets, with statistically significant improvements over baselines. The ablation studies further validate the importance of hierarchical matching and residual learning.  
3. Practical Utility: The integration of the relation detection model into a KBQA pipeline demonstrates its practical applicability. The entity re-ranking step, which leverages relation detection to resolve ambiguities in entity linking, is particularly impactful.  
4. Thorough Evaluation: The paper provides comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with baselines, ablation studies, and end-to-end KBQA evaluations. This rigor strengthens the validity of the claims.

Weaknesses  
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges challenges such as unseen relations and large relation vocabularies, it does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as its scalability to even larger KBs or its reliance on high-quality entity linking.  
2. Generality of the Approach: The proposed HR-BiLSTM is tailored for KBQA tasks, and its applicability to other relation detection tasks (e.g., open-domain relation extraction) is not explored. This limits the broader impact of the work.  
3. Complexity of the Model: The hierarchical architecture and residual learning introduce additional complexity. The paper could benefit from a discussion of the trade-offs between performance gains and computational costs.  
4. Reproducibility: While the paper provides detailed descriptions of the model and experiments, the absence of publicly available code or pre-trained models may hinder reproducibility.

Questions to Authors  
1. How does the proposed HR-BiLSTM scale to larger KBs with millions of relations? Are there any bottlenecks in terms of computational efficiency?  
2. Can the hierarchical matching approach be generalized to other NLP tasks, such as open-domain relation extraction or semantic similarity?  
3. How sensitive is the model's performance to the quality of the initial entity linking?

Conclusion  
Overall, this paper presents a significant advancement in KBQA relation detection through its innovative hierarchical matching and residual learning approach. While there are some concerns regarding scalability, generality, and reproducibility, the strong empirical results and practical utility of the proposed method make it a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the identified weaknesses in the final version.
