Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper investigates the applicability of Regular Graph Languages (RGLs) to natural language processing (NLP) tasks that involve graph-based semantic representations. It reviews three families of graph languages—Hyperedge Replacement Languages (HRL), Monadic Second Order Languages (MSOL), and Regular Graph Languages (RGL)—and identifies RGLs as a promising candidate due to their closure under intersection and probabilistic interpretability. The authors present two key contributions: (1) a proof that RGLs are closed under intersection, and (2) a linear-time parsing algorithm for RGLs. The paper also discusses the limitations of RGLs and their relationship to other graph language formalisms, such as Tree-like Grammars (TLG) and Restricted DAG Grammars (RDG).
Strengths  
1. Theoretical Contributions: The proof that RGLs are closed under intersection is significant, as this property is crucial for many NLP tasks that require combining multiple constraints. The constructive nature of the proof is particularly valuable, as it allows for practical implementation.  
2. Efficient Parsing Algorithm: The proposed top-down parsing algorithm for RGLs is well-designed and achieves linear complexity in the size of the input graph. This makes RGLs computationally attractive compared to more general graph grammars like HRL.  
3. Relevance to NLP: The paper addresses a pressing need in NLP for graph-based models that can handle compositional semantics, particularly in tasks like machine translation and semantic parsing. By situating RGLs within this context, the paper makes a compelling case for their potential utility.  
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper provides a thorough explanation of the theoretical foundations of RGLs and their relationship to other graph language families. The use of illustrative examples, such as the AMR dataset, helps bridge the gap between theory and application.
Weaknesses  
1. Expressivity Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that RGLs are less expressive than HRLs, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the practical implications of this limitation. For example, it remains unclear whether RGLs can adequately model all graph structures found in real-world NLP datasets like AMR.  
2. Evaluation and Experiments: The paper lacks empirical validation of the proposed parsing algorithm. While the theoretical complexity is promising, experiments on real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's claims about the practical utility of RGLs.  
3. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper mentions alternative formalisms like TLG and RDG, it does not provide a detailed comparison of their parsing complexity, expressivity, or closure properties relative to RGLs. This limits the reader's ability to assess the advantages of RGLs in a broader context.  
4. Practical Integration: The paper does not discuss how RGLs could be integrated into existing NLP pipelines or frameworks. This omission makes it harder to evaluate the feasibility of adopting RGLs in practice.
Questions to Authors  
1. Can you provide examples of specific graph structures in NLP datasets that cannot be modeled by RGLs but can be modeled by HRLs or other formalisms?  
2. Have you considered evaluating the proposed parsing algorithm on real-world datasets like AMR? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?  
3. How does the parsing complexity of RGLs compare to that of TLGs and RDGs in practice?  
Conclusion  
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by demonstrating the closure properties of RGLs and proposing an efficient parsing algorithm. However, its practical impact would be significantly enhanced by empirical validation and a more detailed comparison to related formalisms. Despite these limitations, the work is a valuable step toward developing graph-based models for NLP and has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
