Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper addresses the underexplored area of Vietnamese text readability by constructing a new, larger corpus and developing a novel formula to predict text readability. The authors claim that their formula achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting the readability of Vietnamese texts. The primary contributions of this paper are:  
1. The creation of a significantly larger and more diverse corpus (996 documents) for Vietnamese text readability assessment, categorized into three levels of difficulty (easy, normal, and difficult) and evaluated by experts.  
2. The development of a new readability formula based on features such as average sentence length, average word length, and the percentage of difficult words, achieving 81% overall accuracy.  
3. A detailed methodology for feature selection and regression analysis, ensuring the formula's reliability and applicability to practical use cases.  
Strengths  
1. Novelty in Corpus Creation: The construction of a large, annotated corpus for Vietnamese text readability is a significant contribution, as prior studies relied on small datasets of 20â€“54 documents. The inclusion of expert evaluations and Fleiss' kappa analysis enhances the corpus's reliability.  
2. Practical Applicability: The proposed formula demonstrates high accuracy (81%) and is well-suited for practical applications, such as educational material design, legal document drafting, and language learning. This makes the work highly relevant to both academic and real-world contexts.  
3. Rigorous Methodology: The authors employ a systematic approach to feature selection and regression analysis, ensuring that the formula is both interpretable and statistically sound. The use of cross-validation further strengthens the robustness of the results.  
4. Clear Presentation of Results: The paper provides detailed statistical analyses, including correlation coefficients and accuracy metrics, which make the findings transparent and reproducible.  
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Comparison with Existing Methods: While the paper discusses prior formulas for English and Vietnamese, it does not provide a direct comparison of the proposed formula's performance against these existing methods. This limits the ability to assess the improvement over prior work.  
2. Moderate Inter-Annotator Agreement: The Fleiss' kappa score of 0.422 indicates only moderate agreement among annotators, which may impact the reliability of the corpus annotations. Further exploration of this limitation is warranted.  
3. Feature Scope: The formula relies primarily on surface-level features (e.g., sentence length, word length, percentage of difficult words). Incorporating deeper linguistic features, such as syntax or discourse-level information, could improve the formula's precision.  
4. Domain-Specific Limitations: The corpus is diverse but may not generalize well to highly specialized domains (e.g., legal or medical texts). This limitation is acknowledged but not explored in depth.  
Questions to Authors  
1. How does the proposed formula compare quantitatively to the older Vietnamese readability formulas (e.g., Nguyen and Henkin, 1982, 1985) in terms of accuracy and applicability?  
2. Could you elaborate on how the moderate Fleiss' kappa score might affect the reliability of the corpus and the resulting formula?  
3. Are there plans to integrate the formula into practical tools (e.g., word processors or educational platforms)?  
Conclusion  
This paper makes a valuable contribution to Vietnamese text readability research by addressing a long-standing gap in the field. While the work is methodologically sound and practically relevant, it could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods and the inclusion of deeper linguistic features. Nonetheless, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, as it lays a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in Vietnamese text readability assessment.
