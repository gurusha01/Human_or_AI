Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the challenges posed by morphologically rich languages in distributional vector space models, specifically the sparsity of low-frequency word forms and the inability to distinguish between lexical relations with similar distributional signatures. The authors propose a novel post-processing method, morph-fitting, which fine-tunes pre-trained word vectors by injecting morphological constraints derived from simple language-specific rules. This approach pulls inflectional forms closer together and pushes derivational antonyms further apart. The paper claims two primary contributions: (1) improved semantic quality of word vectors, particularly for low-frequency words, across four languages (English, German, Italian, and Russian); and (2) significant downstream performance gains in dialogue state tracking (DST) tasks for morphologically rich languages. The method is resource-light, requiring no curated semantic lexicons, and is shown to be robust across multiple languages and datasets.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Practicality: The morph-fitting approach is novel in its use of simple, language-specific morphological rules to improve word vector spaces. Unlike prior methods, it does not rely on curated resources, making it more portable to low-resource languages.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide extensive intrinsic evaluations on word similarity datasets (SimLex-999 and Morph-SimLex) and extrinsic evaluations on a downstream DST task. The consistent improvements across languages and tasks demonstrate the robustness of the method.
3. Language-Agnostic Design: The method is applied to four typologically diverse languages, showcasing its generalizability. The use of simple morphological rules by non-native speakers further highlights its accessibility.
4. Downstream Impact: The demonstrated improvements in DST performance, particularly for German (+6%) and Italian (+4%), underscore the practical utility of morph-fitting in real-world NLP applications.
5. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient methodological details, including the ATTRACT-REPEL algorithm and the language-specific rules, facilitating reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Exploration of Antonymy Constraints: While the paper incorporates antonymy constraints, their impact is less thoroughly analyzed compared to inflectional constraints. A deeper exploration of their contribution to downstream tasks would strengthen the claims.
2. Simplistic Morphological Rules: The reliance on simple, rule-based constraints may limit the method's ability to capture complex morphological phenomena, particularly in highly inflected languages like Russian. The authors could explore more sophisticated rule sets or data-driven approaches.
3. Lack of Error Analysis: The paper does not provide a detailed error analysis for the DST task, which would help identify specific cases where morph-fitting succeeds or fails.
4. English Bias in Evaluation: While the method is applied to multiple languages, the intrinsic evaluation datasets (e.g., SimLex-999) are primarily English-centric, even in their multilingual versions. This may limit the generalizability of the results to other morphologically rich languages.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the performance of morph-fitting vary with the complexity of the morphological rules? Could more sophisticated rules lead to further improvements?
2. Have you considered extending the method to handle compounding or other morphological processes beyond inflection and derivation?
3. Could you provide more insights into the specific types of errors reduced by morph-fitting in the DST task?
Overall Assessment
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of NLP by addressing a critical gap in the handling of morphologically rich languages in word vector spaces. The proposed morph-fitting method is innovative, resource-efficient, and demonstrates strong empirical results across multiple languages and tasks. While there are areas for further exploration, such as the role of antonymy constraints and more complex morphological rules, the work is well-executed and has practical implications for both intrinsic and extrinsic NLP tasks. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
