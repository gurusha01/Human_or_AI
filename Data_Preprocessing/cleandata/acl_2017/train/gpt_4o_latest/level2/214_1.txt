Review
Summary and Contributions
This paper addresses the critical yet underexplored problem of discourse primary-secondary relationships in discourse structure analysis. The authors propose a unified macro-micro discourse structure representation schema that integrates logical semantic relationships at the micro level with pragmatic functional relationships at the macro level. They also introduce the Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB), a corpus of 97 annotated Chinese news articles, to support their schema. The claimed contributions of the paper are:  
1. A novel macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema that expands discourse analysis from intra-paragraph to the overall discourse level.  
2. The creation of MCDTB, a resource for analyzing discourse relations and primary-secondary relationships.  
3. Preliminary experiments demonstrating the utility of the schema and corpus for discourse relation and primary-secondary relation recognition tasks.
Strengths
1. Novelty of the Representation Schema: The proposed macro-micro unified schema is a significant conceptual advancement, as it bridges the gap between micro-level logical semantics and macro-level pragmatic functions. This holistic approach addresses limitations in existing discourse theories that focus on only one level.  
2. Corpus Development: The creation of MCDTB is a valuable contribution to the field, as annotated corpora for macro-level discourse analysis are scarce. The detailed annotation strategy and quality assurance measures (e.g., kappa scores) enhance the credibility of the resource.  
3. Preliminary Experimental Results: The experiments on discourse relation and primary-secondary relation recognition validate the utility of the proposed schema and corpus. The use of features such as hierarchical characteristics and semantic similarity is well-motivated and demonstrates promising results despite the challenges of imbalanced data.  
4. Practical Relevance: The work has potential applications in various NLP tasks, including text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis, as highlighted by the authors.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Corpus Size: While the MCDTB is a valuable resource, its size (97 articles) is relatively small for robust machine learning applications. This limitation may hinder generalizability and scalability. The authors acknowledge this and suggest future expansion, but the current dataset restricts the scope of the experiments.  
2. Imbalanced Data: The experimental results reveal issues with imbalanced data, particularly for multi-primary relations and less frequent discourse relations like "Sequence" and "Cause-Result." This affects the reliability of the classifiers and limits the interpretability of the results.  
3. Evaluation Metrics: The paper does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the evaluation metrics used for the experiments. For example, while F-scores are reported, the lack of detailed error analysis makes it difficult to assess the specific challenges faced by the models.  
4. Limited Comparison with Existing Work: Although the paper discusses related theories and computational models, it does not provide a direct comparison of the proposed schema and corpus with existing discourse analysis approaches. This omission makes it harder to assess the relative novelty and effectiveness of the work.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the issue of imbalanced data in future work? Would techniques like data augmentation or transfer learning be feasible?  
2. Have you considered extending the schema to other genres beyond news articles? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?  
3. Could you provide more details on the annotation process, particularly how disagreements between annotators were resolved?  
Additional Comments
Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to discourse structure analysis, with a well-defined schema and a valuable annotated corpus. However, the limited corpus size and imbalanced data issues reduce the immediate impact of the work. Expanding the corpus and addressing these challenges would significantly enhance the contribution. The paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the outlined weaknesses in future iterations.
