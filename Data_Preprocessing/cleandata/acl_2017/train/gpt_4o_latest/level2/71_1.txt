Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper presents a framework for cross-lingual name tagging and linking across 282 languages using Wikipedia as a resource. The system identifies name mentions, assigns entity types, and links them to an English Knowledge Base (KB). The primary contributions of the paper are:  
1. Silver-Standard Annotation Generation: The authors propose a method to generate annotations by transferring entity labels from English Wikipedia to other languages using cross-lingual links and KB properties.  
2. Self-Training and Topic Selection: The framework refines annotations through self-training and customizes them for specific downstream applications using cross-lingual topic transfer.  
3. Morphology Analysis and Translation Mining: The authors derive morphology features from Wikipedia markups and mine word translation pairs from cross-lingual links, addressing challenges in morphologically rich and low-resource languages.  
4. Comprehensive Benchmark: The framework is evaluated on both Wikipedia and non-Wikipedia data, and the resources for all 282 languages are made publicly available.  
Strengths
1. Scalability: The framework is applied to an impressive 282 languages, making it one of the most extensive multilingual name tagging and linking systems to date. This is a significant advancement in the field of multilingual NLP.  
2. Resource Efficiency: The approach does not rely on manual annotations or native speaker input, making it highly practical for low-resource languages. The use of Wikipedia as a multilingual resource is well-leveraged.  
3. Performance: The system achieves competitive results on non-Wikipedia datasets, with F-scores only slightly lower than supervised models trained on gold-standard data. The self-training approach provides substantial performance gains, particularly for morphologically rich languages like Turkish and Uzbek.  
4. Practical Utility: The release of resources, including annotations, morphology analyzers, and end-to-end systems, is a valuable contribution to the research community.  
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty in Methodology: While the paper combines existing techniques effectively, many of the core components (e.g., self-training, cross-lingual projection) are not novel. The novelty lies more in the scale and integration rather than in methodological innovation.  
2. Evaluation Scope: The evaluation on non-Wikipedia data is limited to only 9 languages, which does not fully reflect the performance across the claimed 282 languages. Additionally, the reliance on silver-standard data for evaluation on Wikipedia introduces noise and limits the reliability of the reported results.  
3. Morphology Analysis Limitations: The morphology analysis approach is restricted to languages where stems and affixes are directly concatenated, leaving out more complex morphological systems.  
4. Scalability of Self-Training: While self-training improves performance, the iterative process may be computationally expensive for languages with large Wikipedia corpora.  
Questions to Authors
1. How does the system handle languages with extremely limited Wikipedia content (e.g., less than 1,000 mentions)?  
2. Can the proposed morphology analysis approach be extended to handle more complex morphological systems, such as templatic morphology?  
3. How does the framework perform on languages with non-Latin scripts and no word boundaries, such as Thai or Chinese?  
Conclusion
This paper addresses an important and ambitious problem in multilingual NLP and demonstrates significant progress in cross-lingual name tagging and linking. While the methodology lacks substantial novelty, the scale, resource efficiency, and practical contributions make this work a valuable addition to the field. Addressing the limitations in evaluation and morphology analysis could further strengthen the impact of this research.
