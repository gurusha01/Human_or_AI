Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions:  
This paper introduces ngrams into four widely used word representation methods: SGNS, GloVe, PPMI, and SVD. The authors propose a novel approach to incorporate ngram co-occurrence statistics into these methods and conduct comprehensive experiments on word analogy and similarity tasks. The results demonstrate that ngram-based models yield improved word representations, with notable gains in semantic and syntactic tasks. Additionally, the authors propose an efficient method for constructing ngram co-occurrence matrices, which significantly reduces the computational burden, enabling the models to run on low-cost hardware. The paper also provides qualitative evaluations of ngram embeddings, showcasing their ability to capture semantic meanings and syntactic patterns.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty and Practical Utility: The integration of ngrams into traditional word representation methods is a meaningful extension that addresses the limitations of word-only co-occurrence statistics. The proposed method is intuitive and well-motivated by the success of ngrams in language modeling.  
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are thorough, covering both word analogy and similarity tasks. The results consistently show improvements, particularly in analogy tasks, where ngram-based SGNS achieves significant performance gains.  
3. Efficient Matrix Construction: The proposed "mixture" and "stripes" strategies for building ngram co-occurrence matrices are practical and computationally efficient. This contribution is particularly valuable for researchers with limited hardware resources.  
4. Qualitative Analysis: The qualitative evaluation of ngram embeddings is insightful, demonstrating their ability to reflect semantic relationships (e.g., antonyms) and syntactic patterns. This analysis adds depth to the paper and highlights potential applications of ngram embeddings in NLP tasks.  
5. Reproducibility: The authors provide a unified pipeline for implementing the models and release their code (ngram2vec toolkit), which enhances the reproducibility and accessibility of their work.
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Hyperparameter Exploration: The authors strictly adhere to default hyperparameters from baseline models, which may not be optimal for ngram-based methods. This limitation is particularly evident in the underwhelming performance of ngram-enhanced GloVe and SVD models. A more thorough exploration of hyperparameters could strengthen the results.  
2. Sparse Coverage of Higher-Order Ngrams: While the paper focuses on uni-grams and bi-grams, it does not explore the potential benefits or trade-offs of incorporating higher-order ngrams. This omission leaves a gap in understanding the full potential of ngram-based representations.  
3. Incomplete Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not adequately discuss the potential downsides of introducing ngrams, such as increased model complexity and potential overfitting in smaller datasets. A more balanced discussion of limitations would improve the paper.  
4. Lack of Downstream Task Evaluation: While the paper demonstrates improvements in analogy and similarity tasks, it does not evaluate the impact of ngram-based embeddings on downstream NLP tasks (e.g., text classification or sentiment analysis). Such experiments would better establish the practical utility of the proposed approach.
Questions to Authors:  
1. How do the proposed ngram-based methods perform on downstream NLP tasks, such as text classification or machine translation?  
2. Have you considered dynamic weighting strategies or other techniques to optimize the use of ngrams in GloVe and SVD?  
3. Can the proposed matrix construction method be extended to higher-order ngrams without significant computational overhead?  
Conclusion:  
This paper presents a novel and practical extension to existing word representation methods by incorporating ngrams, achieving promising results in analogy and similarity tasks. While there are some limitations in hyperparameter tuning and downstream task evaluation, the contributions are significant, particularly the efficient matrix construction method and the qualitative insights into ngram embeddings. With further refinements, this work has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field of word representation and its applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
