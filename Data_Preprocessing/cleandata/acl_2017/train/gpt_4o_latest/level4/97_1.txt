This paper presents a system designed to assist in scoring written tests.
- Strengths:  
The paper applies an interesting natural language processing (NLP) problem—recognizing textual entailment—to a significant real-world task: written test scoring.
- Weaknesses:  
The paper does not introduce any novel contributions. It primarily involves the application of an existing technology to a well-known problem.  
The proposed approach is not fully autonomous, as it still requires human involvement for the actual scoring process. Additionally, the paper lacks both quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the system's utility. For instance, it does not address whether the system simplifies the scorer's task or enhances their effectiveness compared to manual scoring without automation.  
The system comprises multiple components, but the paper does not clarify how the performance of each component impacts the overall user experience.  
The writing in the paper requires improvement, as the language and style are rough in several sections.  
While the paper includes several detailed examples, these examples do not significantly contribute to the discussion or the overall value of the work.  
For the classification evaluation, the paper does not specify the baseline for predicting the most frequent class, which is an important omission.  
- General Discussion:  
Overall, I find the paper lacking in inspiration. Beyond announcing the development of such a system, it does not convey a clear or compelling message.
