- Strengths:
The manuscript tackles a persistent challenge in the automatic evaluation of outputs from generation and translation systems.  
The examination of existing metrics is detailed and exhaustive.  
The authors introduce a novel metric that exhibits stronger alignment with human evaluations.  
The bibliography serves as a valuable resource for newcomers to the field.  
- Weaknesses:
The paper adopts a numerical analysis perspective, offering minimal insights into linguistic aspects of generation, the generation methods themselves, or the distinctions between outputs from different systems and human-generated references.  
There is ambiguity regarding the suitability of crowd-sourced references in applications requiring language generation.  
- General Discussion:
In summary, the paper would benefit from the inclusion of linguistic examples (along with descriptions of the various systems), even if it means omitting some tables, to provide readers with better intuitions.
