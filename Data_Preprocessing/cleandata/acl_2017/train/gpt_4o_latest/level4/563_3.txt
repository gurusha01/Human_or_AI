This paper conducts a comparative analysis of various vector combination techniques for the task of relation classification.
- Strengths:
The manuscript is well-written and straightforward to follow.
- Weaknesses:
The primary concern with this work lies in the significance of its contributions. While it may be appropriate as a short paper, it does not meet the standards for a full-length submission.
The paper lacks substantial originality and does not present sufficiently strong experimental results to support its claims. Its sole contribution, an 'in-out' similarity metric, is derived from prior work. Furthermore, the results appear highly dependent on the choice of clusters and only significantly outperform a simplistic baseline when the number of clusters is pre-determined to match the data.
Relation classification or clustering using semantic vector space models is undoubtedly a fascinating and challenging area of research. This study could serve as a useful experimental reference on vector combination and comparison techniques in the form of a short paper. However, it falls short of the depth and impact required for a full-length paper.
