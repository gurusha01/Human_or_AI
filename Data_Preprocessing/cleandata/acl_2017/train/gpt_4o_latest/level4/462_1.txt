- Strengths:  
The manuscript presents an approach that surpasses prior methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.  
In terms of data, the method integrates both market and textual data effectively.  
The proposed approach leverages word embeddings to assign weights to each lexicon term, extending these weights to semantically similar terms within the document.  
- Weaknesses:  
Deep learning-based methods are well-known for achieving strong performance in sentiment analysis with minimal feature engineering. A more comprehensive review of related literature would strengthen the comparison with existing works.  
The performance improvement primarily stems from feature-based methods, with limited innovation in terms of the model itself or the introduction of novel features.  
- General Discussion:  
The manuscript outlines an approach to sentiment analysis, employing a relatively recent technique of using word embeddings to determine the weights of lexicon terms. However, the level of novelty in the proposed method is not particularly substantial.
