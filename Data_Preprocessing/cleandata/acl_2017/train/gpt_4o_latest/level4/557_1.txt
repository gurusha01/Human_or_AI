Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written and organized effectively.
- The system integrates several novel techniques, such as global optimization, into end-to-end neural relation extraction, and the direct use of the parser representation is particularly intriguing.
- The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both the ACE05 and CONLL04 datasets.
- The paper includes a range of insightful analyses.
Weaknesses:
- The method appears incremental, primarily combining pre-existing techniques.
- The performance gains (1.2 percentage points on the development set) are relatively modest, and no statistical significance tests are reported.
General Discussion:
Major Comments:
- The model incorporates a recent parser and GloVe word embeddings. What specific impact did these components have on relation extraction performance?
- During prediction, how were illegal predictions handled by the system?
Minor Comments:
- The description of local optimization in the introduction is somewhat misleading. It is not entirely "local," as it "considers structural correspondences between incremental decisions."
- The data points in Figures 6 and 7 should be connected using straight lines rather than curves.
- How are entities represented in the "-segment" approach?
- Some references are incomplete. For instance, Kingma et al. (2014) is published in ICLR, and Li et al. (2014) lacks page numbers.
