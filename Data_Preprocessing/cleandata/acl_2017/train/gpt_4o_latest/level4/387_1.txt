- Strengths:
This study addresses an intriguing problem and introduces what appears to be a novel and well-reasoned method for integrating cognitive features with textual features to perform sentiment analysis and irony detection. The paper is well-written, logically structured, and includes a wealth of useful details, illustrative examples, and informative visualizations. The majority of the results are compelling, and the authors have done a commendable job of comparing their approach and findings with prior work in the field.
- Weaknesses:
1. Based on the abstract alone, I had anticipated that the proposed method would significantly outperform existing approaches and that the combination of eye-gaze and textual features would consistently yield superior results. However, upon reviewing the results section, the findings appear to be more nuanced. It would be beneficial to revise the abstract and introduction to better align with the actual outcomes.  
2. In the evaluation of the model on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, were sarcastic utterances included? Additionally, did the model perform better on classifying non-sarcastic utterances compared to sarcastic ones?  
3. While the utility of eye-movement data for sarcasm detection is clear, it is less evident why such data would enhance (non-sarcastic) sentiment classification beyond what textual features alone can achieve.  
- General Discussion:
This paper offers a wealth of interesting insights, and the proposed approach appears to be both robust and innovative. While the results were somewhat less strong than I had initially expected based on the abstract, the work remains valuable and would likely be of interest to the broader research community. I believe it warrants publication.
