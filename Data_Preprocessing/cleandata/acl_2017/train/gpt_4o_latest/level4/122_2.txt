This paper introduces a neural network-based framework for dialogue state tracking (DST). 
The primary contribution lies in the learning of representations for user utterances, system outputs, and ontology entries, all leveraging pre-trained word vectors. Specifically, for utterance representation, the authors evaluate two distinct neural network models: NBT-DNN and NBT-CNN. These learned representations are then integrated and fed into a downstream network to make binary decisions for given slot-value pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance gains compared to the baseline delexicalized approach.
Overall, this is a solid piece of work with a clear objective, a sound methodology, and improved results over prior studies. However, the paper's organization could be enhanced to better convey the details, particularly for readers less familiar with this domain.
Firstly, a more formal definition of DST should be provided early in the paper. The current explanation is somewhat unclear and may become more confusing when coupled with SLU. It is recommended to present the general architecture of a dialogue system (currently in Section 2) earlier in Section 1, followed by a problem definition of DST that highlights its relationships with other components, such as ASR, SLU, and policy learning.
Additionally, the paper's readability would benefit from defining all notations earlier in the text. For instance, symbols like tq, ts, and t_v are introduced before their meanings are explained, which could confuse readers.
Below are additional comments and questions:
- Is it feasible to perform separate SLU with this model? If not, the term 'joint' might be misleading, as it could imply the model handles both tasks simultaneously.
- Could you provide statistics on the number of errors corrected in the original DSTC2 dataset? If the corrections are not substantial, it would be helpful to include comparisons with other published works, including DSTC2 entries, using the same dataset.
- Have you considered using RNNs or LSTMs to capture the sequential aspects of learning utterance representations? Given the recent successes of these recurrent networks in SLU tasks, they might also be effective for DST.
- Additional details about the semantic dictionary used in the baseline would help clarify the manual effort required to build such resources.
- Including examples of cases where the baseline failed but your proposed models succeeded would be valuable for illustrating the framework's strengths.
