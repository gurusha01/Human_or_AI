Paraphrased Review:
Strengths:
- The model is grounded in solid theoretical foundations and is well-motivated by formal semantics.
Weaknesses:
- While the paper focuses on is-a relation extraction, it fails to reference a significant portion of the existing literature on taxonomization, including the following works:
  - Flati Tiziano, Vannella Daniele, Pasini Tommaso, Navigli Roberto. 2016. MultiWiBi: The multilingual Wikipedia bitaxonomy project.
  - Soren Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak, and Zachary Ive. 2007. DBpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data.

  - Paola Velardi, Stefano Faralli, and Roberto Navigli. 2013. OntoLearn Reloaded: A graph-based algorithm for taxonomy induction.
- The experimental evaluation is insufficient, as it only compares the proposed approach against "Hearst patterns" without considering the aforementioned works.
General Discussion:
The paper is clearly written, and the supplementary material is both well-prepared and helpful. However, it lacks sufficient references to the literature on is-a relation extraction and taxonomization. This shortcoming extends to the experimental evaluation, which does not include meaningful comparisons with other systems, particularly those more recent than Hearst patterns.
Although I reviewed the authors' responses, I remain unconvinced that additional evaluations could not have been conducted. While the theoretical motivations are robust, comparative experiments are crucial to validate whether the authors' theoretical insights hold up in practice. Even though the cited works focus on taxonomy construction, comparisons could still be made by analyzing the edges of a taxonomy.
That said, after considering the authors' detailed responses and the discussion with the other reviewer, I am willing to raise my score to 3. However, I still believe the paper suffers from a lack of experimental depth and fails to adequately situate itself within the broader is-a relation extraction and taxonomy-building literature.
