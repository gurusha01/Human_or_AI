- Strengths:
The paper is well-written.
- Weaknesses:
While the title and abstract suggest a comparison of robust parsing methods for HPSG, the scope of the comparison is limited to only a few techniques applied to a single grammar, the ERG. Historically, the ERG treebank has been constructed only for sentences within the grammar's coverage. Given the idiosyncrasies of the ERG in this regard, the paper may hold limited relevance for researchers working with other precision grammar frameworks.
The paper does not adequately compare its methods with robustness techniques commonly used in systems based on other precision grammars, such as CCG, LFG, the Alpage system for French, or Alpino for Dutch, among others. Additionally, while the paper references Dridan (2013) for supertagging in the context of the ERG, it overlooks earlier work on supertagging for other precision grammar systems, which predates this by at least a decade.
The level of detail provided is insufficient for replicating the results. Key specifics, such as the limits on resource allocation, are not clearly described. More critically, some techniques under comparison (e.g., robust unification) and the evaluation metric rely on a separate paper that is still under preparation.
The performance results of the techniques are underwhelming. Except for the csaw-tb method, parsing speeds are extremely slowâ€”often significantly slower than the baseline method, which does not impose standard resource limitations. While the csaw-tb method is faster, it is not very accurate and is not a novel contribution of this paper but rather an existing PCFG approximation technique.
It would be more compelling to see results on a representative dataset that includes both sentences within and outside the grammar's coverage. This would allow for a meaningful comparison with the "real" baseline system (ERG with standard settings).
A methodological concern arises from the use of the semcor and wsj00ab datasets, which contain sentences that an older version of the ERG could not parse but a newer version can. This introduces a clear bias in these datasets, making it unsurprising that the techniques perform better on them. However, this reviewer finds such results to be of limited significance.
