- Strengths:  
This paper introduces an innovative method for dialogue state tracking that leverages pre-trained embeddings to represent slot values and effectively combines them into distributed representations of user utterances and dialogue context. The experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements compared to the baseline delexicalization-based approach. Additionally, the authors explore alternative pre-training methods for word embeddings, such as XAVIER, GloVe, and Program-SL999.
- Weaknesses:  
While one of the primary motivations for using embeddings is to generalize to more complex dialogue domains where delexicalization may not scale effectively, the datasets employed in the study appear to be somewhat limited. It would be interesting to see how the proposed approach performs with and without a dedicated slot tagging component in more complex dialogue scenarios. For instance, when calculating the similarity between utterances and slot value pairs, it might be possible to restrict the estimation to the span of the slot values, which could still be applicable even when the values do not match.
The examples provided in the introduction seem somewhat misleading. For instance, shouldn't the dialogue state also include "restaurant_name=The House"? This raises another important question: how does the resolution of coreferences influence the performance of this task?
- General Discussion:  
Overall, the use of pre-trained word embeddings is an excellent idea, and the specific methodology proposed for utilizing them is both promising and compelling.
