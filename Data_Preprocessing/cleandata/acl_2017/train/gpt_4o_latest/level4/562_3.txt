The paper frames the relation extraction problem as a reading comprehension task and builds upon a previously proposed reading comprehension (RC) model to extract unseen relations. The proposed method consists of two primary components:
1. Queryfication: Transforming a relation into a natural language question. This step is achieved through crowdsourcing.
2. Applying the RC model: Using the generated questions and sentences to extract answer spans. The authors extend an earlier approach to handle cases where no correct answer exists in the sentence.
Comments:
1. The paper is well-written, and the methodology is explained with clarity.
2. While the idea of leveraging RC for relation extraction is both intriguing and innovative, the overall approach lacks novelty. One component relies on crowdsourcing, and the other is directly adapted from prior work, as mentioned above.
3. Relation extraction is a well-explored area with numerous recent publications. However, the authors fail to compare their method against existing approaches. This omission casts doubt on the effectiveness of the proposed method. As shown in Table 2, the performance metrics for the core task are not particularly compelling. This could potentially be attributed to the dataset used in the study. Nevertheless, a comparison with prior methods is essential to evaluate how the proposed approach measures up to the state-of-the-art.
4. Slot-filling data preparation: The paper states, "we took the first sentence s in D to contain both e and a." How does the first sentence of an entity's Wikipedia article reliably provide the answer sentence for all relations of that entity? This requires clarification. I recommend referring to the following paper, which outlines a set of rules for identifying answer sentences corresponding to an entity's properties in its Wikipedia page:

Overall Assessment:
The paper introduces an interesting approach. However, without a thorough comparison to recent works on relation extraction, the effectiveness of the proposed method remains unclear. As such, the paper is not yet ready for publication.
