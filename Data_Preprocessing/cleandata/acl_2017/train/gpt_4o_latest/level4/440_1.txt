- Strengths:  
This paper introduces an extension to A* CCG parsing that incorporates dependency information. Successfully achieving this while preserving both speed and tractability is a highly commendable aspect of the proposed approach. The use of precomputed attachments is an elegant and effective technique. Additionally, I found the evaluation of the impact of head-rules on normal-form violations particularly insightful, and I would be interested in seeing further details on the remaining unresolved cases.
- Weaknesses:  
There is a need for more detailed analysis of specific dependency structures. In particular, I am curious about how the approach handles coordination and relative clauses, especially in scenarios where the predicate-argument structure of CCG diverges from the dependency structures typically employed by other parsers.
- General Discussion:  
Overall, I am very impressed with this work and consider it a valuable contribution to the field. The only aspect I found lacking was a deeper analysis of the construction types that showed the most improvement (for both English and Japanese) and a discussion, as noted earlier, on reconciling predicate-argument dependencies with those used by other dependency parsers.
