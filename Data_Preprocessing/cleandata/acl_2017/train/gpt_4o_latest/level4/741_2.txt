- Strengths:  
The paper introduces a novel approach for word sense induction leveraging synonymy dictionaries. This method represents a conceptual advancement over existing techniques and demonstrates strong empirical performance. The evaluation is comprehensive, utilizing multiple benchmarks and competitive baseline methods.  
- Weaknesses:  
There are a few minor concerns. First, I would appreciate a more detailed discussion regarding the evaluation. Specifically, the reported F1 scores for all models are relatively low, remaining under 50%. Does this suggest limited room for improvement, or is there an inherent performance ceiling due to the nature of the task? While the authors attribute some of the performance gap to lexical sparsity in the input data, it would be helpful to quantify how much of the gap this sparsity accounts for.  
Second, I would like to see a discussion on the choice of evaluation metric. Word senses can be analyzed at varying levels of granularity, and this variability could naturally influence system scores.  
Lastly, there is some ambiguity regarding the process of obtaining word sense vectors described in Section 3.4. If the senses are determined only after this step, and given that senses are not annotated in the input corpora, it is unclear how these vectors were derived.  
- General Discussion:  
I recommend this paper for presentation at the ACL Meeting. It is a solid and well-executed piece of work.
