- Strengths:  
This paper is well-written overall.  
The clarity of the paper is commendable for the most part.  
The experimental comparisons are thorough and effectively conducted.  
The experiments are thoughtfully designed and executed.  
The concept of employing knowledge distillation (KD) for zero-resource neural machine translation (NMT) is innovative and noteworthy.  
- Weaknesses:  
The abstract and other sections of the paper contain several sentences that are overloaded with information. This could be improved by breaking them into simpler sentences for better clarity.  
The paper lacks a detailed explanation of the actual method used. This section is presented in a rather superficial manner, making it challenging to fully grasp the approach from the descriptions provided.  
The reliance on a source-pivot corpus during test time is a significant limitation of this method. However, this drawback is not acknowledged or discussed in the paper. The authors are strongly encouraged to address this issue and provide commentary on its implications.  
- General Discussion:  
This work applies knowledge distillation to enhance zero-resource translation.  
The techniques employed are closely related to those introduced by Yoon Kim et al., with the novel contribution being their application to zero-resource translation.  
The authors conduct comparisons with other leading works in the field and demonstrate that their approach eliminates the need for double decoding.  
- Detailed Comments:  
- Lines 21–27: The authors could simplify this section by splitting the complex sentence structure into two straightforward sentences.  
- Line 41: Johnson et al. holds the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for English-French and German-English.  
- Lines 77–79: The claim that combining multiple languages increases complexity lacks supporting evidence. The authors should either remove this statement or substantiate it with evidence, as existing literature appears to suggest otherwise.  
- Lines 416–420: These two lines are redundant, as they were already mentioned in the preceding paragraph.  
- Line 577: The reference should be to Figure 2, not Figure 3.
