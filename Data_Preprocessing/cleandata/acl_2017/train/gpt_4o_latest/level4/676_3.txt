- Strengths:  
This work demonstrates high originality by introducing a fundamentally novel approach to word prediction from a vocabulary, which is more efficient than the traditional softmax layer while achieving comparable performance in NMT. If successfully adopted, this method has the potential to be impactful due to its ability to accelerate prediction.  
The paper is well-written and includes excellent diagrams, making it easy to follow. I particularly appreciated the cross-referencing between the models and the diagrams in Table 2. Additionally, the inclusion of loss curves is a valuable touch.  
- Weaknesses:  
While it may not be feasible within the remaining time, it would be beneficial to include a comparison (e.g., BLEU scores) with previous related approaches such as hierarchical softmax and differentiated softmax.  
The paper lacks a linguistic perspective on the proposed method. For example, compared to softmax layers and hierarchical/differentiated softmax, is binary code prediction a natural mechanism for word prediction? How closely does it align with how humans retrieve words from memory? Is there any theoretical basis to suggest that binary code-based approaches are inherently better or worse suited for this task compared to softmax layers?  
Although the introduction promises faster training speeds, Table 3 reveals only modest speedups (less than 2x) during training. This is likely because other parts of the network dominate the training iteration time. It would be helpful to report the time specifically required for the output layer computation.  
- General Discussion:  
It would be helpful if the survey of prior work in Section 2.2 explicitly connected those methods to the desiderata outlined in the introduction (e.g., clarifying which criteria each method satisfies).  
Some qualitative analysis of the binary code prediction's strengths and weaknesses would be valuable. For instance, what types of errors does the system make, and how do these compare to errors made by standard softmax, hierarchical softmax, or differentiated softmax?  
- Low-Level Comments:  
1. Equation 5: Clarify the distinction between `id(w) = id(w')` and `w = w'`.  
2. Line 335: Consider defining "GPGPU" for clarity.  
3. Table 3: Highlight the best BLEU scores in bold for better readability.  
4. Equation 15: Remind readers that `q` is defined in Equation 6 and that `b` is a function of `w`. The notation can be confusing since `w` and `h` appear on the left-hand side but are absent on the right-hand side, and the roles of `b` and `q` may not be immediately clear.
