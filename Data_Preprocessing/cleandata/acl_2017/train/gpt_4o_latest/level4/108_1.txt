- Strengths: The paper is generally well-written, with only a few areas requiring improvement as noted below. The problem addressed in the paper is meaningful. The proposed approach, a multigraph-based model, is a variant of MH. The empirical results are robust and demonstrate promise.
- Weaknesses: Several areas require further clarification.
1. In Section 3, while you provide a description of the previous model, MH, it is important to explicitly highlight the limitations or issues with MH that motivated the development of your new model.
2. In Section 4, the rationale for introducing separators is unclear. What additional information do they convey beyond T/I/O?
3. Section 5.1 does not seem to offer any compelling explanation for why the proposed model outperforms MH.
4. The discussion in Section 5.2 is overly abstract, making it difficult to understand the insights into why the new model is superior to MH. Could you include concrete examples of spurious structures to illustrate your points?
- General Discussion: The paper introduces a novel model for detecting overlapping entities in text. The proposed model demonstrates improvements over the previous state-of-the-art, MH, on several benchmark datasets. However, the reasons and mechanisms behind the improved performance remain unclear and should be better articulated.
