- Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
It is structured clearly and effectively addresses the research questions through a series of well-designed experiments.
- Weaknesses:  
The work demonstrates limited novelty. The "first sentence" heuristic has been a part of the summarization literature for a long time. This study essentially adapts this heuristic (in a refined form) to the context of keyword extraction. While this does not imply that the work lacks merit, it cannot be considered highly innovative.  
The paper does not incorporate state-of-the-art or very recent methods. The evaluation of the system against state-of-the-art approaches relies primarily on strong baselines. Although the experiment successfully answers the question of whether the system outperforms these baselines, it does not convincingly demonstrate superiority over the current state-of-the-art. This limitation somewhat diminishes the overall impact of the work.
- General Discussion:  
In general, the paper is of good quality, and I recommend it for publication and presentation.  
However, I suggest that the authors better position their work and the system's performance in relation to:
