- General Discussion:  
This paper introduces a straightforward formula for assessing the readability of Vietnamese text. By leveraging features such as word count and sentence length, the authors train a basic regression model to estimate document readability.  
A key limitation of the paper is its lack of technical novelty. While earlier work on readability assessment often relied on simple methods like the one proposed here, more recent advancements employ sophisticated techniques, such as those based on language models (e.g., [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mx223/readabilitybea2016.pdf](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mx223/readabilitybea2016.pdf), [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/pubs/ITL-readability-invited-article-v10-camera.pdf](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/pubs/ITL-readability-invited-article-v10-camera.pdf)). Including a comparison with such state-of-the-art methods would enhance the paper's contribution, particularly if the proposed simple approach demonstrates competitive performance against more complex models.  
Additionally, baseline experiments using established readability metrics like SMOG and Gunning Fog Index should be included, along with evaluations on other Vietnamese metrics and datasets referenced by the authors.  
Another issue lies in the coarse classification scheme employed by the authors, which categorizes documents into broad labels such as "easy," "medium," and "hard." This approach lacks the granularity of traditional readability indices, which often map content to specific grade levels. This limitation diminishes the practical utility of the proposed metric. Furthermore, the authors might consider using a classifier instead of a regression model for this task.  
Overall, the work appears underdeveloped and exhibits several significant weaknesses, making it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. The authors are encouraged to address the feedback provided to strengthen their submission.  
Lastly, the paper contains numerous grammatical errors, which should be corrected in any future iterations.
