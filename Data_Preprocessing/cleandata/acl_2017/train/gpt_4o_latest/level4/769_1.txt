This paper introduces a method for constructing dialogue agents engaged in symmetric collaborative tasks, where agents must strategically communicate to achieve a shared objective.
I find this paper interesting and appreciate its focus on exploring data-driven techniques for dialogue management. However, I am concerned that the proposed approach is not inherently specific to symmetric collaborative tasks but rather applies to tasks that can be modeled as graph operations, such as identifying intersections between objects known to both participants.
In Section 2.1, the authors describe the symmetric collaborative dialogue setting. However, similar dialogue settings have been previously explored, such as in Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs' work (Cognition, 1986) and Walker's furniture layout task (Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 2000).
On line 229, the authors claim that the domain is too complex for slot-value semantics. However, since their domain is structured around attribute-value pairs, it could potentially be represented using a semantic framework based on attribute-value pairs, such as first-order logic.
Section 3.2 is challenging to follow. The authors frequently reference Figure 2, but I did not find this example particularly clarifying. For instance, in Section 3.1, it is unclear at what point in the dialogue the example corresponds. Does it occur after the utterance "anyone went to Columbia?"
