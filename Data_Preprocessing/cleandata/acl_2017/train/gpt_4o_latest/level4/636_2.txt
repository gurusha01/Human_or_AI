- Strengths:  
The primary strength highlighted by the paper is its claimed speed advantage while maintaining the same level of accuracy.  
- Weaknesses:  
The explanation of the proposed approach requires significant improvement. Sections 3 and 4 need to be much more precise, particularly in defining concepts, detailing the architecture, and explaining the parameterization. Section 4.1, along with the parameter tying mechanism employed, must be articulated with absolute clarity, as it represents one of the core contributions of the work.  
Additional experiments are necessary to substantiate the substantial speed improvements claimed by the authors. While the results in Table 2 are promising, they are not particularly groundbreaking. A speed-up of 4-6X, while beneficial, is not especially transformative.  
- General Discussion:  
The term "Viterbi prediction" is unclear and not a well-established concept. Readers might infer its meaning, but a more precise and descriptive phrasing is needed.  
Additionally, there is a typo in the citation of Weiss et al., 2015.
