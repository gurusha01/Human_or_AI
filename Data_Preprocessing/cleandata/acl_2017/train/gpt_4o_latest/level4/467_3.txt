The paper introduces a self-learning framework for the generation of bilingual word embeddings. The approach utilizes two pre-trained embeddings (one for the source language and one for the target language) along with a seed lexicon. At each iteration of the mapping process, a new bilingual lexicon is generated. This updated lexicon is then used in the subsequent iteration to refine the mapping. The process continues iteratively until a predefined convergence criterion is satisfied.
A notable strength of the proposed method is that the seed lexicon is directly incorporated into the learning process as a binary matrix. The self-learning framework subsequently addresses a global optimization problem where the seed lexicon is no longer explicitly involved. Its primary function is to initialize the mapping between the two embeddings, thereby ensuring convergence. Furthermore, the initial seed lexicon can be relatively small, requiring only 25 word pairs.
The small size of the seed lexicon is particularly advantageous for mapping between languages with limited bilingual lexicon resources.
It would be beneficial to assess the framework's performance in relation to the quality of the two word embeddings. In scenarios where one or both languages have limited linguistic resources, the word embeddings for these languages may vary significantly in terms of structure and coverage. This scenario could potentially be simulated using existing data by training the respective word embeddings on distinct subcorpora for each language.
