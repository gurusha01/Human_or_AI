- Strengths:  
The concept of leveraging morphological compositionality to guide segmentation decisions is highly promising.  
The motivation for the study is articulated clearly.  
The paper is well-organized and follows a logical structure.  
- Weaknesses:  
Certain aspects remain ambiguous:  
  -- The treatment of rule ambiguity is not sufficiently explained (e.g., the "null->er" examples discussed in the general discussion).  
  -- The inference stage appears to lack optimization.  
  -- The approach is constrained to known words only.  
- General Discussion:  
This paper introduces a semantic-aware approach to morphological segmentation, which relies on a set of straightforward morphological composition rules, primarily structured as 'stem plus suffix or prefix.' The approach is both plausible and supported by a clear and well-reasoned motivation.  
The method employs the concept of vector differences to calculate a semantic confidence score for proposed transformational rules. Prior research has demonstrated that morpho-syntactic relationships can be effectively captured using word analogies or vector differences. However, it has also been shown that this performance significantly declines in the context of derivational morphology, which is less regular than inflectional morphology (see Gladkova, 2016; Vylomova, 2016).  
While the search space in the inference stage is computationally manageable, it still appears to be suboptimal. For instance, to identify a rule like "sky->skies," the system must first search through the entire R_add set and potentially a large set of other possible substitutions. Additionally, the method is restricted to known words for which applicable rules exist.  
The handling of transformations that are orthographically identical but semantically distinct is unclear. For example, the "-er" suffix can serve different functions: with verbs, it forms agentive nouns (e.g., "play->player"), while with adjectives, it creates comparative forms (e.g., "old->older"). Similarly, consider "big->bigger" versus "dig->digger." Furthermore, derivational morphology often exhibits significant irregularity. The same suffix may serve multiple roles, such as "-er" indicating patiental meanings (e.g., "looker"). It is unclear whether such cases are grouped into a single rule or cluster.  
Finally, the paper does not explore how varying the similarity threshold or measure might influence performance.
