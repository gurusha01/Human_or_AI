- Strengths:  
  * Comprehensive creation of evaluation data and a well-designed evaluation framework.  
  * Broad spectrum of compared techniques, ranging from baseline to advanced methods.  
- Weaknesses:  
  * Lacks detailed analysis beyond the aggregate evaluation results.  
- General Discussion:  
This paper conducts a comparative study of several techniques for robust HPSG parsing.  
Given that the primary contribution of this work lies in its empirical evaluation rather than the introduction of a novel parsing method, I recommend providing a more detailed analysis of the results presented in Tables 1 and 2. For instance, including representative example sentences and brief descriptions of their analyses could help illustrate how the compared methods differ in their behavior.  
Additionally, please include EDM precision and recall metrics in Table 2. While the EDM F1 score reflects a combination of factors such as (overall and partial) coverage, parse ranking, and search efficiency, adding EDM recall would complement the overall coverage figures in Table 1 and provide a clearer picture of the results.  
- Minor Comment:  
  - Is 'pacnv+ut' in Tables 1 and 2 equivalent to 'pacnv' as described in Section 3.4.3?
