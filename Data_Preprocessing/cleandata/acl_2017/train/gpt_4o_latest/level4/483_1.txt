- Strengths:
This work represents the first application of a neural network-based approach to argumentation mining. The authors employ a Pointer Network (PN) model combined with multi-task learning, achieving superior performance compared to prior methods in experiments conducted on two datasets.
- Weaknesses:
The approach primarily applies PN to the domain of argumentation mining. While the integration of PN with multi-task learning is novel for this task, the level of innovation may not meet the standards for an ACL long paper. Additionally, the absence of qualitative and error analyses is a significant drawback.
- General Discussion:
Apart from the aforementioned weaknesses, the justification for using PN is not sufficiently compelling. Although three characteristics of PN are outlined in lines 138-143, these do not provide a strong rationale for preferring PN over bi-directional LSTMs with attention mechanisms. The authors should elaborate on the specific problems addressed by PN and evaluate in the experiments how effectively these issues are resolved.
Figures 2 and 3 are challenging to interpret. For instance, what do the self-link to D1 and the links from D2 to E1 and from D3/D4 to E2 represent? These appear to be outputs from the decoder rather than actual links. Furthermore, the decoder LSTM in these figures lacks an input from e_j, which contradicts Equation (3). In addition, the abbreviation "FC" in Figure 3 is not explained.
Equation (8) is unclear. The method for calculating the probability of each component type involves computing the probability of E_i, which seems inconsistent.
In the experimental section, it is unclear why only "PN," which is not a joint model, was evaluated on the microtext corpus.
It is also ambiguous whether the BLSTM model was trained using the joint-task objective.
The paper does not sufficiently address prior studies on discourse parsing that utilize attention mechanisms. The authors should clarify how their work differs from these studies.
- Minor Issues:
l.128: "should related" → "should be related"  
l.215: "(2015)" is improperly formatted and appears to be floating.  
l.706: "it able" → "it is able"  
After reviewing the authors' responses, I found their explanations convincing and have subsequently raised my recommendation score. I strongly encourage the authors to include discussions on improved examples generated by PN and provide detailed feature ablation analyses.
