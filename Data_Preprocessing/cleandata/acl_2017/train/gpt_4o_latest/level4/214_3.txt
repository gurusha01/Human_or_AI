- Strengths:  
The macro-level discourse structure serves as a valuable addition to micro-level frameworks such as RST. Additionally, the release of the dataset has the potential to benefit a variety of NLP applications.
- Weaknesses:  
1. Including more comparisons with the existing CDTB would enhance the paper.  
2. While the "primary-secondary" relationship is frequently referenced, its distinction from nuclearity remains vague and lacks a precise definition.  
3. The experimental methodology is insufficiently detailed in the paper.  
- General Discussion:
