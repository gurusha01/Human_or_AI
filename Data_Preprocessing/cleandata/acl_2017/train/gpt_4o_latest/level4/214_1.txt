This paper introduces a macro discourse structure scheme. The authors conducted a pilot study by annotating a corpus of 97 news articles from the Chinese Treebank 8.0. Subsequently, they developed a model to identify primary-secondary relations and five discourse relations (joint, elaboration, sequence, background, cause-result) within this corpus.
The paper suffers from poor writing quality, making it difficult to follow. I strongly recommend that the authors engage a native English speaker to thoroughly proofread the manuscript. Regarding the content, I have several concerns:
1. Clarity and Logical Consistency:
   - The logic of the paper is unclear and lacks justification. For instance, what do the authors mean by "logical semantics" and "pragmatic function" (lines 115-116)? These terms should be properly defined.
   - Regarding the macro discourse structure, there are inconsistencies in the definitions of macro and micro structures. Figure 4 illustrates the integration of macro and micro discourse structures, where the micro structure is confined to within paragraphs. However, in Figure 6, the micro discourse structure spans beyond paragraph boundaries and captures discourse relations across paragraphs. This depiction in Figure 6 closely resembles the macro structure proposed in Figure 5 and appears to be genre-independent. Why, then, can't the structure in Figure 6 be used instead? What advantages does the macro discourse structure in Figure 5 offer? To me, it seems genre-dependent and does not provide additional information compared to Figure 6.
   - Additionally, why are sentences 6 and 15 missing in Figure 5? Are they excluded because they are subtitles? If so, why is sentence 12, which is also a subtitle, included?
2. Corpus Construction (Section 4):
   - The description of corpus construction is insufficiently detailed. Without concrete examples, it is difficult to understand terms such as "discourse topic, lead, abstract, paragraph topics" (lines 627-629). Furthermore, while the authors claim to "explore the relationships between micro-structure and macro-structure," I could not locate the corresponding analysis in the paper.
   - Table 4 discusses the agreement study, but several issues remain unclear. The authors state, "It's very difficult to achieve high consistency because the judgments of relation and structure are very subjective. Our measurement data is only taken on the layer of leaf nodes." First, what are the "leaf nodes"? At the macro level, they appear to be paragraphs, while at the micro level, they are EDUs. Shouldn't the agreement study be reported separately for macro and micro levels? Second, the authors seem to have used only a subset of the data for the agreement study. This subset does not adequately reflect the overall quality of the corpus, as high agreement on leaf node annotations does not guarantee high agreement on non-leaf node annotations.
   - Additional unclear points in Section 4:
     - Table 4: The terms "discourse structure" and "discourse relation" are ambiguous. What specifically do these refer to?
     - Table 5: The phrase "amount of macro discourse relations" is also unclear. Does this refer to discourse relations between paragraphs? If so, why do similar relations appear both between sentences and between paragraphs in Figure 6?
3. Experiments:
   - Given that the primary goal of the paper is to provide a richer discourse structure at both macro and micro levels, I expected to see some preliminary results demonstrating this. However, the current experimental setup is unconvincing:
     - There are no strong baseline comparisons.
     - The features used in the model are neither clearly described nor adequately motivated.
     - It is unclear why only a subset of discourse relations from Table 6 was selected for the discourse relation recognition experiment.
Overall, I believe the paper requires substantial revisions and is not yet ready for acceptance.
