This paper introduces the first parser for UCCA, a recently proposed semantic representation framework. The parser employs a transition-based approach with a novel transition set specifically designed to handle challenging discontinuous structures and reentrancies. Experimental results demonstrate the parser's effectiveness and highlight the difficulty of constructing these representations using existing parsing methodologies.
The paper is well-written and addresses an important problem in the field. The proposed transition system is well-justified and appears to be highly effective for the task. The authors conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation, exploring variations in the base parser's classifier (e.g., neural networks, linear models) and comparing the parser's performance to the best possible outputs from other, less expressive parsing frameworks. This work establishes a strong benchmark for UCCA parsing and will likely be of interest to researchers working on other expressive semantic representations or complex transition systems.
One open question pertains to the extent to which this new parser generalizes over other transition-based parsers for frameworks like AMR or SDP. Could the UCCA transition scheme be adapted for these cases (potentially with heuristic alignments), and would it naturally simplify by avoiding the use of extra transitions for non-terminals? Would it reduce to an existing algorithm or potentially outperform it? While addressing this question is not essential, as the paper is already very strong, exploring it could enhance understanding and inspire future research directions.
