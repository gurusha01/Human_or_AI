- Strengths: This study extends the use of readability scores to a new language and successfully establishes a well-validated readability metric tailored for Vietnamese.
- Weaknesses: The primary shortcomings, particularly in the context of ACL, are that 1) readability scores have limited relevance to the core interests of computational linguistics. While they hold some value in educational and public communication domains, their contribution to advancing computational linguistics remains modest. A secondary issue lies in the writing quality: the paper contains several minor grammatical mistakes. Additionally, while the discussion contrasts the performance of the PDS1 and PDW1 features from prior work, it does not clearly demonstrate how the earlier readability measures fall short in practical terms compared to the proposed approach.
- General Discussion: The paper's potential for acceptance would be significantly enhanced if the authors released the corpus and, more importantly, the associated labels. Such a release would broaden its utility beyond the development of scalar readability metrics, enabling, for instance, research into the application of more advanced feature-selection techniques.
