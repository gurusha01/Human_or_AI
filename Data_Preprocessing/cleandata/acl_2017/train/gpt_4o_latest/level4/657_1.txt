- Strengths: This paper partially tackles the challenge of interpreting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models trained to classify written justifications in values-affirmation essays. The research question is undoubtedly intriguing. To address this, the authors propose leveraging methodologies commonly employed in experimental psychology. Additionally, the study aims to validate sociological assumptions through its findings.
- Weaknesses: A significant shortcoming of the paper is the lack of clarity regarding its objectives. One overarching and ambitious goal presented by the authors is to utilize experimental psychology techniques to interpret LSTMs. However, the paper does not provide a clear methodology for achieving this. Conversely, if the primary aim is to validate sociological assumptions, this should involve analyzing the relationship between gender markers and written justifications independently of any model. The assertion that "expected gender differences (are) a function of theories of gendered self-construal" remains unsubstantiated by the study.
- General Discussion: While the study is engaging, it is hindered by several weak arguments. First, the observation that the probability shift of a token in the LSTM network correlates with the corresponding SVM coefficients does not constitute evidence that "these probabilities are valid ways to interpret the model." Specifically, (a) SVM coefficients only provide a partial view of the decision function of an SVM classifier, and (b) a coefficient offering interpretability in one model does not necessarily imply that a correlated coefficient explains another model. Moreover, the correlation coefficients are relatively low, which weakens the argument being made.
As previously noted, another issue is the authors' apparent indecision between two distinct goals. It would be more effective to clearly define and focus on a single objective. Regarding the connection to experimental psychology, which is ostensibly a key component of the paper, it would be beneficial to elaborate on and clarify the multilevel Bayesian models used to quantify gender-based self-construal assumptions. Without additional details, it is challenging to evaluate whether the methodology is appropriate. Since this aspect is central to the paper's approach, it warrants further elaboration.
