- Strengths:
This study addresses a highly practical issue: automated short answer scoring (SAS), with a specific focus on Japanese—a language that has received significantly less attention compared to English in the context of SAS research.
- Weaknesses:
The paper primarily resembles a system description and lacks depth in terms of experimental analysis or novel insights. The authors demonstrate limited awareness of recent advancements in related work (particularly for English SAS), both in methodology and evaluation. For instance, the following references are notably absent:

Additionally, a recent Kaggle competition introduced several methodologies that could have been relevant:

- General Discussion:
To align with ACL standards, the paper would benefit from more comprehensive experiments, such as feature ablation studies and algorithm comparisons, to justify the design choices of the proposed system. Furthermore, a qualitative evaluation—such as a user study—could have demonstrated how the mixed-initiative user interface features contributed to improved scoring outcomes. In its current form, the work feels incomplete and lacks actionable contributions in terms of new methodologies or insights.
Finally, for ordinal human scoring tasks, metrics like Pearson/Spearman correlation and kappa scores are generally considered more suitable than accuracy.
