This paper explores the use of distributional vectors of meaning in tasks requiring the identification of semantic relations, akin to the analogical reasoning task proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013). For instance, given an analogy like "X is for France what London is for the UK," X can be approximated through the vector arithmetic operation London - UK + France. The authors contend that this straightforward approach is limited to capturing a narrow subset of analogies and propose a new measure designed to identify a broader spectrum of relations more effectively.
I find the notion of a single vector space model being capable of representing a variety of semantic relationships and analogies to be quite ambitious and, frankly, implausible. As the authors themselves acknowledge, prior research suggests otherwise. The underlying issue stems from the distributional hypothesis (i.e., words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings), which inherently restricts the expressive power of such models. For example, while words like "big" and "small" are opposites in meaning, they are treated as semantically similar in vector space due to their contextual overlap. Consequently, I struggle to see the relevance of the example in Figure 1 to the fundamental nature of vector spacesâ€”or any semantic model, for that matter. While there is a clear analogy between "man-king" and "woman-queen," expecting a word space to capture "has-a" relationships, such as "owl-has-claws" and "hospital-has-walls," seems conceptually unfounded.
The primary motivation for the proposed measure (which involves cross-comparison between word vectors and their context vectors) is not adequately articulated. Furthermore, the measure is evaluated on the relation categories from the SemEval 2010 task, yielding underwhelming results. In nearly all cases, a simple baseline that considers only partial similarities between word pairs achieves strong performance, with differences from the proposed model that appear statistically insignificant. From both methodological and experimental standpoints, the paper has notable shortcomings. In its current state, it feels more like work in progress, and I am therefore inclined to recommend against its acceptance at ACL.

AUTHORS' RESPONSE  
================  
Thank you for your clarifications. However, I remain unconvinced by the concept of a metric or vector space that attempts to capture both semantic and relational similarity. Additionally, I believe the experimental evidence provided is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of your method. I agree with one of the other reviewers that this work would be better suited for submission as a short paper.
