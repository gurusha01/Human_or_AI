This paper builds on prior work that frames dialogue generation as a sequence-to-sequence problem, where the preceding N-1 utterances (the 'dialogue context') are encoded into a context vector (potentially augmented with hand-crafted features) and then decoded into a response representing the Nth turn in the dialogue. Existing models in this paradigm often suffer from issues such as limited diversity, lack of specificity, and weak local coherence when trained on large, multi-topic dialogue datasets (e.g., Cornell, Opensubtitles, Ubuntu). Instead of addressing response diversity at the decoder level—such as through word-by-word beam search (which has been shown to perform poorly, often compromising grammar and sequence validity) or alternative objective functions (e.g., as in Li et al.)—the authors propose introducing a latent variable, z, over which a probability distribution is learned within the network. During prediction, after encoding utterances 1 to k, a context z is sampled, and the decoder generates a response greedily. The evaluation demonstrates modest improvements in BLEU scores compared to a baseline seq2seq model that does not incorporate a learned probability distribution over contexts or sampling.
From a technical perspective, the paper is impressive, particularly in its application of deep learning techniques—specifically conditioned variational autoencoders—to the challenging task of response generation. The authors also employ Information Retrieval methods to obtain multiple reference responses, which is an interesting addition.
I have several conceptual and technical comments regarding the introduction, the model architecture, and the evaluation, which I outline below:
Comments on the Introduction and Motivations
The authors appear to have an incomplete understanding of the historical and theoretical foundations of this field, as well as its practical applications.
1. "[The dialogue manager] typically takes a new utterance and the dialogue context as input, and generates discourse-level decisions."  
   This statement is inaccurate. Traditionally, the dialogue manager's role is to select actions (dialogue acts) based on the dialogue context. The selected action is then passed to a separate generation module for realization. Dialogue management is typically employed in task-based systems that are goal-driven, where the dialogue manager aims to choose actions that optimize task completion (e.g., booking a restaurant) in as few steps as possible. For a comprehensive overview of this literature, see works by Lemon & Pietquin (2012), Rieser, Keizer, and colleagues, as well as publications by Steve Young, Milica Gasic, and their collaborators on Reinforcement Learning and MDP models for task-based dialogue systems.
2. Distinction Between Task-Based and Open-Domain Dialogue Systems  
   The authors need to clearly differentiate between task-based, goal-oriented dialogue systems and chatbots/social bots. The latter are often little more than sophisticated language models (though see Wen et al., 2016). The requirements for these two types of systems are fundamentally different: task-based systems aim to achieve specific goals, whereas chatbots are primarily designed to engage users. The data-driven methods used to build these systems also differ significantly.
3. On the Concept of "Open-Domain" Conversation  
   The term "open-domain conversation" is problematic. Conversations always occur within the context of some activity or goal, which shapes their structure and coherence. Coherence is inherently activity- and context-specific. Humans themselves are not capable of truly open-domain dialogue; when faced with unfamiliar conversational topics or genres, they often produce incoherent or inappropriate responses. This fundamental issue is exacerbated when systems attempt to train a single model on extremely diverse datasets (e.g., movie subtitles), resulting in outputs that are either overly generic or grammatically well-formed but semantically shallow.
Comments on the Model Architecture
The authors propose inducing a distribution over possible contexts, sampling from this, and using the decoder to generate responses greedily. While this approach is novel, it appears counterintuitive and inconsistent with findings from the Linguistic and Psycholinguistic literature on dialogue. Research in these fields suggests that humans resolve potential misunderstandings and establish shared context locally and incrementally, ensuring minimal uncertainty about the current conversational context at any given point. The observed diversity in dialogue stems from variations in conversational goals, topics, and contexts, rather than uncertainty in the immediate context. 
Placing the burden of explaining diversity and coherence on surface-level linguistic contexts seems misguided. While uncertainty can arise from mismatches in vocabulary, grammar, or conceptual understanding, these factors likely account for only a small portion of the variation in follow-up responses. For task-based dialogue systems, the primary challenge lies in capturing synonymy of contexts—i.e., dialogues that differ superficially but lead to similar contexts. This can be achieved through interactional and syntactic equivalence relations or domain-specific synonymy (e.g., "What is your destination?" = "Where would you like to go?" in a flight-booking domain). Relevant work includes Bordes & Weston (2016) and Kalatzis, Eshghi & Lemon (2016), the latter of which employs a grammar-based approach to cluster semantically similar dialogues.
Comments on the Evaluation
The authors aim to demonstrate that their model generates more coherent and diverse responses. However, the evaluation methodology, while interesting, primarily addresses coherence and not diversity, contrary to the claims in Section 5.2. The precision and recall metrics measure the distance between ground truth and generated utterances but do not assess the diversity of the generated responses themselves. For diversity, metrics such as the number of distinct n-grams in generated responses (as used by Li et al.) would be more appropriate.
Additionally, the reported BLEU score improvements are marginal and may not be meaningful. While the qualitative examples provided suggest increased diversity and contentfulness, it is unclear how representative these examples are of the model's overall performance.
Finally, the paper would have been stronger if the authors had compared their results with alternative approaches, such as those by Li et al. (2015), which promote diversity through different objective functions. Despite referencing this work, the authors neither characterize it adequately nor provide a direct comparison.
