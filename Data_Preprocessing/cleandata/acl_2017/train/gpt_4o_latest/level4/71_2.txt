Strengths:
- Exceptionally impressive resource.
- Fully automated system, making it particularly well-suited for cross-lingual learning across a wide range of languages.
- Strong evaluation conducted both within and beyond Wikipedia, with meaningful comparisons to prior works that relied on manual resources.
Weaknesses:
- The paper's clarity could be improved.
General Discussion:
This paper introduces "a simple yet effective framework that can extract names from 282 languages and link them to an English KB." A key strength of the system is its fully automatic nature, which is especially significant given the challenge of working across such a vast number of languages. Despite the inherent complexity of this task, the authors successfully contextualize their results and provide thorough evaluations both within and outside of Wikipedia. I particularly appreciate how the authors situate their work in relation to previous studies that employed manual resources. This demonstrates good scientific practice, and I commend the authors for not shying away from such comparisons, even if it might risk unfavorable perceptions.
That said, the clarity of the paper could be improved. Writing this paper is undoubtedly challenging due to the complexity of the process and the large-scale resource it produces. However, the current organization of the paper is suboptimal, and at times, it reads like an extensive list of details. I encourage the authors to focus on improving the structure of the paper. For instance, a clearer problem definition and stronger high-level motivations at the outset would be beneficial. Additionally, the motivations, decisions, and contributions in each section could be presented more effectively. While I acknowledge the effort the authors have already put into this, I believe further refinement is achievable. This is an important paper, and it deserves a more polished and accessible presentation.
Overall, I find this paper to be highly valuable and believe it provides a significant resource. I would be pleased to see this paper presented at ACL 2017.
