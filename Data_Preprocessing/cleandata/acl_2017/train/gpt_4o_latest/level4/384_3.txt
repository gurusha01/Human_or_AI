Paraphrased Review
Strengths  
This paper introduces an innovative method for modeling the compositional structure of complex categories. The approach preserves a set-theoretic interpretation for common nouns and modifiers while simultaneously enabling a distributional interpretation of head modification. The methodology is well-justified, clearly articulated, and supported by experiments that demonstrate how the proposed decomposed representation enhances the coverage of Hearst-pattern-derived IsA relations, which serve as its training basis.
Weaknesses  
The experimental results are promising, but it would be beneficial to include ROC curves for the proposed method in isolation, rather than only in combination with Hearst patterns. While Table 5 indicates that ModsI improves coverage at the expense of precision, and Figure 2 shows that ModsI achieves comparable precision to Hearst patterns in the high-precision region, these do not provide insight into whether the model can effectively differentiate between high- and low-precision regions. ROC curves specific to the standalone model would address this gap, but they are currently only presented for the ensembled models.
Additionally, Equation 7 appears to include an unnecessary $w$, as $w$ is already defined as $D(\rangle e, p, o \langle)$.
Discussion  
In summary, this paper presents a compelling idea that is well-explained and thoroughly evaluated. I believe it would make a valuable contribution to ACL.
