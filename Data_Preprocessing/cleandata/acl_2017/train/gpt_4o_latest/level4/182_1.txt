Dear Authors,
Thank you for addressing our review comments, which have clarified several detailed questions. I also appreciate your commitment to publishing the code, as it will be highly beneficial to the broader research community.
In light of this, I have raised my overall score to 4.
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written.
- It includes extensive experiments.
- The results are solid.
Weaknesses:
- The work is not groundbreaking and primarily applies existing technologies.
- The code is not yet available.
- The results align with expectations and do not offer significant surprises.
General Discussion:
- Why did you not utilize established audio features such as MFCCs?
Minor Details:
- L155 and other instances: "a LSTM" should be "an LSTM."
- L160, L216, and other locations: Why are there hyphens (-) following the text?
- L205: The explanation of convolution is unclear.
- Table 1 should be moved earlier, ideally to page 2, as it is already cited.
- L263: Is 3D-CNN a standard approach in video processing? Are there alternatives?
- L375, 378: The caret (^) should likely be positioned above the "y."
- L380: "to check overfitting"—did you mean "to avoid overfitting"?
- L403, 408, etc.: Consider putting names in quotation marks or italicizing them for better readability.
- L420: "a SVM" should be "an SVM."
- L448: "Output ... are"—this is incorrect. Use either "Outputs" or "is."
- L489: There is an unnecessary whitespace after "layer."
- L516, 519: The word "concatenation" should not start a new line.
- L567: Why is the exact number of persons unknown?
- L626: Remove the comma after "Since."
- L651: "doesnt" should be "does not."
- L777: Insert "hand, the" after "other."
- References require cleanup: L823 has unnecessary whitespace; L831 needs "Munich"; L860—what does "ACL(1)" refer to?; L888 has an extra closing parenthesis; L894 should include "Volume"; L951 has superfluous new lines; L956—properly indent "Linguistics."
