- Strengths:  
The paper introduces a kernel-based approach that effectively identifies high-order patterns, enabling differentiation between various types of rumors by analyzing the similarities in their propagation tree structures.
- Weaknesses:  
The mathematical explanations in Section 4 are occasionally unclear.
- General Discussion:  
The authors present a propagation tree kernel, a kernel-based technique designed to capture high-order patterns for distinguishing rumor types by assessing the similarities in their propagation tree structures. This method demonstrates faster and more accurate rumor detection compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.
The dataset should be made publicly accessible for research purposes.
The manuscript contains typographical errors that need correction (e.g., lines 326/327: "any subgraph which have" → "has"; line 472: "TPK" → "PTK"; line 644: "Table 2 show+s"), missing details that require inclusion (e.g., line 875: "where was it published?"), and inconsistent formatting (e.g., lines 822 vs. 897). Additionally, Figure 5 appears too small and could benefit from resizing for better readability.
