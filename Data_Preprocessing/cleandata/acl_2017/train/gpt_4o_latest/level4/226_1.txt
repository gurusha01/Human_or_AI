- Strengths:
1) The paper introduces a semi-automated framework (human generation → automatic expansion → human post-editing) designed to construct a dataset for evaluating compositional semantic similarity.
2) The framework is applied to develop a Polish compositional semantic similarity evaluation dataset, which holds potential for advancing research on Polish compositional semantic models.
- Weaknesses:
1) The framework has been tested exclusively on a single language, raising concerns about its generalizability. Specifically, its reliance on a dependency parser could limit its applicability in languages where such parsers are unavailable or perform poorly.
2) The paper does not specify the number of sentence pairs edited by lead judges, making it difficult to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the automatic expansion process. Additionally, the fact that over 3% (369 out of 10,000) of the post-edited pairs required further corrections is concerning.
3) The paper contains several grammatical errors. Below are examples, though this is not an exhaustive list:
   - Lines 210, 212, 213: "on a displayed image/picture" → "in a displayed image/picture"
   - Line 428: "Similarly as in" → "Similar to"
   A thorough proofreading of the paper is recommended.
