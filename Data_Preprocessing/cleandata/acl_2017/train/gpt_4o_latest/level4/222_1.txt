- Strengths:
The authors effectively introduce the task by using illustrative examples and clearly outlining the contributions of the paper.  
The Related Works section thoroughly reviews the state of the art, while also highlighting both the similarities and differences between prior works and the proposed method.  
The method is presented in a highly comprehensible manner, with a clear separation between the tagging scheme and the end-to-end model.  
Another notable strength of this work is the inclusion of strong baselines, which allow for a robust comparison between the proposed methods and several classical triplet extraction methods.  
Finally, the inclusion of examples from the dataset to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the methods is particularly valuable. These outputs effectively complement the explanation of the tagging scheme and the evaluation of triplets.  
- Weaknesses:
A key contribution of this paper is the new tagging scheme described in Section 3.1. However, there are already established schemes for NER and RE, such as IO, BIO, and BILOU.  
Did the authors conduct any experiments using alternative tagging schemes for this method?  
Regarding the dataset, on line 14 of page 5, the authors mention the number of relations (24), but they do not specify the number or types of named entities.  
In Section 4.1, the evaluation criteria for triplets are introduced. Were these criteria derived from prior work? It appears that the entity identification stage is incomplete if only the head of the entity is considered.  
For example S3 in Table 3, was the output of the LSTM-LSTM-Bias model considered correct? The text indicates that the relation role is incorrect, but it is unclear whether the relation role is factored into the evaluation.  
- General Discussion:
This paper introduces a novel tagging scheme and explores end-to-end models for the joint extraction of entities and relations.  
The article is well-structured and clearly written, which facilitates a strong understanding of the proposed method.
