- Strengths:
The manuscript is exceptionally clear and well-articulated. It introduces an innovative method for abstractive sentence summarization, specifically focusing on sentence compression that does not restrict the output to only include words present in the input.
- The paper provides an excellent comparison against a wide range of baseline systems.
- The related work section is comprehensive and well-detailed.
- Weaknesses:
The critiques are relatively minor:
- It would be preferable to include ROUGE F-Score results for all three datasets. While the rationale for reporting recall on one dataset is understandable (since the summaries are of uniform length), it would be beneficial to present both recall and F-Score in such cases.
- The Related Work section would be more effective if placed earlier in the paper.
- The paper would benefit from additional discussion regarding the broader context of the work, such as the intended applications or the necessity of these summaries/compressions.
- General Discussion:
- While ROUGE metrics are suitable for this study, future work should consider incorporating human evaluations of the compressions, focusing on aspects like readability and coherence, or conducting extrinsic evaluations.
