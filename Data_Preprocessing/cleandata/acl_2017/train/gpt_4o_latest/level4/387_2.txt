- Strengths:
(1) The paper introduces a deep CNN framework designed to extract and integrate cognitive features with textual features for the tasks of sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.
(2) The proposed approach is both novel and engaging.
- Weaknesses:
(1) Replicability poses a significant challenge, as researchers may find it difficult to reproduce the system or method due to the unavailability of the data required for feature extraction.
- General Discussion:
Overall, the paper is well-structured and clearly written. The experiments are thoughtfully conducted, providing meaningful comparisons with prior work, and the analysis is sound. Below are some additional comments:
(1) Is the proposed model equally effective for both sarcastic and non-sarcastic utterances? The authors should elaborate further to provide additional insights.
(2) What specific advantages do the eye-movement data offer for sarcastic/non-sarcastic sentiment classification that textual features alone cannot provide? The authors are encouraged to include more detailed explanations.
