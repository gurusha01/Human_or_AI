This paper introduces an innovative framework for modeling symmetric collaborative dialogue agents by dynamically updating knowledge graph embeddings. The task is relatively straightforward: two dialogue agents (bot-bot, human-human, or human-bot) engage in conversations about their mutual friends. Each participant in the dialogue has access to an underlying knowledge base and an associated knowledge graph. The embeddings of items in the knowledge graph are updated dynamically during the interaction and are subsequently used to generate responses.
- Strengths: The proposed model is highly novel and applicable to both goal-directed and open-ended dialogue scenarios. The evaluation metrics provided demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed approach.
- Weaknesses: The mathematical details regarding the computation of embeddings are not explained with sufficient clarity. Although the authors have conducted extensive evaluations, they have not compared their system against a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dialogue manager, which represents the current state-of-the-art for goal-oriented systems. Additionally, the scalability of the approach to more complex problems remains unclear. While the authors claim the knowledge base consists of 3,000 items, the actual operational scope for the agent appears to be closer to 10, as inferred from Table 6.
- General Discussion: In summary, this is a strong paper. However, the theoretical aspects of the work could have been presented more rigorously. With improved clarity in this regard, I would recommend accepting this paper.
