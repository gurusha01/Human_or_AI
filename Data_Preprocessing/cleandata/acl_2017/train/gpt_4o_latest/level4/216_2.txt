Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and well-structured.  
- It integrates topical segmentation into copula LDA, enabling the joint learning of segmentation and latent topics.  
- The experimental setup is thoughtfully designed and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method across multiple metrics and datasets.  
Weaknesses:
- Lacks comparison with more advanced segmentation methods.  
General Discussion:
This paper introduces segLDAcop, a joint latent model that combines topics and segments. The model builds upon copula LDA by incorporating topical segmentation into its framework. The authors conduct extensive experiments using diverse datasets and evaluation metrics to validate the effectiveness of their approach.  
The manuscript is well-written and well-organized. The proposed model represents a logical extension of copula LDA, enabling the joint inference of segmentations and topics. The experimental design is robust, and the results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.  
However, one limitation is that the authors rely on simple NP segmentation and single-word segmentation as baselines for comparison. As noted in the paper, there is a body of work focused on generating more sophisticated segments prior to applying LDA, though such methods are often influenced by the biases of the statistical or linguistic tools employed. Including comparisons with more advanced (state-of-the-art) segmentation methods would strengthen the validation of the proposed approach.  
Minor Comment:
- In line 105, "latent radom topics" should be corrected to "latent random topics."
