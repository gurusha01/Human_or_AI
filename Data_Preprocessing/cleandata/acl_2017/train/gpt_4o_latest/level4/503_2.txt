The paper explores identifying a family of graph languages that is closed under intersection and can be extended to a probabilistic framework.
- Strengths:
The introduction effectively establishes the relevance, overarching goal, and broader context of the work, and it is presented in an engaging manner.  
The motivation for the study is both clear and compelling.  
The paper is exceptionally well-written, though it demands careful reading and a solid formal background. It thoughtfully addresses variations in terminology.  
The generalization of familiar grammars and Earley's algorithm through hyper-edge grammars is intriguing. For instance, the application of "Predict" to nonterminal edges and "Scan" to terminal edges is a noteworthy extension.  
If the distinction between parsing and validation in the NLP context is clarified, the paper has the potential to be a valuable contribution. It is formally sound, insightful, and capable of inspiring new ideas among researchers.  
The algorithm described in the paper can be applied to semantic parsing for reranking hypergraphs generated by another parser. In this limited capacity, the method could become part of the NLP toolkit for natural language parsing, making it relevant to the ACL community.
- Weaknesses:
The potential application of the method for reranking is not mentioned in the introduction.  
While the idea of an Earley parser running in linear time for NLP grammars would be groundbreaking, this result hinges on strong assumptions about the grammar and input type.  
The claim of linear parsing complexity for input graphs seems valid for top-down deterministic grammars. However, the paper does not acknowledge that, in NLP, an input string often corresponds to an exponential number of graphs. Thus, the parsing complexity result should be contextualized in terms of graph validation or deriving a graph for purposes such as graph transduction via synchronous derivations.  
The distinction between semantic parsing (from strings) and parsing of semantic parses (as addressed in this work) needs to be clarified to avoid confusion for readers unfamiliar with the nuances.  
The paper does not address the linear order of 0-arity edges. If the parser is extended to string inputs to identify the optimal hypergraph for given external nodes, the subgraph representations must account for covered 0-arity edges. This extension would render the string-parser variant exponential in complexity.
- Easily Correctable Typos or Textual Issues:
1. Lines 102–106: The phrasing is misleading. While intersection and probabilities are accurate, "such distribution" does not clearly refer to the preceding discussion.  
2. Line 173: It would be more appropriate to refer to "validation" or "recognition" algorithms instead of "parsing" algorithms, as the term "parsing" in NLP typically implies a more complex process involving lexical and structural ambiguity.  
3. Lines 195–196: Clarify the elements of `attG` and explain in what sense they are pairwise distinct. Compare this with Example 1, where `extG` and `attG(e1)` are not disjoint.  
4. Line 206: Move the definition of rank earlier to avoid redundancy.  
5. Line 267: Replace "immediately derives" with a more precise term.  
6. Line 279: Add the word "be" for grammatical accuracy.  
7. Line 352: Provide an example of a nontrivial internal path.  
8. Line 472: Define what constitutes a subgraph of a hypergraph.  
9. Lines 417–418: Since two propositions are presented, clarify how each contributes to the quoted statement.  
10. Line 458: Add the preposition "for" where appropriate.  
11. Table (Axiom): This is the only instance where the term is introduced as an axiom. Link it to the relevant text that describes it as a trigger.
- General Discussion:
It could be beneficial to discuss MSOL graph languages and their yields, which correspond to context-free string languages.  
The paper does not address scenarios where the grammar is ambiguous or not top-down deterministic. What happens if there are exponentially many parses for the input graph due to lexical ambiguity or other factors? How would the parser perform in such cases? Would the Earley recognizer still exhibit strictly polynomial complexity with respect to `m` or `k`?  
Synchronous derivations of semantic graphs may fail to capture certain linguistic phenomena where semantic distinctions are expressed differently across languages. For instance, one language might use a verb affix while another modifies the object to convey the same meaning. While AMR enhances language independence in parses, it may still face such cross-lingual challenges.  
The role of the marker in subgraphs is unclear. It is mentioned initially but seems to be omitted later without further explanation.  
Lines 509–510: By this point, I began to miss the remark made in lines 644–647.  
The normal order does not appear to be unique. Can this be confirmed?  
Definition 7, Condition 1 introduces lexical anchors to predictions. This is reminiscent of lexical anchors in lexicalized grammars.  
Line 760: Are you certain that non-crossing links do not occur when parsing linearized sentences into semantic graphs?
- Significant Questions for the Authors:
1. The claim of linear parsing complexity for input graphs seems valid for top-down deterministic grammars. However, the paper does not address the fact that, in NLP, an input string often corresponds to an exponential number of graphs. How should the parsing complexity result be interpreted in such cases, particularly for graph validation or deriving graphs for graph transduction via synchronous derivations?  
2. How would parsing complexity change if the RGG were a non-deterministic, potentially ambiguous regular tree grammar, and it was used to assign trees to frontier strings like a context-free grammar? Could the Earley algorithm be adapted for this purpose by guessing internal nodes and their edges?  
3. What prevents RGGs from generating hypergraphs whose 0-arity edges (analogous to words) are then linearized? What principle governs their linearization? Is the linear order determined by Earley paths and the normal order in productions, or could it reflect actual word order in natural language strings?  
4. There is no clear connection to (non)context-free string languages or sets of (non)projective dependency graphs used in semantic parsing. Lines 757–758 suggest that HRGs can generate non-context-free languages. Are these graph languages or string languages? How should an NLP expert interpret the fact that RGGs generate only context-free languages? Does this imply that the graphs are non-crossing in the sense of Kuhlmann & Jonsson (2015)?
