- Strengths:
The originality of the CORE evaluation measure stands out, alongside the good accuracy achieved by the proposed similarity measure. Additionally, the use of a large number and diverse range of datasets for evaluation is commendable.
- Weaknesses:
  Typos:
  - Line 116-117: Replace "to design of a new" with "to design a new."
  - Line 176-177: Correct "figure 2" to "figure 1."
  - Line 265: Replace "among the the top" with "among the top."
  - Line 320: Ensure that "figure 4" is introduced within the article body.
  - Line 434: Correct "the dataset was contains" to "the dataset contains."
  - Line 486-487: Replace "table 3" with "table 1."
  - Replace "Tensorflow" with "TextFlow" throughout the manuscript.
  Imprecisions:
  - The paper should provide details on the accuracy of feature computation for lemma, POS, or WordNet synset and discuss whether this impacts the overall similarity accuracy evaluation.
  - While the neural networks are stated to be implemented in Python, the availability of the code is not mentioned, which is essential for reproducibility.
  - Although the training and evaluation sets are said to be shared, the method of sharing (e.g., on-demand, under license) is not specified, which hinders the ability to replicate the experiment.
- General Discussion:
