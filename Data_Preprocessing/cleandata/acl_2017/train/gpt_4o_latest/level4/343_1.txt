- General Discussion:  
This study employs a pre-training strategy to enhance Chinese word segmentation. Building on transition-based neural word segmentation, the authors aim to pre-train incoming characters using external resources (e.g., punctuation, soft segmentation, POS, and heterogeneous training data) through multi-task learning. Each external resource is treated as an auxiliary classification task. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of seven datasets.  
The paper is well-written and easy to comprehend. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive experiments. However, there is a notable concern. The proposed method relies on semi-supervised learning, leveraging external resources for character pre-training. Additionally, the paper incorporates heterogeneous training datasets, albeit only for pre-training purposes. Despite this, the baselines used in the experiments are based on supervised learning. Typically, semi-supervised learning outperforms supervised learning due to its ability to utilize abundant auxiliary information. Consequently, the experiments should have included comparisons with other semi-supervised approaches to ensure a fair evaluation.  
Post Author Response:  
The reviewer's concern lies in the use of an additional "gold-labeled" dataset for pre-training character embeddings. While some baselines in the experiments utilize label information—predicted automatically by their base models, as the authors noted—ensuring a fair comparison requires identical conditions. Even if the "gold" dataset is not directly used to train the segmentation model, the use of this dataset for pre-training character embeddings creates an imbalance. Thus, the comparison appears unfair, as the proposed method benefits from an additional "gold" dataset.
