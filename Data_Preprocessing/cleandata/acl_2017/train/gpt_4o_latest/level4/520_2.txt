- Strengths:
The paper presents a novel software package, ShapeWorld, designed for the automated generation of datasets tailored to image captioning tasks. The microworld employed for generating these datasets is intentionally simple, allowing for straightforward interpretation of both the generated data and the errors made by models. Despite its simplicity, the authors demonstrate that the package can be configured to produce datasets that are sufficiently challenging to serve as a valuable benchmark for advancing research in this domain.
- Weaknesses:
The main limitation of this work is that it resembles a demo paper in certain aspects. While the authors provide experimental evaluations using a reasonable baseline image captioning model on the datasets generated by ShapeWorld, such experiments are often characteristic of demo papers. 
Additionally, the inclusion of a hyperlink to the software package's GitHub repository potentially compromises the anonymity of the authors.
- General Discussion:
Scientific progress frequently benefits from addressing problems that fall within an optimal range of difficulty, akin to Vygotsky's concept of the zone of proximal development. By focusing on challenges that are neither too simple nor too complex, research can advance more efficiently (e.g., the use of tidigits in speech recognition research during the early 1990s). This paper is particularly compelling because it introduces a microworld that is both simple enough for researchers to fully grasp and sufficiently challenging for current models to handle.
The impact of this work is further enhanced by the fact that the software is open-source, readily accessible on GitHub, and outputs data in a format compatible with modern deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow). 
The paper also clearly explains the methods used by the software to generate synthetic data. Furthermore, it is commendable that the authors conducted experiments with various configurations of their software and a baseline image captioning model to highlight the strengths and limitations of existing techniques.
My primary concern with this submission is whether it would be more appropriate for the demo track. Publishing it in the non-demo long paper track might lead to confusion and could be perceived as unfair to authors who correctly submitted similar work to the demo track.
