- Strengths:  
The paper tackles an important problem: learning the mapping between natural language and knowledge base (KB) relations in the context of question answering (QA), specifically when partial information is available for one of the arguments and when there is a very large set of potential target relations.
The proposed method introduces a novel approach to combine two distinct representations of the input text: (1) a word-level representation, which involves segmenting both the target relation names and the input text, and (2) a representation where relations are treated as single tokens, without any segmentation of relation names or input text.
A key contribution to QA appears to be the model's ability to re-rank entities following the Entity Linking step.
The experimental results demonstrate performance improvements over the current state of the art.
- Weaknesses:  
The evaluation has been conducted on a limited dataset.
- General Discussion:  
I suggest that Section 3.1 could be better placed within the related work section, allowing Section 3.2 to become the new Section 3, which would focus on the proposed method. This restructuring would enable the new Section 3 to be divided more effectively.
