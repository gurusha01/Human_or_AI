This paper introduces several weakly supervised methods for developing NERs, which rely on projecting information from English into another language. While the overall approach is not novel, the proposed methods represent incremental improvements over existing techniques. For a paper submitted to ACL, I would have anticipated more innovative contributions.
One notable contribution of the paper is the data selection scheme. The formula used to compute the quality score is relatively straightforward, which is not necessarily a drawback. However, the process for determining the thresholds in Table 2 is unclear. The paper mentions that various thresholds were tested but does not specify whether this was done on a development set. This omission leaves readers uncertain about how to tune these parameters for a new dataset or language pair, even though the evaluation results underscore the importance of data selection.
Another contribution is the combination of outputs from the two systems developed in the paper. However, the explanation of how this combination works is insufficiently clear, despite my efforts to understand it.
The paper also explores multiple variants of the proposed methods. It raises the question of whether combining more than two weakly supervised systems might be beneficial. Did the authors experiment with such combinations?
Finally, additional details about the types of texts included in the "in-house" dataset would enhance the paper's clarity and completeness.
