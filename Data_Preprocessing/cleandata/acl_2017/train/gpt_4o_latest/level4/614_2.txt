Review - Strengths:  
The paper introduces a novel approach that leverages word senses to enhance performance in the task of lexical substitutability. The experimental results demonstrate improvements over existing methods.
Weaknesses:  
When evaluating an ACL paper, I often reflect on what significant insight the work offers and, from a broader perspective, how it contributes to the fields of natural language processing and computational linguistics. Specifically, I ask: how does the task of lexical substitutability, and this paper in particular, advance the development of NLP systems or deepen our understanding of language? After reading this paper, I struggle to find a compelling answer to either of these questions.
From the perspective of a practitioner aiming to enhance natural language understanding systems, I am particularly interested in the first question: does the task of lexical substitutability, along with the improved results over prior work presented here, benefit any downstream application? Considering the current landscape of high-performing systems, discrete clustering of words (or longer utterances) often falls short when compared to continuous word representations. For instance, distributed representations of words have been widely adopted as inputs for tasks like machine translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification, often outperforming methods relying on discrete lexical semantics. How do the authors justify the relevance of lexical substitutability, given that discrete lexical semantic representations frequently underperform? The introduction references a few older studies, primarily conducted in small data settings, and since this work is focused on English, it is unclear why one would choose this method for practical applications. I would appreciate the authors' response to this overarching concern.
As a minor critique, consider the substitutes provided in Table 1:  
1. Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper.  
2. Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the sheet.  
To me, these two sentences convey different meanings. For instance, if the object in question were a paper bag, could "paper" reasonably be replaced with "sheet"? In my understanding, it could not. This highlights the inherent subjectivity of the task, as lexical substitutes can significantly alter the semantics of the original sentence.
Minor point(s):  
- Section 3.1.4 lacks proper citations.  
Addition:  
After reviewing the authors' response, I maintain my initial evaluation of the paper.
