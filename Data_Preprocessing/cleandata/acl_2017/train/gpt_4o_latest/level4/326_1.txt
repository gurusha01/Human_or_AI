- Strengths:
The authors employ well-established neural network techniques, specifically adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., NIPS-2014), to leverage eight distinct Chinese word segmentation test sets, each reflecting a different interpretation of what constitutes a "word" in Chinese.
This work has the potential to impact a variety of NLP tasks that involve slightly divergent definitions of correctness. While the issue has traditionally been approached through adaptation, the application of Goodfellow et al.'s framework offers a fresh and potentially more effective perspective on this challenge.

- Weaknesses:
The problem described above needs a clear and specific name. A term like "the elusive gold standard" might be more appropriate and descriptive than "multi-criteria."
The paper's motivation feels overly narrow. The elusive gold standard issue arises in numerous applications beyond Chinese Word Segmentation.
The motivation also assumes a level of familiarity with Chinese that may not apply to all readers. Those less familiar with Chinese might underestimate its complexity. For example, non-Chinese readers (like this reviewer) might mistakenly equate Chinese Word Segmentation with the relatively straightforward task of tokenizing English text by whitespace. However, it is likely that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) in Chinese is quite low. The key point in Table 1 is that even native Chinese speakers can significantly disagree on segmentation.
It would strengthen the paper to highlight that many NLP tasks involve substantial room for disagreement. For instance, tasks like machine translation, information retrieval, and web search are so prone to differing interpretations that their evaluation metrics are designed to accommodate multiple correct answers. Conversely, tasks like part-of-speech tagging often ignore the elusive gold standard issue, which has hindered progress. In tagging, differences between annotators often reflect subjective opinions, while differences between machine outputs and annotations are almost always treated as errors. This distinction is critical but often overlooked.
The term "adversary" was somewhat confusing for this reader. The original NIPS paper likely used it to model noise under "Murphy's law," where assuming the worst is a prudent strategy. However, framing differences of opinion as an adversarial game, akin to chess, may not be the most constructive approach. In chess, it makes sense to assume your opponent is working against you, but this mindset may not be helpful when addressing subjective disagreements.
To improve clarity, the authors could explicitly state that they are applying an established method from NIPS (which uses the term "adversarial") to address the elusive gold standard problem. They should also emphasize that this problem is widespread across NLP tasks, even though their study focuses on a specific Chinese Word Segmentation context.

- General Discussion:
The paper was unnecessarily difficult to follow in places. This may partly stem from this reviewer's limited familiarity with Chinese and recent developments in NIPS. However, there are also issues with the English language and the overall exposition.
For example, consider Table 4. Line 525 makes a claim about the first block and network depth, but it is unclear which specific lines in Table 4 support this assertion.
Terms like "P" and "R" presumably refer to precision and recall, but this is not explicitly stated. Similarly, "F" is likely the standard F-measure, and "OOV" likely stands for out-of-vocabulary, but these should not be left to the reader's assumptions.
Table 4 contains numerous numbers, but it is unclear what constitutes statistical significance. Which numbers are comparable? Can values across columns be compared? Is performance on one dataset comparable to another? Line 560 suggests that the adversarial method is not significant, but the implications of this are unclear. What should the reader conclude from Table 4? Line 794 claims a significant solution to the elusive gold standard problem, but it is not evident which numbers in Table 4 substantiate this claim.

- Small Quibbles About English:
1. Replace "works" with "work" in multiple places. "Work" is a mass noun, unlike "conclusion," which can be pluralized (e.g., "one conclusion," "two conclusions"). Use "more/less/some work" rather than "one work" or "two works."
2. Line 493: Change "each datasets" to "each dataset."
3. Line 485: Clarify that "Three datasets use traditional Chinese (AS, CITY, CKIP), while the other five use simplified Chinese."
4. Line 509: Replace "random" with "randomize."
