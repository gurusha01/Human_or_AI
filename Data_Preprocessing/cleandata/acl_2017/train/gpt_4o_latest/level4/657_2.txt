- Strengths:  
The manuscript is well-composed and provides a detailed comparison of its approach with existing methods. The authors acknowledge that their results are somewhat constrained in terms of the mean F values.
- Weaknesses:  
There are a few minor typographical errors and some redundant phrases. Overall, the paper would be improved by condensing Sections 1 and 2, which would allow for an expansion of Sections 3 and 4. Additionally, the primary objective of the study is not articulated clearly enough, likely due to the ambiguity surrounding the paper's goals.
- General Discussion:  
Table 1 should be formatted to span a single column, whereas the figures—particularly Figures 3, 5, and 6—would benefit from being displayed across two columns. The paper was somewhat difficult to follow on an initial reading. Significant clarity could be achieved by reorganizing and streamlining the content.
