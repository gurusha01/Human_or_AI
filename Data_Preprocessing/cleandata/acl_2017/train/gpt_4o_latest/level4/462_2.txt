This study explores the use of sentiment signals extracted from companies' annual 10-K filing reports to predict market volatility.  
The authors assess various information retrieval term weighting models, which are initialized with a finance-specific sentiment lexicon and further expanded using word embeddings. Dimensionality reduction is performed via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for similarity estimation.  
Beyond text-based features, the study incorporates non-textual market features, such as sector classifications and volatility metrics.  
The paper also examines multiple fusion strategies to integrate text-derived features with market-based features.  
COMMENTS  
It would enhance the study to include two additional experimental setups: (1) a straightforward trigram-based SVM model that does not rely on pre-existing sentiment lexicons, and (2) features that capture delta-IDF scores for individual terms.  
 
Additionally, incorporating binary features as a baseline comparison would strengthen the evaluation.
