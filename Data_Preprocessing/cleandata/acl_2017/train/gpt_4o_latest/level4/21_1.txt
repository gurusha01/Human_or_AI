The manuscript is well-written, with its claims substantiated by strong evidence. The Related Work section, in particular, is comprehensive and effectively situates the proposed research within the broader context of the field.
I have two primary questions regarding the methodology: (1) Section 3.1 mentions phrases, but the discussion focuses solely on word representations. Could the authors clarify how phrase representations are constructed?  
(2) While there is no explicit linkage between M^+ and M^- in the model, they are indirectly related via the tanh scoring function. How do the learned matrices compare to one another (e.g., does M^- resemble -1*M^+)? Additionally, what would be the advantages or disadvantages of explicitly connecting the two matrices by imposing a dissimilarity constraint?
Furthermore, it would enhance the paper to include an analysis of the statistical significance of the reported performance improvements.
Typographical suggestions:  
- Line 220: Replace "word/phase pair" with "word/phrase pair."  
- Line 245: Consider rephrasing "entities are translated to" as "entities are mapped to," as the former could be misinterpreted as a translation operation in vector space, which may not align with the intended meaning.  
- Line 587: Change "slightly improvement in F-measure" to "slight improvement in F-measure."  
- Line 636: Remove extraneous commas in the citation.  
- Line 646: Revise "The most case" to "The most likely case" (if this interpretation is correct).  
- Line 727: Eliminate the extraneous period and comma in the citation.
