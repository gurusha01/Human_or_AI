The paper introduces a task of selecting the most suitable textual description for a given scene/image from a list of closely related alternatives. It also presents a couple of baseline models, an evaluation metric, and a human evaluation score.
- Strengths:
The paper is well-written and organized.  
Its contributions are clearly articulated and supported by empirical evidence, making it easy to follow and understand.  
The motivation behind the work is strong. A method for selecting the most appropriate caption from a list of misleading alternatives has the potential to enhance other image-captioning/understanding models, particularly as a post-generation re-ranking mechanism.  
- Weaknesses:
The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for generating decoys is questionable, which raises concerns about the validity of the paper's claims.  
The algorithm selects captions with similar representations and surface forms that do not correspond to the same image as the target. However, a fundamental issue with this approach is that not belonging to image-A does not necessarily mean a caption is inappropriate for describing image-A, especially when its representation and surface form are similar. As illustrated in Figure-1, the generated decoys are either too dissimilar to the target to serve as meaningful distractors (giraffe vs. elephant), or they are reasonable substitutes for the target (small boy playing kites vs. boy flies a kite).  
As a result, the dataset created using this algorithm may not effectively train a model to truly go beyond key word recognition, as claimed in the paper. Figure-1 demonstrates that many decoys can be filtered out based on keyword mismatchesâ€”giraffe vs. elephant, pan vs. bread, frisbee vs. kite, etc. When keyword mismatches are not present, the decoys often appear plausible enough to be correct options.  
Additionally, the human accuracy of 82.8% on a sampled test set raises questions. Does this indicate that some examples are inherently too challenging for humans to classify correctly? Or does it suggest that some decoys are sufficiently convincing to act as valid substitutes (or even better options), leading humans to prefer them over the ground-truth captions?  
- General Discussion:
This is a well-written paper with strong motivation and comprehensive experiments.  
However, the primary concern lies in the data-generation algorithm and the resulting dataset, which do not appear to align well with the stated motivation. This undermines the credibility of the experimental conclusions. Therefore, I am inclined to reject this paper unless my concerns are adequately addressed during the rebuttal phase.
