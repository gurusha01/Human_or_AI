This paper introduces a general framework for examining similarities and differences in term meanings and representations across varying contexts.
- Strengths:
  * The proposed framework is highly generalizable, allowing for application across diverse scenarios. It accommodates variations in context notations, similarity functions, and types of word annotations.
  * The paper is well-written and easy to comprehend.
- Weaknesses:
  * There are concerns regarding the experimental evaluation. The paper relies on qualitative evaluation metrics, which complicates the assessment of the proposed method's effectiveness or validity. For instance, Table 1 compares results with Hamilton et al. using different embedding vectors by listing the top 10 words that changed between 1900 and 1990. However, it is challenging to quantitatively assess the performance of CCLA based on this. A similar issue arises in Experiment 2 (comparative lexical analysis over context). While the top 10 words may appear meaningful, what about the top 20 or 100? What about the terms that practitioners are specifically interested in? Without addressing these evaluation concerns, it is difficult to assert that CCLA will provide tangible benefits for downstream applications.
