- Strengths: The exploration of different types of relations between lexical items is both intriguing and ambitious. The authors present a compelling rationale for why extending beyond analogy testing is a meaningful direction.
- Weaknesses: The paper does not provide a justification or broader context for selecting clustering as the evaluation method instead of a classification task, even though classification tasks are inherently easier to evaluate. Additionally, there is no effort to interpret the overall performance of the results. How would humans perform on this task if given only the words without any context?
- General Discussion: I have reviewed the authors' response.
