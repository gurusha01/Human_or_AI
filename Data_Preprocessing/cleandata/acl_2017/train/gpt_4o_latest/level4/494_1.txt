Strengths:
- Clear and effective application of linguistic principles to distributional semantics.  
- Demonstrates significant and consistent improvements on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.  
Weaknesses:
- Relatively straightforward extension of prior retrofitting approaches.  
- Additional baselines, such as character embeddings, would strengthen the evaluation.  
General Discussion:  
This paper introduces "morph-fitting," a retrofitting approach for vector spaces that integrates morphological constraints into the embeddings. The method employs "attract" and "repel" constraints, where attract constraints bring morphological variants closer together (e.g., look/looking), and repel constraints push derivational antonyms apart (e.g., responsible/irresponsible). The authors evaluate their approach across multiple vector spaces and languages, showing consistent gains on intrinsic benchmarks like SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500. Additionally, they test the method on the extrinsic task of dialogue state tracking, demonstrating measurable improvements over embeddings that do not account for morphology.  
Overall, I find this to be a strong paper. It provides a simple yet effective way to incorporate linguistic knowledge into distributional semantic models, and the empirical results are compelling. While I have a few questions and suggestions outlined below, none of them detract from the paper's overall quality or its suitability for publication.  
Comments for Authors:  
1) The inclusion of the morph-SimLex evaluation set raises some concerns. Creating a dataset using the same assumptions as the model being evaluated seems problematic, as it inherently biases the results in favor of the proposed approach. This could lead to confusion and diminish the credibility of the evaluation. Given that your results on standard datasets are already strong, I recommend omitting this dataset entirely.  
2) I appreciate the inclusion of the morph-fix baselineâ€”it provides valuable context. However, I believe the evaluation could be further strengthened by including a baseline based on character embeddings. Character-based approaches are currently a popular method for addressing morphological variation, and an empirical comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. While you mention character embeddings in the related work, directly comparing against them would add depth to your analysis.  
3) While the proposed method effectively brings morphological variants closer together, it would be ideal to also preserve meaningful geometric relationships in the vector space. For instance, does "looking" - "look" + "walk" = "walking"? An analysis demonstrating that morph-fitting results in a semantically meaningful space, beyond just improved embeddings, would be a valuable addition. This could provide further evidence of the broader utility of your approach.
