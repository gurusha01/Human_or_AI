The paper introduces a method for recognizing time expressions in text. This approach is a straightforward rule-based method, which serves as a significant advantage as an analytical tool, given that time expression recognition should function as a fundamental process in various applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses both state-of-the-art rule-based methods and machine learning-based methods in the task of time expression recognition.
While the work is commendable, I have concerns regarding the generalizability of the method. The rules were crafted based on observations from the same corpora used for evaluation, which raises the possibility that the rules are overfitted to these corpora. Additionally, the domains of these corpora may have influenced the rule design. There is no statistical analysis or discussion provided to assess the overlap of time expressions within the observed corpora. If it were shown that time expressions in these corpora largely overlap, such evidence could have supported the generalizability of the rules.
Ideally, the experiments should have included a new corpus, distinct from the one used during the rule design process, to demonstrate that the proposed method is broadly effective across different datasets.
