- Strengths:  
The paper introduces an end-to-end neural model for semantic graph parsing, leveraging a thoughtfully designed transition system. The research is compelling, focusing on learning semantic representations of DMRS, which effectively addresses challenges like scope underspecification. This work presents a novel approach to computational semantics, utilizing an end-to-end transition-based incremental framework that achieves efficient parsing with low computational cost.
- Weaknesses:  
My primary concern is that the paper provides only a generic introduction to the definitions of DMRS and EP, and the accompanying example is somewhat unclear, as it does not highlight any distinctive aspects of DMRS. I believe the explanation could be more detailed. However, given the space constraints, this is somewhat understandable. A similar issue arises with the description of the transition system used in the parsing model. Without prior knowledge of MRS and EP, it is difficult to gain meaningful insights from the paper, aside from recognizing its overall quality.
- General Discussion:  
In summary, I find this paper highly engaging. I greatly appreciate the use of DMRS for semantic parsing and thoroughly enjoyed reading the paper. I look forward to the release of open-source code and datasets, which I believe could help propel this research area into a prominent topic of interest.
