This paper introduces a method for classifying adjective-noun pairs as either literal or metaphoric. The authors construct a word-context matrix for adjectives and nouns, where each element represents the PMI score. They then employ various techniques to select dimensions of this matrix, enabling the representation of each noun/adjective as a vector. The geometric properties of these vectors—both average and normalized—are subsequently used as features to train a regression model that classifies the pairs into literal or metaphorical expressions. The proposed approach achieves performance comparable to prior work that learns vector representations for adjectives.
Supervision and Zero-Shot Learning
The authors claim that their method requires less supervision than previous approaches and supports zero-shot learning. However, this assertion appears to be overstated and warrants clarification, as it is a central claim of the paper. The proposed method is fundamentally a supervised classification task: vector representations are derived from co-occurrence statistics, and these representations, along with gold-standard labels, are used to train the classifier. While the model can indeed be tested on words absent from the training data, it does not learn from such examples. Furthermore, these words are not truly "unseen," as the model requires pre-existing vector representations for them.
Interpretation of the Results
The authors provide a thorough review of prior work on metaphors. However, the intuition behind their approach—specifically, the use of geometric properties like vector length for metaphor identification—is not entirely clear. For instance, the rationale for including normalized vectors is ambiguous, particularly since they do not appear to enhance performance. Additionally, the noun vector emerges as the most predictive feature, which the authors attribute to the dataset design, where each adjective appears in both metaphoric and literal contexts. Consequently, the adjective vector is less informative. This raises concerns about the broader applicability of the approach. Specifically:  
(a) From a theoretical perspective (especially given the paper's submission to the cognitive track), it is unclear what insights this method provides about metaphor processing theories.  
(b) From an NLP applications standpoint, the generalizability of the approach compared to compositional models is questionable.
Novelty
The method for representing noun/adjective vectors closely resembles that of Agres et al. The primary contribution of the paper appears to be the use of geometric properties for classifying these vectors.
