- Strengths  
This study addresses the challenge of determining word polarity orientation in an unsupervised manner by leveraging word embeddings.
- Weaknesses  
While the paper introduces an intriguing and potentially valuable approach, it currently lacks application to a concrete test case. Furthermore, the foundational ideas are described in a more "intuitive" fashion rather than being rigorously justified.
- General Discussion  
The work is undoubtedly compelling. However, the paper could be significantly improved by incorporating additional experiments, benchmarking against alternative methods (e.g., the use of the Normalized Google Distance as explored by authors like Balahur and Montoyo, 2008 - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4906796/), and demonstrating the utility of the derived knowledge in a practical sentiment analysis scenario. At this stage, the research shows promise but remains in its early stages of development.
