- General Discussion:
This paper presents a transductive learning approach for Chinese hypernym prediction, which tackles a compelling research problem. The authors propose a direct mapping from entities to hypernyms in the embedding space, which appears to be a novel contribution. The paper is well-written and easy to comprehend. The initial step of their method, preprocessing with embeddings, is a commonly used technique for preparing input data, though it remains a standard approach. The proposed transductive model serves as an optimization framework for non-linear mapping, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. The supplementary notes provided by the authors further clarify the methodology. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the release of the dataset is a valuable contribution, as it facilitates future research in this domain.
