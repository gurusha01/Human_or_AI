- Strengths:  
The paper addresses an engaging topic—different writing styles in completing a story—that is likely to resonate with participants in the Discourse and Pragmatics field.
- Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks a persuasive and comprehensive discussion of writing style and the broader implications of the experiments for discourse and pragmatics.  
(1) For instance, in relation to "style," the authors could have explored questions such as: What does starting an incoherent end-of-story sentence with a proper noun (l. 582) signify? Could this indicate a topic shift? What are the implications of concluding a story coherently with a past-tense verb, and so on?  
(2) The connection between studies on deceptive language and the short or long answers analyzed in this study is unclear. A more detailed comparison would have been beneficial.  
(3) Terms like "cognitive load" (l. 134) and "mental states" (l. 671) are used in ways that seem somewhat ambiguous.  
(4) The discussion on the use of coordinators (starting at line 275) is insufficient. A deeper exploration of this topic would enhance the paper—for example, what role do coordinators play in these short stories and in discourse more broadly? Does their usage vary depending on the genre of the story? What about cases where no coordinators are used?  
(5) The intended audience for this research is not clearly defined. Are the findings meant to inform language teachers, crowd-sourcing experiment designers, or another group?  
The paper also requires reorganization, as there are repetitive elements throughout the text. Additionally, the abbreviations in Tables 5 and 6 are unclear and need clarification.
- General Discussion:  
Overall, the paper requires significant revision, particularly in terms of its theoretical framework and its implications for discourse and pragmatics.
=====
In their response to the reviewers' feedback, the authors express a willingness to revise the paper and address the issues related to their experimental work. However, I would have preferred a stronger commitment to integrating the study's implications into the Discourse and Pragmatics domain.
