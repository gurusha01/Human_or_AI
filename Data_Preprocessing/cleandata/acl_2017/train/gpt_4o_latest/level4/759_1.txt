This paper introduces a joint model for salient phrase selection and discourse relation prediction in spoken meetings. Experimental results on meeting corpora demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms an SVM-based classifier.
- Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. It provides a thorough explanation of technical details and achieves strong performance in the experimental evaluation. Additionally, it includes valuable comparisons with prior work in the areas of discourse structure analysis and key phrase identification. Notably, the study evaluates not only the performance of phrase selection from discourse, discourse relation labeling, and summary generation as applications but also explores its application to predicting the consistency of team members' understanding, which is an intriguing aspect.
- Weaknesses:  
The concept of jointly modeling salient phrase extraction and discourse relationship labeling across speaker turns has been proposed. However, a more intuitive explanation of their interdependence and the benefits of considering this interaction would strengthen the paper.
- General Discussion:  
The SVM-based classifier is used as a baseline in the experiments. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the rationale behind this choice to validate the experimental setup.
