The authors propose a novel formula for evaluating the readability of Vietnamese texts, which is derived through multiple regression analysis using three features. Additionally, they have created and annotated a new text corpus categorized into three readability levels: easy, middle, and hard.
Research focusing on languages beyond English, particularly low-resource languages, is both valuable and necessary. Consequently, the corpus could serve as a useful resource for further research (though it appears the authors do not plan to make it publicly availableâ€”can this be confirmed?). However, in its current form, I find the paper unconvincing and unlikely to significantly influence future research. My concerns are outlined below:
- The authors fail to justify the need for a new readability formula, given that two existing formulas for Vietnamese already utilize nearly identical features. What are the shortcomings of these existing formulas, and how does the proposed formula improve upon them?
- The experimental section lacks sufficient comparisons with prior work and does not provide an in-depth analysis of the results. While the authors claim that their formula achieves an accuracy of 81% on their corpus and is "good and can be applied in practice," they do not evaluate how this accuracy compares to that of existing formulas. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed formula relative to the existing ones?
- There is no detailed analysis of the results. For instance, which word lengths, sentence lengths, or counts of difficult words are categorized as easy, middle, or hard by the proposed model?
- Including a few practical examples demonstrating how the proposed formula could be applied in real-world scenarios would enhance the paper.
- The related work section functions more as a "background" section, as it primarily summarizes previously published formulas. A broader discussion of related work is missing. For example, papers such as DuBay (2004): "The Principles of Readability" or Rabin (1988): "Determining Difficulty Levels of Text Written in Languages Other than English" could provide valuable context.
- Since Vietnamese is a syllable-based language rather than a word-based one, it is unclear how the authors define "words" in their study. Do they employ a specific method to merge syllables into words? If so, what approach do they use, and what is its accuracy?
- Overall, the paper lacks sufficient content in terms of experiments, comparisons, result analysis, discussion, and related work to justify its length as a full paper.
Additional comments:
- The language throughout the paper requires improvement.
- Equations: The use of parentheses and multiplication operators is inconsistent.
- Related work section: The capitalization of first letters is inconsistent.
