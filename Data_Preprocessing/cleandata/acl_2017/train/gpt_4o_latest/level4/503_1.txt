This is a challenging paper to evaluate, as I believe it contains some valuable and salvageable technical contributions (notably the parsing algorithm). However, the paper as a whole lacks cohesion. It is built around a unifying perspective on formal languages, treating the property of a language being "probabilistic" as a formal characteristic akin to properties like closure under intersection. In my view, the concept of a formal language being probabilistic, as presented here, has not been explored with sufficient rigor to make this overarching perspective convincing.
It is worth emphasizing that the merit of the formal results presented in the paper is largely independent of the weakness of the overarching narrative. Therefore, this is not a case of poor research but rather a poorly constructed and written paper that requires significant revision.
I find it particularly perplexing that the paper's structure allocates so little space to the parsing result, to the extent that the soundness and completeness proofs are relegated to supplementary materials. Additionally, the inclusion of "probabilistic languages" in the paper's title feels misleading, as the submission does not actually engage in probabilistic reasoning.
Finally, the significance of the intersection-closure result in Section 3 appears to be overstated. Unless I am misunderstanding the constraints on the right-hand sides of the rules (in which case, further clarification is needed), this result seems to amount to little more than folding a finite intersection into the set of non-terminal labels.
