Paraphrased Review
Strengths:
- The related work section is comprehensive, and the comparison with the proposed approach strengthens the paper's hypothesis. Additionally, the evaluation section is detailed, making the experiments highly convincing.
Weaknesses:
- Section 3 lacks clarity regarding the specific dataset used for training both the SVM and the proposed model. Moreover, while the starting date for collecting the testing data is mentioned, there is no further information about the dataset's size or the time frame during which the data was gathered. Providing such details could shed light on the results and statistics presented in Section 3.2.  
- In Table 3, the number of reviewers is only slightly lower than the number of reviews posted (at least for hotels), suggesting that only a small number of reviewers contributed more than one review in the labeled dataset. How does this compare to the full dataset in Table 2? What is the exact number of reviewers in Table 2, and what percentage of them are labeled reviewers? Additionally, it would be useful to know the average number of reviews per person. If only a few reviewers contribute multiple reviews (i.e., limited information to learn from), the results would benefit from a more in-depth discussion.
General Discussion:
This paper addresses the problem of identifying spam reviews under the assumption of a cold-start scenario, where limited information is available for decision-making. The authors propose a neural network model that jointly leverages embedded textual and behavioral information to represent new reviews. Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are compelling.
Typos and/or Grammar:
- "The new reviewer only provide us"  
- Jindal and Liu (2008) make the first step -> Since this is an older work, consider using past tense to describe it.  
- Replace short forms such as "can't," "couldn't," and "what's" with their full forms.  
- The following sentence is unclear and should be rephrased: "The new reviewer just posted one review and we have to filter it out immediately, there is not any historical reviews provided to us."
