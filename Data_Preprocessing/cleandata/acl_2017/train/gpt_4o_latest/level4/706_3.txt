- Strengths:  
The concepts and the problem tackled in this paper are both innovative and elegant. The integration of indirect supervision (accepting the resulting parse) with direct supervision (providing a definition) offers a particularly effective approach for interactively constructing a natural language interface to a programming language. The proposed method has significant potential for a broad range of applications.
- Weaknesses:  
The paper contains multiple typos and language issues, and part of the text appears to be missing at the end of Section 6. A thorough proofreading by a native English speaker would greatly enhance the quality of the manuscript.
- General Discussion:  
This paper introduces a method for collaboratively naturalizing a 'core' programming language through incremental syntax expansion by a community of users. The process is interactive, allowing users to input commands in the naturalized language and either choose from a list of candidate parses or provide a definition in natural language. The approach enables users to define concepts intuitively using literals rather than variables (e.g., "select orange"), making it accessible even to non-programmers. A grammar is incrementally induced during this process, which is then used to generate the candidate parses.
