This paper explores the use of dilated convolutions for sequence tagging, with a particular focus on named entity recognition (NER). It introduces innovative concepts, such as sharing the dilated convolution block and predicting tags at each convolutional level, which I believe will be valuable contributions to the research community. The authors conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The writing is exceptionally clear, and the experimental evaluation is highly thorough.
Strengths:  
- Comprehensive experimental comparisons with various architectures (e.g., LSTM, LSTM + CRF).  
- Introduction of novel architectural and training strategies (e.g., block sharing).  
Weaknesses:  
- The method is evaluated solely on English NER, which is concerning given that the paper's title implies a broader applicability to sequence tagging.  
- Section 4.1 could benefit from greater clarity. For instance, I assume padding is used to maintain consistent output resolution across blocks, but this should be explicitly mentioned.  
- An ablation study examining the relationship between the number of layers and performance could provide additional insights.  
Response to Author Rebuttal:  
Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful response. Since the authors have agreed to revise the paper to focus more specifically on NER rather than general sequence tagging, I have updated my score to reflect this improvement.
