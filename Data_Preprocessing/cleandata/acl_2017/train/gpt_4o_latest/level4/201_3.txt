- Strengths:
This study provides a systematic examination of how different context types (linear vs. dependency-based) and word representations (bound vs. unbound) influence the process of learning word embeddings. The authors conducted experiments using three models (Generalized Bag-Of-Words, Generalized Skip-Gram, and GloVe) across a variety of tasks, including word similarity, word analogy, sequence labeling, and text classification. Overall:  
1) The paper is well-written and well-structured.  
2) The experiments are comprehensively evaluated, and the analysis offers valuable insights that could guide researchers in selecting appropriate word embeddings or inspire the development of new models.  
3) The accompanying software is a useful contribution to the community.  
- Weaknesses:
The contribution in terms of novelty is somewhat limited.  
- General Discussion:
Regarding the dependency-based context types, how does the quality of dependency parsing impact the overall performance? Is it entirely fair to compare the two context types, given that dependency-based contexts rely on predicted dependency parsing outputs (e.g., from CoreNLP), whereas linear contexts do not require such preprocessing?
