This paper presents UCCA as a target representation for semantic parsing and introduces a transition-based parser that achieves notable success in inferring this representation. I found this paper highly engaging. The introduction of UCCA, while not entirely new, holds significant value, especially for this community, as it has the potential to inspire fresh perspectives on semantic representations of text. Additionally, I found the model to be thoughtfully designed. Although the model builds on existing transition-based frameworks, the modifications made by the authors to adapt it to this domain were both reasonable and clearly articulated, with an appropriate level of detail.
The empirical evaluation was compellingâ€”the results were strong when compared to several credible baselines, and the authors demonstrated the model's effectiveness across multiple domains. My primary critique of this paper is the absence of multilingual evaluation. This omission is particularly notable given that the formalism under study is intended to be relatively universal. I am fairly certain that multilingual UCCA corpora are available (for instance, the "20k leagues" corpus used in this paper appears to be one such resource), so it would have been valuable to see results in languages other than English.
A minor point: in section 6, the authors describe their model as "grammarless," which I find somewhat misleading. While it is true that UCCA does not stem from traditional linguistic syntactic notions, it still establishes a framework for constructing a compositional abstract symbolic representation of text, which, in my view, qualifies as a form of grammar. (This is admittedly a minor quibble, but it stood out to me enough to mention.)
Edited to add: I appreciate the authors' response.
