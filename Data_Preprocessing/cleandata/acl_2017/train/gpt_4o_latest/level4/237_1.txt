Summary
This paper conducts an empirical investigation aimed at uncovering a latent sentiment dimension within word embeddings.
Strengths
S1) Addresses the challenging task of performing unsupervised sentiment analysis.
S2) Figure 2 stands out as an effective and insightful visualization.
Weaknesses
W1) The experimental evaluation is notably sparse. It would be beneficial to include F1 performance metrics and broaden the range of techniques for comparison.
W2) The methodology section requires better structure and more detailed explanations. While the tested ideas are listed, they lack sufficient justification.
W3) The reported results are relatively weak, both in terms of accuracy and the depth of analysis. This work would benefit from further development, particularly in validating the key assumption that the Distributional Hypothesis ensures that opposite words, despite their semantic similarity, are distinctly separated in the vector space.
