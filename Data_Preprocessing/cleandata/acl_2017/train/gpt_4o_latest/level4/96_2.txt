- Strengths:
(1) The introduction of a new dataset has the potential to benefit other researchers working in this domain.
(2) The paper proposes an algorithm that leverages sentiment-word-based machine translation to interpret sarcastic tweets.
- Weaknesses:
(1) The paper does not provide comprehensive statistical details about the constructed dataset.
(2) The integration of sentiment word clustering with machine translation techniques appears relatively straightforward, raising concerns about the level of novelty.
- General Discussion:
Overall, the paper is well-written, with carefully conducted experiments and reasonable analysis.
I provide the following comments for consideration:  
(1) The data collection process specifies that each tweet is annotated five times. How is the gold standard determined for performance evaluation?  
(2) While the MT technique (Moses) is widely recognized, it may not serve as a strong baseline. Including another MT technique, such as RNN, for comparison would strengthen the study.  
(3) Unlike most research that focuses on sarcasm detection, this work takes an interesting approach by attempting to interpret sarcasm to better reflect semantics.
