This paper introduces a unified annotation framework that integrates macrostructures and RST structures in Chinese news articles. Specifically, RST structure is applied at the paragraph level, while macrostructure is utilized at a higher level across paragraphs. The proposal that nuclearity should be context-dependent rather than solely relation-dependent is intriguing; however, the paper suffers from significant issues in its annotation methodology and experimental validation, as outlined below:
- The concept of a "primary-secondary" relationship is heavily emphasized throughout the paper, but it later becomes evident that this is essentially an extension of nuclearity to macrostructure, making it context-dependent rather than relation-dependent. Despite this, the nuclear-nuclear, nuclear-satellite, and satellite-nuclear statuses are "redefined" as entirely new concepts.
- The paper contains inaccuracies in its descriptions of established discourse theories. For instance, while there is extensive prior research on the pragmatic functions of text, the paper incorrectly claims this area is underexplored. The related work section also contains errors, such as conflating RST and the Chinese Dependency Discourse Treebank as representing coherence and cohesion, respectively. Additionally, the computational approach subsection fails to reference any work published after 2013, and the performance table for nuclearity classification confuses prior research on sentence-level and document-level parsing.
- The description of the macrostructure annotation process is unclear, and statistics for the macro labels are neither listed nor reported. The agreement calculation is problematic, as the paper states that "Our measurement data is only taken on the layer of leaf nodes," which does not seem sufficient to validate the annotation's reliability. Furthermore, the paper frequently mentions that "preliminary experiments show this is a good approach," but no evidence is provided to substantiate these claims. It is also unclear how the kappa values were calculated for this structured task; is the method consistent with the RST Discourse Treebank?
- The paper asserts that nuclearity status is closely tied to the relation label itself. However, it does not provide a baseline performance that relies solely on relation labels. Additionally, some features, such as "hierarchical characteristics," are mentioned but not adequately explained.
- While the paper's main contribution is the integration of macro and microstructures, the experiments only evaluate relations at the micro level, and even then, only for five selectively chosen relations. This limited evaluation does not adequately validate the macrostructure aspect of the proposed framework.
- The paper contains numerous grammatical errors. Furthermore, Figure 7 lacks accompanying text to illustrate the provided example.
