Review - Summary:  
This paper focuses on learning commonsense relationships between object categories (e.g., comparative size, weight, strength, rigidity, and speed) using unstructured text. The central idea is to exploit the correlation between action verbs and these comparative relationships (e.g., x throw y ⇒ x larger y).
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the significant challenge of extracting commonsense attribute relationships from text.
Weaknesses:  
- The paper would benefit from including more examples of object pairs, action verbs, and the corresponding predicted attribute relationships. What are some interesting action verbs and their associated attribute relationships? Additionally, the paper lacks an analysis or discussion of the types of errors the model produces.  
- The dataset contains only 3,656 object pairs, which is relatively small. How many distinct object categories are represented? Furthermore, how well does this approach scale to a larger number of object pairs?  
- The selection process for frame similarity factors and attribute similarity factors is not clearly explained.
General Discussion/Suggestions:  
- The authors should consider discussing the following work and comparing their method to approaches that directly mine attributes or attribute distributions before deriving comparative measures. What specific advantages does the proposed method offer over these more direct approaches?
