This paper introduces a novel method for metaphor identification grounded in a geometric approach. It is undoubtedly a fascinating piece of work, and I appreciated the opportunity to explore a completely new perspective. However, I have identified several issues that I would like the authors to address. I look forward to their responses to the following points.
- Strengths:
* The geometric approach to metaphor interpretation represents an entirely new avenue of research.  
* The paper is well-written and engaging.  
* The authors assert that the strength of their model lies in its simplicity, and I concur with this claim. However, the implications of this simplicity are not discussed in a straightforward manner. Please see the weaknesses section for further elaboration.

Regarding Writing  
====================  
While the paper is undoubtedly well-written, its primary shortcoming lies in its lack of clarity. Poetic language and elegance are commendable, but scientific writing demands a higher degree of precision and lucidity. I encourage the authors to consider the advice articulated here: https://chairs-blog.acl2017.org/2017/02/02/last-minute-writing-advice/.  
Here are my specific concerns regarding the writing:  
* The phrase "while providing a method which is effectively zero-shot" leaves readers confused, as the concept of zero-shot has not been introduced earlier in the paper.  
* In Figure 2, the terms "most," "neutral," and "least" metaphoric are used, but the criteria for these distinctions are unclear. How were these differentiations determined?  
* The paper provides insufficient details about the dataset. Without a clearer discussion of the data, the method becomes less intuitive.  
* While I enjoyed the analysis section, it is not evident why the proposed "simple" method (as claimed) outperforms existing techniques. Including concrete examples would enhance clarity and strengthen the argument.  
Technicality  
================  
The authors claim that "a strength of this model is its simplicity," and while this is true, the implications of this simplicity are not clearly articulated in the paper. While the mathematical and technical problem definition is sound, the broader implications of the approach remain difficult to grasp. This is particularly important given that the simplicity is highlighted as a key contribution of the work. Additionally, the paper demonstrates only a marginal accuracy improvement compared to prior research.  
* The comparison is limited to a single previous work, yet the paper makes broad claims about the method's zero-shot capabilities. This assertion feels somewhat overstated. For instance, could the method be extended to other domains, such as Twitter?
