This paper introduces a novel state-of-the-art deep learning model for semantic role labeling (SRL), which serves as a natural extension of the prior leading system (Zhou and Xu, 2015), incorporating recent advancements in initialization and regularization techniques from the deep learning literature. The proposed model achieves a notable 10% relative error reduction, representing a significant improvement for this task. Additionally, the paper provides comprehensive empirical analyses that highlight the model's strengths and remaining challenges, offering valuable insights for researchers in this domain.
While I recognize that the 3-point improvement in the F1 measure is a highly meaningful achievement from an engineering perspective, I believe the paper's primary contribution lies in its extensive experimental analysis and the deeper investigations presented in the analysis section. The detailed evaluations in Section 4 are conducted in a well-reasoned manner, yielding results that are both consistent with prior SRL literature and novel, such as the exploration of the relationship between syntactic parsing accuracy and SRL performance. Such analyses, which have often been overlooked in recent studies, are undoubtedly crucial for driving further advancements in the field.
The paper is well-written and well-organized.  
I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and strongly support its acceptance.
