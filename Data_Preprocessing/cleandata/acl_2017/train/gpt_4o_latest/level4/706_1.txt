Thank you for your response. I look forward to seeing your discussion on the impact of incentives and the role of language ambiguity within the domain.
Review prior to the author response:
The paper introduces a method for constructing natural language interfaces by enabling a group of users to define new concepts and syntax. This work represents a non-trivial extension of the approach presented in S. I. Wang, P. Liang, and C. Manning (2016), "Learning language games through interaction."
Questions:
- What is the size of the vocabulary employed in the experiments?
- How does this work relate to prior research on inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning?
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulated.
- It offers a compelling approach to addressing the challenge of managing a large set of potential programs while learning natural language interfaces.
Weaknesses:
- The authors should elaborate on how the incentives influence the final performance. Were alternative incentive structures explored?
- Although the paper suggests that the method could be extended to more practical domains, it is unclear how straightforward such extensions would be. How does the method scale with the size of the vocabulary required in a domain? Would increased ambiguity in natural language introduce additional challenges? These aspects are not adequately addressed in the current experimental setup.
- Incorporating a real-world application would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
