- Strengths:
The paper is thoroughly written and discusses its approach compared to
other approaches. The authors are aware that their findings are somewhat
limited regarding the mean F values.
- Weaknesses:
Some minor orthographical mistakes and some repetive clauses. In general the
paper would benefit if the sections 1 and 2 would be shortened to allow the
extension of sections 3 and 4.
The main goal is not laid out clearly enough, which may be a result of the
ambivalence of the paper's goals.
- General Discussion:
Table 1 should only be one column wide, while the figures, especially 3, 5, and
6 would greatly benefit from a two column width.
The paper was not very easy to understand during first read. Major improvements
could be achieved by straightening up the content.
