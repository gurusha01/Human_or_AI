- Strengths:
 - The paper is clearly written and well-structured. 
 - The system newly applied several techniques including global optimization to
end-to-end neural relation extraction, and the direct incorporation of the
parser representation is interesting.
 - The proposed system has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on both
ACE05 and CONLL04 data sets.
 - The authors include several analyses.
- Weaknesses:
 - The approach is incremental and seems like just a combination of existing
methods.  
 - The improvements on the performance (1.2 percent points on dev) are
relatively small, and no significance test results are provided.
- General Discussion:
- Major comments:
 - The model employed a recent parser and glove word embeddings. How did they
affect the relation extraction performance?
 - In prediction, how did the authors deal with illegal predictions?
- Minor comments:
 - Local optimization is not completely "local". It "considers structural
correspondences between incremental decisions," so this explanation in the
introduction is misleading.
 - Points in Figures 6 and 7 should be connected with straight lines, not
curves.
 - How are entities represented in "-segment"?
 - Some citations are incomplete. Kingma et al. (2014) is accepted to ICLR,
and Li et al. (2014) misses pages.
