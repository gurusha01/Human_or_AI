- Strengths:
This paper presents an extension to A* CCG parsing to include dependency
information.  Achieving this while maintaining speed and tractability is a very
impressive feature of this approach.  The ability to precompute attachments is
a nice trick.                  I also really appreciated the evaluation of the
effect of
the
head-rules on normal-form violations and would love to see more details on the
remaining cases.
- Weaknesses:
I'd like to see more analysis of certain dependency structures.  I'm
particularly interested in how coordination and relative clauses are handled
when the predicate argument structure of CCG is at odds with the dependency
structures normally used by other dependency parsers.
- General Discussion:
I'm very happy with this work and feel it's a very nice contribution to the
literature.  The only thing missing for me is a more in-depth analysis of the
types of constructions which saw the most improvement (English and Japanese)
and a discussion (mentioned above) reconciling Pred-Arg dependencies with those
of other parsers.
