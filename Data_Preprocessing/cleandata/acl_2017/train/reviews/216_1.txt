- Strengths:
1. The idea of assigning variable-length document segments with dependent
topics is novel. This prior knowledge is worth incorporated in the LDA-based
framework.
2. Whereas we do not have full knowledge on recent LDA literature, we find the
part of related work quite convincing.
3. The method proposed for segment sampling with O(M) complexity is impressive.
It is crucial for efficient computation. 
- Weaknesses:
1. Compared to Balikas COLING16's work, the paper has a weaker visualization
(Fig 5), which makes us doubt about the actual segmenting and assigning results
of document. It could be more convincing to give a longer exemplar and make
color assignment consistent with topics listed in Figure 4.
2. Since the model is more flexible than that of Balikas COLING16, it may be
underfitting, could you please explain this more?
- General Discussion:
The paper is well written and structured. The intuition introduced in the
Abstract and again exemplified in the Introduction is quite convincing. The
experiments are of a full range, solid, and achieves better quantitative
results against previous works. If the visualization part is stronger, or
explained why less powerful visualization, it will be more confident. Another
concern is about computation efficiency, since the seminal LDA work proposed to
use Variational Inference which is faster during training compared to MCMC, we
wish to see the author's future development.
