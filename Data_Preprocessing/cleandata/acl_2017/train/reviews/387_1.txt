- Strengths:
This paper tackles an interesting problem and provides a (to my knowledge)
novel and reasonable way of learning and combining cognitive features with
textual features for sentiment analysis and irony detection. The paper is 
clearly written and organized, and the authors provided a lot of useful detail
and informative example and plots. Most of the results are convincing, and the
authors did a good job comparing their approach and results with previous work.
- Weaknesses:
1. Just from the reading abstract, I expected that the authors' approach would
significantly outperform previous methods, and that using both the eye-gaze and
textual features consistently yields the best results. Upon reading the actual
results section, however, it seems like the findings were more mixed. I think
it would be helpful to update the abstract and introduction to reflect this. 
2. When evaluating the model on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, were the
sarcastic utterances included? Did the model do better on classifying the
non-sarcastic utterances than the sarcastic ones?
3. I understand why the eye-movement data would be useful for sarcasm
detection, but it wasn't as obvious to me why it would be helpful for
(non-sarcastic) sentiment classification beyond the textual features. 
- General Discussion:
This paper contains a lot of interesting content, and the approach seems solid
and novel to me. The results were a little weaker than I had anticipated from
the abstract, but I believe would still be interesting to the larger community
and merits publication.
