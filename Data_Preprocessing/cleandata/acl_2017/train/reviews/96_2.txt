- Strengths:
(1) A new dataset would be useful for other researchers in this area
(2) An algorithm with sentiment words based machine translation is proposed to
interpret sarcasm tweets.
- Weaknesses:
(1) Do not provide detailed statistics of constructed dataset.
(2) Integrating sentiment word clustering with machine translation techniques
only is simple and straightforward, novelty may be a challenging issue. 
- General Discussion:
Overall, this paper is well written. The experiments are conducted carefully
and the analysis is reasonable. 
I offer some comments as follows.
(1) According to data collection process, each tweet should be annotated
five times. How to determine which one is regarded as gold standard for measure
performance?
(2) The MT technique (Moses) is well known, but it may not be a good
baseline. Another MT technique (RNN) should be put together for comparison.   
(3) Differ from most work focuses on sarcasm detection. The research topic
is interesting. It attempts to interpret sarcasm for reflecting semantics.
