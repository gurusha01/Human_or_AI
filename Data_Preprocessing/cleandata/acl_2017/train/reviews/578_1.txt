- Strengths:
The paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for semantic graph parsing,
based on a well-designed transition system. 
The work is interesting, learning
semantic representations of DMRS, which is capable of resolving semantics
such as scope underspecification. This work shows a new scheme for
computational semantics, benefiting from an end-to-end transition-based
incremental framework, which resolves the parsing with low cost.
- Weaknesses:
  My major concern is that the paper only gives a very common introduction for
the
definition of DMRS and EP, and the example even makes me a little confused
because I cannot see anything special for DMRS. The description can be a little
more detailed, I think. However, upon the space limitation, it is
understandable. The same problem exists for the transition system of the
parsing model. If I do not have any background of MRS and EP, I can hardly
learn something from the paper, just seeing that this paper is very good.
- General Discussion:
  Overall, this paper is very interesting to me. I like the DMRS for semantic
parsing very much and like the paper very much. Hope that the open-source codes
and datasets can make this line of research being a hot topic.
