This paper presents a neural sequence-to-sequence model for encoding dialog
contexts followed by decoding system responses in open-domain conversations.
The authors introduced conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) which is a
deep neural network-based generative model to learn the latent variables for
describing responses conditioning dialog contexts and dialog acts.
The proposed models achieved better performances than the baseline based on RNN
encoder-decoder without latent variables in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.
This paper is well written with clear descriptions, theoretically sound ideas,
reasonable comparisons, and also detailed analysis.
I have just a few minor comments as follows:
- Would it be possible to provide statistical significance of the results from
the proposed models compared to the baseline in quantitative evaluation? The
differences don't seem that much for some metrics.
- Considering the importance of dialog act in kgCVAE model, the DA tagging
performances should affect the quality of the final results. Would it be there
any possibility to achieve further improvement by using better DA tagger?
Recently, deep learning models have achieved better performances than SVM also
in DA tagging.
- What do you think about doing human evaluation as a part of qualitative
analysis? It could be costly, but worth a try to analyze the results in more
pragmatic perspective.
- As a future direction, it could be also interesting if kgCVAE model is
applied to more task-oriented human-machine conversations which usually have
much richer linguistic features available than open conversation.
- In Table 1, 'BLUE-1 recall' needs to be corrected to 'BLEU-1 recall'.
