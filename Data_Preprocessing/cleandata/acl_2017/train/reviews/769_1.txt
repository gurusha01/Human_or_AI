This paper proposes a method for building dialogue agents involved in a
symmetric collaborative task, in which the agents need to strategically
communicate to achieve a common goal.  
I do like this paper.  I am very interested in how much data-driven techniques
can be used for dialogue management.  However, I am concerned that the approach
that this paper proposes, is actually not specific to symmetric collaborative
tasks, but to tasks that can be represented as graph operations, such as
finding an intersection between objects that the two people know about.
In Section 2.1, the authors introduce symmetric collaborative dialogue setting.
 However, such dialogs have been studied before, such as Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs
explored (Cognition '86), and Walker's furniture layout task (Journal of
Artificial Research '00).
On line 229, the authors say that this domain is too rich for slot-value
semantics.  However, their domain is based on attribute value pairs, so their
domain could use a semantics represenation based on attribute value-pairs, such
as first order logic.
Section 3.2 is hard to follow.        The authors often refer to Figure 2, but I
didn't find this example that helpful.        For example, for section 3.1, at what
point of the dialogue does this represent?  Is this the same after `anyone went
to columbia?'
