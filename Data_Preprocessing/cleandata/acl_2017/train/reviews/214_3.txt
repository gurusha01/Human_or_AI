- Strengths:
The macro discourse structure is a useful complement to micro structures like
RST. The release of the dataset would be helpful to a range of NLP
applications.
- Weaknesses:
1. Providing more comparisons with the existed CDTB will be better.
2. The "primary-secondary" relationship is mentioned a lot in this paper,
however, its difference with the nuclearity is unclear and not precisely
defined.
3. The experiment method is not clearly described in the paper.
- General Discussion:
