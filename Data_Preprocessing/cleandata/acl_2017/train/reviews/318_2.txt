- Strengths:
This paper proposes the use of HowNet to enrich embedings. The idea is
interesting and gives good results.
- Weaknesses:
The paper is interesting, but I am not sure the contibution is important enough
for a long paper. Also, the comparision with other works may not be fair:
authors should compare to other systems that use manually developed resources.
The paper is understandable, but it would help some improvement on the English.
- General Discussion:
