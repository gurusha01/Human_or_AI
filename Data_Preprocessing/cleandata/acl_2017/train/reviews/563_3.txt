This paper presents a comparison of several vector combination techniques on
the task of relation classification.
- Strengths:
The paper is clearly written and easy to understand.
- Weaknesses:
My main complaint about the paper is the significance of its contributions. I
believe it might be suitable as a short paper, but certainly not a full-length
paper.
Unfortunately, there is little original thought and no significantly strong
experimental results to back it up. The only contribution of this paper is an
'in-out' similarity metric, which is itself adapted from previous work. The
results seem to be sensitive to the choice of clusters and only majorly
outperforms a very naive baseline when the number of clusters is set to the
exact value in the data beforehand.
I think that relation classification or clustering from semantic vector space
models is a very interesting and challenging problem. This work might be useful
as an experimental nugget for future reference on vector combination and
comparison techniques, as a short paper. Unfortunately, it does not have the
substance to merit a full-length paper.
