- Strengths: the paper is well-written, except for a few places as described
below. The problem the paper tackles is useful. The proposed approach,
multigraph-based model, is a variant of MH. The empirical result is solid.
- Weaknesses: Clarification is needed in several places.
1. In section 3, in addition to the description of the previous model, MH, you
need point out the issues of MH which motivate you to propose a new model.
2. In section 4, I don't see the reason why separators are introduced. what
additional info they convene beyond T/I/O?
3. section 5.1 does not seem to provide useful info regarding why the new model
is superior.
4. the discussion in section 5.2 is so abstract that I don't get the insights
why the new model is better than MH. can you provide examples of spurious
structures? 
- General Discussion: The paper presents a new model for detecting overlapping
entities in text. The new model improves the previous state-of-the-art, MH, in
the experiments on a few benchmark datasets. But it is not clear why and how
the new model works better.
