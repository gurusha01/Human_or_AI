This one is a tough call, because I do think that there are some
important, salvageable technial results in here (notably the parsing
algorithm), but the paper as a whole has very little cohesion.        It is
united around an overarching view of formal languages in which a language
being "probabilistic" or not is treated as a formal property of the same 
variety as being closed under intersection or not.  In my opinion, what it 
means for a formal language to be probabilistic in this view has not been 
considered with sufficient rigor for this viewpoint to be compelling.
I should note, by the way, that the value of the formal results provided
mostly does not depend on the flimsiness of the overarching story.  So
what we have here is not bad research, but a badly written paper.  This needs 
more work.
I find it particulary puzzling that the organization of the paper
leaves so little space for elucidating the parsing result that
soundness and completeness are relegated to a continuation of the
paper in the form of supplementary notes.  I also find the mention of
probabilistic languages in the title of the paper to be very
disingenuous --- there is in fact no probabilistic reasoning in this
submission.
The sigificance of the intersection-closure result of section 3 is
also being somewhat overstated, I think.  Unless there is something
I'm not understanding about the restrictions on the right-hand sides
of rules (in which case, please elaborate), this is merely a matter of
folding a finite intersection into the set of non-terminal labels.
