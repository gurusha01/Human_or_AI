- Strengths: The idea to investigate the types of relations between lexical
items is very interesting and challenging. The authors make a good argument why
going beyond analogy testing makes sense.  
- Weaknesses: The paper does not justify or otherwise contextualize the choice
of clustering for evaluation, rather than using a classification task, despite
the fact that classification tasks are more straightforward to evaluate. No
attempt is being made to explain the overall level of the results. How well
would humans do on this task (given only the words, no context)?
- General Discussion:
I have read the authors' response.
