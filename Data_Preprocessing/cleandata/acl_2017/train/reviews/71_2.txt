- Strengths:
- Very impressive resource
- fully automatic system - particularly suitable for cross-lingual learning
across many languages
- Good evaluation both within and outside wikipedia. Good comparison to works
that employed manual resources.
- Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the paper can be improved.
- General Discussion:
This paper presents "a simple yet effective framework that can extract names
from 282 languages and link them to an English KB". Importantly, the system is
fully automatic, which is particularly important when aiming to learn across
such a large number of languages. Although this is far from trivial, the
authors are able to put their results in context and provide evaluation both
within and outside of wikipedia - I particularly like the way the put their
work in the context of previous work that uses manual resources, it is a good
scientific practice and I am glad they do not refrain from doing that in worry
that this would not look good.
The clarity of the paper can improve. This is not an easy paper to write due to
the quite complex process and the very large scale resource it generates.
However, the paper is not very well organized and at many points I felt that I
am reading a long list of details. I encourage the authors to try and give the
paper a better structure. As one example, I would be happy to see a better
problem definition and high level motivations from the very beginning. Other
examples has to do with better exposition of the motivations, decisions and
contributions in each part of the paper (I admire the efforts the authors have
already made, but I think this can done even better). This is an important
paper and it deserves a clearer presentation.
All in all I like the paper and think it provides an important resource. I
would like to see this paper presented in ACL 2017.
