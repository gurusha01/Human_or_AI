- Strengths:
(1) A deep CNN framework is proposed to extract and combine cognitive features
with textual features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. 
(2) The ideas is interesting and novelty.
- Weaknesses:
(1) Replicability would be an important concern. Researchers cannot replicate
the system/method for improvement due to lack of data for feature extraction. 
- General Discussion:
Overall, this paper is well written and organized. The experiments are
conducted carefully for comparison with previous work and the analysis is
reasonable. I offer some comments as follows.
(1)           Does this model be suitable on sarcastic/non-sarcastic utterances?
The
authors should provide more details for further analysis. 
(2)           Why the eye-movement data would be useful for
sarcastic/non-sarcastic
sentiment classification beyond the textual features? The authors should
provide more explanations.
