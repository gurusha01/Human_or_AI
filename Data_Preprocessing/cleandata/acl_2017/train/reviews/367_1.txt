- Strengths:
The paper addresses a long standing problem concerning automatic evaluation of
the output of generation/translation systems.
The analysis of all the available metrics is thorough and comprehensive.
The authors demonstrate a new metric with a higher correlation with human
judgements
The bibliography will help new entrants into the field.
- Weaknesses:
The paper is written as a numerical analysis paper, with very little insights
to linguistic issues in generation, the method of generation, the differences
in the output from a different systems and human generated reference.
It is unclear if the crowd source generated references serve well in the
context of an application that needs language generation.
- General Discussion:
Overall, the paper could use some linguistic examples (and a description of the
different systems) at the risk of dropping a few tables to help the reader with
intuitions.
