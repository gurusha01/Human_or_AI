This paper presents a novel framework for modelling symmetric collaborative
dialogue agents by dynamically extending knowledge graphs embeddings. The task
is rather simple: two dialogue agents (bot-bot, human-human or human-bot) talk
about their mutual friends. There is an underlying knowledge base for each
party in the dialogue and an associated knowledge graph. Items in the knowledge
graph have embeddings that are dynamically updated during the conversation and
used to generate the answers.
- Strengths: This model is very novel for both goal-directed and open ended
dialogue. The presented evaluation metrics show clear advantage for the
presented model.
- Weaknesses: In terms of the presentation, mathematical details of how the
embeddings are computed are not sufficiently clear. While the authors have done
an extensive evaluation, they haven't actually compared the system with an
RL-based dialogue manager which is current state-of-the-art in goal-oriented
systems. Finally, it is not clear how this approach scales to more complex
problems. The authors say that the KB is 3K, but actually what the agent
operates is about 10 (judging from Table 6).
- General Discussion: Overall, I think this is a good paper. Had the
theoretical aspects of the paper been better presented I would give this paper
an accept.
