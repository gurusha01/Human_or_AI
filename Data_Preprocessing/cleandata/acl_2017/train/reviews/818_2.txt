Summary: This paper aims to learn common sense relationships between object
categories (e.g comparative size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed) from
unstructured text.  The key insight of the paper is to leverage the correlation
of action verbs to these comparative relations (e.g x throw y => x larger y).
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a novel method to address an important problem of mining
common sense attribute relations from text.
Weaknesses:
- I would have liked to see more examples of objects pairs, action verbs, and
predicted attribute relations.                          What are some interesting
action
verbs
and
corresponding attributes relations?  The paper also lacks analysis/discussion 
on what kind of mistakes their model makes.
- The number of object pairs (3656) in the dataset is very small.  How many
distinct object categories are there?  How scalable is this approach to larger
number of object pairs?
- It's a bit unclear how the frame similarity factors and attributes similarity
factors are selected.
General Discussion/Suggestions:
- The authors should discuss the following work and compare against mining
attributes/attribute distributions directly and then getting a comparative
measure.  What are the advantages offered by the proposed method compared to a
more direct approach?
