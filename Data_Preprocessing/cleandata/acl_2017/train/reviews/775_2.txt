This paper presents a  method for metaphor identification based on geometric
approach. Certainly, very interesting piece of work. I enjoyed learning a
completely new perspective. However, I have a few issues, I like them to be
addressed by the authors. I would like to read author's response on the
following issues.
- Strengths:
* A geometric approach to metaphor interpretation is a new research strand
altogether. 
* The paper is well written.
* Author's claim is the beauty of their model lies in its simplicity, I do
agree with their claim. But the implication of the simplicity is not been
addressed in simple ways. Please refer the weakness section.
- Weaknesses:
Regarding writing
===============
No doubt the paper is well-written. But the major issue with the paper is its
lucidness. Indeed, poetic language, elegance is applaud-able, but clarity in
scientific writing is very much needed. 
I hope you will agree with most of the stuff being articulated here:

Let me put my objections on writing here:
* "while providing a method which is effectively zero-shot"..left readers in
the blank. The notion of zero-shot has not been introduced yet!
* Figure 2: most, neutral, least - metaphoric. How did you arrive at such
differentiations?
* Talk more about data. Otherwise, the method is less intuitive.
* I enjoyed reading the analysis section. But it is not clear why the proposed
simple (as claimed) method can over-perform than other existing techniques?
Putting some examples would be better, I believe.
Technicality
============
 "A strength of this model is its simplicity" - indeed, but the implication is
not vivid from the writing. Mathematical and technical definition of a problem
is one aspect, but the implication from the definition is quite hard to be
understood. When that's the note-able contribution of the paper. Comparing to
previous research this paper shows only marginal accuracy gain.
* Comparison only with one previous work and then claiming that the method is
capable of zero-shot, is slightly overstated. Is the method extendable to
Twitter, let's say.
