This paper presents a text classification method based on pre-training
technique using both labeled and unlabeled data. The authors reported
experimental results with several benchmark data sets including TREC data, and
showed that the method improved overall performance compared to other
comparative methods.
I think the approach using pre-training and fine-tuning itself is not a novel
one, but the originality is the use of both labeled and unlabeled data in the
pre-training step. 
The authors compare their results against three baselines, i.e. without
pre-training and a deep learning with unsupervised pre-training using deep
autoencoders, but I think that I would be interesting to compare the method
against other methods presented in the introduction section.
