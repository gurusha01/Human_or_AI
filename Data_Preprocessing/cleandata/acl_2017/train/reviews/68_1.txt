- Strengths: The paper broadens the applicability of readability scores to an
additional language, and produces a well-validated applicability score for
Vietnamese. 
- Weaknesses: The greatest weaknesses, with respect to ACL are that 1)
readability scores are of limited interest within the field of computational
linguistics. While they are somewhat useful in educational and public
communication fields, their impact on the progress of computational linguistics
is limited.  A minor weakness is in the writing: the paper has numerous minor
grammatical errors.
Although the discussion compares the performance of the PDS1 and PDW1 features
from the previous work, it is unclear how poorly the previous readability
measures perform, relevant to the one developed here, for practical purposes.
- General Discussion: This paper would be a stronger candidate for inclusion if
the corpus (and importantly, labels developed) were released. It could be used
more widely than the development of scalar readability metrics, and would
enable (e.g.) investigation of application of more powerful feature-selection
methods.
