Summary
This paper presents an empirical study to identify a latent dimension of
sentiment in word embeddings.
Strengths
 S1) Tackles a challenging problem of unsupervised sentiment analysis.
 S2) Figure 2, in particular, is a nice visualisation.
Weaknesses
 W1) The experiments, in particular, are very thin. I would recommend also
measuring F1 performance and expanding the number of techniques compared.
 W2) The methodology description needs more organisation and elaboration. The
ideas tested are itemised, but insufficiently justified. 
 W3) The results are quite weak in terms of the reported accuracy and depth of
analysis. Perhaps this work needs more development, particularly with
validating the central assumption that the Distributional Hypothesis implies
that opposite words, although semantically similar, are separated well in the
vector space?
