- Strengths:
The main strength promised by the paper is the speed advantage at the same
accuracy level.
- Weaknesses:
Presentation of the approach leaves a lot to be desired. Sections 3 and 4 need
to be much clearer, from concept definition to explaining the architecture and
parameterization. In particular Section 4.1 and the parameter tieing used need
to be crystal clear, since that is one of the main contributions of the paper.
More experiments supporting the vast speed improvements promised need to be
presented. The results in Table 2 are good but not great. A speed-up of 4-6X is
nothing all that transformative.
- General Discussion:
What exactly is "Viterbi prediction"? The term/concept is far from established;
the reader could guess but there must be a better way to phrase it.
