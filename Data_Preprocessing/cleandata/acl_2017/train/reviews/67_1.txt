- Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important issue, that is building ontologies or thesauri
- The methods make sense and seem well chosen
- Methods and setups are well detailed
- It looks like the authors outperform the state-of-the-art approach (but see
below for my concerns)
- Weaknesses:
The main weaknesses for me are evaluation and overall presentation/writing.
- The list of baselines is hard to understand. Some methods are really old and
it doesn't seem justified to show them here (e.g., Mpttern).
- Memb is apparently the previous state-of-the-art, but there is no mention to
any reference.
- While it looks like the method outperforms the previous best performing
approach, the paper is not convincing enough. Especially, on the first dataset,
the difference between the new system and the previous state-of-the-art one is
pretty small.
- The paper seriously lacks proofreading, and could not be published until this
is fixed – for instance, I noted 11 errors in the first column of page 2.
- The CilinE hierarchy is very shallow (5 levels only). However apparently, it
has been used in the past by other authors. I would expect that the deeper the
more difficult it is to branch new hyponym-hypernyms. This can explain the very
high results obtained (even by previous studies)...
- General Discussion:
The approach itself is not really original or novel, but it is applied to a
problem that has not been addressed with deep learning yet. For this reason, I
think this paper is interesting, but there are two main flaws. The first and
easiest to fix is the presentation. There are many errors/typos that need to be
corrected. I started listing them to help, but there are just too many of them.
The second issue is the evaluation, in my opinion. Technically, the
performances are better, but it does not feel convincing as explained above.
What is Memb, is it the method from Shwartz et al 2016, maybe? If not, what
performance did this recent approach have? I think the authors need to
reorganize the evaluation section, in order to properly list the baseline
systems, clearly show the benefit of their approach and where the others fail.
Significance tests  also seem necessary given the slight improvement on one
dataset.
