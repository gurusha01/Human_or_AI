- Strengths:
The proposed methods can save memory and improve decoding speed on CPUs without
losing (or a little loss) performance. 
- Weaknesses:
Since the determination of the convolutional codes of Algorithm 2 and Algorithm
3 can affect the final performance, I think it would be better if the authors
can explore a good method for it. And I think the argument of "Experiments
show the proposed model achieves translation accuracies that approach the
softmax, while reducing memory usage on the order of 1/10 to 1/1000, and also
improving decoding speed on CPUs by x5 to x20." in the Abstract is not
rigorous. As far as I know, your experiments setting with "Binary" and
"Hybrid-512" on ASPEC corpus show the improvements of decoding speed on
CPUs by x20, but the BLEU scores are too low. So this is not a valid
conclusion.
- General Discussion:
This paper proposes an efficient prediction method for neural machine
translation, which predicts a binary code for each word, to reduce the
complexity of prediction. The authors also proposed to use the improved (error
correction) binary codes method to improve the prediction accuracy and the
hybrid softmax/binary model to balance the prediction accuracy and efficiency.
The proposed methods can save memory and improve decoding speed without losing
(or a little loss) performance. I think this is a good paper.
