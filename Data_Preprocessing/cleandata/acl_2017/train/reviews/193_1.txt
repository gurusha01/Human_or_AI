This paper introduces UCCA as a target representation for semantic parsing and
also describes a quite successful transition-based parser for inference into
that representation. I liked this paper a lot. I believe there is a lot of
value simply in the introduction of UCCA (not new, but I believe relatively new
to this community), which has the potential to spark new thinking about
semantic representations of text. I also think the model was well thought out.
While the model itself was fairly derivative of existing transition-based
schemes, the extensions the authors introduced to make the model applicable in
this domain were reasonable and well-explained, at what I believe to be an
appropriate level of detail.
The empirical evaluation was pretty convincing -- the results were good, as
compared to several credible baselines, and the authors demonstrated this
performance in multiple domains. My biggest complaint about this paper is the
lack of multilingual evaluation, especially given
that the formalism being experimented with is exactly one that is supposed to
be fairly universal. I'm reasonably sure multilingual UCCA corpora exist (in
fact, I think the "20k leagues" corpus used in this paper is one such), so it
would be good to see results in a language other than English.
One minor point: in section 6, the authors refer to their model as
"grammarless", which strikes me as not quite correct. It's true that the UCCA
representation isn't derived from linguistic notions of syntax, but it still
defines a way to construct a compositional abstract symbolic representation of
text, which to me, is precisely a grammar. (This is clearly a quibble, and I
don't know why it irked me enough that I feel compelled to address it, but it
did.)
Edited to add: Thanks to the authors for their response.
