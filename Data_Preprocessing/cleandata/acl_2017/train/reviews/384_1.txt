- Strengths:
 - the model if theoretically solid and motivated by formal semantics. 
- Weaknesses:
 - The paper is about is-a relation extraction but the majority of literature
about taxonomization is not referenced in the paper, inter alia:

 - Experiments are poor, they only compare against "Hearst patterns" without
taking into account the works previously cited.
- General Discussion:
 The paper is easy to follow and the supplementary material is also well
written and useful, however the paper lack of references of is a relation
extraction and taxonomization literature. The same apply for the experiments.
In fact no meaningful comparison is performed and the authors not even take
into account the existence of other systems (more recent than hearst patterns).
I read authors answers but still i'm not convinced that they couldn't perform
more evaluations. I understand that they have a solid theoretical motivation
but still, i think that comparison are very important to asses if the
theoretical intuitions of the authors are confirmed also in practice. While
it's true that all the works i suggested as comparison build taxonomies, is
also true that a comparison is possible considering the edges of a taxonomy.
Anyway, considering the detailed author answer and the discussion with the
other reviewer i can rise my score to 3 even if i still think that this paper
is poor of experiments and does not frame correctly in the is-a relation
extraction / taxonomy building literature.
