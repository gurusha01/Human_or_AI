Strengths:
- Well-written, well-organized
- Incorporate topical segmentation to copula LDA to enable the joint learning
of segmentation and latent models
- Experimental setting is well-designed and show the superiority of the
proposed method from several different indicators and datasets
Weaknesses:
- No comparison with "novel" segmentation methods
General Discussion:
This paper presents segLDAcop, a joint latent model for topics and segments.
This model is based on the copula LDA and incorporates the topical segmentation
to the copula LDA. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments by using
several different datasets and evaluation metrics to show the superiority of
their model.
This paper is well-written and well-organized. The proposed model is a
reasonable extension of the copula LDA to enable the joint inference of
segmentations and topics. Experimental setting is carefully designed and the
superiority of the proposed model is fairly validated.
One concern is that the authors only use the simple NP segmentation and single
word segmentation as segments of the previous method. As noted in the paper,
there are many work to smartly generate segments before running LDA though it
is largely affected by the bias of statistical or linguistic tools used. The
comparison with more novel (state-of-the-art) segments would be preferable to
precisely show the validity of the proposed method.
