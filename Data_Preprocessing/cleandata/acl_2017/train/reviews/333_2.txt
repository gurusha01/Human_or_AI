- Strengths:
The paper is very clear and well-written. It proposes a novel approach to
abstractive sentence summarization; basically sentence compression that is not
constrained to having the words in the output be present in the input. 
- Excellent comparison with many baseline systems. 
- Very thorough related work. 
- Weaknesses:
The criticisms are very minor:
- It would be best to report ROUGE F-Score for all three datasets. The reasons
for reporting recall on one are understandable (the summaries are all the same
length), but in that case you could simply report both recall and F-Score. 
- The Related Work should come earlier in the paper. 
- The paper could use some discussion of the context of the work, e.g. how the
summaries / compressions are intended to be used, or why they are needed. 
- General Discussion:
- ROUGE is fine for this paper, but ultimately you would want human evaluations
of these compressions, e.g. on readability and coherence metrics, or an
extrinsic evaluation.
