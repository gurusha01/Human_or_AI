- Strengths:
The approach described in the manuscript outperformed the previous approaches
and achieved the state-of-the-art result.
Regarding data, the method used the combination of market and text data.
The approach used word embeddings to define the weight of each lexicon term by
extending it to the similar terms in the document.
- Weaknesses:
Deep-learning based methods were known to be able to achieve relatively good
performances without much feature engineering in sentimental analysis. More
literature search is needed to compare with the related works would be better.
The approach generally improved performance by feature-based methods without
much novelty in model or proposal of new features.
- General Discussion:
The manuscript described an approach in sentimental analysis. The method used a
relatively new method of using word embeddings to define the weight of each
lexicon term. However, the novelty is not significant enough.
