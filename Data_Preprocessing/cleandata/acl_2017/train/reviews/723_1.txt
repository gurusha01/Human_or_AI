This is a nice paper on morphological segmentation utilizing word 
embeddings. The paper presents a system which uses word embeddings to 
both measure local semantic similarity of word pairs with a potential 
morphological relation, and global information about the semantic validity
of potential morphological segment types. The paper is well written and 
represents a nice extension to earlier approaches on semantically driven 
morphological segmentation.
The authors present experiments on Morpho Challenge data for three 
languages: English, Turkish and Finnish. These languages exhibit varying 
degrees of morphological complexity. All systems are trained on Wikipedia 
text. 
The authors show that the proposed MORSE system delivers clear 
improvements w.r.t. F1-score for English and Turkish compared to the well 
known Morfessor system which was used as baseline. The system fails to 
reach the performance of Morfessor for Finnish. As the authors note, this 
is probably a result of the richness of Finnish morphology which leads to 
data sparsity and, therefore, reduced quality of word embeddings. To 
improve the performance for Finnish and other languages with a similar 
degree of morphological complexity, the authors could consider word 
embeddings which take into account sub-word information. For example,

The authors critique the existing Morpho Challenge data sets. 
For example, there are many instances of incorrectly segmented words in 
the material. Moreover, the authors note that, while some segmentations 
in the the data set may be historically valid (for example the 
segmentation of business into busi-ness), these segmentations are no 
longer semantically motivated. The authors provide a new data set 
consisting of 2000 semantically motivated segmentation of English word 
forms from the English Wikipedia. They show that MORSE deliver highly 
substantial improvements compared to Morfessor on this data set.
In conclusion, I think this is a well written paper which presents 
competitive results on the interesting task of semantically driven 
morphological segmentation. The authors accompany the submission with 
code and a new data set which definitely add to the value of the 
submission.
