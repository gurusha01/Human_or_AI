Strengths:
This paper presents an approach to creating concept maps using crowdsourcing.
The general ideas are interesting and the main contribution lies in the
collection of the dataset. As such, I imagine that the dataset will be a
valuable resource for further research in this field. Clearly a lot of effort
has gone into this work.
Weaknesses:
Overall I felt this paper a bit overstated in placed. As an example, the
authors claim a new crowdsourcing scheme as one of their contributions. This
claims is quite strong though and it reads more like the authors are applying
best practice in crowdsourcing to their work. This isn't a novel methods
then, it's rather a well thought and sound application of existing knowledge.
Similarly, the authors claim that they develop and present a new corpus. This
seems true and I can see how a lot of effort was invested in its preparation,
but then Section 4.1 reveals that actually this is based on an existing
dataset. 
This is more a criticism of the presentation than the work though.
General discussion:
Where do the summary sentences come from for the crowdsource task? Aren't
they still quite subjective?
Where do the clusters come from? Are they part of the TAC2008b dataset? 
In 4.6 expert annotators are used to create the gold standard concept maps.
More information is needed in this section I would say as it seems to be quite
crucial. How were they trained, what made them experts?
