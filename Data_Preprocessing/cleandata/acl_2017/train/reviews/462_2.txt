This paper investigates sentiment signals in  companies' annual 10-K filing
reports to forecast volatility. 
The authors evaluate information retrieval term weighting models which are
seeded with a finance-oriented sentiment lexicon and expanded with word
embeddings. PCA is used to reduce dimensionality before Support Vector
Regression is applied for similarity estimation.
In addition to text-based features, the authors also use non-text-based market
features (e.g. sector information and volatility estimates).
Multiple fusion methods to combine text features with market features are
evaluated.
COMMENTS
It would be interesting to include two more experimental conditions, namely 1)
a simple trigram SVM which does not use any prior sentiment lexica, and 2)
features that reflect delta-IDFs scores for individual features.
As an additional baseline, it would be good to see binary features.
