- Strengths:
This paper presents a sentence based approach to generating memorable mnemonics
for numbers. The evaluation study presented in the paper shows that the
sentence based approach indeed produces memorable mnemonics for short 8-digit
numbers (e.g. 86101521 --> Officiate Wasteland).
Overall the paper presents the problem, the background literature and the
solution in sufficient detail. Because memorizing numbers (e.g. phone numbers
and account numbers) is sufficiently common, this is an interesting problem.
- Weaknesses:
The proposed solution does not seem to scale-up well for longer numbers; seems
to work well with 8-digit numbers though. But many numbers that people need to
memorize such as phone numbers and credit card numbers are longer than
8-digits. Besides, a number may have a structure (e.g. a phone number has a
country code + area code + personal number) which people exploit while
memorizing numbers. As stated above, this paper addresses an important problem
but the current solution needs to be improved further (several ideas have been
listed by the authors in section 6).
- General Discussion:
The current presented approach, in comparison to existing approaches, is
promising.
