This paper propose a general framework for analyzing similarities and
differences in term meaning and representation in different contexts.
- Strengths:
* The framework proposed in this paper is generalizable and can be applied to
different applications, and accommodate difference notation of context,
different similarity functions, different type of word annotations. 
* The paper is well written. Very easy to follow.
- Weaknesses:
* I have concerns in terms of experiment evaluation. The paper uses qualitative
evaluation metrics, which makes it harder to evaluate the effectiveness, or
even the validity of proposed method. For example, table 1 compares the result
with Hamilton et, al using different embedding vector by listing top 10 words
that changed from 1900 to 1990. It's hard to tell, quantitatively, the
performances of CCLA. The same issue also applies to experiment 2 (comparative
lexical analysis over context). The top 10 words may be meaningful, but what
about top 20, 100? what about the words that practitioner actually cares?
Without addressing the evaluation issue, I find it difficult to claim that CCLA
will benefit downstream applications.
