- strengths
This is a novel approach to modeling the compositional structure of complex
categories that maintains a set theoretic interpretation of common nouns and
modifiers, while also permitting a distributional interpretation of head
modification. The approach is well motivated and clearly defined and the
experiments show that show that this decomposed representation can improve upon
the Hearst-pattern derived IsA relations upon which it is trained in terms of
coverage.
- weaknesses
The experiments are encouraging. However, it would be nice to see ROC curves
for the new approach alone, not in an ensemble with Hearst patterns. Table 5
tells us that Mods_I increases coverage at the cost of precision and Figure 2
tells us that Mods_I matches Hearst pattern precision for the high precision
region of the data. However, neither of these tell us whether the model can
distinguish between the high and low precision regions, and the ROC curves
(which would tell us this) are only available for ensembled models.
I believe that Eqn. 7 has an unnecessary $w$ since it is already the case that
$w=D(\rangle e, p, o \langle)$.
- discussion
Overall, this is a nice idea that is well described and evaluated. I think this
paper would be a good addition to ACL.
