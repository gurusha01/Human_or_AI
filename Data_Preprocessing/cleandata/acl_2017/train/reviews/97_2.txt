- Strengths:
This paper tries to tackle a very practical problem: automated short answer
scoring (SAS), in particular for Japanese which hasn't gotten as much attention
as, say, English-language SAS.
- Weaknesses:
The paper simply reads like a system description, and is light on experiments
or insights. The authors show a lack of familiarity with more recent related
work (aimed at English SAS), both in terms of methodology and evaluation. Here
are a couple:

There was also a recent Kaggle competition that generated several
methodologies:

- General Discussion:
To meet ACL standards, I would have preferred to see more experiments (feature
ablation studies, algorithm comparisons) that motivated the final system
design, as well as some sort of qualitative evaluation with a user study of how
the mixed-initiative user interface features led to improved scores. As it is,
it feels like a work in progress without any actionable new methods or
insights.
Also, Pearson/Spearman correlation and kappa scores are considered more
appropriate than accuracy for these sorts of ordinal human scores.
