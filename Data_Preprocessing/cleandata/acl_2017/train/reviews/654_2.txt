This paper presents a new state-of-the-art deep learning model for semantic
role labeling (SRL) that is a natural extension of the previous
state-of-the-art system (Zhou and Xu, 2015) with recent best practices for
initialization and regularization in the deep learning literature.
The model gives a 10% relative error reduction which is a big gain on this
task. The paper also gives in-depth empirical analyses to reveal the strengths
and the remaining issues, that give a quite valuable information to the
researchers in this field. 
Even though I understand that the improvement of 3 point in F1 measure is a
quite meaningful result from the engineering point of view, I think the main
contribution of the paper is on the extensive analysis in the experiment
section and a further in-depth investigation on analysis section. The detailed
analyses shown in Section 4 are performed in a quite reasonable way and give
both comparable results in SRL literature and novel information such as
relation between accuracies in syntactic parsing and SRL. This type of analysis
had often been omitted in recent papers. However, it is definitely important
for further improvement.
The paper is well-written and well-structured. 
I really enjoyed the paper and would like to see it accepted.
