- Strengths:
1. Interesting research problem
2. The method in this paper looks quite formal.
3. The authors have released their dataset with the submission.
4. The design of experiments is good.
- Weaknesses:
1. The advantage and disadvantage of the transductive learning has not yet
discussed.
- General Discussion:
In this paper, the authors introduce a transductive learning approach for
Chinese hypernym prediction, which is quite interesting problem. The authors
establish mappings from entities to hypernyms in the embedding space directly,
which sounds also quite novel. This paper is well written and easy to follow.
The first part of their method, preprocessing using embeddings, is widely used
method for the initial stage. But it's still a normal way to preprocess the
input data. The transductive model is an optimization framework for non-linear
mapping utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. The attached supplementary
notes about the method makes it more clear. The experimental results have shown
the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. The authors also
released dataset, which contributes to similar research for other researchers
in future.
