- Strengths:
The paper proposes a new method for word sense induction from synonymy
dictionaries. The method presents a conceptual improvement over existing ones
and demonstrates robust performance in empirical evaluation. The evaluation was
done thoroughly, using a number of benchmarks and strong baseline methods. 
- Weaknesses:
Just a couple of small points. I would like to see more discussion of the
nature of the evaluation. First, one observes that all models' scores are
relatively low, under 50% F1. Is there room for much improvement or is there a
natural ceiling of performance due to the nature of the task? The authors
discuss lexical sparsity of the input data but I wonder how much of the
performance gap this sparsity accounts for. 
Second, I would also like to see some discussion of the evaluation metric
chosen. It is known that word senses can be analyzed at different levels of
granularity, which can naturally affect the scores of any system.
Another point is that it is not clear how the authors obtained vectors for word
senses that they used in 3.4, if the senses are only determined after this
step, and anyway senses are not marked in the input corpora. 
- General Discussion:
I recommend the paper for presentation at the ACL Meeting. Solid work.
