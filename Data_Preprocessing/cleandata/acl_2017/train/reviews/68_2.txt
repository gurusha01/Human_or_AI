- General Discussion:
In this paper the authors present a simple formula for readability assessment
of Vietnamese Text. Using a combination of features such as word count,
sentence length etc they train a simple regression model to estimate the
readability of the documents. 
One of the major weaknesses of the paper its lack of technical contribution -
while early work in readability assessment employed simple methods like the one
outlined in this paper, recent work on predicting readability uses more robust
methods that rely on language models for instance (Eg :
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mx223/readabilitybea2016.pdf,
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/pubs/ITL-readability-invited-article-v10
-camera.pdf). A comparison with such methods could be a useful contribution and
make the paper stronger especially if simple methods such as those outlined in
this paper can compete with more complicated models. 
Baseline experiments with SMOG, Gunning Fog index etc should also be presented
as well as the other Vietnamese metrics and datasets that the authors cite. 
Another problem is that while previous readability indices were more selective
and classified content into granular levels corresponding to grade levels (for
instance), the authors use a coarse classification scheme to label documents as
easy, medium and hard which makes the metric uninteresting. (Also, why not use
a classifier?)
The work is probably a bit too pre-mature and suffers from significant
weaknesses to be accepted at this stage. I would encourage the authors to
incorporate suggested feedback to make it better. 
The paper also has quite a few grammatical errors which should be addressed in
any future submission.
