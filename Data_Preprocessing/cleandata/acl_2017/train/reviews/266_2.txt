- Strengths: An interesting and comprehensive study of the effect of using
special-domain corpora for training word embeddings.  Clear explanation of the
assumptions, contributions, methodology, and results.  Thorough evaluation of
various aspects of the proposal.
- Weaknesses: Some conclusions are not fully backed up by the numerical
results.  E.g., the authors claim that for Catalan, the improvements of using
specific corpora for training word vectors is more pronounced than English.  I
am not sure why this conclusion is made based on the results.  E.g., in Table
6, none of the combination methods outperform the baseline for the
300-dimension vectors.
- General Discussion: The paper presents a set of simple, yet interesting
experiments that suggest word vectors (here trained using the skip-gram method)
largely benefit from the use of relevant (in-domain) and subjective corpora. 
The paper answers important questions that are of benefit to practitioners of
natural language processing.  The paper is also very well-written, and very
clearly organized.
