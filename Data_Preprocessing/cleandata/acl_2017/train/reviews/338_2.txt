This paper investigates the cold-start problem in review spam detection. The
authors first qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the cold-start problem.
They observe that there is no enough prior data from a new user in this
realistic scenario. The traditional features fail to help to identify review
spam. Instead, they turn to rely on the abundant textual and behavioral
information of the existing reviewer to augment the information of a new user.
In specific, they propose a neural network to represent the review of the new
reviewer with the learnt word embedding and jointly encoded behavioral
information. In the experiments, the authors make comparisons with traditional
methods, and show the effectiveness of their model.
- Strengths:
The paper is well organized and clearly written. The idea of jointly encoding
texts and behaviors is interesting. The cold-start problem is actually an
urgent problem to several online review analysis applications. In my knowledge,
the previous work has not yet attempted to tackle this problem. This paper is
meaningful and presents a reasonable analysis. And the results of the proposed
model can also be available for downstream detection models.
- Weaknesses:
In experiments, the author set the window width of the filters in the CNN
module to 2. Did the author try other window widths, for example width `1' to
extract unigram features, `3' to trigram, or use them together? 
The authors may add more details about the previous work in the related work
section. More specifically description would help the readers to understand the
task clearly.

Sec 1: ``...making purchase decision...'' should be ``making a/the purchase
decision''

exploring''
Sec 1: ``...there is on sufficient behaviors...'' should be "there are no
sufficient behaviors''

abundant behavior''

- General Discussion:
It is a good paper and should be accepted by ACL.
