This paper proposed to explore discourse structure, as defined by Rhetorical
Structure Theory (RST) to improve text categorization. A RNN with attention
mechanism is employed to compute a representation of text. The experiments on
various of dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. Below are my
comments:
(1) From Table 2, it shows that "UNLABELED" model performs better on four
out of five datasets than the "FULL" model. The authors should explain more
about this, because intuitively, incorporating additional relation labels
should bring some benefits. Is the performance of relation labelling so bad and
it hurts the performance instead?
(2) The paper also transforms the RST tree into a dependency structure as a
pre-process step. Instead of transforming, how about keep the original tree
structure and train a hierarchical model on that?
(3) For the experimental datasets, instead of comparing with only one dataset
with each of the previous work, the authors may want to run experiments on more
common datasets used by previous work.
