- Strengths:
The ideas and the task addressed in this paper are beautiful and original.
Combining indirect supervision (accepting the resulting parse) with direct
supervision (giving a definition) makes it a particularly powerful way of
interactively building a natural language interface to a programming language.
The proposed has a wide range of potential applications. 
- Weaknesses:
The paper has several typos and language errors and some text seems to be
missing from the end of section 6. It could benefit from careful proofreading
by a native English speaker. 
- General Discussion:
The paper presents a method for collaborative naturalization of a 'core'
programming language by a community of users through incremental expansion of
the syntax of the language. This expansion is performed interactively, whereby
a user just types a command in the naturalized language, and then either
selects through a list of candidate parses or provides a definition also in the
natural language. The users give intuitive definitions using literals instead
of variables (e.g. "select orange"), which makes this method applicable to
non-programmers. 
A grammar is induced incrementally which is used to provide the candidate
parses.
I have read the authors' response.
