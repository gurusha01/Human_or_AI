- Strengths
This paper deals with the issue of finding word polarity orientation in an
unsupervised manner, using word embeddings.
- Weaknesses
The paper presents an interesting and useful idea, however, at this moment, it
is not applied to any test case. The ideas on which it is based are explained
in an "intuitive" manner and not thoroughly justified. 
- General Discussion
This is definitely interesting work. The paper would benefit from more
experiments being carried out, comparison with other methods (for example, the
use of the Normalized Google Distance by authors such as (Balahur and Montoyo,
2008) - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4906796/) and the
application of the knowledge obtained to a real sentiment analysis scenario. At
this point, the work, although promising, is in its initial phase.
