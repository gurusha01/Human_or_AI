This paper proposes a self-learning framework to learn bilingual word embedding mappings using a very small seed dictionary, as little as 25 word pairs, or even an automatically generated list of numerals. The method exploits the structural similarity of independently trained embedding spaces and works by iteratively learning a mapping and inducing a new dictionary until convergence.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A simple self-learning framework that can learn high-quality bilingual word embeddings from very little bilingual evidence.
2. The method is able to work with small seed dictionaries, including automatically generated lists of numerals, and still achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources.
3. The proposed framework is able to learn bilingual word embeddings without any real bilingual data, making it a promising approach for low-resource languages.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning high-quality bilingual word embeddings.
2. The method is simple and efficient, making it easy to implement and scalable to large datasets.
3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the optimization objective and the behavior of the self-learning framework, providing insights into how the method works and its potential limitations.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The method relies on the structural similarity of independently trained embedding spaces, which may not always be the case, particularly for distant language pairs.
2. The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly those using parallel corpora or more sophisticated optimization techniques.
3. The method may not be robust to noise or errors in the seed dictionary, which could affect its performance in practice.
Questions to authors:
1. How does the method perform on more distant language pairs, where the structural similarity of the embedding spaces may be weaker?
2. Can the method be improved by using more sophisticated optimization techniques or regularization methods to prevent overfitting?
3. How does the method compare to other state-of-the-art methods using parallel corpora or more advanced techniques, such as adversarial training or attention mechanisms?
