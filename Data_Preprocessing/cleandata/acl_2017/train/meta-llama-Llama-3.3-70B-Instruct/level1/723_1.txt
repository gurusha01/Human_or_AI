This paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which leverages both orthographic and semantic features to segment words into morphemes. The authors claim that their approach is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of semantic information: MORSE incorporates semantic knowledge into the morpheme segmentation process, which helps to eliminate over-segmentation errors.
2. Vocabulary-wide evaluation: The framework evaluates morphological relations at a vocabulary-wide level, considering the consistency of difference vectors between pairs of words.
3. New dataset: The authors introduce a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to address the deficiencies of existing benchmarking datasets, such as the Morpho Challenge dataset.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. State-of-the-art results: MORSE achieves state-of-the-art results on the Morpho Challenge dataset and outperforms other published results.
2. Robustness to over-segmentation: The framework's use of semantic information helps to reduce over-segmentation errors, as demonstrated on a set of words that should not be segmented from a semantic perspective.
3. Flexibility: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of MORSE, allowing users to control the trade-off between precision and recall.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited vocabulary size: MORSE is limited to a vocabulary size of 1M, which may not be sufficient for languages with productive morphology, such as Finnish.
2. Greedy inference approach: The framework's inference stage uses a greedy approach, which may lead to suboptimal performance if a wrong segmentation is made at an early stage.
3. Concatenative morphology: MORSE is designed for concatenative morphology and may not perform well on languages that exhibit non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the vocabulary size in MORSE, and what are the potential consequences of increasing the vocabulary size on the performance of the framework?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage, and how it will impact the wider adoption of MORSE by the community?
3. How do the authors plan to extend MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology, and what are the potential challenges and opportunities in this direction?
