This paper proposes a novel method called morph-fitting, which injects morphological knowledge into word vector spaces to improve their quality, especially for morphologically rich languages. The method uses simple language-specific rules to extract linguistic constraints, which are then used to fine-tune the vector space.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Morph-fitting method: The authors propose a novel method that uses morphological constraints to improve word vector spaces, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Language-agnostic approach: The method is language-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to any language with minimal modifications, making it a valuable contribution to the field of multilingual NLP.
3. Improved word similarity performance: The authors demonstrate that morph-fitting improves word similarity performance across four languages, including English, German, Italian, and Russian.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Robustness of the method: The authors show that the method is robust and can be applied to various word vector spaces, including those induced by different architectures.
2. Improved performance on downstream tasks: The authors demonstrate that morph-fitting improves the performance of downstream language understanding models, such as dialogue state tracking.
3. Simple and efficient implementation: The method is simple to implement and requires minimal computational resources, making it a practical solution for improving word vector spaces.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation on downstream tasks: The authors only evaluate the method on one downstream task, dialogue state tracking, and it would be beneficial to see evaluations on other tasks as well.
2. Dependence on language-specific rules: The method relies on language-specific rules, which may not be available for all languages, and it would be beneficial to explore more automated methods for extracting linguistic constraints.
3. Limited analysis of the constraints: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the constraints used in the method, and it would be beneficial to see a more in-depth analysis of the constraints and their impact on the method's performance.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the method to other languages, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the language-specific rules used in the method, and how they were selected?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the method on other downstream tasks, and what tasks do they think would be most beneficial to evaluate?
