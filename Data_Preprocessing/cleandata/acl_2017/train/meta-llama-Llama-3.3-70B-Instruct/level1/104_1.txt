This paper proposes a novel Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding model to address the ambiguity of entity mentions in a unified semantic space. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. A new method for learning multiple sense embeddings for each mention by jointly modeling words from textual contexts and entities derived from a knowledge base.
2. An efficient language model-based approach to disambiguate each mention to a specific sense.
3. The application of the proposed disambiguation method and multi-prototype mention embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art results on the entity linking benchmark dataset.
The strengths of this submission are: 
1. The proposed Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding model effectively addresses the ambiguity of entity mentions, which is a significant challenge in integrating text and knowledge into a unified semantic space.
2. The use of a language model-based approach for disambiguation is efficient and demonstrates high-quality results in experiments.
3. The application of the proposed method to entity linking as a study case provides a clear demonstration of its effectiveness and achieves state-of-the-art results.
4. The paper provides both qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the high quality of the word, entity, and multi-prototype mention embeddings.
The weaknesses of this submission are: 
1. The novelty of the proposed method may be limited, as similar approaches have been explored in previous works.
2. The evaluation of the proposed method is primarily based on a single benchmark dataset, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its generalizability.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations and potential applications of the proposed method.
Questions to Authors: 
1. How does the proposed Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding model handle cases where the knowledge base is incomplete or outdated?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the language model-based approach used for disambiguation, and how it is optimized for entity linking tasks?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to other tasks beyond entity linking, and what potential challenges do they anticipate?
