Summary of the Paper
This paper introduces a novel framework, SHAPEWORLD, for evaluating multimodal deep learning models with respect to their language understanding and generalization abilities. The framework generates artificial data according to the experimenter's specifications, allowing for controlled evaluation of tasks that require generalization abilities. The authors demonstrate the potential of their methodology by evaluating a multimodal architecture on four different tasks and show that their framework provides insights into the model's capabilities and limitations.
