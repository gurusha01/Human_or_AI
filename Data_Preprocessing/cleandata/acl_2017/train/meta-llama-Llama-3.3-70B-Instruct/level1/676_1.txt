This paper proposes a novel method for calculating the output layer in neural machine translation systems, which reduces computation time and memory requirements. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Binary code prediction model: The authors propose a method that predicts output words indirectly using dense bit arrays, which reduces the computational complexity from O(HV) to O(H log V).
2. Hybrid softmax/binary model: The authors introduce a hybrid model that combines softmax prediction and binary code prediction, which improves the robustness of the binary code prediction model.
3. Error-correcting codes: The authors apply convolutional error-correcting codes to introduce redundancy in the bit array, which improves the robustness of the binary code prediction model.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Significant reduction in computation time and memory requirements: The proposed method reduces the computational complexity and memory requirements of the output layer, making it more efficient and scalable.
2. Competitive translation accuracy: The proposed method achieves competitive translation accuracy with standard softmax-based models, while reducing the output layer size and improving decoding speed.
3. Robustness to errors: The introduction of error-correcting codes improves the robustness of the binary code prediction model, making it more reliable and accurate.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Increased complexity of the model: The proposed method introduces additional complexity, such as the need to design and train the binary code prediction model and the error-correcting codes.
2. Limited evaluation: The paper only evaluates the proposed method on two translation tasks, and it would be beneficial to evaluate it on more tasks and datasets to demonstrate its generalizability.
3. Lack of comparison to other methods: The paper does not compare the proposed method to other methods that reduce computation time and memory requirements, such as hierarchical softmax or differentiated softmax.
Questions to authors:
1. How did you determine the optimal size of the softmax layer in the hybrid model?
2. Can you provide more details on the design and training of the error-correcting codes?
3. How do you plan to extend this work to other natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling or text classification?
