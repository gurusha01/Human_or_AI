This paper proposes a macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema, which integrates the primary-secondary relationship at both micro and macro levels. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of a macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema: The authors propose a novel representation schema that combines the micro and macro discourse structures, providing a more comprehensive understanding of discourse analysis.
2. Development of a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB): The authors annotate 97 news wire articles with both micro semantics and macro pragmatics, creating a valuable resource for discourse structure analysis.
3. Preliminary experimentation on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of their corpus resource and representation schema on two tasks, demonstrating promising results.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel representation schema: The proposed macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a more comprehensive understanding of discourse analysis.
2. Valuable corpus resource: The creation of the MCDTB is a valuable contribution to the field, as it provides a large-scale annotated corpus for discourse structure analysis.
3. Promising experimental results: The preliminary experimentation on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed representation schema and corpus resource.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited scope: The paper focuses primarily on news wire articles, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other genres or domains.
2. Subjective annotation: The annotation process is subjective, which may lead to inconsistencies and biases in the corpus.
3. Imbalanced data distribution: The data distribution is imbalanced, which may affect the performance of the models on certain tasks.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of subjective annotation and ensure consistency in the corpus?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the annotation strategy and guidelines used to create the MCDTB?
3. How do the authors plan to enlarge the scale of the corpus and explore various discourse patterns in future work?
