This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis (CCLA), which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is flexible and can accommodate various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A general framework for CCLA: The authors propose a framework that can be applied to various tasks, including semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation.
2. Flexibility in context definition: The framework allows for different definitions of context, such as time periods, locations, or metadata attributes, making it applicable to a wide range of applications.
3. Comparison of word embeddings: The authors demonstrate how CCLA can be used to compare word embeddings learned from different contexts, which can help identify words with stable or changing meanings.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel framework: The proposed framework is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, as it provides a general and flexible approach to cross-context lexical analysis.
2. Extensive experiments: The authors conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CCLA in various tasks, including semantic change detection and word embedding stability evaluation.
3. Comparison to existing methods: The paper provides a detailed comparison of CCLA with existing methods, highlighting its advantages and potential applications.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation metrics: The authors primarily use word similarity and analogy tasks to evaluate the performance of CCLA, which may not be sufficient to fully demonstrate its capabilities.
2. Lack of theoretical analysis: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the framework and its properties, which would provide a deeper understanding of its strengths and limitations.
3. Computational efficiency: The authors do not discuss the computational efficiency of CCLA, which is an important consideration for large-scale applications.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend CCLA to handle more complex context definitions, such as hierarchical or graph-based contexts?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational efficiency of CCLA and its potential applications in real-world scenarios?
3. How do the authors intend to address the issue of disjoint vocabulary when comparing word embeddings across different contexts?
