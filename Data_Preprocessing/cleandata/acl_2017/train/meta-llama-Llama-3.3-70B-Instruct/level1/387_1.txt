This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors introduce a framework that automatically extracts cognitive features from gaze data and combines them with textual features to improve classification performance.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Automatic feature extraction: The authors propose a CNN-based approach to automatically extract features from gaze data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
2. Multimodal fusion: The framework combines textual and gaze features to capture subtle linguistic patterns that may not be apparent through text alone.
3. Improved performance: The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing systems that rely on handcrafted features or text-only CNNs.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The use of cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns is a unique and innovative approach to sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.
2. Strong experimental results: The authors provide thorough experimental evaluations on multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
3. Well-motivated: The paper is well-motivated, with a clear explanation of the limitations of existing approaches and the potential benefits of incorporating cognitive features.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited interpretability: The use of CNNs may make it challenging to interpret the learned features and understand how they contribute to the classification decisions.
2. Dependence on gaze data: The approach relies on the availability of gaze data, which may not always be feasible or practical to collect.
3. Overfitting: The authors mention that the model may be prone to overfitting, particularly on smaller datasets.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting, particularly on smaller datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned features and how they contribute to the classification decisions?
3. How do the authors envision the collection of gaze data in real-world applications, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
