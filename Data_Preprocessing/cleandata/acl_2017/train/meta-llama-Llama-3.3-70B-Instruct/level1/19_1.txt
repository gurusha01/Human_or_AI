This paper proposes a novel approach to zero pronoun resolution by automatically generating large-scale pseudo training data and utilizing a two-step training mechanism with an attention-based neural network model. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. A simple yet effective method for generating large-scale pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution, which can alleviate the issue of limited annotated data.
2. A two-step training approach that leverages both pseudo training data and task-specific data to improve model performance.
3. An attention-based neural network model that can effectively capture the relationships between the document and query.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, with an absolute improvement of 3.1% in F-score.
2. The use of pseudo training data and two-step training approach allows the model to learn from a large amount of data and adapt to the specific task.
3. The attention-based neural network model is effective in capturing the relationships between the document and query.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The model's performance may be affected by the quality of the pseudo training data, which may not always be accurate or representative of the real data.
2. The two-step training approach may require careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
3. The model's ability to handle unknown words and long-distance antecedents may be limited, which could impact its performance in certain scenarios.
Questions to authors:
1. How did you select the specific symbol 〈blank〉 to replace the noun or pronoun in the document, and what are the advantages of using this symbol?
2. Can you provide more details on the two-step training approach, such as the criteria for selecting the best model in the pre-training stage and the adaptation stage?
3. How do you plan to address the issue of unknown words and long-distance antecedents in future work, and what potential solutions do you propose?
