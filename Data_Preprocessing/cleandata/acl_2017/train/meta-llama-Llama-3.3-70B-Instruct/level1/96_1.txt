This paper presents a novel task of sarcasm interpretation, which involves generating a non-sarcastic utterance that conveys the same message as the original sarcastic one. The authors introduce a dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges, and propose a machine translation-based approach to tackle this task.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of the sarcasm interpretation task: The authors define and formalize the task of sarcasm interpretation, which is a crucial step towards understanding and analyzing sarcastic language.
2. Creation of a large-scale dataset: The authors collect and annotate a large dataset of sarcastic tweets, which provides a valuable resource for future research in this area.
3. Proposal of the SIGN algorithm: The authors propose a novel algorithm, SIGN, which targets sentiment words in sarcastic utterances and replaces them with suitable words to generate non-sarcastic interpretations.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel task definition: The authors introduce a new task that has not been previously attempted, which demonstrates their creativity and willingness to tackle challenging problems.
2. Large-scale dataset collection: The authors collect a large dataset of sarcastic tweets, which provides a solid foundation for future research in this area.
3. Effective algorithm proposal: The authors propose an effective algorithm, SIGN, which demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in terms of human evaluation measures.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation measures: The authors rely on automatic evaluation measures, such as BLEU and ROUGE, which may not be suitable for this task. They also use human evaluation measures, but the correlation between these measures is low.
2. Limited analysis of results: The authors provide some analysis of the results, but it is limited to a few examples and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm.
3. Lack of comparison to state-of-the-art models: The authors do not compare their proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art models in related tasks, such as sentiment analysis or irony detection.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to improve the evaluation measures for this task, given the low correlation between automatic and human evaluation measures?
2. Can you provide more analysis of the results, including a comprehensive comparison of the proposed algorithm to baseline models and state-of-the-art models in related tasks?
3. How do you plan to extend this work to other domains, such as spoken language or other forms of text, where sarcasm is prevalent?
