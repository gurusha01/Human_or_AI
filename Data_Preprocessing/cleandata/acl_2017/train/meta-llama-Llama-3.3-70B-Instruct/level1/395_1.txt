This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, DRL-Sense, to learn multi-sense word representations. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Joint learning of sense selection and representation modules: The authors propose a modular design that implements pure sense-level representation learning with linear time sense selection, which is optimized using reinforcement learning.
2. Non-parametric learning algorithm: The authors develop a non-parametric learning algorithm that enables automatic sense induction, allowing the model to discover the sense number for each word without predefining it.
3. Sense exploration mechanism: The authors introduce a sense exploration mechanism using dropout to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the early training stage.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. State-of-the-art performance: The proposed DRL-Sense model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark contextual word similarity task and most of the synonym selection datasets.
2. Efficient sense selection: The model implements linear time sense selection, making it efficient for large-scale datasets.
3. Robust sense representation learning: The authors demonstrate that their model learns robust sense representations that can be used for downstream NLP tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Complexity of the model: The proposed model has multiple components, including sense selection and representation modules, which may increase the risk of overfitting.
2. Limited interpretability: The authors do not provide a clear interpretation of the learned sense representations, which may limit the understanding of the model's behavior.
3. Dependence on hyperparameters: The model's performance may depend on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the embedding dimension and the number of senses per word.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed model to handle out-of-vocabulary words and rare senses?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned sense representations and their relationship to the input data?
3. How do the authors plan to apply the proposed model to downstream NLP tasks, such as text classification and machine translation?
