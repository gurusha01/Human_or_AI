This paper proposes MinIE, a novel open information extraction (OIE) system that minimizes and annotates extractions. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Minimization of OIE extractions: MinIE reduces overly-specific extractions by removing parts considered unnecessary and annotating the remaining information.
2. Annotation of extractions: MinIE provides annotations for polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities, which helps retain the original meaning of the extraction.
3. Multiple minimization modes: MinIE offers various modes with increasing levels of aggressiveness, allowing for a trade-off between precision and minimality.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Effective minimization: MinIE's minimization techniques lead to significantly shorter extractions while maintaining competitive precision and recall.
2. Improved annotation: MinIE's annotations provide valuable information about the extraction, such as polarity and modality, which can be useful for downstream applications.
3. Flexibility: MinIE's multiple minimization modes allow users to choose the level of aggressiveness suitable for their specific use case.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Error propagation: MinIE relies on dependency parsing and named-entity recognition, which can propagate errors to the extraction process.
2. Limited handling of collocations: MinIE's dictionary-based approach to handling collocations may not cover all cases, leading to broken collocations.
3. Room for improvement in basic minimizations: MinIE's basic minimization techniques, such as negation detection, may not cover all cases and could be improved.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do you plan to address the error propagation issue, and what techniques can be used to improve the robustness of MinIE?
2. Can you provide more details on how the dictionary for handling collocations is constructed, and how it can be extended to cover more cases?
3. What are the potential applications of MinIE's annotated extractions, and how can they be used in downstream tasks such as question answering or text summarization?
