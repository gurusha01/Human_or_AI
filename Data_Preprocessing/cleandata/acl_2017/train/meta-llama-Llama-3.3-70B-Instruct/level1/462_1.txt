This paper proposes a novel approach to volatility prediction using sentiment analysis of 10-K annual disclosures of companies in stock markets. The authors investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models, which benefit from word embedding information, in predicting volatility. They also explore various methods to combine textual and factual market information.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The authors propose a word embedding-based approach to sentiment analysis, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
2. They investigate the characteristics of the reports of companies in different financial sectors and show that sector-specific training does not improve performance due to the limited size of the training data.
3. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of combining textual and factual market information using various fusion methods, including stacking and Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL).
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly motivate their approach.
2. They conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of their approach and provide detailed results.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of the intuition behind their word embedding-based approach.
2. The paper could benefit from more analysis of the results and discussion of the implications of the findings.
3. Some of the figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and readability.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more insight into the intuition behind your word embedding-based approach and how it improves upon existing methods?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of limited training data in each sector, and what potential solutions do you propose?
3. Can you provide more analysis of the results and discuss the implications of the findings, particularly in terms of the potential applications of your approach in finance and industry?
