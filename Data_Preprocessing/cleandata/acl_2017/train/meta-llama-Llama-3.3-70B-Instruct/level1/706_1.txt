This paper proposes a novel approach to creating a natural language interface for performing complex actions, such as analyzing data, manipulating text, and querying databases. The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which allows users to interactively naturalize a core programming language by defining alternative syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. The system learns from user definitions and adapts to the community's language usage over time.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Interactive language learning: The system enables users to teach the system a diverse language through interactive definitions, allowing the community to evolve the language and make it more efficient over time.
2. Grammar induction: The authors propose a grammar induction algorithm that optimizes a global objective and uses the learned semantic parsing model to choose substitutions, resulting in high-precision rules.
3. Naturalization of the core language: The system allows users to naturalize the core language by defining new constructions, such as shorter and alternative expressions, different syntax, and more expressive operations.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Effective use of user definitions: The system leverages user definitions to learn and adapt to the community's language usage, resulting in a more natural and efficient language interface.
2. High-precision grammar induction: The proposed grammar induction algorithm produces high-precision rules, which is essential for maintaining a good user experience in the interactive setting.
3. Scalability: The system can handle complex structures and a large number of user interactions, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation: The evaluation is limited to a single domain (Voxelurn) and a specific task (building voxel structures), which may not be representative of other domains and tasks.
2. Lack of comparison to existing systems: The paper does not provide a comparison to existing natural language interfaces or language learning systems, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.
3. Potential limitations of the grammar induction algorithm: The algorithm may not be able to handle very complex or ambiguous definitions, which could limit its applicability in certain scenarios.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to extend the system to other domains and tasks, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
2. Can you provide more details on the grammar induction algorithm and its limitations, and how you plan to address potential issues with ambiguity and complexity?
3. How do you plan to evaluate the system's performance in a more comprehensive and comparative manner, and what metrics do you propose to use for evaluation?
