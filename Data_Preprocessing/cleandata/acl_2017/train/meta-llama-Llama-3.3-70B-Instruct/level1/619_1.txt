This paper presents a novel corpus of annotated revisions of argumentative essays, which enables advanced research in writing comparison and revision analysis. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Creation of a unique corpus: The authors have developed a corpus of argumentative essays with three drafts, annotated with revision purposes, which can be used for various applications such as revision analysis, paraphrase comparison, and computational stylistics.
2. Revision analysis framework: The paper proposes a two-tiered schema for categorizing revisions, which can be used to analyze the purpose of revisions and identify patterns in writing behaviors.
3. Demonstration of applications: The authors demonstrate the potential of the corpus through two studies: one on student revision behaviors and another on automatic revision intention prediction.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novelty of the corpus: The creation of a corpus that focuses on between-draft revisions in the context of full essays is a significant contribution to the field of NLP.
2. Well-designed annotation schema: The two-tiered schema for categorizing revisions is well-motivated and can be used to analyze various aspects of writing behaviors.
3. Demonstration of practical applications: The two studies presented in the paper demonstrate the potential of the corpus for real-world applications, such as improving writing instruction and developing automatic revision analysis systems.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited size of the corpus: The corpus consists of only 60 participants, which may not be representative of the larger population of writers.
2. Limited scope of revision analysis: The paper focuses primarily on sentence-level revisions and does not explore other aspects of revision analysis, such as sub-sentential scopes or evaluative measures.
3. Need for further validation: The results of the two studies presented in the paper are promising, but further validation is needed to confirm the effectiveness of the corpus and the proposed revision analysis framework.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to expand the corpus to include more participants and diverse writing samples?
2. Can you provide more details on the annotation process and the inter-annotator agreement?
3. How do you envision the corpus being used in real-world applications, such as writing instruction or automatic revision analysis systems?
