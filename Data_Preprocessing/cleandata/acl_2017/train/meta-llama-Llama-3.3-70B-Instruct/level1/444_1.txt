Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation methodology for the task of ghostwriting rap lyrics, which involves generating text that is similar in style to a target artist but distinct in content. The authors develop a manual evaluation methodology that assesses fluency, coherence, and style matching, as well as an automated evaluation methodology that captures uniqueness and stylistic similarity. They also create a dataset of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for style matching, and evaluate the performance of an LSTM-based ghostwriter model using the proposed methodology.
Main Contributions
1. Comprehensive evaluation methodology: The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation methodology that captures complementary aspects of the ghostwriting task, including fluency, coherence, style matching, uniqueness, and stylistic similarity.
2. Manual evaluation methodology: The authors develop a manual evaluation methodology that assesses fluency, coherence, and style matching, which provides a fine-grained analysis of the generated verses.
3. Automated evaluation methodology: The authors propose an automated evaluation methodology that captures uniqueness and stylistic similarity, which enables large-scale analysis of the generated verses.
Strengths
1. Comprehensive evaluation methodology: The proposed evaluation methodology provides a thorough analysis of the ghostwriting task, capturing multiple aspects of the generated verses.
2. Manual evaluation methodology: The manual evaluation methodology provides a fine-grained analysis of the generated verses, which is essential for evaluating the quality of the generated text.
3. Automated evaluation methodology: The automated evaluation methodology enables large-scale analysis of the generated verses, which is essential for evaluating the performance of the ghostwriter model.
4. Dataset creation: The authors create a dataset of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for style matching, which provides a valuable resource for future research.
5. Insights into future directions: The evaluation experiments provide key insights into future directions for generative models, such as the need to integrate new vocabulary and leverage other artists' lyrics.
Weaknesses
1. Limited scope: The proposed evaluation methodology is limited to the task of ghostwriting rap lyrics, and it is unclear whether it can be applied to other language generation tasks.
2. Subjectivity of manual evaluation: The manual evaluation methodology relies on human annotators, which can introduce subjectivity and variability in the evaluation results.
3. Computational complexity: The automated evaluation methodology may be computationally expensive, which can limit its applicability to large-scale datasets.
4. Lack of comparison to other models: The authors only evaluate the performance of an LSTM-based ghostwriter model, and it is unclear how other models would perform using the proposed evaluation methodology.
Questions to Authors
1. How can the proposed evaluation methodology be applied to other language generation tasks, such as poetry or dialogue generation?
2. How can the subjectivity of the manual evaluation methodology be mitigated, and what are the implications of using different annotation schemes?
3. What are the computational requirements of the automated evaluation methodology, and how can it be optimized for large-scale datasets?
4. How does the performance of the LSTM-based ghostwriter model compare to other models, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers?
