This paper proposes a novel text similarity measure called TextFlow (XF), which represents input text pairs as continuous curves and uses both the actual position of the words and sequence matching to compute the similarity value. The main contributions of this work are:
1. A novel standalone similarity measure: TextFlow is a new approach that exploits the full sequence of words in the compared texts, providing a more accurate and robust measure of text similarity.
2. Asymmetric similarity measure: TextFlow is asymmetric, allowing it to provide the best performance on different tasks, such as paraphrase detection, textual entailment, and ranking.
3. Empirical study: The authors conduct an extensive evaluation of TextFlow on eight datasets from three different tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and consistency across various tasks and datasets.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: TextFlow is a new and innovative approach to text similarity measurement, which addresses the limitations of existing measures.
2. Extensive evaluation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of TextFlow on multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and consistency.
3. Comparison to state-of-the-art measures: The authors compare TextFlow to other state-of-the-art similarity measures, showing its superiority in many cases.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Computational complexity: The authors mention that the computation of TextFlow has a time complexity of O(nm), which may be a limitation for very large datasets.
2. Parameter tuning: The authors introduce several parameters (α, β, and γ) that need to be tuned for optimal performance, which may require additional computational resources and expertise.
3. Lack of interpretability: The TextFlow measure is not easily interpretable, making it challenging to understand why certain text pairs are considered similar or dissimilar.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the computational complexity of TextFlow for very large datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the tuning of the parameters (α, β, and γ) and their impact on the performance of TextFlow?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the interpretability of TextFlow, making it easier to understand the results and decisions made by the measure?
