This paper proposes a cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework for 282 languages that exist in Wikipedia. The framework generates "silver-standard" annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refines annotations through self-training and topic selection, derives language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mines word translation pairs from cross-lingual links.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Development of a large-scale cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework: The framework is applied to 282 languages, which is the largest number of languages for such a task.
2. Creation of "silver-standard" annotations: The authors propose a method to generate annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties.
3. Introduction of morphology analysis for morphologically rich languages: The authors derive language-specific morphology features from anchor links, which improves the performance of name tagging for these languages.
The strengths of this work are:
1. Large-scale evaluation: The framework is evaluated on both Wikipedia articles and external formal and informal texts, demonstrating its effectiveness.
2. State-of-the-art performance: The authors' approach outperforms previous methods on the same data sets for many languages.
3. Release of resources: The authors release resources for each of the 282 languages, including "silver-standard" name tagging and linking annotations, morphology analyzers, and an end-to-end name tagging and linking system.
The weaknesses of this work are:
1. Limited evaluation on low-resource languages: Although the framework is applied to 282 languages, the evaluation is limited to a few languages with available gold-standard data.
2. Dependence on Wikipedia data: The framework relies heavily on Wikipedia data, which may not be available or reliable for all languages.
3. Lack of comparison to supervised methods: The authors do not compare their approach to supervised methods that use manually annotated data, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of limited evaluation on low-resource languages?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the morphology analysis method and its effectiveness for different languages?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the framework to other information extraction tasks, such as relation extraction?
