This paper presents two approaches for weakly supervised cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) with no human annotation in the target language. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Annotation Projection Approach: The authors develop a heuristic data selection scheme that effectively selects good-quality projection-labeled NER data from noisy comparable corpora. This approach improves the accuracy of the target-language NER system, especially when the alignment accuracy is low and the projection-labeled data are noisy.
2. Representation Projection Approach: The authors propose a new approach for direct NER model transfer based on representation projection, which projects word representations in vector space (word embeddings) from a target language to a source language. This approach enables the use of a single NER system trained in the source language to be applied to the target language without re-training.
3. Co-Decoding Schemes: The authors design two co-decoding schemes that combine the outputs of the two projection-based approaches in a smart way, resulting in improved accuracy over individual systems.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Effective use of weak supervision: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of weak supervision in cross-lingual NER, which is a challenging task due to the lack of annotated data in the target language.
2. Improved accuracy: The proposed approaches achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER approaches, especially on the CoNLL test data.
3. Flexibility: The representation projection approach allows for easy addition of new languages without requiring separate embeddings for each language pair.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their approaches on a limited number of languages (Japanese, Korean, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch) and datasets (in-house and CoNLL).
2. Dependence on alignment accuracy: The annotation projection approach relies on accurate alignment between the source and target languages, which may not always be available or accurate.
3. Complexity: The co-decoding schemes may add complexity to the overall system, which could impact scalability and efficiency.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approaches to low-resource languages with limited or no parallel data?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the effectiveness of the heuristic data selection scheme and the representation projection approach in different language pairs and datasets?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential scalability and efficiency issues associated with the co-decoding schemes?
