Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a new dataset of posts from cybercrime marketplaces annotated with product references, which is a task that combines information extraction (IE) and named entity recognition (NER). The authors formulate this task as a hybrid of slot-filling IE and NER, where the goal is to identify the products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums. They annotate a dataset of 93,924 posts from four different forums, with annotations for 1,938 posts. The authors evaluate the performance of simple baselines and learning-based methods, including binary classification and post-level classification, and explore various methods for domain adaptation to improve performance on new, unseen forums.
Main Contributions
1. New Dataset: The authors release a new dataset of annotated posts from cybercrime marketplaces, which provides a useful testbed for fine-grained domain adaptation and modeling of online marketplace data.
2. Task Formulation: The authors formulate the task of identifying products in cybercrime forums as a hybrid of slot-filling IE and NER, which requires context-sensitive annotation and modeling.
3. Domain Adaptation Methods: The authors explore various methods for domain adaptation, including Brown clusters, type-level annotation, and token-level annotation, and evaluate their effectiveness in improving performance on new forums.
Strengths
1. Novel Task: The paper introduces a new task that combines IE and NER, which is relevant to online marketplace analysis and cybercrime detection.
2. Large Dataset: The authors release a large dataset of annotated posts, which provides a valuable resource for researchers working on domain adaptation and online marketplace analysis.
3. Thorough Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of various methods for domain adaptation, including baseline methods and learning-based approaches.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Domain Adaptation Performance: The authors find that domain adaptation methods do not significantly improve performance on new forums, which suggests that the task is challenging and requires further research.
2. Overfitting: The authors note that some methods, such as domain-specific features, can lead to overfitting on small training sets, which highlights the need for careful regularization and hyperparameter tuning.
3. Lack of Comparison to State-of-the-Art Methods: The authors do not compare their methods to state-of-the-art approaches for domain adaptation and IE/NER, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of their methods in relation to existing work.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limited performance of domain adaptation methods on new forums, and what future research directions do they propose to explore?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the annotation process and the inter-annotator agreement, and how they ensured the quality and consistency of the annotations?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their work to other domains and tasks, and what potential applications do they see for their approach in online marketplace analysis and cybercrime detection?
