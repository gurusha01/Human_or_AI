This paper proposes a novel approach to machine translation for unbalanced languages, specifically Chinese-to-Spanish, by decoupling machine translation from morphology generation. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Morphology simplification: The authors propose to simplify the morphology of the target language (Spanish) by removing gender and number inflections, which achieves a good trade-off between translation gain and morphology generation complexity.
2. Deep learning-based classification architecture: The authors design a new neural network-based architecture for morphology generation, which consists of several layers, including embedding, convolutional, recurrent neural network, sigmoid, and softmax layers. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art results in classification tasks, outperforming standard machine learning techniques such as SVM and random forests.
3. Improved translation results: The authors demonstrate that their approach improves translation results, achieving a gain of up to 0.7 METEOR points compared to the baseline system.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach to morphology generation: The authors propose a new approach to morphology generation, which is based on deep learning techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results.
2. Improved translation results: The authors demonstrate that their approach improves translation results, which is a significant contribution to the field of machine translation.
3. Well-written and well-organized paper: The paper is well-written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their approach on a single language pair (Chinese-to-Spanish), which limits the generalizability of their results.
2. Lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art systems: The authors do not compare their approach to other state-of-the-art systems, which makes it difficult to assess the significance of their results.
3. Limited analysis of the results: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the results, which makes it difficult to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other language pairs?
2. How do the authors plan to compare their approach to other state-of-the-art systems?
3. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the results, including an analysis of the errors made by their system?
