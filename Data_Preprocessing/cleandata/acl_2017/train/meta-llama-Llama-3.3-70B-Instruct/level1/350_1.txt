This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically label training data for event extraction (EE) tasks using world knowledge and linguistic knowledge. The authors claim three main contributions: (1) automatically labeling data for large-scale EE via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, (2) proposing an approach to detect key arguments and triggers for each event type, and (3) demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach through manual and automatic evaluations.
The main contributions of this work, in order of strength, are:
1. Automatically labeled data generation: The authors propose a method to generate large-scale labeled data for EE, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Key argument and trigger detection: The authors propose an approach to detect key arguments and triggers for each event type, which is essential for accurate EE.
3. Evaluation and baseline model: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach and propose a baseline model (DMCNN-MIL) for further research on this data.
The strengths of this submission are:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to automatically label training data for EE, which addresses the limitation of supervised learning methods that rely on expensive human-annotated data.
2. Large-scale evaluation: The authors conduct a large-scale evaluation of their approach using both manual and automatic evaluations, which demonstrates the effectiveness of their method.
3. Baseline model: The authors provide a baseline model (DMCNN-MIL) for further research on this data, which is a significant contribution to the field.
4. Release of labeled data: The authors release their labeled data, which can be used by other researchers to further improve EE models.
The weaknesses of this submission are:
1. Complexity of the approach: The authors' approach involves multiple components, including key argument detection, trigger word detection, and soft distant supervision, which may be challenging to implement and reproduce.
2. Dependence on world knowledge and linguistic knowledge: The authors' approach relies on world knowledge (Freebase) and linguistic knowledge (FrameNet), which may not be available or accurate for all event types or languages.
3. Noise in automatically labeled data: The authors acknowledge that their automatically labeled data may contain noise, which can affect the performance of EE models trained on this data.
4. Limited event types: The authors only evaluate their approach on 21 selected event types, which may not be representative of all event types.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of their approach and make it more accessible to other researchers?
2. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other event types and languages?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the accuracy of their automatically labeled data and reduce noise?
4. Can the authors provide more details on the DMCNN-MIL model and its implementation?
