This paper proposes a new dataset, FOIL-COCO, which extends the MS-COCO dataset by associating images with both correct and 'foil' captions. The foil captions are generated by replacing one word in the original caption with a incorrect word, making it a challenging task for language and vision (LaVi) models to detect the mistake. The authors evaluate two state-of-the-art LaVi models on three tasks: caption classification, foil word detection, and foil word correction. The results show that the models perform poorly on these tasks, indicating that they do not truly integrate language and vision.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The introduction of the FOIL-COCO dataset, which provides a challenging testbed for evaluating LaVi models.
2. The proposal of three tasks for evaluating LaVi models, which can help diagnose their failures.
3. The demonstration that current LaVi models are not able to integrate language and vision effectively, and that they rely heavily on language priors.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The dataset and tasks proposed are well-motivated and can help advance the field of LaVi research.
2. The experiments are thorough and well-designed, providing a clear picture of the models' performance.
3. The analysis of the results is insightful, highlighting the limitations of current LaVi models.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The dataset generation process could be improved, as the current method may introduce biases.
2. The evaluation metrics used may not be comprehensive, and additional metrics could provide a more complete picture of the models' performance.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential directions for future research.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to address the potential biases in the dataset generation process?
2. Can you provide more details on the evaluation metrics used and why they were chosen?
3. How do you think the results of this paper can be used to improve the design of LaVi models?
