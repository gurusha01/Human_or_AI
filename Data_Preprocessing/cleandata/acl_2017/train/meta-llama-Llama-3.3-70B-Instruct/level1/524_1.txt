This paper presents a comprehensive study on enhancing coverage in parsing with Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) using various robust parsing techniques. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Evaluation methodology: The authors propose a novel evaluation methodology for robust parsing techniques, which involves intrinsic evaluation using datasets with missing gold standard annotations.
2. Comparison of robust parsing techniques: The paper compares the performance of five approaches to increasing the robustness of parsing with the English Resource Grammar (ERG), including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches.
3. Significant coverage gains: The results show that the PCFG-based systems can greatly enhance the coverage of the ERG, with coverage gains of up to 100% on certain datasets.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Comprehensive evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of various robust parsing techniques, providing a detailed analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.
2. Novel evaluation methodology: The proposed evaluation methodology addresses the challenge of missing gold standard annotations, allowing for a more accurate assessment of robust parsing techniques.
3. Significant coverage gains: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in improving coverage, which is a critical aspect of parsing performance.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited extrinsic evaluation: The authors acknowledge that extrinsic evaluation is necessary to fully assess the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, but this is not conducted in the paper.
2. Computational efficiency: Some of the proposed techniques, such as the PCFG-based systems, may have high computational costs, which could limit their applicability in practice.
3. Lack of parse ranking model adaptation: The authors note that the parse ranking model is not adapted to the novel situations in which it is used, which could impact the accuracy of the proposed techniques.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of limited extrinsic evaluation in future work?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed techniques and potential optimizations to improve their performance?
3. How do the authors intend to adapt the parse ranking model to improve the accuracy of the proposed techniques in future work?
