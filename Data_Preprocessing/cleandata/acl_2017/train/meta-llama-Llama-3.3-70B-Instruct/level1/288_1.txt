This paper presents a case study on the impact of writing tasks on writing style, using the story cloze task as a testbed. The authors demonstrate that different writing tasks, such as writing an entire story, adding a coherent or incoherent ending to a story, can lead to measurable differences in writing style. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Measurable differences in writing style: The authors show that a simple linear classifier can distinguish between different types of story endings (coherent, incoherent, and original) with high accuracy, even without considering the story context.
2. State-of-the-art results on the story cloze task: The authors achieve a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze task, outperforming previous approaches that relied on deep learning models.
3. Insights into the design of NLP tasks: The authors highlight the importance of considering the writing task and its potential impact on writing style when designing NLP tasks, and suggest ways to mitigate these effects.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novel approach to analyzing writing style: The authors propose a new approach to analyzing writing style, focusing on the impact of writing tasks on style, rather than traditional factors such as author personality or demographics.
2. Simple yet effective methodology: The authors use a simple linear classifier and stylistic features to achieve high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
3. Important implications for NLP task design: The authors' findings have significant implications for the design of NLP tasks, highlighting the need to consider the potential impact of writing tasks on writing style.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. Limited scope: The authors focus on a single task, the story cloze task, which may limit the generalizability of their findings to other NLP tasks.
2. Lack of deeper analysis: The authors do not provide a deeper analysis of the cognitive implications of their findings, which could provide further insights into the relationship between writing tasks and writing style.
3. Potential biases in the data: The authors acknowledge potential biases in the data, such as the fact that the story cloze task was designed to be a challenging task, which may affect the generalizability of their findings.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other NLP tasks, and what potential challenges do they anticipate?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the cognitive implications of their findings, and how they relate to existing research on writing style and mental state?
3. How do the authors plan to address potential biases in the data, and what steps can be taken to ensure the generalizability of their findings to other datasets and tasks?
