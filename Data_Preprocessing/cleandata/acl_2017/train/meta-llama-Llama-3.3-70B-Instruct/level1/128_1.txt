This paper proposes a novel model, Knowledge-Guided Structural Attention Networks (K-SAN), which leverages prior knowledge to incorporate non-flat topologies and learn suitable attention for different substructures that are salient for specific tasks. The main contributions of this work are:
1. End-to-end learning: The model utilizes general knowledge as guidance in an end-to-end fashion, where the model automatically learns important substructures with an attention mechanism.
2. Generalization for different knowledge: The model can handle different types of parsing results, such as dependency relations, knowledge graph-specific relations, and parsing output of handcrafted grammars, as knowledge guidance.
3. Efficiency and parallelizability: The model can be trained in parallel, and the modeling time may not increase linearly with respect to the number of words in the input sentence.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Effective use of prior knowledge: The model leverages prior knowledge to guide the attention mechanism, which improves the performance of the natural language understanding (NLU) task.
2. State-of-the-art results: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ATIS benchmark dataset, outperforming other baseline models.
3. Robustness to data scarcity: The model shows better generalization and robustness to data scarcity, especially when the training data is small.
4. Flexibility in knowledge representation: The model can handle different types of knowledge representations, such as dependency trees and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs.
5. Attention analysis: The visualization of the attention weights shows that the model pays correct attention to important substructures guided by the external knowledge, even when the training data is scarce.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Complexity of the model: The proposed model has a complex architecture, which may make it difficult to train and optimize.
2. Dependence on prior knowledge: The model relies heavily on prior knowledge, which may not always be available or accurate.
3. Limited evaluation: The model is only evaluated on the ATIS benchmark dataset, which may not be representative of other NLU tasks or datasets.
4. Lack of comparison to other attention-based models: The paper does not compare the proposed model to other attention-based models, which may have similar performance.
5. Need for hyperparameter tuning: The model requires hyperparameter tuning, which may be time-consuming and require significant computational resources.
Questions to authors:
1. How does the model handle cases where the prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate?
2. Can the model be applied to other NLU tasks, such as intent detection or sentiment analysis?
3. How does the model compare to other attention-based models, such as those used in machine translation or question answering?
4. What is the computational cost of training the model, and how does it scale to larger datasets?
5. Can the model be used in a multi-task learning setting, where it is trained on multiple NLU tasks simultaneously?
