This paper presents a procedure for building an evaluation dataset for validating compositional distributional semantics models in Polish, a language with limited resources. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The creation of a Polish evaluation dataset, consisting of 10K sentence pairs annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment, which can be used to evaluate compositional distributional semantics models of Polish.
2. The development of a procedure for building the dataset, which adapts the design principles of the SICK corpus to the Polish language, taking into account the lack of necessary extraneous resources and the need for language-specific transformation rules.
3. The introduction of an element of human verification of correctness of automatically transformed sentences and additional post-corrections, which improves the quality of the dataset.
The strengths of this submission are: 
1. The dataset created is of high quality, with satisfactory inter-annotator agreement scores for both entailment labels (κ = 0.732) and relatedness scores (α = 0.78).
2. The procedure developed is well-documented and can be adapted to other languages with limited resources.
3. The evaluation dataset will be made publicly available, which will encourage the development of compositional distributional semantics models in Polish and other under-resourced languages.
4. The paper provides a thorough description of the annotation process, including the guidelines and examples used to annotate the sentence pairs.
5. The use of Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's alpha to measure inter-annotator agreement provides a reliable evaluation of the dataset's quality.
The weaknesses of this submission are: 
1. The procedure developed is based on the SICK corpus, which may not be directly applicable to other languages or domains.
2. The dataset is limited to 10K sentence pairs, which may not be sufficient for training and evaluating compositional distributional semantics models.
3. The paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the compositional distributional semantics models that can be trained and evaluated using the created dataset.
4. The linguistic transformation rules defined for Polish may not be generalizable to other languages.
5. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the created dataset.
Questions to authors: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the limited size of the dataset and ensure that it is sufficient for training and evaluating compositional distributional semantics models?
2. Can the procedure developed be adapted to other languages or domains, and what modifications would be necessary?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the compositional distributional semantics models that can be trained and evaluated using the created dataset?
4. What are the implications of the results for the development of compositional distributional semantics models in Polish and other under-resourced languages?
5. How do the authors plan to make the dataset publicly available and ensure its accessibility to the research community?
