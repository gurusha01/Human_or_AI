This paper proposes a novel approach to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in speech transcripts using complex network features. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of complex network features: The authors model speech transcripts as complex networks and enrich them with word embeddings, which allows for the capture of semantic information and improves the representation of short texts.
2. Comparison with traditional linguistic features: The authors compare the performance of complex network features with traditional linguistic features and show that the former outperforms the latter in individual classifier results.
3. Combination of machine and multi-view learning: The authors demonstrate that combining machine and multi-view learning can improve accuracy in detecting MCI.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The use of complex network features is a new and innovative approach to detect MCI in speech transcripts.
2. Improved performance: The authors show that complex network features outperform traditional linguistic features in individual classifier results.
3. Robustness to disfluencies: The approach is robust to disfluencies in speech transcripts, which is a common problem in neuropsychological assessments.
4. Comparability to state-of-the-art results: The authors report accuracy values comparable to those reported in the literature, ranging from 60% to 85%.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited dataset: The authors use a limited dataset, which may not be representative of the entire population.
2. Lack of interpretability: The complex network features may be difficult to interpret, which can make it challenging to understand the underlying factors contributing to MCI.
3. Dependence on word embeddings: The approach relies on word embeddings, which may not always capture the nuances of language.
4. Need for further validation: The authors acknowledge the need for further validation of their approach using larger and more diverse datasets.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of limited dataset size and ensure that their approach generalizes to other populations?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the complex network features and how they relate to the underlying cognitive processes?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other languages and cultures, considering the potential differences in language use and cognitive processes?
