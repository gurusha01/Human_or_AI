This paper presents a novel approach to cross-lingual transfer learning for paradigm completion, a task in morphological generation. The authors propose a method that leverages labeled data from a high-resource language to improve performance on a low-resource language using a neural encoder-decoder model.
Summary of the paper:
The paper introduces a cross-lingual transfer learning method for paradigm completion, which involves mapping a lemma to its inflected forms. The authors use a neural encoder-decoder model, which is the state of the art for monolingual paradigm completion, and adapt it for cross-lingual transfer learning. They conduct experiments on 21 language pairs from four language families and demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and edit distance, especially in low-resource settings.
Main contributions:
1. Cross-lingual transfer learning method: The authors propose a novel method for cross-lingual transfer learning for paradigm completion, which enables the use of high-resource language data to improve performance on low-resource languages.
2. Neural encoder-decoder model: The authors adapt a neural encoder-decoder model for cross-lingual transfer learning and demonstrate its effectiveness in paradigm completion.
3. Experiments on multiple language pairs: The authors conduct experiments on 21 language pairs from four language families, demonstrating the applicability of their method to a wide range of languages.
Strengths:
1. Significant improvements in accuracy and edit distance: The authors demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and edit distance, especially in low-resource settings.
2. Effective use of high-resource language data: The authors show that their method can effectively leverage high-resource language data to improve performance on low-resource languages.
3. Robustness to language relatedness: The authors demonstrate that their method is robust to language relatedness, with more closely related languages resulting in better transfer learning performance.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited analysis of error types: The authors could provide a more detailed analysis of error types and their impact on performance.
2. No comparison to other transfer learning methods: The authors do not compare their method to other transfer learning methods, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.
3. Limited discussion of regularization techniques: The authors could provide a more detailed discussion of regularization techniques and their impact on performance.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their method to other NLP tasks, such as machine translation or parsing?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the neural encoder-decoder model architecture and its hyperparameters?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of language-relatedness in their method, and what are the implications for languages with limited resources?
