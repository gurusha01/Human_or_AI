This paper proposes a novel approach to measure sentiment orientations of words using vector space models. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The development of an unsupervised and semi-supervised methodology to calculate sentiment orientations of words using vector space models, specifically Word2Vec and GloVe.
2. The comparison of the proposed approach with a previous unsupervised method, PMI-IR, and the demonstration of its superiority in terms of accuracy and robustness to data sparsity.
3. The exploration of the potential of dense vector modeling in overcoming the data-sparsity problem in sentiment analysis tasks.
The strengths of this paper are: 
1. The proposed approach outperforms the existing unsupervised method, PMI-IR, in terms of accuracy, and is more robust to data sparsity.
2. The use of vector space models, specifically Word2Vec and GloVe, allows for the capture of paradigmatic relations between words, which is essential for sentiment analysis tasks.
3. The paper provides a thorough comparison of the proposed approach with the existing method, and discusses the potential limitations and future directions of the work.
4. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in sentiment classification tasks, and provide insights into the importance of dense vector modeling in overcoming data sparsity.
The weaknesses of this paper are: 
1. The performance of the proposed approach does not meet the high standards of supervised approaches, which typically achieve accuracy above 80%.
2. The method used to construct reference vectors, vector averaging, may not be optimal, and the results do not dramatically increase with the added number of word tokens.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and the potential avenues for future research.
4. The comparison with the PMI-IR approach is limited to a specific dataset, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed approach on a wider range of datasets and tasks.
