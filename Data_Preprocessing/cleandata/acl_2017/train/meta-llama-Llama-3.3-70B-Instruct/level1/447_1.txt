This paper proposes a novel approach to text categorization by leveraging discourse structure, as defined by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), to improve the accuracy of categorization models. The authors introduce a recursive neural network that uses a discourse dependency tree to compute a representation of the text, focusing on salient content from the perspective of both RST and the task.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Effective use of discourse structure: The authors demonstrate that discourse structure can be used to improve text categorization accuracy, even when the discourse parser is not perfect.
2. Novel attention mechanism: The proposed attention mechanism, inspired by RST, allows the model to learn the importance of different parts of the text without normalizing attention weights.
3. State-of-the-art results: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on four out of five datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Clear motivation: The authors provide a clear motivation for using discourse structure in text categorization, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches.
2. Well-designed experiments: The authors conduct thorough experiments on five datasets, comparing their approach to existing state-of-the-art methods.
3. Detailed analysis: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a qualitative analysis of the attention weights and a discussion of the effect of parsing performance on categorization accuracy.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Overparameterization: The FULL model is overparameterized for smaller datasets, which may lead to overfitting.
2. Limited generalizability: The approach may not generalize well to genres with different discourse structures, such as legislative bills.
3. Dependence on discourse parser: The accuracy of the discourse parser has a significant impact on the categorization accuracy, which may limit the applicability of the approach.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the overparameterization issue in the FULL model?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into why the approach does not work well for legislative bills?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the discourse parser to increase the accuracy of the categorization model?
