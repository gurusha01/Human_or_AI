This paper proposes a novel approach to word representation learning (WRL) by incorporating sememe information from the HowNet knowledge base. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Incorporation of sememe information: The authors utilize sememe information to improve WRL, which is a new and innovative approach.
2. Attention-based model: The authors propose an attention-based model to automatically select appropriate senses for context words, which is a key contribution of this work.
3. Evaluation on word similarity and word analogy tasks: The authors evaluate their models on two tasks, including word similarity and word analogy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The incorporation of sememe information is a new and innovative approach to WRL, which has the potential to improve the performance of WRL models.
2. Attention-based model: The attention-based model is a key contribution of this work, which allows the model to automatically select appropriate senses for context words.
3. Extensive evaluation: The authors evaluate their models on two tasks, including word similarity and word analogy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
4. Case study: The authors provide a case study to demonstrate the validity of their approach, which provides insights into the effectiveness of their model.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited analysis of sememe information: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the sememe information used in their approach, which makes it difficult to understand the effectiveness of their model.
2. Lack of comparison with other WRL models: The authors do not compare their approach with other WRL models that incorporate sense information, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach.
3. Limited evaluation on other tasks: The authors only evaluate their models on two tasks, including word similarity and word analogy, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the sememe information used in your approach, including the source and quality of the information?
2. How do you plan to extend your approach to other languages, and what challenges do you anticipate?
3. Can you provide more comparison with other WRL models that incorporate sense information, and how does your approach differ from these models?
