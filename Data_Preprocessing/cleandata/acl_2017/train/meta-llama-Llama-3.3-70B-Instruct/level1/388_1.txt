This paper introduces UDEPLAMBDA, a semantic interface for Universal Dependencies (UD) that maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent manner. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Development of a multilingual semantic interface: UDEPLAMBDA is designed to work with UD, which provides a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme, allowing for the development of a semantic interface that can be applied to multiple languages.
2. Extension of DEPLAMBDA to UD: The authors build upon the DEPLAMBDA framework, which was designed for English Stanford Dependencies, and adapt it to work with UD, enabling the application of the semantic interface to a broader range of languages.
3. Evaluation on semantic parsing for question answering: The authors evaluate UDEPLAMBDA on semantic parsing for question answering against Freebase in three languages: English, Spanish, and German, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in a multilingual setting.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novel application of UD to semantic parsing: The authors demonstrate the potential of UD as a foundation for semantic parsing, showcasing the benefits of using a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme.
2. Strong evaluation results: The authors report competitive results on semantic parsing for question answering, outperforming strong baselines and achieving state-of-the-art performance on GraphQuestions.
3. Multilingual evaluation: The authors provide translations of benchmark datasets in German and Spanish, facilitating the evaluation of UDEPLAMBDA in a multilingual setting and promoting further research in this area.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. Limited handling of language-specific constructions: The authors acknowledge that UDEPLAMBDA may not capture language-specific constructions, such as pronoun-dropping or idiomatic expressions, which may impact the accuracy of the semantic interface.
2. Dependence on syntactic parsing accuracy: The authors note that the performance of UDEPLAMBDA is dependent on the accuracy of the syntactic parser, which may vary across languages and datasets.
3. Limited coverage of linguistic phenomena: The authors acknowledge that UDEPLAMBDA may not cover all linguistic phenomena, such as quantifiers, negation, and intentional verbs, which may require additional extensions or modifications to the framework.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address language-specific constructions and idiomatic expressions in future work?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the entity resolution algorithm and its performance across languages?
3. How do the authors envision applying UDEPLAMBDA to other natural language understanding tasks, such as summarization and machine translation?
