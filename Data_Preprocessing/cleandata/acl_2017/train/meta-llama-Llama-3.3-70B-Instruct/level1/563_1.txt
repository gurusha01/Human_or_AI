This paper explores the potential of pre-trained word embeddings to identify generic types of semantic relations in an unsupervised experiment. The authors propose a new relational similarity measure based on the combination of word2vec's CBOW input and output vectors, which outperforms concurrent vector representations when used for unsupervised clustering on SemEval 2010 Relation Classification data.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A new relational similarity measure that combines first and second order similarities between entity pairs, which shows promising results in capturing the structure of semantic relations.
2. An evaluation of different vector combination methods for calculating relational similarities, including pairwise similarities, analogies, and difference-based methods.
3. A demonstration that the proposed input-output combination measure outperforms other combinations in almost every setting, indicating a better potential for unsupervised experiments.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The authors provide a thorough review of related work on word embeddings and semantic relation classification, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the need for a new approach.
2. The proposed input-output combination measure is novel and shows promising results, indicating a potential breakthrough in unsupervised relation classification.
3. The authors provide a detailed evaluation of different vector combination methods, which helps to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
4. The paper highlights the challenges of unsupervised relation classification, including the need to separate relations with semantically constrained arguments from free ones, and adapting the clustering method to handle outliers.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The authors rely heavily on the SemEval 2010 Relation Classification data, which may not be representative of all types of semantic relations.
2. The proposed input-output combination measure is sensitive to the chaining effect and may require task-specific clustering parameters to optimize performance.
3. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how the proposed measure can be used in practice, or how it can be integrated with other NLP tasks.
4. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the proposed measure and potential avenues for future research.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of contextual relation instances, which may not be captured by the proposed input-output combination measure?
2. Can the authors provide more details on how the proposed measure can be used in practice, or how it can be integrated with other NLP tasks?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the proposed measure on other datasets, or in other languages?
4. Can the authors provide more insights into the limitations of the proposed measure, and potential avenues for future research?
