This paper proposes a deep learning framework for event factuality identification, which is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) applications. The framework consists of two main steps: extracting essential information from raw texts and identifying the factuality of events using a deep neural network.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A two-step supervised framework for identifying event factuality in raw texts.
2. The utilization of an attention-based CNN to detect source introducing predicates (SIPs).
3. The proposal of an attention-based deep neural network model combining BiLSTM and CNN to identify the factuality of events.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the FactBank dataset, outperforming several baseline models.
2. The use of attention-based neural networks allows the model to effectively capture important information from syntactic paths and words.
3. The framework is able to identify negative and speculative factuality values more effectively with the help of corresponding cues.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The model relies heavily on the quality of the extracted features, such as SIPs, sources, and cues.
2. The performance of the model on embedded sources is relatively low, which may be due to the complexity of the syntactic structures.
3. The model requires a large amount of annotated data to train, which may be a limitation for low-resource languages or domains.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to improve the performance of the model on embedded sources?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the attention mechanism used in the model and how it helps in capturing important information from syntactic paths and words?
3. How do the authors plan to adapt the model to low-resource languages or domains where annotated data is scarce?
