Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel architecture for neural machine translation (NMT) that learns morphology using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder, which translates at the character level. This approach addresses the issue of large vocabulary in word-level NMT models and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art systems. The model consists of six recurrent neural networks and is trained end-to-end using a variant of the gate recurrent unit (GRU) called HGRU.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Architecture: The paper introduces a new architecture for NMT that learns morphology using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder, which translates at the character level.
2. Efficient Training: The model is able to efficiently train a deep character-level neural machine translation model, achieving higher performance than word-level models and comparable performance to state-of-the-art character-level models.
3. Learning Morphology: The paper demonstrates that the model is able to learn morphology, which enables it to translate misspelled words and nonce words correctly.
Strengths
1. Addressing OOV Issue: The paper proposes a solution to the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue that word-level models suffer from, by using a character-level approach.
2. Efficient Training: The model is able to efficiently train a deep character-level neural machine translation model, achieving higher performance than word-level models.
3. Learning Morphology: The paper demonstrates that the model is able to learn morphology, which enables it to translate misspelled words and nonce words correctly.
4. Comparable Performance: The model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating its effectiveness.
5. Flexibility: The paper suggests that the idea behind the approach could be applied to many other tasks, such as speech recognition and text summarization.
Weaknesses
1. Complexity: The model consists of six recurrent neural networks, which may make it more complex and difficult to train than other models.
2. Computational Resources: The paper mentions that the model requires significant computational resources, which may be a limitation for some researchers.
3. Limited Evaluation: The paper only evaluates the model on three language pairs, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness on a wider range of languages.
4. Comparison to Other Models: The paper compares the model to other character-level models, but it would be useful to compare it to more word-level models to demonstrate its advantages.
5. Lack of Theoretical Analysis: The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of the model, which may make it difficult to understand its limitations and potential applications.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the model handle languages with complex morphology, such as Arabic or Chinese?
2. Can the model be used for other natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling or text classification?
3. How does the model compare to other character-level models in terms of computational resources and training time?
4. Can the model be used for low-resource languages, where the amount of training data is limited?
5. How does the model handle out-of-vocabulary words that are not seen during training?
