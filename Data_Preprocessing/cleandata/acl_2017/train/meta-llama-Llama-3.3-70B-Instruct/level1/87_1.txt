Summary of the Paper:
The paper proposes a novel unsupervised graph-based algorithm, called PositionRank, for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents. PositionRank incorporates both the position of words and their frequency in a document into a biased PageRank. The algorithm constructs a word graph from a document, where nodes represent words and edges represent word co-occurrences. The position information of each word is used to assign a weight to the word, which is then incorporated into the PageRank algorithm. The paper evaluates PositionRank on three datasets of research papers and shows that it outperforms strong baselines, including TextRank, SingleRank, and ExpandRank.
