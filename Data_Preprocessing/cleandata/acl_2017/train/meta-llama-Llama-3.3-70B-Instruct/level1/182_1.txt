This paper proposes a novel approach to multimodal sentiment analysis by leveraging the contextual relationships among utterances in a video. The authors introduce a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network that captures the dependencies among utterances, enabling the model to extract contextual features that improve sentiment classification.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Contextual LSTM network: The authors propose a LSTM-based network that models the relationships among utterances, allowing the model to capture contextual information and improve sentiment classification.
2. Hierarchical fusion framework: The authors introduce a hierarchical fusion framework that combines context-independent unimodal features with context-dependent features extracted by the LSTM network, leading to improved performance.
3. State-of-the-art results: The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the contextual LSTM network and hierarchical fusion framework.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to multimodal sentiment analysis that leverages contextual relationships among utterances, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
2. Improved performance: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
3. Robustness to person variance: The authors demonstrate the robustness of their method to person variance by performing person-independent experiments, which is a significant advantage over existing methods.
4. Qualitative analysis: The authors provide a qualitative analysis of the results, highlighting the importance of modalities and the limitations of the approach.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited datasets: The authors only evaluate their method on three datasets, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
2. Lack of comparison to other fusion methods: The authors only compare their hierarchical fusion framework to a non-hierarchical framework, but do not compare it to other fusion methods, such as early fusion or late fusion.
3. Limited analysis of modalities: While the authors provide some analysis of the importance of modalities, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the contributions of each modality to the overall performance.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the approach, such as the lack of robustness to noisy audio signals and weak sentiments?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the qualitative analysis, such as the specific utterances that were misclassified and the reasons for the misclassification?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other multimodal sentiment analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis of text-image pairs or audio-visual pairs?
