This paper proposes a novel tagging scheme to jointly extract entities and relations from unstructured text. The authors introduce a tagging scheme that converts the joint extraction task into a tagging problem, allowing for the use of end-to-end models to extract entities and relations directly. The paper claims three main contributions: (1) a novel tagging scheme, (2) the study of different end-to-end models based on the tagging scheme, and (3) the development of an end-to-end model with a bias objective function to suit the novel tags.
The main contributions of this work, in order of strength, are:
1. The proposed tagging scheme, which effectively transforms the joint extraction task into a tagging problem, enabling the use of end-to-end models.
2. The development of an end-to-end model with a bias objective function, which enhances the association between related entities.
3. The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving the best results on the public dataset.
The strengths of this submission are:
1. The novelty of the tagging scheme, which provides a new perspective on the joint extraction task.
2. The thorough experimentation, which compares the proposed method with various baselines and provides detailed analysis of the results.
3. The effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the public dataset.
The weaknesses of this submission are:
1. The limitation of the proposed method to non-overlapping relations, which may not be suitable for all real-world applications.
2. The reliance on distant supervision, which may introduce noise in the training data.
3. The lack of detailed analysis of the bias objective function, which may require further investigation to fully understand its impact on the results.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to address the limitation of non-overlapping relations in future work?
2. Can you provide more details on the bias objective function and its impact on the results?
3. How do you think the proposed method can be applied to other NLP tasks, such as question answering or text classification?
