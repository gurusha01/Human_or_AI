Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a new approach to assessing the readability of Vietnamese text. The authors create a large corpus of 996 documents, categorized into three levels of difficulty (easy, normal, and difficult), and use this corpus to develop a new formula for predicting text readability. The formula is based on features such as average sentence length, average word length, and percentage of difficult words. The authors evaluate the performance of their formula using cross-validation and report an accuracy of over 80% in predicting the readability of Vietnamese text.
Main Contributions
1. Creation of a large corpus: The authors create a large and reliable corpus of Vietnamese text, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Development of a new formula: The authors develop a new formula for predicting text readability, which is based on a combination of features such as average sentence length, average word length, and percentage of difficult words.
3. Evaluation of the formula: The authors evaluate the performance of their formula using cross-validation and report an accuracy of over 80% in predicting the readability of Vietnamese text.
Strengths
1. Large and reliable corpus: The authors create a large and reliable corpus of Vietnamese text, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Simple and effective formula: The authors develop a simple and effective formula for predicting text readability, which is based on a combination of features that are easy to extract.
3. High accuracy: The authors report an accuracy of over 80% in predicting the readability of Vietnamese text, which is a significant achievement.
Weaknesses
1. Limited features: The authors only consider a limited set of features, such as average sentence length, average word length, and percentage of difficult words, which may not capture all the complexities of text readability.
2. Lack of comparison: The authors do not compare their formula with existing formulas for text readability, which makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of their formula.
3. Limited applicability: The authors only evaluate their formula on a specific corpus of Vietnamese text, which may not be representative of all types of text.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend their work to other languages and domains?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the features they used and why they chose them?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of their formula on other corpora and datasets?
