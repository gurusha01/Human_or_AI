This paper presents Grid Beam Search (GBS), an algorithm that extends beam search to allow the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of Grid Beam Search: The authors propose a novel decoding algorithm that enables the incorporation of lexical constraints into the output sequence of any model that generates sequences.
2. Flexibility and applicability: GBS can be used with any sequence generation model, including machine translation, automatic summarization, image captioning, and dialog generation.
3. Efficient decoding: The algorithm is designed to be efficient, with a runtime complexity of O(ktc), and can be parallelized to allow all beams at each timestep to be filled simultaneously.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novelty and originality: The introduction of GBS is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, as it provides a flexible and efficient way to incorporate lexical constraints into sequence generation models.
2. Experimental results: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GBS in various experiments, including interactive post-editing and domain adaptation for machine translation.
3. Wide applicability: The algorithm can be applied to a wide range of text generation tasks, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Complexity: The algorithm and its implementation may be complex and difficult to understand for some readers.
2. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate GBS on machine translation tasks, and it is unclear how well the algorithm will perform on other sequence generation tasks.
3. Comparison to existing methods: The authors do not provide a thorough comparison of GBS to existing methods for incorporating lexical constraints into sequence generation models.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to evaluate GBS on other sequence generation tasks, such as automatic summarization and image captioning?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of GBS, including the specific models and hyperparameters used in the experiments?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential complexity of GBS, and make it more accessible to a wider range of researchers and practitioners?
