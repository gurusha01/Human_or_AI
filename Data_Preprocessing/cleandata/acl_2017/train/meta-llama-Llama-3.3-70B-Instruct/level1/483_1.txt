This paper proposes a novel approach to argumentation mining, a crucial task in natural language processing that involves identifying the structure of arguments in text. The authors introduce a joint neural model based on a Pointer Network architecture to simultaneously extract links between argument components and classify their types. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on two evaluation corpora, outperforming previous models that rely on hand-crafted features and integer linear programming.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Joint modeling of link extraction and argument component classification: The authors propose a novel approach that jointly models these two tasks, which are crucial for argumentation mining. This joint modeling enables the model to capture the relationships between argument components and their types, leading to improved performance.
2. Pointer Network architecture: The authors adapt the Pointer Network architecture to the task of argumentation mining, which allows the model to effectively capture the sequential nature of argument components and their links.
3. State-of-the-art results on two evaluation corpora: The authors evaluate their model on two corpora, namely the Persuasive Essay corpus and the Microtext corpus, and achieve state-of-the-art results on both datasets.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach to argumentation mining: The authors propose a novel approach that jointly models link extraction and argument component classification, which is a significant departure from previous work in this area.
2. Effective use of Pointer Network architecture: The authors adapt the Pointer Network architecture to the task of argumentation mining, which allows the model to effectively capture the sequential nature of argument components and their links.
3. State-of-the-art results: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on two evaluation corpora, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited analysis of the results: While the authors provide an analysis of the results, it is limited to a comparison with previous work and does not provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
2. Lack of interpretability: The authors do not provide an analysis of the learned representations and the decisions made by the model, which makes it difficult to understand how the model is working.
3. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their model on two corpora, which may not be representative of all types of argumentative text.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the learned representations and the decisions made by the model?
2. How do you plan to extend this work to other types of argumentative text, such as debates or discussions?
3. Can you provide a comparison with other neural architectures, such as graph convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Pointer Network architecture for argumentation mining?
