This paper proposes a novel approach to improving word vector representations by incorporating morphological knowledge through a post-processing technique called morph-fitting. The method uses simple language-specific rules to extract linguistic constraints, which are then used to fine-tune pre-trained word vectors. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of morph-fitting in improving word similarity performance across four languages, including English, German, Italian, and Russian.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Morph-fitting approach: The paper introduces a new method for incorporating morphological knowledge into word vector representations, which is language-agnostic and does not require curated knowledge bases.
2. Improved word similarity performance: The results show that morph-fitting improves word similarity performance across four languages, with significant gains in morphologically rich languages such as German and Italian.
3. Downstream task evaluation: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of morph-fitting in a downstream task, dialogue state tracking, and shows that it improves performance, especially for morphologically rich languages.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The morph-fitting approach is a new and innovative way to incorporate morphological knowledge into word vector representations.
2. Language-agnostic: The method is language-agnostic, making it applicable to multiple languages.
3. Improved performance: The results show significant improvements in word similarity performance and downstream task evaluation.
However, there are some weaknesses:
1. Limited comparison to previous work: The paper does not provide a thorough comparison to previous work in the area, making it difficult to assess the significance of the contributions.
2. Lack of replication: The paper does not provide replication of related work, which is essential to substantiate the claims made.
3. Scalability: The paper does not discuss the scalability of the proposed system to multiple languages and low-resource languages, which is a significant gap.
To improve the paper, I suggest:
1. Provide a more thorough comparison to previous work: The paper should provide a detailed comparison to previous work in the area, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
2. Replicate related work: The paper should replicate related work to substantiate the claims made and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
3. Discuss scalability: The paper should discuss the scalability of the proposed system to multiple languages and low-resource languages, and provide a plan for addressing these challenges.
Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to improving word vector representations, with significant improvements in word similarity performance and downstream task evaluation. However, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed to make the paper more comprehensive and convincing.
