Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which incorporates semantic information into the segmentation process. MORSE uses word representations to capture semantic relationships between words and their morphemes, in addition to orthographic features. The framework is evaluated on several languages, including English, Turkish, and Finnish, and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art morpheme segmenters, including Morfessor.
Main Contributions
1. Introduction of semantic information into morpheme segmentation: MORSE is the first framework to consider vocabulary-wide semantic knowledge of words and their affixes in addition to relying on their surface forms.
2. Development of a new dataset for morpheme segmentation: The paper introduces a new semantically driven dataset (SD17) for English gold morpheme segmentations, which is designed to address the weaknesses of existing benchmarking datasets.
3. State-of-the-art results on morpheme segmentation: MORSE achieves state-of-the-art results on several languages, including English, Turkish, and Finnish, and outperforms Morfessor and other published state-of-the-art results.
Strengths
1. Effective use of semantic information: MORSE's use of semantic information helps to eliminate over-segmentation errors and improves the accuracy of morpheme segmentation.
2. Robustness to language variability: MORSE is shown to be effective on several languages with different morphological structures, including English, Turkish, and Finnish.
3. Introduction of a new dataset: The paper introduces a new dataset (SD17) that addresses the weaknesses of existing benchmarking datasets and provides a more accurate evaluation of morpheme segmenters.
Weaknesses
1. Limited vocabulary size: MORSE is limited to a vocabulary size of 1M, which may affect its performance on languages with productive morphology.
2. Greedy inference approach: MORSE's inference stage uses a greedy approach, which may limit its performance and lead to incorrect segmentations.
3. Limited to concatenative morphology: MORSE is designed for concatenative morphology and may not be effective on languages that include non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the limitation of MORSE to concatenative morphology and extend it to non-concatenative morphology?
2. Can you provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage and how it will be implemented?
3. How do you plan to evaluate the performance of MORSE on languages with limited resources and small datasets?
