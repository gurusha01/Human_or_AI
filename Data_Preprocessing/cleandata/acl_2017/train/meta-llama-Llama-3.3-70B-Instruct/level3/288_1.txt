This paper proposes a model to classify story endings based on character and word n-grams, achieving better performance on the story cloze task than prior work. However, the paper has several issues that need to be addressed. The definition of "style" is unclear, and the paper needs to be restructured and clarified to make it easier for readers to follow.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The paper demonstrates that different writing tasks can lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be captured using simple stylistic features.
2. The authors establish a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, substantially higher than previous results based on deep learning models.
3. The paper highlights the importance of considering the writing task and its constraints when designing NLP tasks and datasets.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated research question, investigating the effect of writing tasks on writing style.
2. The paper presents a thorough analysis of the story cloze task and its limitations, highlighting the importance of considering the writing task and its constraints.
3. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model in capturing stylistic differences between different writing tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The definition of "style" is unclear, and the paper lacks a clear theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between writing tasks and writing style.
2. The paper lacks details about the data used, such as the number of stories, authors, and stories per author, which is necessary to assess the claim that the writing task imposes different styles on the author.
3. Many statements in the paper are made without justification, such as the choice of "five frequent" POS and words, and the use of character 4-grams, which need to be explained and linked to the concept of "style".
4. The connection between the section "Design of NLP tasks" and the rest of the paper is unclear, and the terminology of "right" and "wrong" endings is confusing and needs to be clarified.
5. The paper's model and approach are not clearly differentiated from previous work, and the results are difficult to understand due to the lack of clarity in the paper.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide a clear definition of "style" and its relationship to writing tasks?
2. How do you justify the choice of "five frequent" POS and words, and the use of character 4-grams?
3. Can you provide more details about the data used, such as the number of stories, authors, and stories per author?
4. How do you differentiate your model and approach from previous work on writing style and machine reading tasks?
