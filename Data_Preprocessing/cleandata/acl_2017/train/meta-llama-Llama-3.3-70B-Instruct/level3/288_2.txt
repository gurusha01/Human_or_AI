This paper explores the impact of different writing tasks on an author's writing style, with a focus on the story cloze task. The authors demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can distinguish between different types of story endings, including original, right, and wrong endings, based on stylistic features. The results show that people adopt different writing styles when asked to write coherent vs. incoherent story endings, and when writing the entire story on their own compared to writing only the final sentence for a given story context.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The demonstration that different writing tasks can lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be captured by a simple linear classifier.
2. The establishment of a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, with an accuracy of 75.2%.
3. The provision of insights into the design of NLP tasks, highlighting the importance of careful attention to instructions given to authors and the potential for biases in writing style.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The innovative approach to analyzing writing style, which sheds light on the cognitive processes involved in writing.
2. The use of a simple yet effective linear classifier, which demonstrates the power of stylistic features in distinguishing between different types of story endings.
3. The thorough analysis of the results, which provides insights into the differences in writing style between original, right, and wrong endings.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
1. The lack of a convincing discussion on writing style and its implications, which could be further explored to provide a deeper understanding of the results.
2. The failure to provide thorough answers to questions related to writing style, such as the implication of starting an incoherent end-of-story sentence with a proper noun or ending a story coherently with a past tense verb.
3. The unclear comparison between studies on deceptive language and short or long answers in the current study, which could be clarified to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results.
4. The vague use of terms like "cognitive load" and "mental states", which could be more precisely defined to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
5. The lack of sufficient discussion on the use of coordinators in short stories and their role in discourse, including differences in genre and the use of "no" coordinators.
Questions to the authors include:
* Can you provide more insight into the cognitive processes involved in writing, and how they relate to the differences in writing style observed in the study?
* How do the results of this study relate to other research on writing style, such as the detection of deceptive text?
* Can you clarify the comparison between studies on deceptive language and short or long answers in the current study, and provide more context for the results?
* How do the findings of this study inform the design of NLP tasks, and what implications do they have for the development of more effective NLP models?
