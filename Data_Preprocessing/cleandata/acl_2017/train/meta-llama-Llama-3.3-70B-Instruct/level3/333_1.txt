Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel task of concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which aims to create a concept map that represents the most important content of a set of related documents. The authors introduce a new crowdsourcing scheme, called low-context importance annotation, to create a gold-standard corpus for this task. The corpus consists of 30 topics, each with around 40 documents and a summarizing concept map. The authors also provide a baseline system and evaluation protocol for the task.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Task Proposal: The authors propose a new task of concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which is a significant extension of traditional summarization tasks.
2. Crowdsourcing Scheme: The authors introduce a novel crowdsourcing scheme, low-context importance annotation, to create a gold-standard corpus for the task.
3. Corpus Creation: The authors create a new corpus for the task, which consists of 30 topics, each with around 40 documents and a summarizing concept map.
4. Baseline System and Evaluation Protocol: The authors provide a baseline system and evaluation protocol for the task, which can be used to compare different approaches.
Strengths
1. Novel Task Proposal: The proposed task is a significant extension of traditional summarization tasks and has the potential to lead to more effective and efficient summarization systems.
2. Well-Designed Crowdsourcing Scheme: The low-context importance annotation scheme is well-designed and effective in creating a gold-standard corpus for the task.
3. Large-Scale Corpus: The created corpus is large-scale and diverse, making it a valuable resource for the research community.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of Implementation Details: The paper lacks implementation details about the baseline system and evaluation protocol, which makes it difficult to reproduce the results.
2. Unclear Comparisons: The paper does not provide clear comparisons with other state-of-the-art systems, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. Limited Analysis: The paper provides limited analysis of the results, which makes it difficult to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide more implementation details about the baseline system and evaluation protocol?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of content selection, which is a major challenge in the task?
3. Can you provide more analysis of the results, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art systems?
