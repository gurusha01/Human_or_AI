This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic parsing, called the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM), which integrates a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer" with a symbolic non-differentiable computer. The NSM framework is designed to support abstract, scalable, and precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of the NSM framework: The authors propose a new framework that combines neural networks with a symbolic computer to support semantic parsing. This framework is designed to be more scalable and efficient than previous approaches.
2. Use of a non-differentiable computer: The NSM framework uses a non-differentiable computer, which allows for more efficient and precise operations. This is in contrast to previous approaches that use differentiable computers, which can be slower and less accurate.
3. Introduction of a key-variable memory: The authors propose a key-variable memory, which allows the neural network to represent and refer to program variables. This is a novel approach that enables the neural network to learn to represent variables in a more efficient and effective way.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Improved performance: The NSM framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset, outperforming previous approaches.
2. Efficient training: The authors propose an efficient training procedure that uses a combination of iterative maximum likelihood and REINFORCE. This approach allows for faster training and better performance.
3. Scalability: The NSM framework is designed to be more scalable than previous approaches, making it more suitable for large-scale semantic parsing tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Lack of analysis: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of why the NSM framework works better than previous approaches. This makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms and limitations of the framework.
2. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate the NSM framework on a single dataset, which limits the generalizability of the results.
3. Complexity: The NSM framework is complex and requires a significant amount of computational resources, which may limit its applicability in practice.
Overall, this paper proposes a novel and efficient approach to semantic parsing, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a challenging dataset. However, further analysis and evaluation are needed to fully understand the strengths and limitations of the NSM framework. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the key-variable memory and how it is used in the NSM framework?
2. How does the NSM framework handle out-of-vocabulary words and entities?
3. Can you provide more analysis on the performance of the NSM framework on different types of questions and entities? 
Minor comments:
1. The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the NSM framework and its components.
2. The authors could provide more examples of how the NSM framework is used in practice.
3. The paper could be improved by adding more related work and comparing the NSM framework to other approaches in the field.
