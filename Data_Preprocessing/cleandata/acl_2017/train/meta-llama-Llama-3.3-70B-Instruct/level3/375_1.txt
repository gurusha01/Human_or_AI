This paper proposes a framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is flexible and can accommodate various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through three applications: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A general framework for cross-context lexical analysis: The authors propose a framework that can be used to analyze word meanings and representations across different contexts, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Flexibility in context definition: The framework allows for various definitions of context, including temporal, spatial, and metadata-based contexts, making it a versatile tool for different applications.
3. Comparison of word embeddings: The authors demonstrate how their framework can be used to compare word embeddings learned from different contexts, which is an important task in natural language processing.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Thorough evaluation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their framework through multiple datasets and baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in different applications.
2. Flexibility: The framework is flexible and can be used with various similarity functions and word annotations, making it a useful tool for different tasks.
3. Novel applications: The authors demonstrate the potential of their framework in novel applications, such as semantic change detection and word embedding stability evaluation.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. Lack of comparison to previous work: The authors do not provide a thorough comparison of their framework to previous work on statistical and probabilistic modeling of networks, which is a significant limitation.
2. Methodological concerns: The authors' use of neural network techniques and heuristic objective functions may be seen as a limitation, as it ignores well-principled generative models.
3. Overfitting: The authors' use of grid searches for hyperparameter values may lead to overfitting, which could be addressed through more robust hyperparameter tuning methods.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. However, the authors could improve their work by addressing the methodological concerns and providing a more thorough comparison to previous work.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to address the methodological concerns and provide a more thorough comparison to previous work on statistical and probabilistic modeling of networks?
2. Can you provide more details on how you plan to use your framework in novel applications, such as framing bias on political viewpoints and fine-grained comparative analysis over specific products?
3. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting and provide more robust hyperparameter tuning methods?
