This paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which leverages word embeddings to capture local semantic similarity and global information about semantic validity of potential morphological segment types. The authors experiment with MORSE on Morpho Challenge data for English, Turkish, and Finnish, demonstrating improvements in F1-score for English and Turkish compared to the Morfessor system. However, MORSE fails to reach Morfessor's performance for Finnish due to the language's rich morphology, leading to data sparsity and reduced word embedding quality.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The introduction of a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that incorporates semantic information, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on English and Turkish.
2. The creation of a new dataset for English gold morpheme segmentations, guided by compositionality, which highlights the importance of semantic cues in morpheme segmentation.
3. The demonstration of MORSE's ability to handle compositionality, outperforming Morfessor on a set of words that should not be segmented from a semantic perspective.
The strengths of this submission are:
1. The innovative approach to morpheme segmentation, combining orthographic and semantic features to improve performance.
2. The thorough evaluation of MORSE on multiple languages and datasets, providing a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and limitations.
3. The creation of a new dataset that addresses the weaknesses of existing benchmarking datasets, providing a more accurate assessment of morpheme segmentation systems.
The weaknesses of this submission are:
1. The limited vocabulary size of MORSE, which may lead to suboptimal performance on languages with rich morphology, such as Finnish.
2. The reliance on gold morpheme segmentations for tuning, which may limit the applicability of MORSE to languages with limited resources.
3. The greedy inference approach, which may propagate errors and limit the performance of MORSE.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do you plan to address the limitation of MORSE's vocabulary size, and what strategies can be employed to improve its performance on languages with rich morphology?
2. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, and how the selection of hyperparameters affects the performance of MORSE?
3. How do you envision the integration of MORSE with other natural language processing tasks, such as lemmatization and stemming, and what potential benefits or challenges do you foresee?
