This paper proposes a novel approach to building natural language interfaces by allowing users to define new concepts and syntax, extending previous work by S. I. Wang, P. Liang, and C. Manning. The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which enables users to interactively naturalize a core programming language, resulting in a more efficient and expressive language interface.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Interactive language learning: The authors propose a method for interactive language learning, where users can define new concepts and syntax, allowing the system to learn and adapt to the user's language.
2. Grammar induction: The authors introduce a grammar induction algorithm that can learn new grammar rules from user definitions, enabling the system to generalize and apply these rules to new utterances.
3. Naturalization of core language: The authors demonstrate that users can naturalize a core programming language, resulting in a more efficient and expressive language interface.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Well-written content: The paper is well-organized and clearly explains the proposed approach and its components.
2. Compelling direction: The authors propose a novel approach to building natural language interfaces, which has the potential to improve the usability and expressiveness of these interfaces.
3. Strong experimental results: The authors provide experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including the naturalization of the core language and the induction of new grammar rules.
However, there are also some weaknesses and concerns:
1. Lack of discussion on incentives: The authors do not provide a detailed discussion on the effect of incentives on performance, which is an important aspect of the proposed approach.
2. Potential challenges in extending to practical domains: The authors do not discuss the potential challenges in extending their approach to more practical domains, such as natural language processing or robotics.
3. Need for real-world applications: The authors do not provide real-world applications of their approach, which would help to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.
4. Sensitivity to vocabulary size and ambiguity: The authors do not address the potential sensitivity of their approach to vocabulary size and ambiguity in natural language, which could impact its performance and effectiveness.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the potential challenges in extending their approach to more practical domains?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the effect of incentives on performance and how they plan to optimize the incentive structure?
3. How do the authors plan to address the sensitivity of their approach to vocabulary size and ambiguity in natural language?
