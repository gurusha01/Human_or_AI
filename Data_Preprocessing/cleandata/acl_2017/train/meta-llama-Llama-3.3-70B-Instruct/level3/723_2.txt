This paper proposes a method called MORSE for unsupervised morphological segmentation, which applies local optimization based on orthographic and semantic rules. The authors present multiple ways to evaluate segmentation hypotheses on word embeddings and provide convincing results on English and Turkish data sets. The paper is clearly written and organized, with an extensive bibliography and included software for testing the English MORSE model.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of the MORSE method for unsupervised morphological segmentation.
2. The evaluation of segmentation hypotheses on word embeddings, which provides a new perspective on morphological segmentation.
3. The provision of convincing results on English and Turkish data sets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the MORSE method.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The clear and organized writing style, which makes it easy to follow and understand the proposed method and its evaluation.
2. The extensive bibliography, which provides a comprehensive overview of the related work in the field.
3. The inclusion of software for testing the English MORSE model, which allows for easy replication and verification of the results.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The lack of meaningful comparison to prior work and analysis of the method's limitations, which makes it difficult to assess the significance and impact of the proposed method.
2. The limitations of the proposed method, particularly in segmenting compounds, and the unfair evaluation due to the lack of hyperparameter tuning for the baseline method Morfessor.
3. The lack of important details, such as the description of the "morpheme-level evaluation" method and the comparison of results from different evaluation sets.
To improve this paper, the authors could provide more details on the computational efficiency of the MORSE method, clarify the benefits of the MORSE approach, and address inconsistencies in the gold standard data sets. Additionally, the abstract and sections 3 and 5 could be improved with additional information, and the format of the data sets could be improved for better usability. Finally, the authors should correct the errors in the references, including missing publication details and incorrect capitalization of proper nouns and abbreviations.
Questions to the authors:
1. How does the MORSE method handle out-of-vocabulary words and morphological variations?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the MORSE method and the baseline method Morfessor?
3. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the MORSE method, particularly in segmenting compounds?
