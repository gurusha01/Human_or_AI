This paper presents a novel approach to improving word vector spaces by incorporating morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints. The proposed method, termed morph-fitting, uses simple language-specific rules to extract sets of linguistic constraints that describe morphological processes in a language. These constraints are then used to fine-tune pre-trained word vectors, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Morph-fitting methodology: The authors propose a novel method for incorporating morphological knowledge into word vector spaces, which is language-agnostic and does not require curated knowledge bases.
2. Improved word similarity performance: The results show that morph-fitting improves vector spaces induced by distributional models across four languages, with significant gains in word similarity tasks such as SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500.
3. Boosted downstream performance: The use of morph-fitted vectors boosts the performance of downstream language understanding models, such as dialogue state tracking, especially for morphologically rich languages like German.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Well-written and thorough discussion: The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the approach, its limitations, and the results.
2. Robust evaluation: The authors evaluate their method on multiple languages, datasets, and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.
3. Novel contribution: The proposed morph-fitting method is a new and innovative approach to improving word vector spaces, with potential applications in various NLP tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Minor weaknesses in writing: There are some minor orthographical mistakes and repetitive clauses, which can be improved by shortening sections 1 and 2.
2. Ambiguous goals: The main goal of the paper is not clearly laid out, which can make it difficult to follow.
3. Formatting issues: The formatting of tables and figures, such as Table 1 and figures 3, 5, and 6, can be improved for better readability and presentation.
4. Content organization: The paper's content can be reorganized to make it easier to understand, as it was difficult to follow during the first read.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on how the language-specific rules were created and how they can be extended to other languages?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of ambiguous goals and improve the clarity of the paper?
3. Can you provide more insights on the potential applications of morph-fitting in other NLP tasks and how it can be integrated with other methods?
