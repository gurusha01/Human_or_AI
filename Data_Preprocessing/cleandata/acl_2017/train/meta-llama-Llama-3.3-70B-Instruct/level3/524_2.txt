This paper explores several techniques for enhancing coverage when parsing with HPSG grammars, specifically the English Resource Grammar (ERG). The authors evaluate five approaches to increasing the robustness of parsing with the ERG, including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches. The results show that the PCFG-based systems are capable of greatly enhancing the coverage of the ERG, while producing analyses whose quality is better than the other robust systems evaluated.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A comparison of robust parsing methods for HPSG grammars, including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches.
2. An evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods on several datasets, including alchemy45, ws13r, semcor, and wsj00ab.
3. The introduction of a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of PCFG-based parsing and precision grammar parsing.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. A thorough evaluation of several robust parsing methods for HPSG grammars, providing a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
2. The use of multiple datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods, including datasets with varying levels of difficulty and complexity.
3. The introduction of a hybrid approach that shows promise in improving the coverage and accuracy of HPSG parsing.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
1. The comparison of robust parsing methods is limited to only a few techniques applied to a single grammar, the ERG, which may not be representative of other precision grammar frameworks.
2. The paper lacks comparison with robustness techniques applied to other precision grammars, such as CCG, LFG, and Alpage system for French.
3. The paper lacks sufficient detail to make the results replicable, with various details not spelled out and references to other papers that are still in preparation.
4. The actual results of the various techniques are disappointing, with most methods being extremely slow and the csaw-tb method being faster but not very accurate.
5. The paper would benefit from results on a representative dataset, including both sentences that are in the coverage of the grammar and those that are not, to provide a more accurate comparison with the baseline system.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of replicability, given the lack of detail in the paper and the references to other papers that are still in preparation?
2. How do the authors plan to extend the comparison of robust parsing methods to other precision grammar frameworks, such as CCG, LFG, and Alpage system for French?
3. What are the plans for future work on improving the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid approach, and how do the authors plan to evaluate its effectiveness in downstream applications?
