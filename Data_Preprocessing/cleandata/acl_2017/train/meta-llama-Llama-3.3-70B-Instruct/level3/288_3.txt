This paper presents a well-written and effectively demonstrated application of stylometric analysis in text classification, with significant implications for NLP dataset design. The authors show that variants of the same writing task can lead to measurable differences in writing style, and that a simple linear classifier informed with stylistic features can distinguish among different types of story endings.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The demonstration of the impact of writing tasks on writing style, highlighting the potential of stylometric analysis in reasoning-like text classification.
2. The presentation of a simple yet effective method for distinguishing between different types of story endings, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task.
3. The provision of valuable insights for the design of NLP tasks, emphasizing the importance of controlling for writing task effects on writing style.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The clear and controlled experimental design, which allows for the isolation of the effect of writing tasks on writing style.
2. The effective use of simple features and a simple classifier to prove a non-obvious hypothesis, demonstrating the significant impact of writing tasks on style.
3. The discussion on the implications for NLP task design, which is particularly noteworthy and has the potential to be highly influential and well-cited in the field.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of a clear definition of "style", which may cause confusion for readers outside of computational stylometrics.
2. The limited scope of the study, which focuses on a specific writing task and may not generalize to other tasks or domains.
3. The potential for biases in the dataset, which may affect the results and limit their applicability to other contexts.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of a clear definition of "style" in their future work?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the potential biases in the dataset and how they may affect the results?
3. How do the authors plan to generalize their findings to other writing tasks and domains?
