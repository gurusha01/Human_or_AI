This paper proposes a novel approach to keyphrase prediction in scientific texts using a generative model based on the encoder-decoder framework. The model utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and a copy mechanism to capture both semantic and syntactic features of the input text. The main contributions of this work are three-fold: (1) the proposal of an RNN-based generative model for keyphrase prediction, (2) the incorporation of a copy mechanism to handle rarely-occurred phrases, and (3) the demonstration of the model's effectiveness in predicting both present and absent keyphrases.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novel approach: The proposed model is a new and innovative approach to keyphrase prediction, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in this area.
2. Effective use of RNNs and copy mechanism: The model's use of RNNs and a copy mechanism allows it to capture both semantic and syntactic features of the input text, which is essential for effective keyphrase prediction.
3. Comprehensive evaluation: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting both present and absent keyphrases.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. Lack of comparison to other generative models: The paper does not compare the proposed model to other generative models for keyphrase prediction, which makes it difficult to assess its relative performance.
2. Limited analysis of the copy mechanism: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the copy mechanism and its impact on the model's performance, which would be useful for understanding its strengths and limitations.
3. No evaluation of the model's robustness: The paper does not evaluate the model's robustness to noise or variations in the input text, which is an important aspect of any natural language processing model.
Overall, this paper presents a promising approach to keyphrase prediction, and with some additional analysis and evaluation, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
Questions to authors:
1. How does the proposed model handle out-of-vocabulary words, and what is the impact of the copy mechanism on this issue?
2. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the copy mechanism and its impact on the model's performance?
3. How does the model's performance vary across different domains and types of text, and what are the implications of this for its potential applications?
