This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors introduce a multimodal ensemble of features, automatically learned from text and readers' eye-movement data, to improve the performance of sentiment and sarcasm classification tasks.
Summary of the Paper:
The paper presents a CNN-based framework that combines text and gaze features to detect sentiment and sarcasm in text. The authors experiment with different variants of the CNN architecture, including static, non-static, and multi-channel text components, as well as fixation, saccade, and multi-channel gaze components. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features, as well as CNN-based systems that rely on text input alone.
