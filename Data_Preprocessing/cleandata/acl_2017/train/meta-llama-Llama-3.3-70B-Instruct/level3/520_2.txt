This paper introduces a novel approach to interactive language learning, which the authors term "naturalization." The core idea is to seed a system with a core programming language and allow users to incrementally define new constructions, effectively teaching the system to understand a more natural language. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a voxel-based world, Voxelurn, where users can build complex structures using a combination of core language and user-defined concepts.
The primary contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of the naturalization concept: The authors propose a new paradigm for interactive language learning, which leverages user definitions to incrementally expand the language capabilities of the system.
2. Development of the Voxelurn system: The authors design and implement a voxel-based world, Voxelurn, which serves as a testbed for their naturalization approach.
3. Grammar induction algorithm: The authors develop a grammar induction algorithm that can learn from user definitions and generate new grammar rules, enabling the system to parse and understand user-defined concepts.
The strengths of this work are:
1. Effective use of user definitions: The authors demonstrate that user definitions can provide a powerful learning signal, allowing the system to learn and generalize to new concepts.
2. Scalability: The Voxelurn system is able to handle a large number of user interactions and definitions, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
3. Flexibility: The naturalization approach can be applied to various domains, including answering questions about semi-structured data, parsing to regular expressions, or following robot instructions.
However, there are some weaknesses to this work:
1. Limited evaluation: The authors primarily evaluate their approach using a single dataset and task, which may not be representative of the broader applicability of their method.
2. Lack of comparison to existing methods: The authors do not provide a direct comparison to existing interactive language learning approaches, making it difficult to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of their method.
3. Potential for overfitting: The authors' use of user definitions as a learning signal may lead to overfitting to the specific users and tasks, rather than generalizing to new users and tasks.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do you plan to address the potential for overfitting to specific users and tasks?
2. Can you provide a more detailed comparison to existing interactive language learning approaches?
3. How do you envision the naturalization approach being applied to other domains and tasks?
