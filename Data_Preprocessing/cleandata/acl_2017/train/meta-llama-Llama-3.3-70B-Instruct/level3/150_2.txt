This paper proposes a novel multigraph-based model for recognizing overlapping entities in text, which is a significant improvement over previous models. The paper is well-structured and clear, with original ideas and interesting results, making it easy to follow and understand. The proposed architecture explores a complex architecture with a new deep word-encoding layer and a deep word-decoding layer to improve performance.
The main contributions of this paper are: 
1. A novel multigraph-based model for predicting overlapping entities, 
2. Empirical results showing that the model achieves higher F1-scores compared to previous models in multiple datasets, and 
3. Theoretical analysis showing that the model resolves the spurious structures issue associated with a previous state-of-the-art model.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to recognize overlapping entities, which is a common phenomenon in many datasets. The model's performance is also impressive, with significant improvements over previous models. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses, including its ability to handle non-overlapping entities and its performance on different datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses to this paper. The evaluation comparison with other state-of-the-art systems is incomplete, with small differences in F1-scores and missing statistical significance information. The section on the system's ability to learn morphology lacks formal evaluation and experiments to support the claims. Additionally, the paper uses many undefined acronyms, which could be defined to improve clarity, and has some formatting and typographical errors that need to be corrected.
To improve the paper, I suggest several minor changes, including defining acronyms, refreshing concepts, and correcting typos. The paper could also benefit from more detailed explanations of the model's architecture and training procedure. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis of the model's performance on different datasets and more comparison with other state-of-the-art models.
Some questions to the authors include: 
1. How does the model handle cases where there are multiple overlapping entities with different types? 
2. Can the model be applied to other NLP tasks that involve predicting overlapping structures, such as equation parsing? 
3. How does the model's performance compare to other state-of-the-art models on different datasets? 
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of NLP, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
