This paper proposes a novel approach to IsA extraction, which involves a compositional method for interpreting fine-grained class labels. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. A compositional method for IsA extraction, which applies noun-phrase paraphrasing methods to semantic taxonomy induction.
2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP: assigning intrinsic "meaning" to a phrase and reasoning about that phrase in a truth-theoretic context.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposed framework is generalizable and can be applied to different applications with various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read and understand.
* The approach has the potential to significantly increase the number of fine-grained classes that can be populated with instances.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The experiment evaluation is a major concern, as it uses qualitative metrics, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.
* The lack of quantitative evaluation makes it hard to claim the benefits of the proposed method, CCLA, for downstream applications.
* The paper relies heavily on the quality of the IsA repository and fact repository, which may not always be accurate or comprehensive.
Some questions to the authors:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of qualitative evaluation and provide more quantitative results to support their claims?
* Can the authors provide more details on how the proposed method can be applied to different applications and domains?
* How do the authors plan to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the IsA repository and fact repository, which are crucial to the success of the proposed method?
