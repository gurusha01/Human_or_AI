This paper proposes a novel multigraph-based model for recognizing overlapping entities in text, which shows promising results on several standard datasets. The authors release their code and learned models, allowing for validation and replication of their work. The system produces reasonable translation results even after the first training epoch and learns morphological tokenizations.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. A novel multigraph-based model for predicting overlapping entities, 
2. Empirical results showing that the model achieves higher F1-scores compared to previous models on multiple datasets, and 
3. Theoretical analysis showing that the model resolves the spurious structures issue associated with a previous state-of-the-art model.
The strengths of this paper include: 
1. The proposed model's ability to recognize overlapping entities, which is a common phenomenon in many datasets, 
2. The model's non-deficient nature, which resolves the issue of spurious structures, and 
3. The empirical results showing that the model outperforms previous models on several datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses to this paper, including: 
1. The lack of explicit statement of which test and dev sets the results are reported on, making comparison to existing work difficult, 
2. The incomplete and unclear software README instructions, and 
3. The unclear diagram of the 6-level architecture, which appears to show fewer than 6 layers.
Some questions to the authors include: 
1. Can you provide more details on the features used in the model, and how they were selected? 
2. How does the model handle cases where there are multiple overlapping entities with different types? 
3. Can you provide more analysis on the spurious structures issue and how it is resolved in the proposed model? 
Overall, this paper is a nice contribution to the literature on character-based neural machine translation, and the proposed model shows promising results on several datasets. However, there are some areas that need improvement, such as providing more details on the features and model architecture, and addressing the spurious structures issue more thoroughly.
