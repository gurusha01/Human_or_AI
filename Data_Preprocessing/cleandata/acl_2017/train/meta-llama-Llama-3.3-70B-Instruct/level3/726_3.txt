Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which uses both orthographic and semantic features to segment words into morphemes. The framework is evaluated on three languages (English, Turkish, and Finnish) and outperforms the state-of-the-art Morfessor system. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to evaluate the performance of morpheme segmenters in a more semantically driven way.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Framework: The paper proposes a new framework for morpheme segmentation that combines orthographic and semantic features.
2. State-of-the-Art Results: MORSE outperforms Morfessor on English and Turkish, and achieves competitive results on Finnish.
3. New Dataset: The authors introduce a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to evaluate the performance of morpheme segmenters in a more semantically driven way.
Strengths
1. Improved Performance: MORSE achieves state-of-the-art results on English and Turkish, and competitive results on Finnish.
2. Semantic Features: The framework uses semantic features to improve the accuracy of morpheme segmentation.
3. New Dataset: The introduction of SD17 provides a new benchmark for evaluating morpheme segmenters.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Vocabulary: MORSE is limited to a vocabulary of 1M, which may not be sufficient for languages with large vocabularies.
2. Greedy Inference: The greedy inference approach used in MORSE may lead to suboptimal results.
3. Concatenative Morphology: MORSE is limited to concatenative morphology, which may not be suitable for languages with non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of MORSE to concatenative morphology?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of MORSE on languages with non-concatenative morphology?
