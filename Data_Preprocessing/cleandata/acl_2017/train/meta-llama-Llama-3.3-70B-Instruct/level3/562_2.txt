This paper proposes a novel approach to relation extraction by converting it into a question answering task. The technique is effective in identifying relations, working well on unseen questions and relatively well on unseen relations. The authors provide a method for obtaining a large training dataset, which is a significant contribution. The paper is well-written and argued, presenting an interesting idea that works decently, with notable results including the zero-shot NL method performing similarly to the single question baseline.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. A compositional method for IsA extraction, which involves a novel application of noun-phrase paraphrasing methods to the task of semantic taxonomy induction.
2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP: assigning intrinsic "meaning" to a phrase, and reasoning about that phrase in a truth-theoretic context.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed method achieves good performance, with an F-measure of almost 90, indicating its effectiveness in relation extraction.
2. The technique is able to handle unseen questions and relations, demonstrating its ability to generalize well.
3. The authors provide a method for obtaining a large training dataset, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The lack of comparison on standard relation extraction datasets, making it difficult to determine the biases in the data and the technique's performance.
2. The authors failed to compare their QA approach with a relation detection model trained on the generated data, which would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of their method.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of comparison on standard relation extraction datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more details on how they plan to compare their QA approach with a relation detection model trained on the generated data?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the performance of their method on unseen relations?
