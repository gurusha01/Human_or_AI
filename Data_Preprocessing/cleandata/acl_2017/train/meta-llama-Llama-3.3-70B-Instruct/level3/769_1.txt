Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation methodology for the task of ghostwriting rap lyrics, which involves generating lyrics in the style of a given artist. The authors develop a manual evaluation method that assesses several key properties of generated verse, including fluency, coherence, and style matching. They also create a dataset of authentic verse, manually annotated for style matching, and propose a fully automated evaluation method that replicates the results of a previously available semi-automatic method.
Main Contributions
1. Comprehensive evaluation methodology: The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation methodology that captures complementary aspects of the ghostwriting task, including fluency, coherence, and style matching.
2. Manual evaluation method: The authors develop a manual evaluation method that assesses several key properties of generated verse, including fluency, coherence, and style matching.
3. Automated evaluation method: The authors propose a fully automated evaluation method that replicates the results of a previously available semi-automatic method and can be used to evaluate the performance of ghostwriting models.
Strengths
1. Comprehensive evaluation methodology: The proposed evaluation methodology is comprehensive and captures multiple aspects of the ghostwriting task, providing a more complete understanding of the task's goals and challenges.
2. Manual evaluation method: The manual evaluation method provides a detailed and nuanced assessment of the generated verse, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.
3. Automated evaluation method: The automated evaluation method is efficient and can be used to evaluate the performance of ghostwriting models on a large scale.
Weaknesses
1. Limited dataset: The dataset used in the paper is limited to 13 rap artists, which may not be representative of the entire rap music genre.
2. Subjective evaluation: The manual evaluation method is subjective and may be influenced by the annotators' personal biases and preferences.
3. Lack of comparison to other models: The paper only compares the performance of the proposed model to a baseline model and does not provide a comparison to other state-of-the-art models.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limited size of the dataset and ensure that the proposed evaluation methodology is representative of the entire rap music genre?
2. How do the authors plan to mitigate the subjectivity of the manual evaluation method and ensure that the results are reliable and consistent?
3. Can the authors provide a comparison of the proposed model to other state-of-the-art models in the field of ghostwriting and natural language generation?
