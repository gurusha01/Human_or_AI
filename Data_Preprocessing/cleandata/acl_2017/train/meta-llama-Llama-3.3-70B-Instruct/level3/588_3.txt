This paper proposes a novel framework for neural program induction, called the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM), which integrates a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer" with a symbolic non-differentiable "computer". The NSM is designed to support abstract, scalable, and precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. The paper claims that the NSM achieves state-of-the-art results on a challenging semantic parsing dataset with weak supervision, significantly closing the gap between weak and full supervision.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of the Manager-Programmer-Computer framework for neural program induction, which integrates neural networks with a symbolic non-differentiable computer.
2. The introduction of the Neural Symbolic Machine, which integrates a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer" with a Lisp interpreter "computer" and a key-variable memory to support compositionality.
3. The development of an augmented REINFORCE training procedure, which combines REINFORCE with an iterative maximum likelihood process to bootstrap training.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The NSM framework provides a novel and promising approach to neural program induction, which can support abstract, scalable, and precise operations.
2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the NSM on a challenging semantic parsing dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art results with weak supervision.
3. The augmented REINFORCE training procedure is a significant contribution, as it provides a effective way to train the NSM with weak supervision.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The paper lacks a convincing argument for proposing the Rare Entity prediction task, and its importance and real-world applications are not clearly demonstrated.
2. The paper lacks a detailed characterization of the dataset, making it difficult to understand the baselines and evaluate the results.
3. The baselines used in the paper are not clearly motivated, and alternative methods such as using pre-trained vectors or Pointer Networks are not considered.
4. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of the reasoning process behind the model's predictions, which makes it difficult to understand why the NSM is effective.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the Rare Entity prediction task and its importance in real-world applications?
2. Can you provide a more detailed characterization of the dataset, including the distribution of entities and relations?
3. Can you motivate the choice of baselines and consider alternative methods such as using pre-trained vectors or Pointer Networks?
4. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning process behind the model's predictions, and how the NSM is able to effectively predict rare entities?
