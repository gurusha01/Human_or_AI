This paper explores several techniques for enhancing coverage in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parsing, with a focus on robust parsing methods. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The development of a robust parsing framework that incorporates model averaging during inference through a Bayesian treatment of RNN parameters, although this is not directly applicable to the HPSG parsing task at hand.
2. The evaluation of five approaches to increasing the robustness of parsing with the English Resource Grammar (ERG), including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches.
3. The creation of several datasets for evaluating robust parsing techniques, including alchemy45, ws13r, semcor, and wsj00ab.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. A thorough evaluation of various robust parsing techniques, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
2. The development of a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of PCFG-based parsing and precision grammar-based parsing.
3. The creation of datasets for evaluating robust parsing techniques, which can be useful for future research in this area.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of clarity in the experimental setup, with important details such as burn-in, number of epochs, and samples collected missing from the main paper.
2. The absence of comparison and discussion with related methods like ensembling and distillation, which share a similar goal of incorporating model averaging effects.
3. The need for further discussion on the preference for certain sampling methods over others and variational approximation.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup, including the burn-in period, number of epochs, and samples collected?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of ambiguity management in the bridging and Pacman approaches?
3. Can you provide a more detailed comparison with related methods like ensembling and distillation?
