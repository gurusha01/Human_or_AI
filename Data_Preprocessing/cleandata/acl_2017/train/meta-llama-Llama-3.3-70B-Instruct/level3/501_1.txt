This paper proposes a novel approach to word representation learning (WRL) by incorporating sememe information from the HowNet knowledge base. The authors introduce three sememe-encoded models, including Simple Sememe Aggregation Model (SSA), Sememe Attention over Context Model (SAC), and Sememe Attention over Target Model (SAT), which utilize sememe information to improve word representation learning. The paper is well-written, well-structured, and well-motivated, with clear contributions supported by empirical evidence.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a novel method to model sememe information for learning better word representations.
2. The introduction of three sememe-encoded models, including SSA, SAC, and SAT, which utilize sememe information to improve word representation learning.
3. The evaluation of the proposed models on word similarity and word analogy tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the sememe-encoded models.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The paper proposes a novel approach to WRL by incorporating sememe information, which has not been explored before.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed models on two tasks, including word similarity and word analogy, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the sememe-encoded models.
3. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results, including case studies, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed models.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The paper assumes that the sememe information in HowNet is accurate and reliable, which may not always be the case.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art WRL models, which makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the proposed models.
3. The paper does not explore the potential applications of the proposed models in other NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of noisy or inaccurate sememe information in HowNet?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art WRL models, including their strengths and weaknesses?
3. How do the authors plan to explore the potential applications of the proposed models in other NLP tasks?
