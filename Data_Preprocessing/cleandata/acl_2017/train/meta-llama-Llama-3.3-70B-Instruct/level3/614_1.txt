This paper proposes a novel approach to natural language inference (NLI) by integrating word sense inventories into existing lexical substitution task frameworks. The authors introduce a metric to measure the mutual substitutability of sense inventories and empirically evaluate the substitutability of inventories from various sources.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a two-pronged approach that combines vector space models and sense inventories to improve the lexical substitution task.
2. The introduction of a metric to measure the mutual substitutability of sense inventories, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different inventory combinations.
3. The empirical evaluation of the substitutability of inventories from various sources, which provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different inventory combinations.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposal of a novel approach that combines the strengths of vector space models and sense inventories to improve the lexical substitution task.
2. The introduction of a metric to measure the mutual substitutability of sense inventories, which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different inventory combinations.
3. The empirical evaluation of the substitutability of inventories from various sources, which provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different inventory combinations.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of clarity in the presentation, with disjoint sections and unclear connections between them, making it hard to follow.
2. The poor performance on nouns, which contradicts the claim that the clustering approach is generalizable to all parts of speech.
3. The unclear effectiveness of the multi-view clustering approach, with one view performing significantly better than others.
Overall, this paper proposes a novel approach to NLI that combines the strengths of vector space models and sense inventories. While the paper has some weaknesses, the proposal of a metric to measure the mutual substitutability of sense inventories and the empirical evaluation of the substitutability of inventories from various sources are significant contributions to the field.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on how the metric to measure the mutual substitutability of sense inventories is calculated?
2. How do you plan to address the poor performance on nouns, and what modifications can be made to the clustering approach to improve its generalizability to all parts of speech?
3. Can you provide more insights into the effectiveness of the multi-view clustering approach, and why one view performs significantly better than others?
