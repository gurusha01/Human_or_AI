This paper proposes a novel approach to keyphrase generation using an encoder-decoder framework, which achieves better results than other baselines with supervised data. The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and provides enough details to replicate experiments with reasonable and supportive results.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of an RNN-based generative model for keyphrase prediction, which incorporates a copy mechanism to enable the model to predict rarely-occurred phrases.
2. The comprehensive comparison against six important baselines on a broad range of datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model for generating both present and absent keyphrases.
3. The introduction of a new testing dataset, KP20k, which contains a large number of scientific articles in Computer Science.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The paper proposes a novel approach to keyphrase generation, which has the potential to improve information retrieval performance and assist user browsing.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which outperforms other baselines in most cases.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive comparison against other baselines, which helps to establish the superiority of the proposed model.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of surprise in the proposed approach, as the encoder-decoder framework has been widely used in other natural language processing tasks.
2. The model's poor performance when transferred to a new domain, such as news articles, which suggests that the model may not be able to generalize well to other types of text.
3. The paper does not fully consider the correlation among target keyphrases, which may be an important aspect of keyphrase generation.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to address the issue of the model's poor performance when transferred to a new domain?
2. Can you provide more details on how the copy mechanism works and how it enables the model to predict rarely-occurred phrases?
3. How do you plan to explore the multiple-output optimization on your model to consider the correlation among target keyphrases?
