This paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which leverages both orthographic and semantic features to segment words into morphemes. The authors claim that their approach is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, the proposed framework, and the experimental results.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A novel framework for morpheme segmentation that combines orthographic and semantic features.
2. A new dataset for English gold morpheme segmentations, called SD17, which is created with compositionality guiding the annotations.
3. An evaluation of the proposed framework on multiple languages, including English, Turkish, and Finnish.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the Morpho Challenge dataset and the newly introduced SD17 dataset.
2. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the weaknesses of the Morpho Challenge dataset and introduce a new dataset that addresses these weaknesses.
3. The paper presents a clear and well-structured overview of the related work and the proposed framework.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The authors do not provide a thorough comparison of their approach with other state-of-the-art methods, such as those using deep learning techniques.
2. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the errors made by the proposed framework and the potential reasons for these errors.
3. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how the hyperparameters of the proposed framework are tuned, which could be an important aspect of the approach.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the proposed framework, such as the greedy inference approach and the limitation to concatenative morphology?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage, which could be an important aspect of the approach?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed framework to other languages and domains, and what are the potential challenges and opportunities in doing so?
