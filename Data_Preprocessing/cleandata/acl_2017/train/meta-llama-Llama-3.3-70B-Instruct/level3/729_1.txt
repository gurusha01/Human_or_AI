This paper proposes a kernel-based method for rumor detection by evaluating similarities between propagation tree structures. The approach detects rumors more quickly and with higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A novel kernel-based method that captures high-order patterns differentiating types of rumors.
2. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in rumor detection, outperforming existing methods.
3. The incorporation of syntactic parsing information further improves the performance, even when added to an already strong model.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed method's ability to detect rumors quickly and accurately, making it a significant contribution to the field.
2. The use of syntactic parsing information, which complements the sequential inference model and further improves performance.
3. The thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including ablation analysis and comparison with existing state-of-the-art models.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The math is not always clear, specifically in Section 4, which may hinder understanding of the proposed method.
2. The paper requires editing to fix typos, add missing information, and standardize formatting to improve clarity and readability.
3. The dataset used in the study should be made public for research purposes to facilitate further development and comparison of rumor detection methods.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the kernel-based method and how it captures high-order patterns differentiating types of rumors?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of data sparseness, and what knowledge resources do you intend to explore in future work?
3. Can you provide more insights into the fragments of sentences or parses highlighted by the attention mechanism and how they can be used to provide human-readable explanations of the decisions?
