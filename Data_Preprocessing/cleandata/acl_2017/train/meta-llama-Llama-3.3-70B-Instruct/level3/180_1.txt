This paper presents a novel approach to learning bilingual word embeddings using a self-learning framework. The method reduces the need for large bilingual dictionaries and can work with as little as 25 word pairs or even an automatically generated list of numerals. The authors claim that their approach is able to learn high-quality bilingual embeddings that are competitive with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A self-learning framework that can be combined with any embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique.
2. The ability to learn bilingual word embeddings from small seed dictionaries or automatically generated lists of numerals.
3. Competitive results with state-of-the-art systems on bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity tasks.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed method is simple and efficient, making it easy to implement and scale.
2. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on multiple language pairs and tasks.
3. The analysis of the optimization objective provides insight into how the self-learning framework works and why it is able to learn high-quality bilingual embeddings.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The method relies on a good initial solution to avoid getting stuck in poor local optima, which may not always be the case.
2. The approach may not be suitable for language pairs with very different linguistic structures or writing systems.
3. The use of a small seed dictionary or automatically generated list of numerals may not provide enough information to learn high-quality bilingual embeddings for all language pairs.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do you plan to address the issue of getting stuck in poor local optima, and what methods can be used to improve the initial solution?
2. Can you provide more analysis on the linguistic proximity of the language pairs and how it affects the performance of the method?
3. How do you plan to extend the approach to learn bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all, and what challenges do you anticipate in this direction?
