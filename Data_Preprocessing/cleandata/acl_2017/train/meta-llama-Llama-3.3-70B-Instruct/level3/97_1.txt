Summary of the Paper
The paper presents an automated Japanese short-answer scoring and support system for the new National Center written test exams. The system uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to evaluate the semantic similarity between model answers and actual written answers. The system generates automated scores based on evaluation criteria and allows human raters to revise them. The authors claim that their system can achieve a high degree of accuracy in scoring short-answer tests, with differences between human and automated scores within one point for 70-90% of the data.
Main Contributions
1. Application of NLP to written test scoring: The paper applies NLP techniques to a practical problem in education, demonstrating the potential of AI in automating scoring tasks.
2. Development of a support system: The system provides a useful tool for human raters to evaluate and revise automated scores, reducing the time and effort required for scoring.
3. Evaluation of the system's performance: The authors present an evaluation of the system's performance on a set of test items, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
Strengths
1. Practical application: The paper demonstrates a practical application of NLP and machine learning techniques to a real-world problem in education.
2. Useful tool for human raters: The system provides a useful tool for human raters to evaluate and revise automated scores, reducing the time and effort required for scoring.
3. Potential for improvement: The authors identify areas for improvement, such as increasing the size of the training dataset and refining the evaluation criteria.
Weaknesses
1. Lack of novelty: The paper does not introduce new concepts or methods, but rather applies existing techniques to a known problem.
2. Limited evaluation: The evaluation of the system's performance is limited to a small set of test items and does not provide a clear baseline for comparison.
3. Dependence on human intervention: The system requires human intervention to revise automated scores, which may limit its autonomy and effectiveness.
4. Poor writing and presentation: The paper's writing and presentation are rough and unclear in several places, making it difficult to follow the authors' arguments.
5. Lack of inspiring message: The paper does not convey a meaningful message beyond announcing the development of the system, and its contributions are not clearly articulated.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of limited training data and improve the system's performance on a larger scale?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the evaluation criteria used to assess the system's performance and how they were developed?
3. How do the authors envision the system being used in practice, and what are the potential benefits and limitations of its adoption?
