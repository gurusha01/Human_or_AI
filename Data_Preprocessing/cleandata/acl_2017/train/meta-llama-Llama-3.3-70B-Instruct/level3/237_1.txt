This paper presents a systematic investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of various word embedding models, including Continuous Skip-Gram (CSG), Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), and GloVe, with different context types (linear and dependency-based) and context representations (unbound and bound).
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A comprehensive evaluation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
2. The introduction of a new context representation, bound representation, which associates each contextual word with its relative position or dependency relation to the target word.
3. The development of a word2vecPM toolkit, which supports generalized SG, CBOW, and GloVe with arbitrary contexts, making it easier for researchers to experiment with different context types and representations.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The thorough evaluation of different context types and representations, providing a clear understanding of their impact on word embedding quality.
2. The use of a variety of tasks, including word similarity, word analogy, part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and text classification, to demonstrate the effectiveness of different context types and representations.
3. The provision of a word2vecPM toolkit, which will facilitate further research and experimentation in the field.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of a clear justification for the choice of context types and representations, which may limit the generalizability of the results.
2. The limited evaluation of the word2vecPM toolkit, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
3. The absence of a detailed analysis of the results, which may make it difficult to understand the underlying reasons for the observed differences in performance.
Questions to the authors:
1. How did you choose the specific context types and representations evaluated in this paper, and what motivated these choices?
2. Can you provide more details on the word2vecPM toolkit, including its implementation and any plans for future development or maintenance?
3. How do you think the results of this paper can be generalized to other languages or domains, and what further research is needed to explore these areas?
