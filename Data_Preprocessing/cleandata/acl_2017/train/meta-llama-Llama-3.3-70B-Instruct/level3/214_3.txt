This paper presents a valuable study on the impact of writing tasks on writing style, with a focus on the story cloze task. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The paper demonstrates that different writing tasks can lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be captured using simple stylistic features.
2. The authors show that a linear classifier informed with stylistic features can distinguish between different types of story endings, even without considering the story context.
3. The paper establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, substantially higher than previous results based on deep learning models.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The study provides new insights into the relationship between writing tasks and writing style, which can have implications for the design of NLP tasks and the development of writing style analysis tools.
2. The authors use a simple yet effective approach to capture stylistic differences between different types of story endings, which can be useful for other NLP applications.
3. The paper presents a thorough analysis of the results, including an examination of the most discriminative feature types and the most salient features contributing to the classification process.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks sufficient comparisons with existing work on writing style analysis and machine reading tasks, which would strengthen the paper's claims and provide a clearer understanding of its contributions.
2. The experiment method used in the paper is not clearly described, making it difficult to understand and replicate the results.
3. The concept of "primary-secondary" relationship is unclear and not well-defined, particularly in relation to nuclearity, which needs more precise explanation.
To address these weaknesses, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with existing work, clarify the experiment method, and provide a more precise definition of the "primary-secondary" relationship. Additionally, the authors could consider exploring the cognitive implications of their findings and providing more insights into the effects of writing tasks on mental states.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their study to other types of writing tasks and genres?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the experiment method and the data preprocessing steps?
3. How do the authors define the "primary-secondary" relationship, and how does it relate to nuclearity?
