This paper proposes a novel method for learning semantic hierarchies based on a discriminative generative fusion architecture combined with a simple lexical structure rule. The method achieves an F1-score of 74.20% on a manually labeled test dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a higher precision value of 91.60%. The fusion architecture can be easily expanded to other languages, making it a language-independent approach.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A uniform fusion architecture that can learn semantic hierarchies via word embeddings without any background knowledge.
2. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset, especially with a good enough precision value for application.
3. The fusion learning architecture is language-independent, making it easily expandable to other languages.
The strengths of this submission are:
1. The proposed method achieves a high F1-score and precision value, indicating its effectiveness in learning semantic hierarchies.
2. The fusion architecture is language-independent, making it a versatile approach that can be applied to multiple languages.
3. The method is complementary with manually-built hierarchies, allowing for more precise learning of semantic hierarchy construction.
The weaknesses of this submission are:
1. The evaluation part lacks details and is barely understandable, making it impossible to replicate the experiments.
2. The paper has several technical issues, including missing details on preprocessing, experiment setup, and results analysis.
3. The use of outdated templates and citation styles detracts from the overall quality of the paper.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the evaluation methodology and experiment setup to facilitate replication of the results?
2. How do you plan to address the technical issues and improve the overall quality of the paper?
3. Can you provide more insights into the language-independent nature of the fusion architecture and its potential applications to other languages?
