This paper proposes a novel approach to relation extraction by modeling it as a reading comprehension problem. The approach involves two main components: queryfication and applying a reading comprehension model. While the paper is well-written and clearly explains the approach, the novelty of the approach itself is questionable. 
The main contributions of this work are the compositional method for IsA extraction and the operationalization of a formal semantics framework. However, the paper lacks comparison with previous works on relation extraction, which raises suspicions about the effectiveness of the approach and its performance numbers. 
One of the strengths of this paper is its ability to handle fine-grained classes and its potential to improve the state-of-the-art in relation extraction. The use of a formal semantics framework to model the meaning of modifiers is also a notable contribution. 
However, there are several weaknesses in this paper. The slot-filling data preparation method used in the paper is unclear and requires clarification, particularly in terms of locating answer sentences for entity relations in Wikipedia articles. Additionally, the paper's evaluation is limited to a specific dataset and task, and it is unclear how the approach would perform on other datasets and tasks. 
To improve this paper, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with previous works on relation extraction and clarify the slot-filling data preparation method. They should also consider evaluating their approach on other datasets and tasks to demonstrate its generalizability. 
Some questions to the authors include: How does the proposed approach handle cases where the modifier is not explicitly mentioned in the text? How does the approach handle cases where the head and modifier have multiple possible interpretations? What are the limitations of the proposed approach, and how do they plan to address them in future work? 
Overall, while this paper presents an interesting approach to relation extraction, its effectiveness and novelty need to be further demonstrated through comparison with previous works and more comprehensive evaluation. 
The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 
1. A compositional method for IsA extraction that models the meaning of modifiers as functions.
2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to model the meaning of modifiers.
3. The potential to improve the state-of-the-art in relation extraction by handling fine-grained classes.
