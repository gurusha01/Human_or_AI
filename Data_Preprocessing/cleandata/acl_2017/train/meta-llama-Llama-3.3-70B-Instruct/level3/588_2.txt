This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic parsing, introducing the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM) that integrates a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer" with a symbolic non-differentiable computer. The NSM is designed to support abstract, scalable, and precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. The main contributions of this work are:
1. Introduction of the Manager-Programmer-Computer framework: This framework integrates neural networks with a symbolic non-differentiable computer, enabling the use of high-level programming languages for semantic parsing.
2. Development of the Neural Symbolic Machine: The NSM consists of a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer" with key-variable memory and a Lisp interpreter with code assistance, which provides a friendly neural computer interface.
3. Application of reinforcement learning with pseudo-gold programs: The authors use an iterative maximum likelihood training process to find pseudo-gold programs, which are then used to bootstrap reinforcement learning.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach to semantic parsing: The NSM offers a new perspective on semantic parsing, combining the strengths of neural networks and symbolic computing.
2. State-of-the-art results on WEBQUESTIONSSP: The NSM achieves new state-of-the-art results on the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset with weak supervision, significantly closing the gap between weak and full supervision.
3. End-to-end training without feature engineering: The NSM is trained end-to-end without requiring feature engineering or domain-specific knowledge.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. Complexity of the model: The NSM consists of multiple components, which can make it challenging to train and optimize.
2. Limited interpretability: The use of a non-differentiable computer and reinforcement learning can make it difficult to interpret the model's decisions.
3. Overfitting: The authors acknowledge that overfitting is a major problem for training the NSM, and more techniques are needed to control it.
To improve this work, the authors could consider:
1. Simplifying the model architecture: Exploring ways to simplify the NSM architecture while maintaining its performance.
2. Improving interpretability: Developing techniques to provide more insight into the model's decision-making process.
3. Addressing overfitting: Investigating additional techniques to control overfitting, such as regularization methods or data augmentation.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of semantic parsing, and its novel approach has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
