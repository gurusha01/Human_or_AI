This paper proposes a novel method for learning semantic hierarchies based on a discriminative generative fusion architecture combined with a simple lexical structure rule. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a manually labeled test dataset with an F1-score of 74.20% and a precision-value of 91.60%. The fusion architecture is language-independent and can be easily expanded to other languages.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A uniform fusion architecture that can learn semantic hierarchies via word embeddings without any background knowledge.
2. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset, especially with a high precision-value for application.
3. The fusion learning architecture is language-independent and can be easily expanded to other languages.
The strengths of this submission are:
1. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a manually labeled test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning semantic hierarchies.
2. The fusion architecture is language-independent, making it a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing.
3. The method is complementary with manually-built hierarchies, allowing for more precise learning of semantic hierarchy construction.
The weaknesses of this submission are:
1. The experimental comparison with previous work is not convincing, lacking phrase-level results and a thorough evaluation.
2. The paper lacks detailed explanations of certain aspects, such as the effect of negation or intensity words on the polarity of the context, and the use of bi-LSTM for regularizers.
3. The definition and optimization of the parameter s_c are not clearly explained, and its impact on the experiment results is unclear.
To improve this submission, I suggest adding results on phrase-level annotations, reporting statistics on the effect of negation or intensity words, and conducting additional experiments on a sub-dataset with phrases containing negation or intensity words. Additionally, clarifying the definition and optimization of the parameter s_c and its impact on the experiment results would strengthen the submission. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the definition and optimization of the parameter s_c and its impact on the experiment results?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of phrase-level results and thorough evaluation in the experimental comparison with previous work?
3. Can you provide more explanations on the effect of negation or intensity words on the polarity of the context and the use of bi-LSTM for regularizers?
