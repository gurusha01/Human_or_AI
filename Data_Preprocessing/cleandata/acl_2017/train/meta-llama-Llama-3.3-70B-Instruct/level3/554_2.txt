This paper explores several techniques for enhancing coverage in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parsing, with a focus on the English Resource Grammar (ERG). The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of several robust parsing techniques, including bridging, Pacman, and PCFG approximation, to improve the coverage of the ERG.
2. A detailed evaluation methodology for assessing the performance of these techniques, including the use of intrinsic evaluation metrics such as coverage and Elementary Dependency Matching (EDM) F1 score.
3. The creation of several datasets for evaluating the performance of these techniques, including the alchemy45, ws13r, semcor, and wsj00ab datasets.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The thorough evaluation of several robust parsing techniques, providing a comprehensive comparison of their performance.
2. The use of a range of datasets to assess the performance of these techniques, including datasets with varying levels of difficulty and complexity.
3. The proposal of a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of different techniques to achieve improved coverage and accuracy.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties of the proposed algorithms, which is a significant weakness.
2. The limited comparison of the proposed algorithm to other existing methods, which makes it difficult to assess its relative performance.
3. The absence of sufficient details on the impact of the proposed algorithm on training speed, which is an important consideration in many applications.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the proposed techniques handle out-of-vocabulary words and unknown linguistic constructions?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and deploy the proposed models?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of parse ranking model adaptation to novel situations, which is identified as a limitation of the current work?
