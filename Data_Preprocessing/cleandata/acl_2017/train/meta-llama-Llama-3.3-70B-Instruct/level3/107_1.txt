This paper presents a weakly supervised method for developing Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems, relying on projection from English into another language. However, the approach is not new and lacks novelty. The main contributions of the paper are the data selection scheme, which uses a straightforward formula to calculate quality scores, and the combination of outputs of two systems. 
The primary contribution of this work is the fusion learning architecture, which combines discriminative and generative models to learn semantic hierarchies. The architecture is language-independent and can be easily expanded to other languages. The use of a simple lexical structure rule to assist the fusion model is also a notable contribution. 
The strengths of this submission include the achievement of an F1-score of 74.20% on a manually labeled test dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and a high precision-value of 91.60%. The fusion learning architecture is also language-independent, making it a valuable contribution to the field. 
However, there are several weaknesses to this submission. The approach is not new and lacks novelty, which is a significant concern. The data selection scheme lacks clarity on threshold calculation, and the combination of outputs of two systems is unclear and lacks detail. The authors present multiple variants of each method, raising questions about combining more than two weakly supervised systems, which was not explored. Additionally, the paper lacks information about the types of texts in the "in-house" dataset, making it difficult to understand its composition and potential biases.
To improve this submission, the authors should provide more clarity on the threshold calculation for the data selection scheme and the combination of outputs of two systems. They should also explore combining more than two weakly supervised systems and provide more information about the "in-house" dataset. 
Some questions to the authors include: How do you plan to address the lack of novelty in your approach? Can you provide more details on the combination of outputs of two systems? How do you plan to explore combining more than two weakly supervised systems? Can you provide more information about the types of texts in the "in-house" dataset? 
Overall, this submission has some notable contributions, but it requires significant improvements to address the weaknesses and concerns mentioned above.
