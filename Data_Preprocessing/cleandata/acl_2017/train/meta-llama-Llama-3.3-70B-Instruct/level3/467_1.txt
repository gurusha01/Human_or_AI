This paper presents a novel approach to learning bilingual word embeddings using a self-learning framework that can work with minimal manual input. The method iteratively learns a mapping between two languages using a small seed dictionary, which is then used to induce a new dictionary. This process is repeated until convergence, resulting in high-quality bilingual embeddings.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Self-learning framework: The proposed method can learn bilingual word embeddings with minimal manual input, using a small seed dictionary or even an automatically generated list of numerals.
2. Competitive results: The method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art systems that use much richer bilingual resources, such as larger dictionaries or parallel corpora.
3. Analysis of the optimization objective: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization objective, showing that the self-learning framework is implicitly optimizing a meaningful objective function that is independent of any bilingual data.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The self-learning framework is a novel approach to learning bilingual word embeddings, which can work with minimal manual input.
2. Competitive results: The method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating its effectiveness.
3. Detailed analysis: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization objective, which provides insights into the method's behavior.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Lack of discussion on errors: The paper does not provide a detailed discussion on the method's errors and potential adjustments to address them.
2. Frequency of seed words: The frequency of seed words in monolingual corpora and its impact on the method's performance is not thoroughly explored.
3. Evolution of word mappings: The evolution of word mappings between languages over iterations and the handling of different translations and senses of the same word are not fully analyzed.
4. Handling compounds: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the method handles compounds in languages like German.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do you plan to address the issue of errors and potential adjustments to improve the method's performance?
2. Can you provide more insights into the frequency of seed words in monolingual corpora and its impact on the method's performance?
3. How do you plan to extend the method to handle non-linear transformations and alternative dictionary induction methods?
