This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is flexible and can accommodate various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their framework to three tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A general framework for cross-context lexical analysis that can be applied to various tasks and contexts.
2. The application of the framework to semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
3. The demonstration of the flexibility and effectiveness of the framework in handling different types of word annotations and similarity functions.
However, I have several concerns and weaknesses that I would like to highlight:
1. The paper relies heavily on the distributional hypothesis, which assumes that words with similar meanings will have similar vector representations. However, this hypothesis has been shown to have limitations, and the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support its applicability to the proposed framework.
2. The paper lacks a clear motivation for the proposed similarity measure, and its performance on the SemEval 2010 task is unsatisfactory, with a simple baseline performing similarly to the best-performing model.
3. The paper has methodological and experimental weaknesses, and the results seem to describe work in progress rather than a completed study.
4. The authors' response to my concerns does not provide sufficient evidence to address my weaknesses, and I remain unconvinced by the proposed framework.
In terms of strengths, I would argue that:
1. The paper proposes a novel and flexible framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which has the potential to be applied to various tasks and contexts.
2. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their framework to several tasks, including semantic change detection and comparative lexical analysis over context.
3. The paper highlights the importance of considering context in lexical analysis and provides a useful framework for doing so.
However, overall, I believe that the weaknesses of the paper outweigh its strengths, and I would not recommend its acceptance to the conference in its current form.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more evidence to support the applicability of the distributional hypothesis to the proposed framework?
2. Can you motivate the proposed similarity measure and provide more experimental results to demonstrate its effectiveness?
3. Can you address the methodological and experimental weaknesses of the paper and provide more convincing results to support the proposed framework?
