Summary of the Paper
The paper explores how different writing tasks can lead to measurable differences in writing style. The authors use the story cloze task as a case study, where annotators are assigned similar writing tasks with different constraints. They show that a simple linear classifier informed with stylistic features can distinguish among the three cases, without even looking at the story context. The authors also establish a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, substantially higher than previous results based on deep learning models.
Main Contributions
1. Novel approach to writing style analysis: The authors propose a new approach to analyzing writing style by focusing on the differences in writing tasks, rather than just author-specific styles.
2. State-of-the-art results on the story cloze task: The authors achieve a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze task, outperforming previous results based on deep learning models.
3. Insights into the design of NLP tasks: The authors provide valuable insights into the design of NLP tasks, highlighting the importance of considering the writing tasks used to generate the data.
Strengths
1. Simple yet effective approach: The authors' approach is simple yet effective, demonstrating that measurable differences in writing styles can be detected using stylistic features.
2. State-of-the-art results: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
3. Insights into cognitive implications: The authors' findings have cognitive implications, motivating further research on the effects of writing prompts on an author's mental state and response.
Weaknesses
1. Limited scope: The authors' approach is limited to the story cloze task, and it is unclear whether their findings generalize to other NLP tasks.
2. Technical issues: The authors' use of a linear classifier may not be the most effective approach, and more advanced models may be needed to fully capture the complexities of writing style.
3. Lack of detailed analysis: The authors' analysis of the most salient features is limited, and more detailed analysis is needed to fully understand the differences in writing styles.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other NLP tasks, and what challenges do they anticipate?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the most salient features, and how do these features relate to the writing tasks used to generate the data?
3. How do the authors plan to address the technical issues with their approach, and what alternative models or methods may be more effective?
