This paper proposes a novel approach to word representation learning (WRL) by incorporating sememe information from the HowNet knowledge base. The authors introduce a Sememe-Encoded Word Representation Learning (SE-WRL) model, which utilizes sememes to represent various senses of each word and proposes a Sememe Attention mechanism to automatically select appropriate senses in contexts.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a novel SE-WRL model that incorporates sememe information for WRL.
2. The introduction of a Sememe Attention mechanism to select appropriate senses in contexts.
3. The evaluation of the SE-WRL model on word similarity and word analogy tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The innovative use of sememe information to improve WRL, which has the potential to capture more nuanced semantic relationships between words.
2. The proposed Sememe Attention mechanism, which allows for flexible and context-dependent sense selection.
3. The thorough evaluation of the SE-WRL model on various tasks, including word similarity and word analogy, which demonstrates its effectiveness.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The reliance on the HowNet knowledge base, which may not be available for all languages or domains.
2. The potential complexity of the Sememe Attention mechanism, which may require significant computational resources.
3. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art WRL models that incorporate sense information.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of relying on the HowNet knowledge base, and can the SE-WRL model be adapted to work with other knowledge bases or sense inventories?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the SE-WRL model, and how it compares to other WRL models?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the SE-WRL model to work with other languages, and what challenges do they anticipate in adapting the model to new languages or domains?
