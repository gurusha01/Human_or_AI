This paper proposes a novel approach to word representation using Gaussian mixture models, which can capture multiple distinct meanings of words and uncertainty information. The authors introduce a maximum margin energy-based objective to learn the parameters of the mixture model and demonstrate its effectiveness on various word similarity and entailment tasks.
