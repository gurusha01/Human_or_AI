This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various tasks, including semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through several experiments, including the analysis of semantic change, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A general framework for cross-context lexical analysis that can accommodate any notion of context, any similarity function, and any type of word annotation.
2. The application of the framework to several tasks, including semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation.
3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through several experiments, including the analysis of semantic change, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed framework is flexible and can be applied to various tasks, making it a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. The authors provide a clear and well-written introduction to the topic, making it easy to understand the motivation and context of the work.
3. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and provide interesting insights into the analysis of word meanings and representations across different contexts.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The paper requires close reading and formal background, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
2. The authors assume deep knowledge of the grammar and input, which may limit the applicability of the approach to certain domains or tasks.
3. The paper does not recognize the exponential number of graphs that can arise from an input string in NLP, which may affect the scalability of the approach.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of scalability, given the exponential number of graphs that can arise from an input string in NLP?
2. Can the authors provide more details on how the framework can be applied to other tasks, such as sentiment analysis or text classification?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in comparison to other methods, such as topic models or word embeddings?
