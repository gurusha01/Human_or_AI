This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic graph parsing based on a well-designed transition system, enabling effective semantic representation learning. The work introduces a new scheme for computational semantics, leveraging an end-to-end transition-based incremental framework to resolve parsing with low cost. The main contributions of this paper are: 
1. A compositional method for IsA extraction, which involves a novel application of noun-phrase paraphrasing methods to the task of semantic taxonomy induction.
2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP: assigning intrinsic "meaning" to a phrase, and reasoning about that phrase in a truth-theoretic context.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed method can handle fine-grained classes and does not require the entire class label to be observed verbatim in text, making it more flexible and effective.
2. The approach can combine evidence from multiple sentences and perform IsA extraction without requiring any example instances of a given class.
3. The paper provides a detailed evaluation of the proposed method, including a comparison with baseline methods and an analysis of the results.
However, there are some weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed introduction to key concepts like DMRS and EP, which may confuse readers without relevant background knowledge.
2. The description of the transition system is insufficient, making it difficult for non-experts to understand and learn from the research.
Overall, this paper is considered interesting and has the potential to make semantic parsing a hot topic, especially if open-source codes and datasets are made available. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details about the transition system and how it is used in the proposed method?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of background knowledge for readers without experience in DMRS and EP?
3. Are there any plans to release the codes and datasets used in the paper to facilitate further research and replication?
