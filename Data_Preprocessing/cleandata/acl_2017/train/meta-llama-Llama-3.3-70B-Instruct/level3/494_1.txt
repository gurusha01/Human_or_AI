This paper proposes a novel method called "morph-fitting" that incorporates morphological constraints into word vector spaces to improve their quality. The method uses simple language-specific rules to extract linguistic constraints, which are then used to fine-tune pre-trained word vectors. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of morph-fitting in improving word similarity tasks and downstream language understanding tasks, such as dialogue state tracking, across four languages.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. Introduction of morph-fitting: The paper introduces a new method for incorporating morphological knowledge into word vector spaces, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Improvement in word similarity tasks: The paper shows that morph-fitting improves the performance of word vectors in word similarity tasks, such as SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500, across four languages.
3. Improvement in downstream tasks: The paper demonstrates that morph-fitting improves the performance of downstream language understanding tasks, such as dialogue state tracking, especially for morphologically rich languages like German.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Clear and nice application of linguistics ideas: The paper applies linguistics ideas to distributional semantics in a clear and nice way, demonstrating improvements on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.
2. Consistent improvements: The paper shows consistent improvements in word similarity tasks and downstream tasks across four languages.
3. Robustness: The paper demonstrates that morph-fitting is robust and can be applied to different languages and tasks.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Lack of additional baselines: The paper lacks additional baselines, such as character embeddings, for comparison.
2. Questionable creation of Morph-SimLex: The creation of the Morph-SimLex evaluation set is questionable, and it would be beneficial to have more information about its construction.
3. Limited analysis of the geometry of the resulting vector space: The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the geometry of the resulting vector space to ensure that it is meaningful.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, and its results are convincing. However, there are some areas that could be improved, such as the addition of more baselines and a more detailed analysis of the resulting vector space. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more information about the creation of the Morph-SimLex evaluation set?
2. How do you plan to extend the framework to other morphologically rich languages and downstream tasks?
3. Can you provide more details about the post-processing algorithm and constraints selection?
