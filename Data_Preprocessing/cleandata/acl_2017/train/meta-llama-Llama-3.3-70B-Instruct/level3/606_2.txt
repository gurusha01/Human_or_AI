This paper proposes a novel approach to zero pronoun resolution by automatically generating large-scale pseudo training data and utilizing an attention-based neural network model. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of a simple but effective method to generate large-scale pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution, which can be used to pre-train a neural network model.
2. The introduction of a two-step training approach, which combines the pre-trained model with task-specific data to fine-tune the model and achieve better performance.
3. The development of an attention-based neural network model that can effectively resolve zero pronouns.
The strengths of this paper include: 
1. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, outperforming existing systems by a significant margin.
2. The use of pseudo training data and two-step training approach allows the model to learn from a large amount of data and adapt to the specific task, which is effective in improving performance.
3. The attention-based neural network model is well-suited for zero pronoun resolution, as it can effectively capture the context and semantic information of the sentence.
However, there are also some weaknesses: 
1. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the compositionality of the proposed model, which is an important aspect of zero pronoun resolution.
2. The choice of dataset is questionable, as the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset may not be the most suitable for evaluating zero pronoun resolution systems.
3. The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other existing systems, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Some questions to the authors include: 
1. How does the proposed approach handle cases where the antecedent of the zero pronoun is far away from the pronoun?
2. Can the proposed approach be applied to other languages, such as English or Japanese?
3. How does the proposed approach compare to other existing systems in terms of computational efficiency and scalability? 
Overall, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach to zero pronoun resolution, and the experimental results demonstrate its potential. However, further analysis and comparison with other existing systems are needed to fully evaluate its effectiveness.
