This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing writing style by examining the impact of different writing tasks on an author's style. The authors use the story cloze task as a case study, where they compare the writing styles of authors who write original stories, coherent endings, and incoherent endings. The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The authors demonstrate that different writing tasks can lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be detected using simple linear classifiers.
2. They show that the style differences between original stories, coherent endings, and incoherent endings can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task.
3. The authors highlight the importance of considering the writing task when designing NLP datasets, as different tasks can introduce biases and affect the writing style of authors.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of analyzing writing style and its importance in NLP.
2. The experimental design is well-executed, and the results are convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, highlighting the most discriminative feature types and the most salient features that contribute to the classification process.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. The writing style of the paper is sometimes poor and difficult to follow, requiring proofreading by a native English speaker.
2. The logic of the paper is unclear at times, with undefined terms such as "logical semantics" and "pragmatic function", and conflicting definitions of macro and micro discourse structure.
3. The corpus construction is not informative enough, lacking detailed examples and clarity on concepts such as "discourse topic" and "paragraph topics".
4. The agreement study is incomplete, only measuring agreement on leaf nodes and not providing a clear understanding of the overall quality of the corpus.
5. The experiments are unconvincing, lacking strong baselines, clear feature descriptions, and motivation, and only choosing a subset of discourse relations for recognition.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the corpus construction process and the criteria used to select the stories and endings?
2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the current study, such as the lack of strong baselines and the limited scope of the experiments?
3. Can you provide more insight into the cognitive implications of the findings and how they relate to the author's mental state and writing process?
