Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces a novel approach to multi-document summarization, where the goal is to generate a concept map that represents the most important content of a set of documents. The authors propose a new crowdsourcing scheme, called low-context importance annotation, to create a gold-standard corpus for this task. The corpus consists of 30 topics, each with around 40 documents and a summarizing concept map. The authors also provide a baseline system and evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Summarization Task: The authors propose a new summarization task, concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which aims to generate a concept map that represents the most important content of a set of documents.
2. Low-Context Importance Annotation: The authors introduce a novel crowdsourcing scheme to determine the importance of propositions in a document cluster, which is used to create the gold-standard corpus.
3. Gold-Standard Corpus: The authors create a new corpus for concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which consists of 30 topics, each with around 40 documents and a summarizing concept map.
4. Baseline System and Evaluation Protocol: The authors provide a baseline system and evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization.
Strengths
1. Novel Approach: The paper introduces a novel approach to multi-document summarization, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in this field.
2. Large-Scale Corpus: The authors create a large-scale corpus for concept-map-based multi-document summarization, which can be used to train and evaluate systems for this task.
3. Extensive Evaluation: The authors provide an extensive evaluation of their approach, including a baseline system and evaluation protocol, which can be used to compare the performance of different systems.
4. Potential Applications: The concept-map-based approach to multi-document summarization has potential applications in various fields, such as education, research, and decision-making.
Weaknesses
1. Complexity of the Task: The concept-map-based multi-document summarization task is complex and requires a deep understanding of the documents and their relationships.
2. Quality of the Corpus: The quality of the corpus depends on the quality of the crowdsourcing scheme and the expertise of the annotators.
3. Limited Evaluation: The evaluation of the approach is limited to a specific dataset and may not generalize to other datasets or domains.
4. Computational Resources: The approach requires significant computational resources to process the large-scale corpus and generate the concept maps.
