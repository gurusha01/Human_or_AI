This paper proposes a novel summarization task, concept-map-based multi-document summarization (MDS), which aims to create a concept map that represents the most important content of a set of related documents. The authors introduce a new crowdsourcing scheme, low-context importance annotation, to determine the importance of propositions in a document cluster. They use this scheme to create a large-scale corpus of concept maps, which is made publicly available along with a baseline system and evaluation protocol.
The main contributions of this paper are: 
1. The proposal of a novel summarization task, concept-map-based MDS, which has the potential to provide a more structured and interpretable summary than traditional text-based summarization.
2. The development of a new crowdsourcing scheme, low-context importance annotation, which allows for efficient and reliable annotation of proposition importance.
3. The creation of a large-scale corpus of concept maps, which provides a benchmark for evaluating concept-map-based MDS systems.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The novelty of the proposed task and the crowdsourcing scheme, which addresses the challenges of traditional summarization tasks.
2. The large-scale corpus creation, which provides a valuable resource for the research community.
3. The provision of a baseline system and evaluation protocol, which facilitates the comparison of different approaches.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. The lack of evaluation on other monotonic seq2seq tasks, which limits the generalizability of the proposed approach.
2. The unclear implementation of the crowdsourcing scheme, which may raise questions about the reliability of the annotations.
3. The limited analysis of the linguistic features used in the model, which may not provide a complete understanding of the proposed approach.
Some questions to the authors include:
1. How do the authors plan to address the challenges of content selection and relation extraction in the concept-map-based MDS task?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the low-context importance annotation scheme and the reliability of the annotations?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of the concept-map-based MDS systems, and what metrics will be used to compare different approaches?
