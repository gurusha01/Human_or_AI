This paper proposes a novel multigraph-based model for recognizing overlapping entities in text, which is a challenging problem in natural language processing. The model is based on the insight that common knowledge influences language and uses a factor graph with action and object graphs to extract physical knowledge from unstructured text.
The paper's strengths include its interesting and challenging problem, innovative model, clear description, and effective empirical evidence. The model handles text sparsity with semantic similarity factors and is well-supported by empirical evidence compared to other baselines. The paper is well-written with informative visualization, making it easy to understand the proposed model and its components.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. One of the main weaknesses is the under-discussion of model components, which makes it difficult to fully understand the model's architecture and its limitations. Additionally, the paper lacks qualitative analysis and evidence on task difficulty, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. The paper also lacks analysis on the discrepancy between different similarity measures, which could provide valuable insights into the model's behavior.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper's contributions are significant. The proposed multigraph-based model is a novel approach to recognizing overlapping entities, and its performance is impressive compared to other baselines. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses, which is essential for understanding its limitations and potential applications.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more qualitative analysis and evidence on task difficulty, as well as analysis on the discrepancy between different similarity measures. Additionally, the authors could discuss the model's components in more detail, providing a clearer understanding of its architecture and limitations. With some re-organization and addition of background and experimental analysis, the paper can be improved to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed model and its contributions.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and its contributions are significant. With some revisions to address the weaknesses, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field of natural language processing.
