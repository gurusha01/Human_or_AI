This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors address a challenging problem in political discourse reporting with a relatively high degree of success, making it a potentially interesting topic for the ACL community.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The introduction of a framework to automatically extract cognitive features from eye-movement data, which can be used in conjunction with textual features for sentiment and sarcasm detection.
2. The proposal of a CNN architecture that can learn features from both gaze and text inputs, and merge them to improve classification performance.
3. The evaluation of the proposed framework on two publicly available datasets, which shows significant performance improvements over existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features, as well as CNN-based systems that rely on text input alone.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The innovative use of eye-movement data to improve sentiment and sarcasm detection, which has the potential to capture subtle linguistic cues that may not be apparent from text alone.
2. The thorough evaluation of the proposed framework on multiple datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.
3. The clear and well-organized presentation of the paper, which makes it easy to follow and understand the proposed approach.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. The lack of quantitative baselines for comparison, which makes it unclear how necessary the proposed model is, and how it compares to traditional baseline classification algorithms.
2. The qualitative investigation is interesting, but the visualizations are difficult to understand and add little to the discussion, suggesting alternative visualization approaches.
3. The submission is well-written, but lacks proper quantitative baselines and has several areas that need clarification, such as citations, related work, and methodology details.
Some minor comments and suggestions for improvement include:
1. Providing more context for the results, such as the importance of temporal similarity assumptions, and how they impact the performance of the proposed framework.
2. Clarifying the assumptions made about the eye-movement data, such as the relationship between gaze patterns and cognitive processes, and how these assumptions impact the proposed approach.
3. Considering alternative visualization approaches to better illustrate the learned features and their relationship to sentiment and sarcasm detection.
Overall, this paper presents a novel and interesting approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection, and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of NLP. However, there are some areas that need improvement, and the authors should address these weaknesses to strengthen their submission. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on how the eye-movement data was collected and preprocessed, and how it was used to train the CNN model?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting, which was observed in the experiments on dataset 2?
3. Can you provide more insights on the learned features and how they relate to sentiment and sarcasm detection, and how they can be used to improve the performance of the proposed framework?
