This research paper proposes a novel framework for neural program induction, called the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM), which integrates a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer" with a symbolic non-differentiable computer. The NSM is designed to support abstract, scalable, and precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. The paper claims three main contributions: (1) the introduction of a key-variable memory to support language compositionality, (2) the use of a Lisp interpreter as the "computer" to provide code assistance and prune the search space, and (3) the development of an augmented REINFORCE training procedure that combines iterative maximum likelihood training with REINFORCE to optimize the task reward.
The main strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art models on the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset with weak supervision, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning semantic parsers from question-answer pairs.
2. The use of a symbolic non-differentiable computer allows for efficient discrete operations and precise control over the search space, making it suitable for large knowledge bases.
3. The augmented REINFORCE training procedure is able to bootstrap the model using pseudo-gold programs found by iterative maximum likelihood training, leading to improved performance and stability.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. The comparison with other models is limited, and it is unclear how the NSM would perform in other semantic parsing tasks or datasets.
2. The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the errors and limitations of the model, as well as more extensive experiments to evaluate its robustness and generalizability.
3. The use of a Lisp interpreter as the "computer" may limit the applicability of the framework to other domains or tasks that require different types of operations or reasoning.
Some questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the NSM framework to other domains or tasks, such as natural language generation or dialogue systems?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the Lisp interpreter and the key-variable memory, and how they are integrated with the sequence-to-sequence model?
3. How do the authors evaluate the trade-off between the precision of the symbolic computer and the scalability of the neural network, and what are the implications for the design of the NSM framework?
