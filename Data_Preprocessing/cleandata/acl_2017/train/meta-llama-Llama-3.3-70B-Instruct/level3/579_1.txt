This paper proposes a novel approach to keyphrase prediction in scientific publications using a generative model based on the encoder-decoder framework. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of an RNN-based generative model for keyphrase prediction, which incorporates a copy mechanism to handle out-of-vocabulary words.
2. The application of the encoder-decoder model to keyphrase prediction, which allows the model to capture the deep semantic meaning of the text.
3. The evaluation of the proposed model on six benchmark datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness in generating both present and absent keyphrases.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, which makes it easy to follow and understand.
2. The comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model, which includes a comparison with six baseline models and an analysis of the results on different datasets.
3. The novelty of the proposed approach, which combines the strengths of the encoder-decoder model and the copy mechanism to handle keyphrase prediction.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The limitation of the proposed model to scientific publications, which may not be generalizable to other domains or types of text.
2. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art models, which may have achieved better results on the same datasets.
3. The need for further evaluation and analysis of the proposed model, including its performance on different types of text and its ability to generalize to new datasets.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to extend the proposed model to other domains or types of text, and what modifications would be necessary to achieve this?
2. Can you provide more details on the training process and the hyperparameters used to optimize the proposed model?
3. How do you plan to evaluate the quality of the predicted keyphrases, and what metrics would you use to measure their accuracy and relevance?
