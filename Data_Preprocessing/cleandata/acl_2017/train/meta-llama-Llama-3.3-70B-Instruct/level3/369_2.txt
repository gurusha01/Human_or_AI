This paper proposes a novel method for improving two-step translation using deep learning, specifically for Chinese->Spanish translation. The approach seems to be largely language-independent. The main novelty of the work is the use of deep neural networks as classifiers in the second step of the translation process, which achieves high accuracy and improves final translation quality.
The strengths of this paper include the proposal of a fusion learning architecture that combines discriminative and generative models to learn semantic hierarchies. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset, with an F1-score of 74.20% and a precision-value of 91.60%. The method is also language-independent, making it easily expandable to other languages.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The lack of comparison with straightforward deep-learning baselines, such as bidirectional LSTM networks, is a significant limitation. The final re-scoring step is not clearly explained, and more information is needed on how it is implemented, including what features are used and whether n-best sentences are re-scored. Additionally, the impact of larger word embeddings on the final results is unclear, and clarification is needed on this point.
The paper also raises some questions, such as why adding information from the source sentence hurts the translation quality. A more thorough discussion on this point, with convincing examples, is necessary. Furthermore, the paper contains numerous typos and grammatical errors, which may not be sufficient for presentation at a conference like ACL.
In terms of contributions, the paper proposes a uniform fusion architecture that can learn semantic hierarchies via word embeddings without any background knowledge. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset, especially with a good enough precision-value for application. The fusion learning architecture is language-independent, making it easily expandable to other languages.
Overall, while the paper has some strengths, it also has significant weaknesses and raises important questions that need to be addressed. With further clarification and improvement, the method proposed in this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine translation. 
Some minor corrections are needed, such as correcting typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper. Additionally, the authors should consider adding more examples to illustrate the effectiveness of their method and providing more details on the implementation of the final re-scoring step. 
To improve the paper, the authors should consider comparing their method with other state-of-the-art methods, such as bidirectional LSTM networks, and providing more details on the impact of larger word embeddings on the final results. They should also address the question of why adding information from the source sentence hurts the translation quality and provide convincing examples to support their claims. 
In conclusion, while the paper has some strengths, it requires significant improvements to address the weaknesses and questions raised. With further clarification and improvement, the method proposed in this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine translation.
