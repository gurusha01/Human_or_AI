Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to creating a language interface for performing complex actions, such as analyzing data, manipulating text, and querying databases. The approach, called "naturalization," involves seeding a system with a core programming language and allowing users to incrementally define alternative syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. The system, called Voxelurn, is a command interface for a voxel world that allows users to build complex structures using a combination of natural language and programming language.
Main Contributions
1. Naturalization Process: The paper introduces a new interactive language learning process that allows users to naturalize a core programming language, making it more accessible and usable.
2. Voxelurn System: The paper presents a system that implements the naturalization process, allowing users to build complex structures in a voxel world using a combination of natural language and programming language.
3. Grammar Induction Algorithm: The paper proposes a grammar induction algorithm that can learn new grammar rules from user definitions, enabling the system to understand and generate more complex language constructs.
Strengths
1. Innovative Approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to creating a language interface that combines the strengths of natural language and programming language.
2. Effective Naturalization Process: The experimental results show that the naturalization process is effective in allowing users to build complex structures and define new language constructs.
3. Scalability: The system can handle a large number of users and definitions, making it a scalable solution for creating a language interface.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Complexity: The paper notes that the maximally achievable complexity of the system is limited, which may restrict its applicability to more complex tasks.
2. Over/Underfitting Issues: The experimental results show that the system suffers from basic over/underfitting issues, which could be addressed by adjusting network capacity or using more data.
3. Lack of Qualitative Complexity: The paper notes that the system lacks qualitative complexity, only allowing for quantitative increases in difficulty through unnatural means.
Questions to Authors
