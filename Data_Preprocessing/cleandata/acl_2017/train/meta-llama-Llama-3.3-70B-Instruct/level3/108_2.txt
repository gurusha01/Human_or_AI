This paper proposes a novel approach to improve word vector representations by incorporating morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints. The method, called morph-fitting, uses simple language-specific rules to extract inflectional and derivational morphology rules, which are then used to fine-tune pre-trained word vectors. The approach is evaluated on four languages (English, German, Italian, and Russian) and shows consistent improvements in intrinsic word similarity tasks and a downstream dialogue state tracking task.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Morph-fitting method: The paper introduces a new method for incorporating morphological knowledge into word vector representations, which is language-agnostic and does not require curated knowledge bases.
2. Improved word similarity performance: The morph-fitting method shows consistent improvements in word similarity tasks across four languages, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing semantic relationships between words.
3. Downstream task performance: The use of morph-fitted vectors boosts the performance of a downstream dialogue state tracking task, especially for morphologically rich languages such as German.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The morph-fitting method is a new and innovative approach to improving word vector representations, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of languages and tasks.
2. Consistent improvements: The method shows consistent improvements in word similarity tasks across four languages, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.
3. Downstream task performance: The use of morph-fitted vectors improves the performance of a downstream task, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation: The paper only evaluates the morph-fitting method on four languages and a single downstream task, which may not be representative of its performance on other languages and tasks.
2. Simple rules: The language-specific rules used to extract morphology rules may not be comprehensive or accurate, which may limit the effectiveness of the method.
3. Lack of comparison: The paper does not compare the morph-fitting method to other approaches that incorporate morphological knowledge into word vector representations, which makes it difficult to assess its relative performance.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the morph-fitting method to other languages and tasks?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the language-specific rules used to extract morphology rules and how they were developed?
3. How does the morph-fitting method compare to other approaches that incorporate morphological knowledge into word vector representations?
