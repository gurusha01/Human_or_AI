This paper proposes a novel approach to computational argumentation mining (AM) using neural techniques for end-to-end learning. The authors frame AM as a dependency parsing problem, a sequence tagging problem, and a multi-task learning problem, and evaluate the performance of these approaches on a dataset of persuasive essays. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the proposal of neural end-to-end solutions to AM, (2) the demonstration that these solutions perform better than a state-of-the-art joint ILP model, and (3) the finding that a standard neural sequence tagging model performs robustly in different environments.
The strengths of this paper are: 
1. The authors propose a novel approach to AM using neural techniques, which eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and costly ILP constraint designing.
2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approaches on a dataset of persuasive essays, and the results show that the neural approaches outperform the state-of-the-art ILP model.
3. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including an examination of the performance of different models on component detection and relation identification.
The weaknesses of this paper are: 
1. The paper lacks a related work section, making it difficult to compare the proposed approach with previous work in the field.
2. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of the features used in the neural models, which makes it difficult to understand the results.
3. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the performance of the different models on different types of texts, such as short documents versus long documents.
Questions to authors: 
1. Can you provide more details on the features used in the neural models, and how they were selected?
2. How do the authors plan to address the issue of long-range dependencies in the neural models, which was identified as a limitation of the current approach?
3. Can you provide more details on the evaluation metric used to compare the performance of the different models, and how it was selected?
