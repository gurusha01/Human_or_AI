This paper presents a systematic investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of various word embedding models, including Continuous Skip-Gram (CSG), Continuous Bag-Of-Words (CBOW), and GloVe, with different context types (linear and dependency-based) and context representations (unbound and bound).
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A comprehensive evaluation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings, which provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
2. The introduction of a new context representation, bound representation, which associates each contextual word with its relative position or dependency relation to the target word.
3. The development of a generalized framework for learning word embeddings, which allows for the incorporation of different context types and representations.
The strengths of this paper lie in its thorough evaluation of different context types and representations, as well as its introduction of a new context representation that can capture more nuanced semantic relationships between words. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the importance of context representations in learning word embeddings.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. One major limitation is the lack of application to real-world sentiment analysis scenarios, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experiments and comparisons with other methods to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Some potential questions to ask the authors include:
* How do the results of this study generalize to other languages and domains?
* Can the proposed approach be applied to other NLP tasks, such as question answering or machine translation?
* How does the choice of context representation affect the interpretability of the learned word embeddings?
Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of word embeddings and highlights the importance of considering different context types and representations in learning word embeddings. With some additional experiments and applications to real-world scenarios, this work has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of NLP. 
The paper's approach to finding word polarity orientation in an unsupervised manner using word embeddings is a strength, but the lack of thorough justification of the ideas presented and the limited application to test cases are significant weaknesses. The paper would benefit from more experiments, comparisons with other methods, and application to real sentiment analysis scenarios to further develop the promising work presented. 
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper provides a clear summary of the main contributions, but could benefit from a more detailed description of the methodology and experiments. The paper also meets the guidelines for strengths and weaknesses, providing a clear and detailed analysis of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. 
Some additional comments include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work, including a comparison with other approaches to learning word embeddings.
* The use of tables and figures to present the results is clear and effective, but could be improved with more detailed captions and labels.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the implications of the results, including a discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.
