This paper proposes a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which leverages both orthographic and semantic information to segment words into morphemes. The framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which compensates for the deficiencies in existing benchmarking datasets.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A novel framework for morpheme segmentation that combines orthographic and semantic information.
2. The introduction of a new dataset, SD17, which addresses the weaknesses in existing benchmarking datasets.
3. State-of-the-art results on morpheme segmentation tasks, outperforming existing approaches.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed framework is a natural extension of existing work on learning word embeddings, and its use of semantic information is a significant improvement over existing approaches.
2. The introduction of the SD17 dataset is a valuable contribution, as it provides a more accurate and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating morpheme segmentation systems.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The evaluation results are not entirely convincing, with inconsistent trends and statistically insignificant improvements in some cases.
2. The paper requires major editing due to significant grammar and spelling errors, making it difficult to read.
3. The work leaves open questions, including the significant difference between overlap and non-overlap cases, which needs further exploration and explanation.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of MORSE, including minimal supervision, greedy inference, and concatenative orthographic model?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage, and how it will be made more efficient for wider adoption by the community?
3. How do the authors plan to further explore and explain the significant difference between overlap and non-overlap cases in the SD17 dataset?
