This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is language-independent and can be applied to various tasks, including semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A general framework for cross-context lexical analysis that can accommodate any notion of context, similarity function, and word annotation.
2. The application of the framework to three distinct tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation.
3. The demonstration of the framework's flexibility and effectiveness in various experiments, including the analysis of semantic change, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposal of a general framework that can be applied to various tasks, making it a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. The demonstration of the framework's effectiveness in various experiments, which shows its potential for real-world applications.
3. The use of a language-independent approach, which makes the framework applicable to multiple languages.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
1. The task proposed in the paper seems idiosyncratic and presupposes existing methods for hypernym detection.
2. The paper lacks clarity in its explanations, including the description of Figure 4 and the use of thresholds in Section 4.2.
3. Some sections of the paper, such as "Combined with Manually-Built Hierarchies" and Section 4.4, are puzzling and difficult to understand.
4. The paper has redundancy in its content, including related work in multiple sections and uninformative figures.
5. The paper's marginal improvement over existing work and wastage of space are also notable weaknesses.
Overall, this paper proposes a valuable framework for cross-context lexical analysis, but its presentation and clarity could be improved. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above to make the paper more convincing and easier to understand.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more clarification on the task proposed in the paper and how it relates to existing methods for hypernym detection?
2. Can you provide more details on the use of thresholds in Section 4.2 and how they were determined?
3. Can you explain the purpose of the "Combined with Manually-Built Hierarchies" section and how it relates to the rest of the paper?
4. Can you provide more information on how the framework can be applied to other languages and how its language-independence was evaluated?
5. Can you discuss the potential applications of the framework in real-world scenarios and how it can be used to improve existing natural language processing systems?
