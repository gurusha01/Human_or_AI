This paper proposes a novel approach to interactive topic modeling by introducing a probabilistic framework for querying a database given the agent's beliefs over its fields. The authors claim that this framework, called Soft-KB lookup, allows the downstream reinforcement learner to discover better dialogue policies by providing it more information. The paper presents an end-to-end (E2E) agent for the task, which demonstrates a strong learning capacity in simulations but suffers from overfitting when tested on real users.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. Novel Probabilistic Framework: The authors propose a probabilistic framework for querying a database given the agent's beliefs over its fields, which allows for a differentiable and end-to-end trainable dialogue agent.
2. End-to-End Agent: The paper presents an E2E agent for the task, which demonstrates a strong learning capacity in simulations but suffers from overfitting when tested on real users.
3. Exhaustive Evaluation: The authors conduct an exhaustive evaluation of their approach using simulated and real users, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Well-organized and Strong Paper: The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and its evaluation.
2. Novel and Practical Contribution: The authors make a novel and practical contribution to interactive topic modeling, which has the potential to improve the performance of dialogue agents.
3. Exhaustive Evaluation: The authors conduct an exhaustive evaluation of their approach, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited Scope: The paper is limited in scope, as it only compares the proposed approach with a few baseline methods and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.
2. Lack of Empirical Support: The paper lacks empirical support for its claims, as the evaluation is limited to a single dataset and a few metrics.
3. Overfitting: The E2E agent suffers from overfitting when tested on real users, which may limit its practical applicability.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the overfitting issue in the E2E agent?
2. Can the authors provide a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches in interactive topic modeling?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex and realistic scenarios, such as multi-domain dialogue systems?
