This paper presents a neural network architecture for natural language inference (NLI) that achieves state-of-the-art results on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) benchmark. The architecture consists of a three-step process: input encoding, local inference modeling, and inference composition. The authors propose two variants of the model, one based on TreeRNNs and the other on sequential BiLSTMs, with the sequential model outperforming published results.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a new neural network architecture for NLI that achieves state-of-the-art results on the SNLI benchmark.
2. The demonstration that carefully designing sequential inference models based on chain LSTMs can outperform more complicated network architectures.
3. The exploration of the effectiveness of syntax for NLI, showing that incorporating syntactic parsing information can further improve the performance of the model.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The paper is clear, well-motivated, and has impressive results, making it a solidly incremental work that is recommended for acceptance.
2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the major components that contribute to the good performance of the model, including the importance of the layer performing the enhancement for local inference information and the pooling layer in inference composition.
3. The paper provides a detailed comparison with previous work, including a significance test to show that the difference between the proposed model and previous models is statistically significant.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The claim that the system can serve as a new baseline for future work on NLI is not especially helpful or meaningful, as this could be said about any model.
2. The model architecture is symmetric in some ways that seem unnecessary, such as computing attention across sentences in both directions, which may nearly double the run time.
3. The results for the tree-based model on its own are not presented, which is a notable omission.
4. The use of the vector difference feature gives the model redundant parameters and may not be necessary, although it may have learning-related benefits.
5. The implementation of the tree-structured components of the model and potential issues with speed or scalability are not clearly explained.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the tree-structured components of the model and how you addressed potential issues with speed or scalability?
2. How do you plan to explore the usefulness of knowledge resources to help alleviate data sparseness issues in future work?
3. Can you provide more insights into the fragments of sentences or parses highlighted by the attention mechanism and how they can be used to provide human-readable explanations of the decisions?
