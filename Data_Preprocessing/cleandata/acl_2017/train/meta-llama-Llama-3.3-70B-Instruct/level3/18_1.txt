This paper proposes a novel approach to computational argumentation mining (AM) using neural techniques, specifically framing AM as a dependency parsing problem, a sequence tagging problem, and a multi-task learning problem. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms a state-of-the-art feature-based ILP model, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and costly ILP constraint designing.
The primary contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of the first neural end-to-end solutions to computational AM, 
2. The demonstration that several of these solutions perform better than the state-of-the-art joint ILP model, 
3. The finding that a framing of AM as a token-based dependency parsing problem is ineffective.
The strengths of this submission are: 
1. The novelty of the approach, which combines different neural techniques to tackle the complex task of AM, 
2. The thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on a benchmark dataset, 
3. The comparison with a state-of-the-art feature-based ILP model, which provides a strong baseline for evaluation.
The weaknesses of this submission are: 
1. The lack of clarity in some notation, such as Equation 12, which may cause confusion for readers, 
2. The unclear motivation for not exploring the initialization of word embeddings with existing vectors, 
3. The potential error in the reported improvement on validation, which may affect the reliability of the results.
Questions to the authors include: 
1. Can you provide more insights into why the weight for local LM is relatively higher for the CN task despite the benefit of adding it being less? 
2. Can you clarify the phrase "letting the model explicitly learn weights between individual attentions"? 
3. Have you considered releasing the software as part of the submission to facilitate reproducibility and further research? 
Overall, this submission presents a significant contribution to the field of computational argumentation mining, and with some clarifications and revisions, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
