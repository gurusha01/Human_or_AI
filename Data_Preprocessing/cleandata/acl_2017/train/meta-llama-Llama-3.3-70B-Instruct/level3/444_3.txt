This research paper proposes a novel approach to word embeddings, representing each word as a Gaussian mixture model. The authors introduce an energy-based max-margin objective to learn the parameters of the mixture model, which captures multiple distinct meanings of words and uncertainty. The paper presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on various word similarity and entailment datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing subtle meanings and advancing the state of the art in predictive tasks.
