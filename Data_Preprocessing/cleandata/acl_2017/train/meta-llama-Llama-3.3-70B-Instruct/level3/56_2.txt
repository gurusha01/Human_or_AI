Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which utilizes both orthographic and semantic features to segment words into morphemes. The framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which compensates for the deficiencies in the existing Morpho Challenge (MC) dataset. The experimental results show that MORSE outperforms the widely used Morfessor approach and achieves state-of-the-art results.
Main Contributions
1. Introduction of semantic features: MORSE is the first framework to incorporate semantic features into morpheme segmentation, which improves the accuracy of the segmentation process.
2. Vocabulary-wide evaluation: The framework evaluates morphological relations at a vocabulary-wide level, which helps to eliminate errors caused by local semantic noise.
3. New dataset: The authors introduce a new dataset, SD17, which addresses the weaknesses of the existing MC dataset and provides a more accurate evaluation of morpheme segmentation algorithms.
Strengths
1. Improved accuracy: MORSE achieves state-of-the-art results in morpheme segmentation, outperforming the widely used Morfessor approach.
2. Robustness to semantic noise: The framework's use of semantic features and vocabulary-wide evaluation helps to eliminate errors caused by local semantic noise.
3. Flexibility: The framework's hyperparameters can be adjusted to control the trade-off between precision and recall, making it suitable for different downstream tasks.
Weaknesses
1. Limited vocabulary size: The framework's performance is limited by the size of the vocabulary, which can lead to suboptimal performance on languages with productive morphology.
2. Greedy inference approach: The framework's inference stage uses a greedy approach, which can lead to propagation of errors and suboptimal performance.
3. Limited to concatenative morphology: The framework is limited to concatenative morphology and may not perform well on languages with non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the vocabulary size and improve the performance of MORSE on languages with productive morphology?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the greedy inference approach and how it can be improved to reduce the propagation of errors?
3. How do the authors plan to extend MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology and improve its performance on languages with complex morphological structures?
