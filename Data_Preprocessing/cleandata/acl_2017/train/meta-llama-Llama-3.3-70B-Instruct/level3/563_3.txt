This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is flexible and can accommodate various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their framework to three tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The paper is clearly written and easy to understand, making it a well-presented work. However, the contributions of the paper are not significant enough to warrant a full-length paper. The experimental results are sensitive to the choice of clusters and only outperform a naive baseline under specific conditions. The work may be useful as a reference for future studies on vector combination and comparison techniques, but only as a short paper.
The main strengths of the paper are its clarity and the flexibility of the proposed framework. The authors provide a thorough explanation of their methodology and demonstrate its applicability to various tasks. However, the weaknesses of the paper outweigh its strengths. The lack of original thought and strong experimental results is a significant limitation. The paper's contributions are not substantial enough to justify a full-length paper, and the experimental results are not robust enough to support the authors' claims.
In terms of contributions, the paper provides a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which can be useful for future studies. However, the framework is not significantly different from existing methods, and the authors do not provide enough evidence to support its effectiveness. The paper also lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate its contributions.
The questions that need to be addressed by the authors include: (1) How does the proposed framework differ from existing methods, and what are its advantages? (2) How robust are the experimental results, and what are the limitations of the proposed framework? (3) How can the framework be improved to provide more significant contributions to the field?
Overall, while the paper is well-written and easy to understand, its contributions are not significant enough to warrant a full-length paper. The authors need to provide more substantial evidence to support their claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework in a more robust and thorough manner.
