This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of term meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various tasks, including semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A general framework for cross-context lexical analysis that can accommodate any notion of context, similarity function, and word annotation.
2. The application of the framework to three distinct tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability evaluation.
3. The demonstration of the framework's flexibility and effectiveness in various experiments, including the analysis of semantic change, comparative lexical analysis, and word embedding stability.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The proposed framework is well-motivated and addresses an important problem in natural language processing.
2. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the framework and its applications.
3. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in various tasks and provide interesting insights into the analysis of term meanings and representations.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The lack of intuitive explanation about the interactivity between salient phrase extraction and discourse relationship labeling.
2. The validity of using an SVM-based classifier as a comparative method in the experiment is questionable and requires further discussion.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and provides a useful framework for cross-context lexical analysis. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, and the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology and results.
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more intuition about the interactivity between salient phrase extraction and discourse relationship labeling?
2. How did you choose the parameters for the SVM-based classifier, and what is the justification for using this classifier as a comparative method?
3. Can you provide more details about the word embedding stability evaluation task and how it relates to the overall framework?
4. How do you plan to extend the framework to other applications, such as framing bias analysis or sentiment valence prediction?
