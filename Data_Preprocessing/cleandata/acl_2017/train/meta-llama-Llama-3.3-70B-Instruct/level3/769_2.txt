This paper presents a novel evaluation methodology for the task of ghostwriting rap lyrics, which is a challenging language generation task that requires creativity, style, and coherence. The authors propose a comprehensive manual evaluation methodology that assesses fluency, coherence, and style matching of generated verses, as well as an automated evaluation methodology that captures uniqueness and stylistic similarity.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A comprehensive manual evaluation methodology for ghostwriting rap lyrics, which assesses fluency, coherence, and style matching of generated verses.
2. A fully automated evaluation methodology that captures uniqueness and stylistic similarity of generated verses.
3. A dataset of authentic rap lyrics, manually annotated for style matching, which can be used as a gold standard for future experiments.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed evaluation methodology is comprehensive and captures multiple aspects of the ghostwriting task, including fluency, coherence, and style matching.
2. The automated evaluation methodology is fully automated and can be used to evaluate large-scale generated verses.
3. The dataset of authentic rap lyrics, manually annotated for style matching, is a valuable resource for future experiments.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The manual evaluation methodology requires human annotators, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
2. The automated evaluation methodology may not capture all aspects of the ghostwriting task, such as creativity and originality.
3. The dataset of authentic rap lyrics may not be representative of all rap artists or styles.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language generation, particularly in the area of ghostwriting rap lyrics. The proposed evaluation methodology is comprehensive and can be used to evaluate the performance of ghostwriting models. However, further work is needed to improve the automated evaluation methodology and to develop more advanced ghostwriting models that can capture the creativity and originality of human-generated rap lyrics.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to improve the automated evaluation methodology to capture more aspects of the ghostwriting task, such as creativity and originality?
2. Can you provide more details on how you plan to use the dataset of authentic rap lyrics, manually annotated for style matching, in future experiments?
3. How do you think the proposed evaluation methodology can be applied to other language generation tasks, such as poetry or dialogue generation?
