This paper presents a new method for improving lexical substitutability by exploiting word senses, achieving better results than previous methods. However, the paper lacks important insights into natural language processing and computational linguistics. 
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of a new method that enhances sequential inference models based on chain LSTMs, outperforming previous results on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) benchmark.
2. The demonstration that incorporating syntactic parsing information using recursive networks can further improve performance.
3. The achievement of a new state-of-the-art result on the SNLI benchmark with an accuracy of 88.6%.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposal of a novel approach that achieves better results than previous methods.
2. The thorough evaluation of the proposed method on a benchmark dataset.
3. The analysis of the importance of different components of the proposed model.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The lack of practical applications of the lexical substitutability task and its improved results, given the current state of high-performing systems.
2. The subjective nature of the lexical substitutability task, which can alter the semantics of the original sentence.
3. The minor issue of missing citations in Section 3.1.4.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more insights into the natural language processing and computational linguistics aspects of your method?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of practical applications of the lexical substitutability task?
3. Can you elaborate on the potential impact of the subjective nature of the lexical substitutability task on the reliability of the results?
