This paper proposes a semi-automated framework for constructing a compositional semantic similarity evaluation data set, which is a significant strength of the paper. The proposed framework is used to create a Polish compositional semantic similarity evaluation data set, which is useful for future work in developing Polish compositional semantic models.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of an RNN-based generative model for keyphrase prediction, which incorporates a copy mechanism to enable the model to predict rarely-occurred phrases.
2. The creation of a new testing dataset, KP20k, which contains a large number of scientific articles in Computer Science.
3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed model for generating both present and absent keyphrases for different types of text.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposal of a novel approach to keyphrase prediction, which addresses the limitations of previous studies.
2. The creation of a large-scale dataset for evaluating keyphrase prediction models.
3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed model on multiple datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses to this paper:
1. The proposed framework has only been tested on one language, and its portability to other languages is unclear due to its reliance on a dependency parser.
2. The paper lacks information on the number of sentence pairs edited by leader judges, making it difficult to evaluate the correctness and efficiency of the automatic expansion framework.
3. The paper contains several grammatical mistakes, highlighting the need for a proofread pass to improve its overall quality.
Some questions to the authors include:
1. How do the authors plan to address the portability issue of the proposed framework to other languages?
2. Can the authors provide more information on the number of sentence pairs edited by leader judges and the evaluation metrics used to assess the correctness and efficiency of the automatic expansion framework?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the overall quality of the paper, including addressing grammatical mistakes and providing more detailed information on the experimental setup and results?
