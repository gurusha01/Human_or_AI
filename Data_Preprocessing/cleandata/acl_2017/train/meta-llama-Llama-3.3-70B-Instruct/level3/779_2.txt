This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors introduce a multimodal ensemble of features, automatically learned from text and readers' eye-movement data, to improve the performance of sentiment and sarcasm classifiers.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Automatic feature extraction: The authors propose a CNN-based approach to automatically extract features from eye-movement data, which can capture subtle linguistic patterns and cognitive processes.
2. Multimodal ensemble: The authors combine the automatically extracted features from text and eye-movement data to create a multimodal ensemble, which can represent deep linguistic subtleties in text.
3. Improved performance: The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve significant performance improvements over existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features or CNN-based systems that rely on text input alone.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to sentiment and sarcasm detection by leveraging cognitive features extracted from eye-movement data.
2. Automatic feature extraction: The authors' approach can automatically extract features from eye-movement data, which can reduce the need for manual feature engineering.
3. Improved performance: The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve significant performance improvements over existing systems.
However, there are some weaknesses in this paper:
1. Lack of clarity: The paper could benefit from clearer explanations of the CNN architecture and the feature extraction process.
2. Limited analysis: The authors could provide more detailed analysis of the learned features and their impact on the performance of the sentiment and sarcasm classifiers.
3. Small dataset size: The authors use relatively small datasets, which may not be representative of the entire population.
Some questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting, particularly when using small datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the learned features and their impact on the performance of the sentiment and sarcasm classifiers?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other NLP tasks, such as emotion analysis, text summarization, and question-answering?
