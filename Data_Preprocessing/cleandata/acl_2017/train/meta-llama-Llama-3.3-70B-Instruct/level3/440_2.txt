Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which utilizes both orthographic features and semantic information to segment words into morphemes. The framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which compensates for the deficiencies in the existing Morpho Challenge (MC) dataset. The experiments demonstrate that MORSE outperforms the widely used Morfessor approach and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple languages.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Framework: MORSE is a new framework that combines orthographic features with semantic information to perform morpheme segmentation.
2. Vocabulary-Wide Semantic Information: MORSE is the first approach to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for morpheme segmentation.
3. New Dataset: The authors introduce a new dataset, SD17, which addresses the deficiencies in the existing MC dataset.
Strengths
1. Improved Performance: MORSE achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple languages, outperforming the widely used Morfessor approach.
2. Robustness to Over-Segmentation: MORSE is robust to over-segmentation, which is a common issue in morpheme segmentation.
3. Flexibility: The framework allows for flexibility in hyperparameter tuning, enabling users to control precision and recall based on the needs of the downstream task.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Vocabulary Size: MORSE is limited to a vocabulary size of 1M, which may affect its performance on languages with productive morphology.
2. Greedy Inference Approach: The greedy inference approach may limit the performance of MORSE, as wrong segmentations can propagate and result in consequent wrong segmentations.
3. Concatenative Morphology: MORSE is limited to concatenative morphology, which may decrease its efficacy on languages that include non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of MORSE to concatenative morphology?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage for wider adoption by the community?
3. How do the authors plan to extend MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology and improve its performance on languages with productive morphology?
