This paper presents several techniques for enhancing coverage in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parsing, with a focus on the English Resource Grammar (ERG). The main contributions of this work are the evaluation of various robust parsing techniques and the presentation of a methodology for evaluating these techniques.
The primary contribution of this paper is the evaluation of five approaches to increasing the robustness of parsing with the ERG: baseline, bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and a hybrid approach. The results show that the PCFG-based systems are capable of greatly enhancing the coverage of the ERG, while producing analyses whose quality is better than the other robust systems evaluated.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Comprehensive evaluation: The paper presents a thorough evaluation of various robust parsing techniques, providing a detailed comparison of their performance on different datasets.
2. Methodology for evaluation: The paper presents a methodology for evaluating robust parsing techniques, which is a significant contribution to the field.
3. Improvement in coverage: The results show that the PCFG-based systems can significantly improve the coverage of the ERG, making them a promising approach for robust parsing.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. Limited datasets: The evaluation is limited to four datasets, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
2. Complexity of the approaches: Some of the approaches, such as the hybrid approach, may be complex and difficult to implement.
3. Need for further evaluation: The paper highlights the need for further evaluation of the techniques, particularly in terms of extrinsic evaluation and evaluation on data strictly outside of the coverage of the underlying precision grammar.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the complexity of the approaches and make them more accessible to a wider audience?
2. What are the plans for further evaluation of the techniques, particularly in terms of extrinsic evaluation and evaluation on data strictly outside of the coverage of the underlying precision grammar?
3. How do the authors intend to improve the performance of the parse ranking model, particularly in novel situations where it is used?
