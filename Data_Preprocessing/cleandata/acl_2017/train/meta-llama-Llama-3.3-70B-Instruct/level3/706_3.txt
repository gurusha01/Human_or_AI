This paper presents a novel approach to computational argumentation mining (AM) by framing it as a neural end-to-end learning problem. The authors propose several framings, including dependency parsing, sequence tagging, and multi-task learning, to tackle the AM problem. The main contributions of this paper are: 
1. The introduction of neural end-to-end solutions to AM, which eliminate the need for manual feature engineering and costly ILP constraint designing.
2. The demonstration that BiLSTM taggers perform well for component detection, and that naively coupling component and relation detection is not optimal.
3. The finding that relation detection is more difficult, especially when dealing with long documents, and that a more restrained modeling is preferable in such cases.
The strengths of this paper include its innovative approach to AM, its thorough experimentation with different framings, and its achievement of state-of-the-art results on the PE dataset. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methods and results, making it easy to follow and understand their work.
However, there are some weaknesses to this paper. The writing could be improved, as there are some typos, language errors, and missing text that make it difficult to read in some places. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed approach.
Some potential questions to ask the authors include: How do the authors plan to address the issue of long-range dependencies in relation detection, and what are the potential applications of their approach to real-world problems? How do the authors think their approach could be improved or extended, and what are the potential limitations of their method? 
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of AM, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications, from legal decision making to document summarization and analysis of scientific papers. With some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, this paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
