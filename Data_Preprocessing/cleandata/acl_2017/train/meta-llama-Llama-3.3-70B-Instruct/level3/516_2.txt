This paper proposes a novel approach to interactive topic modeling, introducing a method called Tandem Anchors that leverages anchor words to learn topic models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through thorough evaluations, showcasing its ability to outperform existing interactive methods in terms of speed and user experience.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of the Tandem Anchors method, which enables interactive user specification of topics and learns topic models effectively.
2. The demonstration of the approach's superiority over existing interactive methods, allowing for faster and more effective user interaction.
3. The thorough evaluation of the method, including comparisons to recent related work and analysis of its strengths and weaknesses.
The strengths of this paper lie in its clear description of methods and evaluation, as well as its ability to demonstrate the practicality of the technique in real-world interactive topic modeling. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including comparisons to existing methods and analysis of its strengths and weaknesses.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including the lack of related work on anchor words and the limited theoretical contribution. Additionally, the evaluation could be improved with more ideas on how to build topic facets in the absence of convenient sources. The authors also fail to compare their work to recent related work, such as papers by Lee et al. and Nguyen et al., which provide useful insights into the anchor selection process.
Overall, this paper is a meaningful contribution to interactive topic modeling, but could be improved with more thorough evaluation and comparison to related work. The authors provide several minor notes and suggestions for improvement, including clarifying certain points, considering alternative operators, and providing more explanation of the results.
Questions to the authors include: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of related work on anchor words and the limited theoretical contribution?
2. Can the authors provide more ideas on how to build topic facets in the absence of convenient sources?
3. How do the authors plan to compare their work to recent related work, such as papers by Lee et al. and Nguyen et al.? 
4. Can the authors provide more explanation of the results and clarify certain points that are unclear? 
5. How do the authors plan to improve the evaluation of their approach and address the weaknesses identified in the paper?
