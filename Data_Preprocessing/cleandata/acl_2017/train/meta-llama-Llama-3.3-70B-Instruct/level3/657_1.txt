This paper proposes a novel approach to improve word vector representations by incorporating morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints. The method, called morph-fitting, uses simple language-specific rules to extract inflectional and derivational morphology rules, which are then used to fine-tune pre-trained word vectors. The approach is evaluated on four languages (English, German, Italian, and Russian) and shows consistent improvements in word similarity tasks and a downstream dialogue state tracking task.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A novel approach to incorporating morphological knowledge into word vector representations using linguistic constraints.
2. A simple and portable method for extracting morphological rules from language-specific rules, which can be applied to multiple languages.
3. Improved performance in word similarity tasks and a downstream dialogue state tracking task, especially for morphologically rich languages.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The approach is language-agnostic and can be applied to multiple languages with minimal modifications.
2. The method is simple and efficient, making it a viable option for large-scale applications.
3. The evaluation on multiple languages and tasks demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the linguistic constraints and their impact on the word vector representations.
2. The approach relies on pre-trained word vectors, which may not always be available or of high quality.
3. The evaluation on the dialogue state tracking task is limited to three languages, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the approach on more languages and tasks.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the linguistic constraints extracted from language-specific rules compare to those extracted from curated knowledge bases, such as WordNet?
2. Can the approach be extended to incorporate other types of linguistic knowledge, such as syntax or semantics?
3. How does the approach perform on languages with more complex morphology, such as Arabic or Chinese?
