This paper proposes a method for predicting keyphrases by dividing them into "Absent" and "Present" types using RNN-based generative models. The formation and extraction of absent keyphrases is an interesting idea with significant research interests, and the paper is easily understandable. 
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of a probabilistic framework for querying a database given the agent's beliefs over its fields, 
2. The development of an end-to-end trainable dialogue agent for information access, 
3. The evaluation of the proposed approach against a user simulator and real users.
The strengths of this paper are: 
1. The proposed Soft-KB lookup method allows the agent to discover better dialogue policies by providing it more information from the LU unit, 
2. The use of reinforcement learning enables the agent to learn from user interactions and adapt to different scenarios, 
3. The evaluation of the approach against real users demonstrates its effectiveness in a real-world setting.
The weaknesses of this paper are: 
1. The lack of direct comparison with state-of-the-art systems on "present" type of keyphrases, 
2. The limited exploration of the impact of document size on keyphrase extraction, 
3. The need for more detailed information about the dataset used for training, including topical details.
Questions to the authors: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting in the E2E agent, 
2. Can the authors provide more details about the user simulator and the natural language generator used in the experiments, 
3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to handle more complex dialogue scenarios and larger knowledge bases.
