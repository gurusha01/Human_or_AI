Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which uses morpho-syntactic regularities preserved by word representations, in addition to orthographic features, to segment words into morphemes. The framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The authors also analyze the deficiencies of available benchmarking datasets and introduce a new dataset that was created on the basis of compositionality. The proposed segmentation algorithm is evaluated using benchmarking datasets from the Morpho Challenge for multiple languages and the newly introduced dataset for English.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Framework: The paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation that combines semantic relatedness with orthographic relatedness to eliminate errors.
2. Vocabulary-Wide Semantic Evaluation: The framework evaluates morphological relationships via the difference vector of morphologically related words, giving it a vocabulary-wide evaluation of morphological relations learned.
3. New Dataset: The authors introduce a new dataset for English gold morpheme segmentations with compositionality guiding the annotations.
Strengths
1. Improved Performance: MORSE performs better than Morfessor on English and Turkish, and significantly outperforms published state-of-the-art results.
2. Robustness to Over-Segmentation: MORSE is robust to over-segmentation, especially on words that don't compose the meaning of the word.
3. Flexibility: The framework allows for flexibility in controlling precision and recall based on the needs of the downstream task.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Vocabulary Size: The framework is limited to a vocabulary of size 1M, which can lead to suboptimal performance on languages with productive morphology.
2. Greedy Inference Approach: The greedy inference approach can limit the performance of the framework, as a wrong segmentation at the beginning can propagate and result in consequent wrong segmentations.
3. Concatenative Morphology: The framework is limited to concatenative morphology, which can decrease its efficacy on languages that include non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the limitations of MORSE, such as minimal supervision, greedy inference, and concatenative orthographic model?
2. Can you provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage for wider adoption by the community?
3. How do you plan to extend MORSE to handle non-concatenative morphology and improve its performance on languages with productive morphology?
