This paper proposes a novel approach to keyphrase prediction using a generative model based on the encoder-decoder framework. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of an RNN-based generative model for keyphrase prediction, which incorporates a copy mechanism to handle out-of-vocabulary words.
2. The application of the encoder-decoder model to keyphrase prediction, which allows the model to capture the deep semantic meaning of the text.
3. The evaluation of the proposed model on six benchmark datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness in generating both present and absent keyphrases.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed model outperforms existing baselines on most datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in keyphrase prediction.
2. The model is able to generate absent keyphrases, which is a challenging task that existing methods struggle with.
3. The use of a copy mechanism allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words, which is a common issue in keyphrase prediction.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. The model's performance on some datasets is not significantly better than the baselines, which suggests that there may be room for improvement.
2. The model requires a large amount of training data, which may not be available for all domains or applications.
3. The evaluation metrics used in the paper may not fully capture the quality of the generated keyphrases, and additional metrics or human evaluation may be necessary to fully assess the model's performance.
Some questions to the authors include:
1. How does the model handle keyphrases with multiple words, and are there any plans to extend the model to handle more complex keyphrases?
2. Can the model be applied to other domains or applications, such as news articles or social media posts, and if so, what modifications would be necessary?
3. Are there any plans to release the code or data used in the paper, which would allow other researchers to build on this work and explore its potential applications?
