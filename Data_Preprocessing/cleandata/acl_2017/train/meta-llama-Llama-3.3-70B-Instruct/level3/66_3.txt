This paper proposes a novel approach to generating memorable mnemonic encodings of numbers, leveraging a probabilistic framework and reinforcement learning. The authors introduce a Soft-KB lookup method, which allows for end-to-end training of dialogue agents and provides more information to the reinforcement learner, enabling it to discover better dialogue policies.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Soft-KB lookup method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework for querying a database given the agent's beliefs over its fields, which allows for end-to-end training of dialogue agents.
2. End-to-end trainable dialogue agent: The authors present an end-to-end trainable dialogue agent, which demonstrates strong learning capability in simulations but suffers from overfitting when tested on real users.
3. Evaluation and comparison: The authors evaluate and compare different versions of the dialogue agent, including rule-based and reinforcement learning-based approaches, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Soft-KB lookup method.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to generating memorable mnemonic encodings of numbers, which has practical applications.
2. Well-motivated: The paper is well-motivated by existing work on security and memorability, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and their approach.
3. Strong evaluation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including comparisons with other methods and analysis of the results.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation: The evaluation is limited to a single dataset and scenario, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive evaluation and comparison with other methods.
2. Overfitting: The end-to-end trainable dialogue agent suffers from overfitting when tested on real users, which highlights the need for more robust training methods.
3. Lack of background: The paper could benefit from more background information on the Major system, including its origin and logic, as well as examples of the digits and encodings used in the user study.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to address the overfitting issue in the end-to-end trainable dialogue agent?
2. Can you provide more details on the user study, including the number of participants and the tasks they were asked to perform?
3. How do you envision the Soft-KB lookup method being applied in real-world scenarios, and what are the potential benefits and challenges?
