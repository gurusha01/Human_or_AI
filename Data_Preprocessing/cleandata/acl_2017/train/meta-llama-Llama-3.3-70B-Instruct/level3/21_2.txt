This paper presents a novel approach to automated short-answer scoring and support for Japanese university entrance examinations. The proposed system utilizes a combination of machine learning and human evaluation to score written answers. The authors' method is formal and well-structured, with a good design of experiments that effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The development of a short-answer scoring and support system that can accurately evaluate written answers and provide feedback to human raters.
2. The use of random forests machine learning algorithm to predict scores based on the understanding of other human raters or supervised data.
3. The creation of a mechanism to automatically generate a scoring screen from a scoring criterion file, allowing for easy modification and updating of the system.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed system has a high degree of accuracy, with a concordance rate of 71-95% between the estimated scores and human ratings.
2. The use of random forests algorithm allows for the evaluation of the importance of variables in distinction, providing valuable insights into the factors that contribute to accurate scoring.
3. The system has a user-friendly interface, with a scoring screen that provides clear and concise information to human raters.
However, there are some weaknesses to this paper:
1. The lack of discussion on the limitations and potential biases of the machine learning algorithm used, which could impact the accuracy and fairness of the scoring system.
2. The reliance on human scores for supervised learning, which may not always be available or reliable.
3. The need for a large amount of labeled data to train the machine learning model, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of limited labeled data for supervised learning, and what strategies will they use to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the scoring system?
2. Can the authors provide more information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the system, and how they plan to improve the accuracy and reliability of the scoring system?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the system to other subjects, such as Japanese literature, and what modifications will be needed to accommodate the unique characteristics of each subject?
