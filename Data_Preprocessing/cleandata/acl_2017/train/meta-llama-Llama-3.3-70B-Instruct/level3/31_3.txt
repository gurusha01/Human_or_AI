This paper proposes a novel approach to creating a natural language interface for performing complex actions, such as analyzing data, manipulating text, and querying databases. The authors introduce a system called Voxelurn, which allows users to interactively naturalize a core programming language by defining new constructions and concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. Interactive language learning: The authors propose a new interactive language learning process, which enables users to teach the system to understand the language they want to use, rather than the core language that users are forced to use initially.
2. Grammar induction: The authors develop a grammar induction algorithm that can learn new grammar rules from user definitions, which allows the system to generalize and improve its understanding of the language over time.
3. Naturalization: The authors demonstrate that the system can naturalize the core language, allowing users to use more natural and concise language to perform complex actions.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a novel approach to creating a natural language interface, which has the potential to bridge the gap between the power of programming languages and the convenience of natural language interfaces.
2. Effective grammar induction: The authors develop an effective grammar induction algorithm that can learn new grammar rules from user definitions, which allows the system to improve its understanding of the language over time.
3. Empirical results: The authors provide empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including the ability of the system to naturalize the core language and improve its understanding of user definitions.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited evaluation: The authors only evaluate their system on a single task, which is building voxel structures, and it is unclear how well the system would perform on other tasks.
2. Lack of comparison: The authors do not compare their system to other natural language interfaces or programming languages, which makes it difficult to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
3. Complexity: The authors' approach requires a significant amount of user interaction and feedback, which may be time-consuming and cumbersome for users.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to extend your approach to other tasks and domains, and what challenges do you anticipate?
2. How do you plan to evaluate the effectiveness of your system in comparison to other natural language interfaces and programming languages?
3. What are the potential applications of your approach, and how do you see it being used in practice?
