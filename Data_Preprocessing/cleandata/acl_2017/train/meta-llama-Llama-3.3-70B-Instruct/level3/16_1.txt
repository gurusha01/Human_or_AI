This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of several techniques for enhancing the coverage of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parsing. The authors propose a clear and simple framework for robust parsing, which significantly improves the performance of the English Resource Grammar (ERG) on various datasets.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The introduction of a supervised attention mechanism that leverages a method successfully used in tasks like machine translation to improve event detection performance.
2. The proposal of several robust parsing techniques, including bridging, Pacman, and PCFG approximation, which are evaluated on multiple datasets.
3. The development of a methodology for evaluating robust parsing techniques, which addresses the challenge of missing gold standard evaluation data for inputs that cannot be parsed.
The strengths of this paper lie in its thorough evaluation of various techniques, its solid experiments, and its effective framework for robust parsing. The use of a supervised attention mechanism is a significant contribution, as it outperforms the baseline and demonstrates the potential of this approach for improving parsing performance.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The calculation of the attention vector is simplistic and could be improved with a more sophisticated approach. Additionally, the proposed strategies for the supervised attention mechanism are straightforward, and more complex strategies could potentially yield better results.
Overall, this paper proposes an effective framework with good performance, supported by solid experiments, making it a candidate for acceptance despite areas for improvement. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges in robust parsing and provide a comprehensive evaluation of various techniques, making this paper a valuable contribution to the field.
Some potential questions to the authors include:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of simplistic attention vector calculation, and what alternative approaches could be explored?
* Can the authors provide more details on the potential applications of the proposed framework, and how it could be integrated into existing NLP systems?
* How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on datasets that are strictly outside of the coverage of the underlying precision grammar?
