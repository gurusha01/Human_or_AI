This paper proposes a general framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which enables the comparison of word meanings and representations across different contexts. The framework, called CCLA, is flexible and can accommodate various notions of context, similarity functions, and word annotations. The authors demonstrate the applicability of CCLA to three distinct tasks: semantic change detection, comparative lexical analysis over context, and word embedding stability evaluation.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. CCLA framework: The authors introduce a novel framework for cross-context lexical analysis, which provides a unified approach to comparing word meanings and representations across different contexts.
2. Semantic change detection: The authors apply CCLA to detect semantic changes in word meanings over time, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying words with changing meanings.
3. Comparative lexical analysis: The authors use CCLA to compare word meanings across different contexts, such as sentiment analysis datasets, and identify context-sensitive and context-insensitive terms.
4. Word embedding stability evaluation: The authors propose a method to evaluate the stability of word embeddings using CCLA, which can help identify the most stable and effective word embedding methods.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. Flexibility: The CCLA framework is highly flexible and can be applied to various tasks and contexts.
2. Effectiveness: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CCLA in detecting semantic changes and comparing word meanings across different contexts.
3. Novelty: The paper introduces a new framework and approach to cross-context lexical analysis, which can be useful for various NLP tasks.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
1. Lack of cohesion: The paper jumps between different tasks and applications, making it difficult to follow at times.
2. Overemphasis on technical details: The paper focuses heavily on technical details, which may make it challenging for non-experts to understand the broader implications and applications of the work.
3. Limited evaluation: The authors could have provided more comprehensive evaluations of the CCLA framework and its applications, including comparisons with existing methods and baselines.
To improve the paper, the authors could address the following questions:
1. How does CCLA compare to existing methods for cross-context lexical analysis, such as topic models and word embedding methods?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analyses of the results and discussions of the implications of the findings?
3. How can CCLA be applied to other NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation?
