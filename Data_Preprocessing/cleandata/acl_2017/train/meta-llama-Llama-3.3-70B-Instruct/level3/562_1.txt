This paper presents a novel approach to relation extraction, specifically focusing on zero-shot relation extraction. The authors have created a large dataset for relation extraction as question answering, which is likely to be useful to the community. The paper explores an interesting problem and the idea of performing relation extraction as reading comprehension by creating a large dataset of "querified" relations and using a reading comprehension model is well-written and interesting.
However, the paper lacks comparison and credit to existing work, and the contributions of the paper do not seem particularly novel, with similar work having been done by other researchers. The authors have missed citing several related works, including Neelakantan et al. 2015, Verga et al. 2017, and Bordes et al., which have performed similar tasks and achieved similar results.
The empirical results of the paper are weak due to the lack of evaluation on another dataset and the lack of comparison with previously published models on their dataset. The paper's main contributions are the creation of a large dataset and the proposal of a compositional method for IsA extraction, but the method lacks novelty and the results are not convincing.
The strengths of the paper include the creation of a large dataset, which is a significant contribution to the community, and the exploration of an interesting problem. However, the weaknesses of the paper, including the lack of comparison to existing work, the lack of novelty in the method, and the weak empirical results, outweigh the strengths.
The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:
1. The creation of a large dataset for relation extraction as question answering.
2. The proposal of a compositional method for IsA extraction.
3. The exploration of an interesting problem of zero-shot relation extraction.
However, these contributions are not sufficient to outweigh the weaknesses of the paper, and the paper requires significant improvements before it can be considered for acceptance.
Questions to the authors include:
* How does the proposed method compare to existing methods for relation extraction?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method compared to existing methods?
* How can the empirical results be improved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method?
* What are the potential applications of the proposed method and the created dataset?
