This paper proposes a novel approach to improve word vector representations by incorporating morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints. The authors introduce a method called morph-fitting, which injects morphological constraints into pre-trained word vectors to better capture semantic relationships between words. The approach is language-agnostic and does not require curated knowledge bases or gold lexicons.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a morph-fitting method that improves word vector representations by incorporating morphological knowledge.
2. The demonstration of the effectiveness of morph-fitting across four languages (English, German, Italian, and Russian) on intrinsic word similarity tasks.
3. The evaluation of morph-fitting on a downstream task, dialogue state tracking, which shows significant improvements in performance, especially for morphologically rich languages.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The novelty of the approach, which combines morphological knowledge with word vector representations to improve semantic relationships between words.
2. The thorough evaluation of the method across multiple languages and tasks, which demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.
3. The potential impact of this work on natural language processing tasks, particularly those that rely on word representations as features.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The reliance on simple language-specific rules to extract morphological constraints, which may not capture the full complexity of morphological processes in languages.
2. The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods that incorporate morphological knowledge into word vector representations.
3. The limited evaluation on downstream tasks, which may not fully demonstrate the potential benefits of morph-fitting.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the morph-fitting method to other languages and tasks, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the language-specific rules used to extract morphological constraints, and how they were developed and evaluated?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the morph-fitting method, such as the reliance on simple language-specific rules and the lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods?
