This paper presents a novel approach to IsA relation extraction, which leverages the compositionality of natural language to populate fine-grained classes with instances. The approach is well-motivated and addresses a significant limitation of existing methods, which treat class labels as atomic units that must be observed in full to be populated with instances.
The main contributions of this work are: 
1. A compositional method for IsA extraction, which involves a novel application of noun-phrase paraphrasing methods to the task of semantic taxonomy induction.
2. The operationalization of a formal semantics framework to address two aspects of semantics that are often kept separate in NLP: assigning intrinsic "meaning" to a phrase, and reasoning about that phrase in a truth-theoretic context.
The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve upon the Hearst-pattern derived IsA relations in terms of coverage, with a >10 point increase in AUC on both UniformSet and WeightedSet. The results also show that the proposed method can extract instances about as well as the baseline, whenever the baseline can extract anything at all, and that there are many classes for which the baseline is not able to extract any instances, but the proposed method is.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The experiments lack ROC curves for the new approach alone, making it difficult to evaluate its ability to distinguish between high and low precision regions. Additionally, there is a potential error in Eqn. 7, with an unnecessary variable $w$ that is already defined elsewhere.
Overall, the paper is well-described and evaluated, making it a good potential addition to ACL. The approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving upon existing methods. 
The primary contributions of this work are the compositional method for IsA extraction and the operationalization of a formal semantics framework. The secondary contributions are the experiments and results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The strengths of this paper are:

Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the formal semantics framework and how it is used to assign intrinsic "meaning" to a phrase?
2. How do you plan to address the potential error in Eqn. 7 and ensure that the variable $w$ is used correctly?
3. Can you provide more analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in terms of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method?
