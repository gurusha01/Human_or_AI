This paper proposes a novel approach to zero pronoun resolution by automatically generating large-scale pseudo training data and utilizing an attention-based neural network model. The main contributions of this work are: 
1. The proposal of a simple but effective method to generate large-scale pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution, which can alleviate the problem of lack of annotated data.
2. The introduction of a two-step training approach, which combines the benefits of large-scale pseudo training data and task-specific data to improve the performance of zero pronoun resolution.
3. The development of an attention-based neural network model that can effectively capture the context information and resolve zero pronouns.
The strengths of this paper include: 
1. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, with an absolute improvement of 3.1% in F-score.
2. The two-step training approach is effective in adapting the model to the task-specific data and improving the performance of zero pronoun resolution.
3. The attention-based neural network model is able to capture the context information and resolve zero pronouns effectively.
However, there are some weaknesses in this paper: 
1. The proposed approach relies heavily on the quality of the pseudo training data, which may not always be guaranteed.
2. The model may not perform well when there are lots of unknown words in the context of zero pronouns, especially when the unknown words appear near the zero pronoun.
3. The model may make incorrect decisions when the correct antecedents of zero pronouns are in long distance.
To improve this work, the authors could consider the following questions: 
1. How to improve the quality of the pseudo training data to ensure that it is representative of the task-specific data?
2. How to develop more effective methods to handle unknown words in the context of zero pronouns?
3. How to modify the model to capture long-distance dependencies and improve its performance on resolving zero pronouns with distant antecedents?
