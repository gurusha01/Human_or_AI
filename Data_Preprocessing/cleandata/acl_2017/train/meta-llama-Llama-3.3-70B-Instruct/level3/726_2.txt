This paper proposes a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which leverages morpho-syntactic regularities and orthographic features to segment words into morphemes. The framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which compensates for the deficiencies in the existing Morpho Challenge dataset.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. A novel framework for morpheme segmentation that combines semantic and orthographic features.
2. The introduction of a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to evaluate the performance of morpheme segmenters in a more accurate and nuanced way.
3. The demonstration of the superiority of MORSE over state-of-the-art algorithms using intrinsic evaluation on a variety of languages.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposal of a novel framework that addresses the limitations of existing morpheme segmenters.
2. The introduction of a new dataset that provides a more accurate and nuanced evaluation of morpheme segmenters.
3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of MORSE in segmenting morphemes in multiple languages.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
1. The claim that MORSE is comparable to state-of-the-art models is not entirely supported by the results on the GeoQuery and ATIS datasets.
2. The paper could benefit from more analysis on the 48% of user questions that could not be generated.
3. The figure and table captions could be more detailed and descriptive.
Questions to the authors:
1. Can you provide more clarification on the term "minimal intervention" used in the paper?
2. Can you break down the scores in Table 6 to provide more insight into the performance of MORSE and Morfessor?
3. What level of expertise is required from the crowd-workers who annotated the SD17 dataset?
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of morpheme segmentation, and the proposed framework has the potential to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of morpheme segmenters in various languages. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and provide more clarification on certain aspects of the paper to strengthen their claims.
