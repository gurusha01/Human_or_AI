Summary of the Paper:
The paper proposes a scalable Bayesian learning framework for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods. The framework models weight uncertainty in RNNs, which is essential for preventing overfitting and improving generalization. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, image captioning, and sentence classification.
