Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a novel approach to zero pronoun resolution by automatically generating large-scale pseudo training data and utilizing an attention-based neural network model. The authors address the issue of limited annotated data for zero pronoun resolution by generating pseudo training data using a cloze-style reading comprehension approach. They also propose a two-step training method, which combines the benefits of large-scale pseudo training data and task-specific data.
Main Contributions
1. Automatic generation of pseudo training data: The authors propose a simple and effective method to generate large-scale pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution, which can alleviate the issue of limited annotated data.
2. Attention-based neural network model: The authors utilize an attention-based neural network model to resolve zero pronouns, which can effectively capture the context information and improve the performance of zero pronoun resolution.
3. Two-step training approach: The authors propose a two-step training approach, which combines the benefits of large-scale pseudo training data and task-specific data, and can be easily adapted to other tasks as well.
Strengths
1. Effective use of pseudo training data: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of using pseudo training data to improve the performance of zero pronoun resolution, which can alleviate the issue of limited annotated data.
2. State-of-the-art results: The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus, which demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed approach.
3. Simple and efficient method: The authors propose a simple and efficient method to generate pseudo training data, which can be easily adapted to other tasks as well.
Weaknesses
1. Limited analysis of errors: The authors only provide a limited analysis of errors, which may not be sufficient to understand the limitations of their proposed approach.
2. Lack of comparison with other methods: The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other methods, which may make it difficult to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their proposed approach.
3. Dependence on task-specific data: The authors' proposed approach relies on task-specific data, which may limit its applicability to other tasks or domains.
