This paper presents a novel method for improving lexical substitution rankings by integrating word sense inventories into existing models. The authors propose a multi-view clustering approach to generate sense clusters of paraphrases, which are then used as a filter to improve the rankings of vector- and embedding-based lexical substitution models.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. The proposed multi-view clustering approach can generate sense clusters that are more substitutable and coherent than previous results.
2. The sense clusters can be used as a filter to improve the rankings of lexical substitution models, resulting in better agreement with human-annotated substitutes.
The paper supports these claims through a series of experiments, including:
1. Evaluating the substitutability of existing sense inventories, such as WordNet and PPDBClus, using a proposed cluster quality metric, B-Cubed F-Score.
2. Comparing the performance of the proposed multi-view clustering approach with single-view clustering approaches, such as Context Substitutability and Paraphrase Similarity.
3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the sense filtering approach in improving the rankings of lexical substitution models, such as Syn.VSM and AddCos.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. The proposal of a novel multi-view clustering approach that incorporates multiple sources of information to generate sense clusters.
2. The evaluation of the substitutability of existing sense inventories, which provides a baseline for comparison with the proposed approach.
3. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the sense filtering approach in improving the rankings of lexical substitution models.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. The reliance on a simple word sense disambiguation method, which may introduce bias and limit the accuracy of the sense filtering approach.
2. The limited evaluation of the proposed approach on a specific dataset, which may not generalize to other datasets or languages.
3. The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art lexical substitution models, which may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to improving lexical substitution rankings by integrating word sense inventories into existing models. However, further evaluation and refinement of the approach are necessary to fully demonstrate its effectiveness and potential applications.
Questions to authors:
1. How do you plan to address the limitation of the simple word sense disambiguation method, and what alternative methods could be explored?
2. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the multi-view clustering approach, including the specific parameters and hyperparameters used?
3. How do you plan to evaluate the proposed approach on other datasets and languages, and what challenges do you anticipate in generalizing the approach to these domains?
