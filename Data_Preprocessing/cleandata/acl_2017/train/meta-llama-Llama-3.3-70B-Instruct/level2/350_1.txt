This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically label training data for event extraction (EE) tasks using world knowledge and linguistic knowledge. The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed approach can automatically generate large-scale labeled data for EE, (2) the quality of the automatically labeled data is competitive with human-annotated data, and (3) the automatically labeled data can be used to improve the performance of EE models.
The paper supports these claims through a series of experiments, including manual and automatic evaluations of the automatically labeled data. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve high precision and recall in both trigger labeling and argument labeling, and that the automatically labeled data can be used to improve the performance of EE models.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the proposal of a novel approach to automatically label training data for EE tasks, (2) the use of world knowledge and linguistic knowledge to improve the quality of the automatically labeled data, and (3) the thorough evaluation of the proposed approach through both manual and automatic evaluations.
However, there are also some weaknesses in the paper, including: (1) the reliance on a specific knowledge base (Freebase) and linguistic resource (FrameNet), which may limit the applicability of the approach to other domains and languages, and (2) the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art EE models and approaches.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of EE, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of EE models and reduce the need for human-annotated training data.
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. A novel approach to automatically label training data for EE tasks using world knowledge and linguistic knowledge.
2. The proposal of a key argument detection method to prioritize arguments for each event type.
3. The use of FrameNet to filter noisy triggers and expand more triggers.
