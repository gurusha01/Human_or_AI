Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to relation extraction by reducing it to a reading comprehension problem. The authors map each relation to a set of natural-language questions, allowing them to leverage recent advances in neural reading comprehension techniques. This approach enables zero-shot learning, where new relations can be extracted without requiring labeled training data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a Wikipedia slot-filling task, achieving high accuracy on unseen entities and relations.
Main Contributions
1. Reduction of relation extraction to reading comprehension: The authors show that relation extraction can be formulated as a reading comprehension problem, enabling the use of neural reading comprehension techniques.
2. Zero-shot learning: The approach allows for zero-shot learning, where new relations can be extracted without requiring labeled training data.
3. Large-scale dataset creation: The authors create a large-scale dataset of over 30,000,000 examples using a crowdsourcing approach, which can be used for training and evaluating relation extraction models.
Strengths
1. Novel approach: The paper proposes a novel approach to relation extraction, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in the field.
2. Effective use of neural reading comprehension techniques: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of using neural reading comprehension techniques for relation extraction.
3. Large-scale dataset creation: The creation of a large-scale dataset is a significant contribution to the field, enabling the training and evaluation of relation extraction models.
Weaknesses
1. Limited evaluation: The paper only evaluates the approach on a single task (Wikipedia slot-filling) and dataset, which may not be representative of all relation extraction tasks.
2. Dependence on question quality: The approach relies on the quality of the questions used to define the relations, which may not always be accurate or informative.
3. Limited analysis of errors: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by the model, which could provide insights into areas for improvement.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limited evaluation of the approach, and what other tasks and datasets will be used to evaluate the method?
2. How do the authors plan to improve the quality of the questions used to define the relations, and what methods will be used to evaluate question quality?
3. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model, and what insights can be gained from this analysis?
