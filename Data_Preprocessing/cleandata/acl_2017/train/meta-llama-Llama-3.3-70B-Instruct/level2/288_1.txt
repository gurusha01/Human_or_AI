Summary of the Paper
This paper explores how different writing tasks can affect an author's writing style. The authors conduct a case study using the story cloze task, where annotators are assigned to write stories with different constraints. They show that a simple linear classifier can distinguish between different types of story endings (coherent, incoherent, and original) with high accuracy, even without considering the story context. The paper also establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, outperforming previous deep learning models.
Main Contributions
1. Writing task affects writing style: The paper demonstrates that different writing tasks can lead to measurable differences in writing style, which can be detected using simple stylistic features.
2. Style-based classifier for story cloze task: The authors propose a style-based classifier that achieves state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task, outperforming previous models that rely on deep learning and context-based features.
3. Importance of task design in NLP: The paper highlights the importance of careful task design in NLP, as different writing tasks can introduce biases and affect the resulting writing style.
Strengths
1. Novel approach to writing style analysis: The paper proposes a new approach to analyzing writing style, focusing on the effect of writing tasks on style.
2. Simple yet effective classifier: The authors demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can achieve state-of-the-art results on the story cloze task, highlighting the importance of stylistic features.
3. Insights into task design: The paper provides valuable insights into the importance of task design in NLP, highlighting the need for careful consideration of writing tasks and their potential biases.
Weaknesses
1. Limited scope: The paper focuses on a specific task (story cloze) and may not generalize to other NLP tasks.
2. Lack of deeper analysis: The paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of the cognitive implications of the findings and the potential applications in NLP.
3. No comparison to other style-based models: The paper does not compare the proposed style-based classifier to other style-based models, which could provide additional insights into the effectiveness of the approach.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend the approach to other NLP tasks, and what potential challenges do they anticipate?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the cognitive implications of the findings, and how they relate to existing research on writing style and mental state?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the approach, such as the limited scope and lack of deeper analysis?
