Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a novel approach to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in speech transcripts using complex network features. The authors model speech transcripts as complex networks and enrich them with word embeddings to better represent short texts. They evaluate their approach on three datasets, including the DementiaBank, Cinderella, and Arizona-Battery datasets, and compare the results with traditional linguistic features and bag-of-words representation. The authors claim that their approach outperforms traditional linguistic features and achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods.
Main Contributions
1. Novel approach to MCI detection: The authors propose a new approach to detect MCI in speech transcripts using complex network features, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Enriching complex networks with word embeddings: The authors enrich complex networks with word embeddings to better represent short texts, which improves the accuracy of MCI detection.
3. Comparison with traditional features: The authors compare their approach with traditional linguistic features and bag-of-words representation, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
Strengths
1. Innovative approach: The authors propose a novel approach to MCI detection, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Competitive results: The authors achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
3. Robust evaluation: The authors evaluate their approach on three datasets, including the DementiaBank, Cinderella, and Arizona-Battery datasets, which provides a robust evaluation of their approach.
Weaknesses
1. Limited interpretation: The authors do not provide a detailed interpretation of the complex network features, which makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms of MCI detection.
2. Dependence on word embeddings: The authors rely on word embeddings to enrich complex networks, which may not be effective for all languages or domains.
3. Limited comparison with other methods: The authors only compare their approach with traditional linguistic features and bag-of-words representation, which may not be a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you provide a more detailed interpretation of the complex network features and how they relate to MCI detection?
2. How do you plan to extend your approach to other languages or domains, where word embeddings may not be effective?
3. Can you provide a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for MCI detection?
