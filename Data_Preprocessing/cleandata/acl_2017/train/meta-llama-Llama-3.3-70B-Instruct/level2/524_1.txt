Summary of the Paper
This paper explores several techniques for enhancing coverage when parsing with Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) grammars. The authors evaluate the performance of five approaches to increasing the robustness of parsing with the English Resource Grammar (ERG), including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches. The results show that the PCFG-based systems are capable of greatly enhancing the coverage of the ERG, while producing analyses whose quality is better than the other robust systems evaluated.
Main Contributions
1. Evaluation of robust parsing techniques: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of several robust parsing techniques for HPSG grammars, including bridging, Pacman, PCFG approximation, and hybrid approaches.
2. Methodology for evaluation: The authors propose a methodology for evaluating robust parsing techniques, including the use of intrinsic evaluation metrics such as coverage and EDM F1 scores.
3. Hybrid approach: The paper introduces a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of PCFG-based parsing and HPSG-based parsing, achieving high coverage and accuracy.
Strengths
1. Comprehensive evaluation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of several robust parsing techniques, including a comparison of their performance on different datasets.
2. Novel hybrid approach: The hybrid approach introduced in the paper shows promising results, achieving high coverage and accuracy.
3. Methodology for evaluation: The authors propose a clear and well-defined methodology for evaluating robust parsing techniques, which can be useful for future research.
Weaknesses
