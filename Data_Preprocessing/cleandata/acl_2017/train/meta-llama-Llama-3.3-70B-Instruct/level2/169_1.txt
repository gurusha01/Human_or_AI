Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a method to automatically annotate parallel error correction data with explicit edit spans and error type information. This is achieved through a two-step approach: first, a linguistically-enhanced alignment algorithm is used to extract edits between parallel original and corrected sentences, and second, a new rule-based framework is used to classify these edits into error types. The authors evaluate their approach by applying it to the system output produced in the CoNLL-2014 shared task on Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing a detailed analysis of system error type performance.
Main Contributions
1. Automatic annotation of error correction data: The paper presents a method to automatically annotate parallel error correction data with explicit edit spans and error type information, which can be used to standardize existing error correction corpora or facilitate a detailed error type evaluation.
2. Rule-based framework for error type classification: The authors introduce a new rule-based framework to classify edits into error types, which is entirely dataset-independent and relies only on automatically obtained information such as POS tags and lemmas.
3. Detailed evaluation of system error type performance: The paper demonstrates the value of the proposed approach by carrying out a detailed evaluation of system error type performance for all teams in the CoNLL-2014 shared task on GEC.
Strengths
1. Effective error type classification: The authors' rule-based framework is shown to be effective in classifying edits into error types, with a high percentage of predicted error types considered "Good" or "Acceptable" by human raters.
2. Detailed evaluation of system performance: The paper provides a detailed analysis of system error type performance, which can help researchers identify strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to GEC.
3. Release of annotation tool: The authors plan to release the annotation tool used in the paper, which can facilitate further research in GEC.
Weaknesses
1. Limited evaluation of the annotation tool: The paper only evaluates the annotation tool on a small-scale dataset, and it is unclear how well it would perform on larger datasets.
2. Lack of comparison to other annotation tools: The paper does not compare the proposed annotation tool to other existing tools, which makes it difficult to assess its relative performance.
3. Limited analysis of error types: While the paper provides a detailed analysis of system error type performance, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the error types themselves, which could provide further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to GEC.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the proposed annotation tool handle cases where the edit span is ambiguous or unclear?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the rule-based framework used for error type classification, including the specific rules and features used?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the annotation tool on larger datasets, and what metrics will they use to assess its performance?
