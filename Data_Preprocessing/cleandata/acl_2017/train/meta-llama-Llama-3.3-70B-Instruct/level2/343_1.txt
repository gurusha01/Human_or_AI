Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a neural word segmentation model that leverages rich external resources to improve its performance. The model uses a globally optimized beam-search framework and a modular architecture, allowing for pretraining of a key submodule using external data. The authors investigate the effectiveness of various external training sources, including punctuation, automatically segmented text, heterogeneous segmentation data, and POS information. The results show that pretraining the character window network using these sources leads to significant improvements in segmentation accuracy.
