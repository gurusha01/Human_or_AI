Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a neural model for morphological inflection generation that employs a hard attention mechanism. The model is designed to handle the task of generating a target word given a source word and its morpho-syntactic attributes. The authors evaluate the model on three previously studied morphological inflection generation datasets and show that it provides state-of-the-art results in various setups compared to previous neural and non-neural approaches.
Main Contributions
1. The authors propose a hard attention model for nearly-monotonic sequence-to-sequence learning, which is suitable for the morphological inflection generation task.
2. The model is evaluated on three morphological inflection generation datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art on these datasets.
3. The authors perform an analysis and comparison of their model and the soft-attention model, shedding light on the features such models extract for the inflection generation task.
Strengths
1. The model's ability to handle small training sets and avoid overfitting is a significant strength, as it outperforms previous neural models on the low-resource CELEX dataset.
2. The hard attention mechanism allows the model to condition on the entire output history, which is not available in FST models, making it more suitable for the task.
3. The model's performance on the large training set experiments (Wiktionary) shows its robustness and advantage over previous neural and non-neural state-of-the-art baselines.
4. The analysis of the learned alignments and representations provides insights into how the model works and why it is effective for the task.
Weaknesses
1. The model's performance on languages with more complex morphological phenomena, such as vowel harmony and consonant harmony, is slightly less accurate than the soft-attention model.
2. The model requires a pre-trained character-level alignment, which may not always be available or accurate.
3. The model's simplicity and lack of complexity may limit its ability to capture more nuanced aspects of the task.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the model's performance on languages with more complex morphological phenomena?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the character-level alignment process and how it is used to guide the training of the encoder-decoder network?
3. How do the authors think the model can be applied to other nearly-monotonic align-and-transduce tasks, such as abstractive summarization or machine translation?
