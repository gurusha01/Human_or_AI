Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel task of sarcasm interpretation, which involves generating a non-sarcastic utterance that conveys the same message as the original sarcastic one. The authors introduce a dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges, and propose a monolingual machine translation (MT) approach to address the task. They experiment with MT algorithms, including phrase-based and neural MT systems, and evaluate their performance using automatic and human-based measures. The authors also propose a novel algorithm, Sarcasm SIGN, which targets sentiment words in sarcastic utterances and replaces them with suitable words to produce accurate interpretations.
Main Contributions
1. Introduction of the sarcasm interpretation task and a novel dataset of sarcastic tweets with human interpretations.
2. Proposal of a monolingual MT approach to address the task, including the use of phrase-based and neural MT systems.
3. Development of the Sarcasm SIGN algorithm, which targets sentiment words in sarcastic utterances to produce accurate interpretations.
Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel and interesting task that has not been previously attempted, and provides a comprehensive dataset to support the research.
2. The authors propose a well-motivated approach to address the task, using MT algorithms and evaluating their performance using both automatic and human-based measures.
3. The Sarcasm SIGN algorithm shows promising results, outperforming the baseline MT systems in terms of human evaluation measures.
Weaknesses
1. The paper relies heavily on the quality of the dataset, which may be limited by the use of a single platform (Twitter) and a specific hashtag (sarcasm).
2. The authors acknowledge that the Sarcasm SIGN algorithm struggles with producing correct interpretations for tweets that do not express sarcasm through sentiment words, or require world knowledge to comprehend.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future research.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the Sarcasm SIGN algorithm, particularly in handling tweets that do not express sarcasm through sentiment words?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the human evaluation process, including the criteria used to assess the quality of the interpretations?
3. How do the authors envision the sarcasm interpretation task being applied in real-world scenarios, and what potential applications do they see for the Sarcasm SIGN algorithm?
