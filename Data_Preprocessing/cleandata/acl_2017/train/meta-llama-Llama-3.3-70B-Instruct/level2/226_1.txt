Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a procedure for building an evaluation dataset for validating compositional distributional semantics models for the Polish language. The procedure is based on the design principles of the SICK corpus, but with significant modifications to accommodate the characteristics of the Polish language and the lack of available resources. The resulting dataset consists of 10K sentence pairs annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment.
Main Contributions
1. Development of a Polish evaluation dataset: The paper presents a novel dataset for evaluating compositional distributional semantics models for Polish, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Adaptation of the SICK corpus procedure: The authors adapt the SICK corpus procedure to the Polish language, taking into account the language's specific characteristics and the lack of available resources.
3. Introduction of language-specific transformation rules: The paper introduces new transformation rules for Polish, which are essential for generating sentence pairs with similar, contrastive, or neutral meanings.
Strengths
1. Well-motivated and clearly described procedure: The paper provides a clear and well-motivated description of the procedure for building the evaluation dataset.
2. High-quality annotations: The authors report high inter-annotator agreement scores for both entailment labels and relatedness scores, indicating the high quality of the annotations.
3. Significant contribution to the field: The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing by providing a novel evaluation dataset for Polish.
Weaknesses
1. Limited scope: The paper focuses on the Polish language, which may limit its applicability to other languages.
2. Dependence on manual annotation: The procedure relies heavily on manual annotation, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
3. Potential biases in the dataset: The authors do not discuss potential biases in the dataset, such as biases in the selection of images or the annotation process.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address potential biases in the dataset?
2. Can the procedure be adapted to other languages with similar characteristics to Polish?
3. How do the authors plan to make the dataset publicly available, and what are the plans for future updates and maintenance?
