Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on the dual tasks of extracting links between argument components and classifying types of argument components. The authors introduce a joint model based on a Pointer Network architecture to simultaneously solve these tasks. The model is evaluated on two separate evaluation corpora, achieving state-of-the-art results on both.
Main Contributions
1. Joint Pointer Network Model: The authors propose a joint model that simultaneously extracts links between argument components and classifies their types, achieving state-of-the-art results on two corpora.
2. Pointer Network Architecture: The authors modify the Pointer Network architecture to handle the task of link extraction and type classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling the sequential nature of argument components.
3. Experimental Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation on two corpora, comparing their model with several baseline models and demonstrating its superiority.
Strengths
1. State-of-the-art Results: The joint model achieves state-of-the-art results on both corpora, demonstrating its effectiveness in argumentation mining.
2. Novel Architecture: The modified Pointer Network architecture is a novel contribution, demonstrating its potential in modeling complex sequential relationships.
3. Thorough Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation, providing a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Contextual Understanding: The model relies on pre-defined features and does not explicitly model contextual relationships between argument components.
2. Dependence on Pre-processing: The model assumes that argument components have already been identified, which may not always be the case in real-world applications.
3. Limited Generalizability: The model is evaluated on two specific corpora, and its generalizability to other datasets and domains is unclear.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of relying on pre-defined features and explore more contextual understanding of argument components?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the model's performance on different types of argument components and links?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the model to handle more complex argumentation structures and relationships?
