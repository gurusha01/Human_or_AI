Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces a novel approach to word embeddings, representing words as multimodal distributions formed from Gaussian mixtures. This allows for the capture of multiple distinct meanings, entailment, and uncertainty information. The authors propose an energy-based max-margin objective to learn the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model, using an expected likelihood kernel as the energy function. The model is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including word similarity and entailment tasks, and is shown to outperform existing methods.
