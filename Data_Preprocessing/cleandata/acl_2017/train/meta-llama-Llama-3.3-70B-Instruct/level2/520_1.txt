Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces a novel framework called SHAPEWORLD for evaluating multimodal deep learning models with respect to their language understanding and generalization abilities. The framework generates artificial data according to the experimenter's specifications, allowing for control over the content of the data during training and evaluation. The authors demonstrate the potential of their methodology by evaluating a multimodal architecture on four different tasks, showing that the framework provides insights into the model's capabilities and limitations.
Main Contributions
1. Introduction of the SHAPEWORLD framework: A novel framework for evaluating multimodal deep learning models, allowing for control over the content of the data during training and evaluation.
2. Automatic generation of artificial data: The framework generates artificial data according to the experimenter's specifications, reducing the need for manual data annotation and allowing for infinite availability of data.
3. Evaluation of a multimodal architecture: The authors demonstrate the potential of their methodology by evaluating a multimodal architecture on four different tasks, showing that the framework provides insights into the model's capabilities and limitations.
Strengths
1. Control over data generation: The framework allows for control over the content of the data during training and evaluation, enabling the creation of tasks that require generalization abilities.
2. Infinite availability of data: The automatic generation of artificial data reduces the need for manual data annotation and allows for infinite availability of data.
3. Insights into model capabilities: The framework provides insights into the model's capabilities and limitations, enabling the identification of areas for improvement.
Weaknesses
1. Limited complexity of microworlds: The current implementation of the framework uses simple microworlds, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
2. Limited evaluation of the framework: The authors only evaluate a single multimodal architecture on four tasks, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the full potential of the framework.
3. Need for further development: The framework is still under development, and additional work is needed to integrate new datasets and enhance the language generation module.
Questions to Authors
