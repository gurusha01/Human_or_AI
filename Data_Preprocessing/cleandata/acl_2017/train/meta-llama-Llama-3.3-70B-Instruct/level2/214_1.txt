Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema, which integrates the primary-secondary relationship at both micro and macro levels. The authors argue that recognizing the primary-secondary relationship is crucial for discourse structure analysis and has been largely ignored in recent studies. They annotate 97 news wire articles based on the proposed schema and evaluate the corpus resource on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition tasks.
Main Contributions
1. Macro-micro unified discourse structure representation schema: The authors propose a novel schema that integrates the primary-secondary relationship at both micro and macro levels, providing a more comprehensive understanding of discourse structure.
2. Annotation of a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB): The authors annotate 97 news wire articles based on the proposed schema, creating a valuable resource for discourse structure analysis.
3. Evaluation of the corpus resource: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of the representation schema and corpus resource on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition tasks, demonstrating its usefulness for discourse structure analysis.
Strengths
1. Novel approach to discourse structure analysis: The paper proposes a new approach to discourse structure analysis, which integrates the primary-secondary relationship at both micro and macro levels.
2. Comprehensive annotation scheme: The authors provide a detailed annotation scheme, which includes the primary-secondary relationship, discourse relations, and paragraph segments.
3. Evaluation of the corpus resource: The authors evaluate the effectiveness of the representation schema and corpus resource, demonstrating its usefulness for discourse structure analysis.
Weaknesses
1. Limited scope of the annotation: The annotation is limited to 97 news wire articles, which may not be representative of other genres or domains.
2. Subjectivity of annotation: The annotation process is subjective, and the authors acknowledge the difficulty in achieving high consistency among annotators.
3. Imbalanced distribution of relations: The authors note that the distribution of relations in the corpus is imbalanced, which may affect the performance of the models.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limited scope of the annotation and expand the corpus to other genres or domains?
2. How do the authors plan to improve the consistency of the annotation process and reduce subjectivity?
3. How do the authors plan to address the imbalanced distribution of relations in the corpus and improve the performance of the models?
