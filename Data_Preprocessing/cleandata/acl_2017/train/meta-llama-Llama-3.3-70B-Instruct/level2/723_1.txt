Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel framework for morpheme segmentation, called MORSE, which uses both orthographic features and semantic information to segment words into morphemes. MORSE is the first approach to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. The authors also introduce a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to evaluate the performance of morpheme segmenters in a more accurate and meaningful way.
Main Contributions
1. MORSE framework: The paper introduces a new framework for morpheme segmentation that combines orthographic features with semantic information, using word representations and difference vectors to evaluate morphological relationships.
2. SD17 dataset: The authors create a new dataset, SD17, which is designed to evaluate the performance of morpheme segmenters in a more accurate and meaningful way, taking into account the compositionality of morphemes.
3. State-of-the-art results: MORSE achieves state-of-the-art results on the Morpho Challenge dataset and outperforms other approaches, including Morfessor, on the SD17 dataset.
Strengths
1. Effective use of semantic information: MORSE effectively uses semantic information to improve morpheme segmentation, which is a significant improvement over previous approaches that rely solely on orthographic features.
2. Robustness to over-segmentation: MORSE is robust to over-segmentation, which is a common problem in morpheme segmentation, and achieves better results on words that are not compositional.
3. Flexibility and adaptability: MORSE can be easily adapted to different languages and tasks, and its hyperparameters can be tuned to control precision and recall.
Weaknesses
1. Limited vocabulary size: MORSE is limited to a vocabulary size of 1M, which can lead to suboptimal performance on languages with productive morphology.
2. Greedy inference approach: The greedy inference approach used in MORSE can lead to wrong segmentations, and a more optimal approach may be needed to improve performance.
3. Concatenative morphology limitation: MORSE is limited to concatenative morphology, which can limit its efficacy on languages that include non-concatenative morphology.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to address the limitation of MORSE to concatenative morphology, and what approaches do you think could be used to extend it to non-concatenative morphology?
2. Can you provide more details on the computational optimization of the training stage, and how you plan to make MORSE more efficient and scalable?
3. How do you think MORSE could be adapted to other tasks, such as lemmatization or stemmer, and what potential applications do you see for this framework?
