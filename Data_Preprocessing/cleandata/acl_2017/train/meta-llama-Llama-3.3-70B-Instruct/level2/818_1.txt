Summary of the Paper
This paper presents a novel approach to acquiring trivial physical knowledge from unstructured natural language text. The authors focus on acquiring relative physical knowledge of actions and objects organized along five dimensions: size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed. They frame knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two closely related problems: learning relative physical knowledge of object pairs and physical implications of actions when applied to those object pairs. The authors propose a model that can infer relations over grounded object pairs together with first-order relations implied by physical verbs. They also develop a new dataset, VERBPHYSICS, that compiles crowd-sourced knowledge of actions and objects.
Main Contributions
1. Introduction of a new task of commonsense knowledge extraction from language, focusing on physical implications of actions and relative physical relations among objects.
2. Proposal of a model that can infer relations over grounded object pairs together with first-order relations implied by physical verbs.
3. Development of a new dataset, VERBPHYSICS, that compiles crowd-sourced knowledge of actions and objects.
Strengths
1. The paper presents a novel approach to acquiring physical knowledge from natural language text, which has the potential to improve language understanding and reasoning.
2. The authors propose a model that can jointly infer relative physical knowledge of object pairs and physical implications of actions, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches.
3. The paper includes a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model, including experiments on both frame prediction and object pair prediction tasks.
4. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including ablation studies to identify the most important components of the model.
Weaknesses
1. The paper assumes that the crowd-sourced knowledge is accurate and reliable, which may not always be the case.
2. The model relies on a limited set of attributes (size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed), which may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of physical knowledge.
3. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the model can be extended to handle more complex physical knowledge or to incorporate additional attributes.
4. The evaluation of the model is limited to a specific dataset (VERBPHYSICS), which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of noise in the crowd-sourced knowledge, and what measures can be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data?
2. Can the model be extended to handle more complex physical knowledge, such as knowledge about materials, textures, or temperatures?
3. How do the authors plan to incorporate additional attributes or dimensions into the model, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of doing so?
4. Can the model be applied to other domains or tasks, such as computer vision or robotics, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of doing so?
