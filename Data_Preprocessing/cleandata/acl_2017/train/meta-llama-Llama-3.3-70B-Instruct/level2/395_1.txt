This paper proposes DRL-Sense, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for learning multi-sense word representations. The main claims of the paper are: (1) DRL-Sense jointly learns a word sense selection module and a sense representation module using reinforcement learning, (2) it implements non-parametric learning for word sense induction and exploration for word sense selection, and (3) it achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark contextual word similarity tasks and synonym selection datasets.
The support for these claims is provided through extensive experiments on various datasets, including SCWS, ESL-50, RD-300, and TOEFL-80. The results show that DRL-Sense outperforms existing multi-sense word representation models, including clustering methods, probabilistic models, and retrofitting methods. The paper also provides qualitative analysis of the learned sense embeddings, demonstrating that they capture different senses of words and can be used for downstream NLP tasks.
The usefulness of the proposed approach is evident in its ability to learn high-quality sense embeddings that can be used in various NLP applications, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the proposed model, including its architecture, training procedure, and hyperparameter settings, making it easy to reproduce and extend the results.
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, citing relevant works and discussing the limitations of existing approaches. The proposed approach is novel and significant, as it addresses the challenging problem of word sense ambiguity using a reinforcement learning framework. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thoroughly conducted, making it a strong contribution to the field of NLP.
