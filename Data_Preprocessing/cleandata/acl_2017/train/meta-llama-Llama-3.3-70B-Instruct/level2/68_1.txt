Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a new approach to assessing the readability of Vietnamese text. The authors create a large corpus of 996 documents, categorized into three levels of difficulty, and use it to develop a new formula for predicting text readability. The formula is based on features such as average sentence length, average word length, and percentage of difficult words. The authors evaluate the performance of the formula using cross-validation and report an accuracy of over 80% in predicting the readability of Vietnamese text.
Main Contributions
1. Creation of a large corpus: The authors create a large and reliable corpus of Vietnamese text, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Development of a new formula: The authors develop a new formula for predicting text readability, which is based on a combination of features such as average sentence length, average word length, and percentage of difficult words.
3. Evaluation of the formula: The authors evaluate the performance of the formula using cross-validation and report an accuracy of over 80% in predicting the readability of Vietnamese text.
Strengths
1. Large and reliable corpus: The authors create a large and reliable corpus of Vietnamese text, which is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
2. Comprehensive evaluation: The authors evaluate the performance of the formula using cross-validation, which provides a comprehensive assessment of its accuracy.
3. Practical applications: The formula has practical applications in areas such as education, publishing, and government, where assessing the readability of text is crucial.
Weaknesses
1. Limited features: The authors only examine a limited set of features, such as average sentence length, average word length, and percentage of difficult words.
2. Lack of comparison: The authors do not compare their formula with existing formulas for assessing text readability.
3. Limited domain: The corpus is limited to general text and does not cover specific domains such as technical or scientific text.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to extend their work to cover specific domains such as technical or scientific text?
2. How do the authors plan to compare their formula with existing formulas for assessing text readability?
3. What are the potential applications of the formula in areas such as education, publishing, and government?
