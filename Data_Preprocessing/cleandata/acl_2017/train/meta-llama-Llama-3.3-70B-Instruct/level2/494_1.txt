This paper proposes a novel method called morph-fitting, which improves word vector spaces by injecting morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints. The method is language-agnostic and does not require curated knowledge bases or gold lexicons. Instead, it uses simple language-specific rules to extract morphological constraints, which are then used to fine-tune the word vector space.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. Morph-fitting improves the quality of word vector spaces, especially for low-frequency words and morphologically rich languages.
2. The method is robust and effective across different languages and vector space models.
3. Morph-fitting boosts the performance of downstream language understanding models, such as dialogue state tracking.
The support for these claims is provided through extensive experiments on four languages (English, German, Italian, and Russian) and various vector space models. The results show that morph-fitting consistently improves the performance on word similarity tasks and dialogue state tracking.
The usefulness of the proposed method is evident in its ability to improve the performance of language understanding models, especially for morphologically rich languages. The method is also practically useful as it does not require expensive resources or curated knowledge bases.
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, citing relevant literature and providing a clear overview of the related work. The methodology is well-explained, and the experiments are thoroughly conducted.
The novelty of the work lies in its ability to exploit morphological richness as a source of inexpensive supervision for fine-tuning vector spaces. The paper also provides a new dataset, Morph-SimLex, which can be used to evaluate the performance of word vector spaces on morphological relations.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged, and the authors suggest future work on exploring other potential sources of morphological knowledge and porting the framework to other languages and downstream tasks.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the contributions are significant. The strengths of the paper include:
1. The proposed method is novel and effective in improving word vector spaces.
2. The experiments are thorough and provide strong evidence for the claims.
3. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field and provides a clear overview of the related work.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. The method may not be effective for languages with very simple morphology, such as English.
2. The paper could benefit from more analysis on the types of morphological relations that are captured by the method.
3. The authors could provide more details on the computational resources required for the method.
Questions to the authors:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the framework to other languages and downstream tasks?
2. Can the authors provide more analysis on the types of morphological relations that are captured by the method?
3. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the method for languages with very simple morphology?
