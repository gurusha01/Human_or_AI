Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel framework for zero-resource neural machine translation (NMT) by leveraging a teacher-student approach. The method assumes that parallel sentences have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language and uses a pre-trained pivot-to-target model to guide the learning process of a source-to-target model without parallel corpora. The paper introduces two teaching methods: sentence-level and word-level, and evaluates their performance on the Europarl and WMT corpora.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Framework: The paper proposes a new framework for zero-resource NMT that leverages a teacher-student approach to transfer knowledge from a rich-resource language pair to a zero-resource language pair.
2. Sentence-Level and Word-Level Teaching: The paper introduces two teaching methods, sentence-level and word-level, to guide the learning process of the student model.
3. Experimental Results: The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed methods on the Europarl and WMT corpora and shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art pivot-based and multilingual methods.
Strengths
1. Effective Knowledge Transfer: The paper demonstrates effective knowledge transfer from the teacher model to the student model, resulting in significant improvements in translation quality.
2. Flexibility: The proposed framework can be applied to different language pairs and corpora, making it a flexible solution for zero-resource NMT.
3. Improved Decoding Efficiency: The paper shows that the proposed method can improve decoding efficiency by avoiding the error propagation problem in pivot-based approaches.
Weaknesses
1. Assumption Limitations: The paper's assumption that parallel sentences have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language may not always hold, which could limit the applicability of the method.
2. Computational Complexity: The paper's method requires additional computational resources to train the teacher model and guide the learning process of the student model.
3. Limited Evaluation: The paper's evaluation is limited to two corpora, and further evaluation on other corpora and language pairs is needed to fully assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the assumption that parallel sentences have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and how it compares to other zero-resource NMT methods?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the evaluation of the proposed method to other corpora and language pairs?
