Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel architecture for neural machine translation, called Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation (DCNMT), which learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder that translates at the character level. The model consists of six recurrent neural networks and is able to learn the representation of morphemes and the rules of how they are combined. The authors evaluate their model on English-to-French, English-to-Czech, and Czech-to-English translation tasks and show that it achieves a high translation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art neural machine translation models.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Architecture: The paper proposes a novel architecture for neural machine translation that learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder.
2. Efficient Training: The model is able to efficiently train a deep character-level neural machine translation model, achieving higher performance than other character-level models.
3. Learning Morphology: The model is able to learn the representation of morphemes and the rules of how they are combined, which is useful for translating misspelled or nonce words.
Strengths
1. High Translation Performance: The model achieves a high translation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art neural machine translation models.
2. Efficient Training: The model is able to efficiently train a deep character-level neural machine translation model, which is a significant improvement over other character-level models.
3. Ability to Translate Misspelled or Nonce Words: The model is able to translate misspelled or nonce words, which is a significant advantage over word-level models.
Weaknesses
1. Complexity of the Model: The model consists of six recurrent neural networks, which may make it more difficult to train and tune.
2. Limited Evaluation: The model is only evaluated on three language pairs, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness on other language pairs.
3. Comparison to Other Models: The model is only compared to a limited number of other models, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art models.
Questions to Authors
1. How does the model handle out-of-vocabulary words that are not seen during training?
2. Can the model be used for other natural language processing tasks, such as speech recognition and text summarization?
3. How does the model compare to other state-of-the-art neural machine translation models in terms of translation performance and efficiency?
