Summary of the Paper
This paper investigates the use of sentiment analysis on annual disclosures of companies (10-K reports) to forecast volatility in the stock market. The authors propose a novel approach that combines state-of-the-art information retrieval term weighting models with word embeddings to analyze the sentiment of the reports. They also explore various methods to fuse the text features with factual market features, such as historical prices and GARCH models. The experiments demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in volatility prediction.
Main Contributions
1. Novel Sentiment Analysis Approach: The authors propose a new sentiment analysis approach that leverages state-of-the-art information retrieval term weighting models and word embeddings to analyze the sentiment of 10-K reports.
2. Effective Fusion of Text and Market Features: The authors explore various methods to combine text features with factual market features, including early fusion, late fusion, and multi-kernel learning.
3. Analysis of Sector-Specific Risk Factors: The authors investigate the characteristics of each individual sector with regard to risk-sensitive terms and demonstrate that reports in the same sectors share particular risk and instability factors.
Strengths
1. Improved Volatility Prediction: The authors' approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in volatility prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in long-term volatility forecasting.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of their approach using various metrics, including r2 and MSE, and compare their results with existing methods.
3. Insights into Sector-Specific Risk Factors: The authors provide valuable insights into the characteristics of each individual sector, highlighting the importance of considering sector-specific risk factors in volatility prediction.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Data: The authors note that the size of the available data in each sector is limited, which may affect the performance of their approach.
2. Computational Complexity: The authors mention that the multi-kernel learning approach has high computational complexity, which may be a limitation for large-scale applications.
3. Ambiguity in Word Senses: The authors highlight the issue of ambiguity in word senses, which can affect the accuracy of their approach.
