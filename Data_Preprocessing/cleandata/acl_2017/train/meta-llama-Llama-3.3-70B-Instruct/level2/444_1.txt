Summary of the Paper
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation methodology for the task of ghostwriting rap lyrics, which involves generating text that is similar in style to a target artist but distinct in content. The authors develop a manual evaluation methodology that assesses fluency, coherence, and style matching, as well as an automated evaluation methodology that captures uniqueness and stylistic similarity. They also create a dataset of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for style matching, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of an LSTM-based ghostwriter model.
Main Contributions
1. A comprehensive manual evaluation methodology for ghostwriting rap lyrics, which assesses fluency, coherence, and style matching.
2. An automated evaluation methodology that captures uniqueness and stylistic similarity, which is fully automated and replicates the results of a previously proposed semi-automatic method.
3. A dataset of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for style matching, which can be used as a gold standard for future experiments.
Strengths
1. The paper presents a thorough and comprehensive evaluation methodology for ghostwriting rap lyrics, which addresses multiple aspects of the task.
2. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including correlations between different metrics and insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the LSTM-based ghostwriter model.
3. The paper highlights the importance of complementary evaluation methods for capturing different aspects of the ghostwriting task.
Weaknesses
1. The paper assumes that the LSTM-based ghostwriter model is a suitable baseline for evaluation, which may not be the case for other models or approaches.
2. The automated evaluation methodology relies on a specific implementation of the rhyme density metric, which may not be generalizable to other datasets or tasks.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the evaluation methodology and potential avenues for future research.
Questions to Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting in the LSTM-based ghostwriter model, which is highlighted in the results?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the annotation process for style matching, including the criteria used to select annotators and the level of agreement between annotators?
3. How do the authors envision the evaluation methodology being used in practice, and what are the potential applications of the ghostwriting task in music and other creative industries?
