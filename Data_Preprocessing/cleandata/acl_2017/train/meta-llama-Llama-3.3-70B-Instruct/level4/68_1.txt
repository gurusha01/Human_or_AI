The paper has several strengths, notably its expansion of readability score applications to the Vietnamese language, resulting in a well-validated score. 
However, it also exhibits weaknesses, primarily in its relevance to the ACL field, where readability scores have limited significance, offering more utility in education and public communication. Additionally, the writing contains multiple minor grammatical errors. A further concern lies in the comparison of PDS1 and PDW1 features from previous work, where it remains unclear how the previous readability measures perform in practical terms relative to the new measure.
A more substantial contribution could be made if the corpus and associated labels were made publicly available, enhancing the paper's suitability for inclusion. This would facilitate broader applications beyond scalar readability metrics, such as exploring more advanced feature-selection methods.
