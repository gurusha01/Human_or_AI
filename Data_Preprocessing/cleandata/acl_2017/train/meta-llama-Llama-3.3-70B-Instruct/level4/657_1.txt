This paper partially addresses the challenge of interpreting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models used for categorizing written justifications in values-affirmation essays, which is a compelling research question. The authors' intention to leverage approaches from experimental psychology and validate sociological assumptions is noteworthy. 
However, a significant weakness of the paper is the lack of clarity in its objectives. The overarching goal of utilizing experimental psychology approaches to interpret LSTMs is ambitious, yet the methodology to achieve this is not clearly outlined. Alternatively, if the aim is to validate sociological assumptions, it would be more effective to examine the relationships between gender markers and written justifications independently of any model. The claim regarding expected gender differences as a function of theories of gendered self-construal is not substantiated by the study.
The study, although interesting, is marred by several weak arguments. The correlation between the probability shift of a token in the LSTM network and the corresponding SVM coefficients does not conclusively prove that these probabilities are a valid means of interpreting the model. This is because SVM coefficients only partially reveal the decision function of an SVM classifier, and a correlated coefficient in one model does not necessarily provide an explanation in another. Moreover, the correlation coefficients are not sufficiently high to support the point being made.
A significant issue with the paper is the authors' apparent indecision between two objectives, which would be better addressed by clearly stating and developing a single goal. Regarding the connection to experimental psychology, a crucial aspect of the paper, it would be beneficial to elaborate on and provide a clearer explanation of the multilevel Bayesian models used to quantify gender-based self-construal assumptions. Without more detailed information, it is challenging to assess the appropriateness of the methodology employed, which is a critical component of the method that warrants further elaboration.
