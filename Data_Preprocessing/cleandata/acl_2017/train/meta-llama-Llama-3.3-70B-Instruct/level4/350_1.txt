Strengths:
The proposed approach demonstrates an improvement over the current state-of-the-art, and its methodology may have potential applications in other domains.
Weaknesses:
The method lacks significant novelty, and it is unclear whether the dataset used is sufficiently generalizable to be applicable in other domains.
General Discussion:
This paper presents a rule-based approach for generating additional weakly labeled data for event extraction, which consists of three primary stages. Initially, it leverages Freebase to identify crucial slot fillers for matching sentences in Wikipedia, as utilizing all slot fillers would be too restrictive, resulting in an insufficient number of matches. Subsequently, it employs FrameNet to enhance the reliability of labeling trigger verbs and to identify nominal triggers. Finally, it utilizes multi-instance learning to address the noise in the generated training data.
One of the notable aspects of this paper is its ability to improve upon the state-of-the-art on a non-trivial benchmark. The rules involved are relatively transparent, making it a potentially useful resource for practitioners seeking to enhance information extraction systems in other domains. However, some manual effort is still required, such as mapping Freebase event types to ACE event types, as mentioned in Section 5.3, line 578. This necessity for manual intervention also creates challenges for future work to establish a direct comparison with this paper. Moreover, the method's lack of novelty is a concern.
Other comments:
I am also concerned about the generalizability of this method to other domains. As stated in Section 2, line 262, 21 event types are selected from Freebase, but the selection criteria and coverage of the 33 event types in the ACE data are unclear.
The paper is generally well-written, although there are some suggestions for improvement. For instance, in Section 3.1, line 316, the phrase "arguments liked time, location" could be rephrased to "arguments, such as time and location," to enhance clarity. Additionally, there are minor typos, such as the missing "that" in line 357, but these are not major concerns.
