Review
Strengths:
The paper provides a clear description of its methods and evaluation, effectively utilizing and interpreting various assessments to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed technique in real-world interactive topic modeling. The approach successfully leverages the anchor words algorithm, enhancing it with the introduction of constructed anchor pseudowords.
Weaknesses:
Notable weaknesses include the lack of discussion on related work concerning anchor words, the less-than-ideal choice of the 20 Newsgroups dataset for evaluation, and a relatively small theoretical contribution. The evaluation could be strengthened by comparisons with more recent and relevant studies.
General Discussion:
The authors introduce Tandem Anchors, a novel method for interactive user specification of topics, building upon the anchor words algorithm. By replacing individually inferred anchors with constructed anchor pseudowords, the approach achieves improved classification accuracy and facilitates faster, more effective interactive iteration. The user study demonstrates the ease and effectiveness of multiword anchors for users. While the technical contribution is modest, the thorough evaluation justifies its presentation as a full paper. However, the absence of ideas for constructing facets without convenient sources and the reliance on the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which may not be ideal for topic modeling due to document length variability and preprocessing challenges, are notable limitations.
The evaluation methodology, particularly the use of classification tasks, could be enhanced by considering alternative datasets or tasks that more closely align with common applications of topic models, such as corpus exploration. Furthermore, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive review of related work, including comparisons with recent studies on anchor-based topic inference and anchor selection processes.
Several specific points warrant clarification or further consideration, including the computational efficiency of the approach, the choice of operators for constructing pseudowords, and the preprocessing of the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of the implications of the results for understanding confusion in topic modeling would be valuable.
Overall Assessment:
Despite its limitations, the paper presents a meaningful contribution to interactive topic modeling, offering a straightforward yet beneficial modification to an existing algorithm. Its thorough evaluation and potential for facilitating more effective and engaging interactive topic modeling experiences make it a worthwhile contribution to the field. With addressing the noted weaknesses and incorporating a broader range of related work, the paper's impact could be further enhanced.
