The paper presents several notable strengths, including:
1) The introduction of a semi-automated framework for constructing a compositional semantic similarity evaluation data set, which leverages a human generation phase, followed by automatic expansion and subsequent human post-editing.
2) The successful application of this framework in creating a Polish compositional semantic similarity evaluation data set, a valuable resource for the development of future Polish compositional semantic models.
However, several weaknesses are also apparent:
1) The framework's limitations are highlighted by its testing on only a single language, raising concerns about its portability and applicability to other languages, particularly given its reliance on a dependency parser that may not be universally available or effective.
2) The evaluation of the automatic expansion framework is hindered by the lack of reporting on the number of sentence pairs edited by leader judges, and the significant proportion (over 3%) of post-edited pairs requiring further editing raises questions about the framework's accuracy and efficiency.
3) The presence of numerous grammatical errors throughout the paper, such as those found on lines 210, 212, 213, and 428, underscores the need for a thorough proofreading process to ensure the clarity and professionalism of the presentation.
Overall, these points warrant further consideration and refinement to strengthen the paper's contributions and impact.
