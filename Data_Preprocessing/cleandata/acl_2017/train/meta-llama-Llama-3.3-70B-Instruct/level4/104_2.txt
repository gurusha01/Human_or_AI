This paper tackles the challenge of disambiguating and linking textual entity mentions to a background knowledge base, specifically English Wikipedia. Although the title and introduction may be somewhat exaggerated, as bridging text and knowledge encompasses more than the Entity Disambiguation and Linking (EDL) task, EDL is indeed a crucial component. The proposed method employs an intermediate representation layer, namely mention senses, which involves a two-step process: (1) mapping mentions to mention senses, and (2) mapping mention senses to entities. The approach learns various embedding representations for words, mention senses, and entities, which are jointly trained to optimize a single objective function.
From a technical standpoint, the approach is relatively clear and aligns with current deep processing trends and best practices for embeddings. While alternative methods could be suggested, it is unclear whether they would yield significantly better results. My comments focus on the fundamental approach, which raises questions about the necessity of a two-step process involving mention senses. The paper does not provide a clear explanation for why this approach is superior to a direct one-step mapping from word mentions to entities, as seen in the ALIGN algorithm proposed by Yamada et al. Although Table 2 shows that the two-step MPME and its simplification SPME perform better, the exact difference and additional information provided by the mention senses compared to the entities are not clearly explained.
To clarify, the profiles for entities consist of neighboring entities in a relatedness graph, which is built by examining word-level relatedness in entity definitions (Wikipedia pages). These profiles are extended skip-gram-based embeddings. In contrast, word profiles are based on standard distributional semantics without sense disambiguation. Mention sense profiles, on the other hand, employ standard distributional semantics with sense disambiguation, which is performed using a sense-based profile (language model) derived from local context words and neighboring mentions. However, the creation and differentiation of senses are not thoroughly explained, leaving questions about how senses are defined and how many senses a mention string can have.
If the sense collection's definitional profiles are built using entity text as seed words, it is essential to understand what information is used at the mention sense level that is not used at the entity level. Is it merely the words in the texts that reliably associate with the mention sense but do not occur in the equivalent entity webpage in Wikipedia? How many such words are there, on average, for a mention sense? This raises questions about the necessity of maintaining this extra differentiation information in a separate space (the mention sense space) rather than incorporating it into the entity space.
The paper's claim that it is the first work to address mention ambiguity in integrating text and knowledge representations is inaccurate. The TAC KBP evaluations have hosted EDL tasks for the past two years, involving multiple systems performing this task against Freebase, a larger and noisier knowledge base than Wikipedia. A positive aspect of the paper is the introduction of the smoothing parameter in Section 6.4.2, which is a valuable contribution.
After reviewing the authors' responses, I remain unsatisfied with their justification for dismissing the relevance of the KBP evaluation. The goodness of embeddings can only be truly evaluated through their application, and conceptual elegance is secondary to performance. The question remains: does the proposed embedding approach perform better than alternatives?
