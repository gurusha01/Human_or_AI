This manuscript presents a rule-based methodology for extracting time expressions, leveraging the observation that such expressions are typically concise and contain at least one time token. The approach involves a multi-step process: initially, time tokens are identified through a combination of dictionary lookup, regular expression matching, and part-of-speech tagging information. Subsequently, the time segment is expanded outward from the time token based on a predefined set of heuristic rules until a boundary is reached. Finally, these time segments are consolidated into a single time expression according to another set of rules. The evaluation of this methodology, benchmarked against both rule-based and machine learning-based systems across three datasets, demonstrates significant performance enhancements.
- Strengths:
The manuscript is well-structured and clearly articulated, with rules that are empirically grounded and justified by the evaluation outcomes.
- Weaknesses:
The paper suffers from certain underspecifications that hinder the reproducibility of the results, as detailed below.
- General Discussion:
* In Section 4.1, the reference to "5 seasons" is unclear; consideration of seasonal references like Ramadan or Holiday Season would be beneficial.
* Section 5.1 contains an inconsistency, referring to "two benchmark datasets" instead of the correct "three datasets".
* An illustrative example lacking a time token in Section 5.2 would provide additional clarity.
* Given that 93% of expressions contain time tokens and the system has achieved a 92% recall rate, suggesting it is nearing the performance ceiling, the authors should elaborate on their strategy for further improvement.
* There is also a need to clarify whether there are plans to make the comprehensive set of rules or the software utilized in this study publicly available.
