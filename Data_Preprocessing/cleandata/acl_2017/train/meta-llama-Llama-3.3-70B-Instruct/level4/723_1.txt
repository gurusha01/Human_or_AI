This paper presents a compelling approach to morphological segmentation using word embeddings, where the system leverages these embeddings to assess both local semantic similarity between word pairs with potential morphological relationships and global information regarding the semantic validity of possible morphological segment types. The work is well-structured and extends earlier semantically driven morphological segmentation methods in a meaningful way.
Experiments were conducted on the Morpho Challenge dataset for English, Turkish, and Finnish, languages that exhibit diverse levels of morphological complexity. Training was performed on Wikipedia text for all systems. The proposed MORSE system demonstrated significant improvements in F1-score for English and Turkish when compared to the Morfessor baseline. However, it failed to surpass Morfessor's performance for Finnish, likely due to the richness of Finnish morphology leading to data sparsity and reduced word embedding quality. To address this, incorporating sub-word information into word embeddings, as seen in works such as those by Cao and Rei, and Bojanowski et al., could enhance performance for languages like Finnish.
The authors also critique the existing Morpho Challenge datasets, highlighting issues such as incorrectly segmented words and segmentations that, while historically valid, are no longer semantically motivated. In response, they introduce a new dataset comprising 2000 semantically motivated English word form segmentations from Wikipedia, on which MORSE shows substantial improvements over Morfessor.
In summary, this paper is well-written and presents competitive results in the area of semantically driven morphological segmentation. The inclusion of code and a new dataset with the submission significantly enhances its value, making it a notable contribution to the field.
