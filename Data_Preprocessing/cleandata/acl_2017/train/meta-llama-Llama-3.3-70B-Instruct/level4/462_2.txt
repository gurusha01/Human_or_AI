Strengths:
* The paper explores a novel approach to forecasting volatility by analyzing sentiment signals in companies' annual 10-K filing reports.
* The authors employ a comprehensive methodology, utilizing information retrieval term weighting models seeded with a finance-oriented sentiment lexicon and expanded with word embeddings, followed by PCA and Support Vector Regression for similarity estimation.
* The inclusion of non-text-based market features, such as sector information and volatility estimates, adds depth to the analysis.
* The evaluation of multiple fusion methods to combine text features with market features is a notable strength.
Weaknesses:
* The paper could benefit from additional experimental conditions to further validate the results, such as a simple trigram SVM without prior sentiment lexica and features reflecting delta-IDFs scores for individual features.
* The absence of binary features as a baseline condition is a notable omission.
General Discussion:
This study investigates the use of sentiment signals in companies' annual 10-K filing reports to predict volatility, leveraging a range of techniques including information retrieval term weighting models, word embeddings, PCA, and Support Vector Regression. The authors also incorporate non-text-based market features and evaluate various fusion methods to combine text and market features. To further enhance the research, considering additional experimental conditions and baseline features, such as those suggested above, would be beneficial. Furthermore, referencing relevant studies, like the one found at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57d6/29615c19caa7ae6e0ef2163eebe3b272e65a.pdf, could provide additional context and support for the findings.
