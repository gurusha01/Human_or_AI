This paper presents a well-structured and coherent narrative, making it easily comprehensible. The organization is clear, and the research questions are addressed through a series of targeted experiments.
However, one of the limitations of this work is its lack of significant novelty. The concept of the "first sentence" heuristic has been well-established in the summarization literature for a considerable amount of time. The current work applies an evolved version of this heuristic to keyword extraction, which, although not trivial, does not substantially contribute to the field in terms of new ideas.
Another weakness is the absence of a comparison with very recent, state-of-the-art methods. The experimental evaluation against strong baselines provides some insight into the system's performance but does not convincingly demonstrate its superiority over the current state-of-the-art. This omission somewhat diminishes the paper's impact.
In general, the paper is of good quality, and I recommend its publication and presentation. Nevertheless, to strengthen their work, the authors should contextualize their system's performance relative to other recent studies, such as Martinez-Romo et al.'s SemGraph approach, which shares notable similarities with the proposed method, and Le et al.'s work on unsupervised keyphrase extraction. By doing so, the authors can provide a more comprehensive understanding of their contribution to the field.
