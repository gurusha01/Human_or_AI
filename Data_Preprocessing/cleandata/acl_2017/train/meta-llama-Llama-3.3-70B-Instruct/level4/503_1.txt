This paper presents a challenging evaluation, as it contains some valuable and redeeming technical contributions, particularly the parsing algorithm, but ultimately lacks coherence and unity. The authors attempt to unify their work around a overarching framework that treats a language's probabilistic nature as a formal property analogous to closure under intersection. However, in my opinion, this concept of probabilistic formal languages has not been rigorously developed, which undermines the compellingness of this viewpoint.
It is worth noting that the technical results presented are largely independent of the paper's narrative weaknesses, indicating that the research itself is not flawed, but rather the presentation is. Consequently, this paper requires significant revision to strengthen its argument and clarity.
I find it surprising that the paper's organization devotes insufficient space to elaborating on the parsing result, relegating crucial aspects such as soundness and completeness to supplementary notes. Furthermore, the title's reference to probabilistic languages is misleading, as the submission lacks actual probabilistic reasoning.
Additionally, I believe the significance of the intersection-closure result in section 3 is overstated. Unless there are specific restrictions on the right-hand sides of rules that I am not aware of, this result appears to be a straightforward consequence of incorporating a finite intersection into the set of non-terminal labels, and further clarification would be necessary to fully appreciate its impact.
