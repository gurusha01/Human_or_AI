The authors propose a novel formula for evaluating the readability of Vietnamese texts, which is derived from a multiple regression analysis incorporating three key features. Additionally, they have created and annotated a new text corpus, categorizing texts into three readability levels: easy, middle, and hard.
Investigations into languages beyond English are both intriguing and crucial, particularly for low-resource languages. As such, the developed corpus could serve as a valuable resource for future research, although it appears that the authors do not intend to make it publicly available. However, in its current form, the paper falls short of being persuasive and is unlikely to significantly impact future research. The following concerns underpin this assessment:
- The authors fail to provide a compelling rationale for the development of a new readability formula, given the existence of two preceding formulas for Vietnamese that utilize similar features. It is essential to elucidate the drawbacks of these existing formulas and demonstrate the superiority of the newly proposed formula.
- The experimental section is notable for its lack of comparative analysis with prior work and insufficient discussion of the results. The authors claim an accuracy of 81% for their formula on their corpus, deeming it "satisfactory for practical application." A comprehensive evaluation should include comparisons with existing formulas, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages relative to the new proposal.
- A detailed analysis of the results is also absent, such as an examination of the word, sentence lengths, and frequency of challenging words that the model categorizes as easy, middle, or hard.
- Incorporating a few illustrative examples of how the formula could be applied in real-world scenarios would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
- The related work section primarily serves as a background, focusing on previously published formulas without providing a broader discussion of relevant research. Incorporating seminal works like DuBay (2004) on "The principles of readability" or Rabin (1988) on "Determining difficulty levels of text written in languages other than English" could enrich the section.
- Given that Vietnamese is a syllable-based language, it is crucial to understand how the authors define and extract "words" for their study. Do they employ a specific method for syllable merging, and if so, what is the accuracy of this approach?
- Overall, the paper's content, including experiments, comparisons, analysis, discussion, and related work, is insufficient for a lengthy publication.
Additional observations include:
- The language used throughout the paper requires improvement.
- The notation in equations is inconsistent, particularly regarding the use of parentheses and multiplication operators.
- The related works section exhibits inconsistency in the capitalization of first letters.
