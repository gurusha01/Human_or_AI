Summary
This manuscript explores the identification of a latent sentiment dimension in word embeddings through an empirical investigation.
Strengths
 S1) The study addresses the complex issue of unsupervised sentiment analysis, a notable challenge in the field.
 S2) The visualization presented in Figure 2 is particularly effective in conveying the results.
Weaknesses
 W1) The experimental component of the study is limited and would benefit from additional metrics, such as F1 score, and a broader comparison of techniques to enhance its robustness.
 W2) The methodology section requires further clarification and organization, as the tested concepts, although listed, lack sufficient justification and explanation.
 W3) The reported results exhibit modest accuracy and depth of analysis, suggesting that the work may require further development, especially in validating the core assumption that the Distributional Hypothesis leads to the separation of antonymous words in the vector space, despite their semantic similarity.
