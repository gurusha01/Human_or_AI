The paper exhibits several strengths, including its overall clarity of writing, notwithstanding a few areas that require improvement as outlined below. The problem addressed is pertinent, and the proposed multigraph-based model, a variant of MH, demonstrates solidity in its empirical results.
However, several weaknesses were identified. 
1. Section 3 would benefit from an explicit discussion on the limitations of the previous MH model, highlighting the motivations behind the development of the new approach.
2. The introduction of separators in Section 4 lacks clear justification, particularly regarding the additional information they convey beyond what is already provided by T/I/O.
3. Section 5.1 fails to offer meaningful insights into the superiority of the new model.
4. The discussion in Section 5.2 is overly abstract, making it difficult to discern the advantages of the new model over MH. Providing concrete examples of spurious structures would enhance understanding.
In general, while the paper introduces a novel model for detecting overlapping entities in text, which shows improvement over the previous state-of-the-art MH model in experiments on several benchmark datasets, it falls short in clearly explaining why and how the new model achieves this superiority.
