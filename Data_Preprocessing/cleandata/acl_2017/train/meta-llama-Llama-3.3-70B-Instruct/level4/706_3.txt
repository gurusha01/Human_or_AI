Strengths:
This paper presents a unique and innovative approach, tackling a fascinating task with creative ideas. The combination of indirect supervision, where the resulting parse is accepted, and direct supervision, where a definition is provided, yields a robust method for interactively developing a natural language interface to a programming language. The proposed approach has a broad spectrum of potential applications, making it a valuable contribution.
Weaknesses:
The manuscript requires thorough proofreading due to the presence of numerous typos, language errors, and apparent omissions, such as the incomplete text at the end of section 6. Engaging a native English speaker for a meticulous review would significantly enhance the paper's clarity and readability.
General Discussion:
The paper introduces a collaborative method for naturalizing a core programming language through community-driven, incremental syntax expansion. This process is interactive, allowing users to input commands in a naturalized language and then either select from a list of potential parses or provide definitions in natural language. Notably, users can offer intuitive definitions using literals instead of variables (e.g., "select orange"), making this approach accessible to non-programmers. The method involves the incremental induction of a grammar that facilitates the generation of candidate parses. Following the review, I have considered the authors' response.
