The paper presents a novel task of selecting the most suitable textual description for a given scene or image from a set of similar options, accompanied by proposed baseline models, evaluation metrics, and human evaluation scores.
- Strengths:
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand. The contributions are well-supported by empirical evidence, rendering the paper highly readable. The motivation behind the paper is also well-established, as the proposed method for selecting the most appropriate caption from a list of misleading candidates has the potential to benefit other image-caption and image-understanding models by serving as a post-generation re-ranking method.
- Weaknesses:
However, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for generating decoys is questionable, which raises concerns about the paper's validity. The algorithm selects decoys based on similar representation and surface form that do not belong to the same image. Nevertheless, this approach has a fundamental flaw: not belonging to image A does not necessarily mean it is not an appropriate description for image A, especially when the representation and surface form are similar. This issue casts doubt on the validity of the ground-truth labels. As illustrated in Figure 1, the generated decoys are either too dissimilar to be considered good decoys or are fair substitutes for the target, which undermines the algorithm's effectiveness.
Consequently, I am concerned that the dataset generated using this algorithm may not be able to train a model to truly go beyond keyword recognition, as claimed in the paper. Most decoys can be filtered out based on keyword mismatches, and when they cannot be separated by keyword matching, they appear to be tempting correct options. Furthermore, the fact that humans only achieved an accuracy of 82.8% on a sampled test set raises questions about the difficulty of the examples or the quality of the decoys.
- General Discussion:
In summary, this is a well-written paper with clear motivation and substantial experiments. However, the primary concern lies in the data-generating algorithm and the resulting dataset, which do not seem to align with the paper's motivation. This, in turn, makes the experimental conclusions less convincing. Unless my concerns are fully addressed in the rebuttal, I am inclined to reject this paper.
