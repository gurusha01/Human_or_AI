Strengths:
The methodologies presented in this paper offer significant advantages in terms of memory conservation and enhanced decoding speed on central processing units (CPUs), achieving this without substantial performance degradation.
Weaknesses:
A critical aspect that warrants further exploration is the determination of convolutional codes in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3, as this directly influences the ultimate performance of the model. Furthermore, the claim in the Abstract that the proposed model achieves translation accuracies comparable to softmax, while significantly reducing memory usage and improving CPU decoding speed, lacks rigor. Specifically, experiments conducted on the ASPEC corpus with "Binary" and "Hybrid-512" settings demonstrate a decoding speed improvement of up to x20, but the corresponding BLEU scores are notably low, rendering the conclusion drawn from these experiments invalid.
General Discussion:
This manuscript introduces an innovative prediction approach for neural machine translation, characterized by the prediction of binary codes for each word to simplify the prediction process. The authors propose an enhanced method utilizing error-correcting binary codes to boost prediction accuracy and a hybrid softmax/binary model to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. The proposed methodologies are capable of conserving memory and accelerating decoding without compromising performance, making this a commendable paper.
