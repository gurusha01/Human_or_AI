This manuscript proposes a graph-based method for generating sense-disambiguated synonym sets from a collection of undisambiguated sets. The authors assess their approach by deriving these sets from Wiktionary and Russian dictionaries, then comparing pairwise synonymy relations (using precision, recall, and F1) against WordNet and BabelNet for English, or RuThes and Yet Another RussNet for Russian.
The paper is well-written and structured, with clear and easy-to-follow experiments and evaluations. The methodology is sound, and the analysis of results is cogent. Initially, I had concerns, such as the mismatch in vocabulary between synonym dictionaries and gold standards, which were addressed in the later sections.
However, I am concerned that the authors may not have fully understood previous work, which undermines the paper's motivation. For instance, OmegaWiki is incorrectly lumped with Wiktionary and Wikipedia as resources with "undisambiguated synonyms" due to its lack of formal structure. In reality, OmegaWiki uses a relational database based on word senses, making its translations, synonyms, and semantic annotations unambiguous.
A more significant misunderstanding arises in the discussion of BabelNet and UBY. The paper claims both rely on English WordNet as a pivot for mapping existing resources, criticizing this approach as "error-prone." Although BabelNet does use WordNet as a pivot, UBY does not. UBY is a general-purpose specification for representing lexical-semantic resources and links between them, existing independently of any given resource, including WordNet. The criticisms of UBY are therefore misplaced.
I also believe that at least one criticism of BabelNet is not entirely justified. The authors imply that Watset may be superior due to BabelNet's error-prone mapping and machine translation. However, this claim seems grandiose and unsupported by the study's results or the authors' prior knowledge of similarity-based sense linking and graph clustering algorithms.
The last paragraph of ยง1 and the first two paragraphs of ยง2 should be revised to focus on the general problem of generating synsets by sense-level alignment/translation of LSRs, rather than specifically on BabelNet and UBY. It would be helpful to note that alignment/translation methods can produce synsets or enrich existing ones, but this is not always an explicit goal.
Furthermore, the paper criticizes TWSI of JoBimText for including too many hypernyms, co-hyponyms, etc., instead of synonyms. However, it is unclear whether this problem is unique to TWSI and JoBimText or if Watset also struggles with this issue. Quantitative evidence comparing the two would be beneficial.
Some minor points that require attention include:
* The sentence about Kiselev et al. (2015) seems unnecessary and could be removed.
* The pun on "wat" in the sentence about discovering the correct word sense is unclear and could be reworded or replaced with a more straightforward explanation.
* Figure 2 and Tables 3, 4, and 5 are difficult to read due to small font sizes and could be improved with larger fonts or abbreviations.
* The date of the Wiktionary database dump used should be specified to facilitate replication or comparison.
* The constant switching between Times and Computer Modern fonts is distracting and could be resolved by removing the times package and replacing it with newtxtext and newtxmath or mathptmx.
