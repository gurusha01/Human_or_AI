Strengths:
* The paper has the potential to provide a valuable resource
* It raises several noteworthy points
Weaknesses:
* Limited awareness of related research (as discussed below)
* The feasibility of the authors' goal of domain-independent microplanning is uncertain (as explored below)
* The suitability of crowdsourced texts for this purpose is questionable (as examined below)
General Discussion:
This paper presents an interesting concept and a potentially valuable resource, and I am largely sympathetic to its objectives. However, I have several high-level concerns that are not addressed in the paper, which I hope the authors will address in their response.
(1) I was surprised by the frequent references to Wen 2016, a relatively unknown paper. It would be more effective for the authors to justify their work by comparing it to well-established corpora, such as those listed in Section 2. Additionally, there are numerous NLG projects that have investigated microplanning issues in verbalizing DBPedia, including a 2016 workshop with multiple papers on NLG and DBPedia (https://webnlg2016.sciencesconf.org/ and http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/3500), as well as prior work by Duboue and Kutlak. I would like to see a more comprehensive awareness of other research on NLG and DBPedia, rather than a primary focus on Wen (2016).
(2) Microplanning is often highly dependent on the domain or genre, as pronoun usage varies significantly between novels and technical manuals, for instance. This is why many studies have focused on domain-dependent resources. Consequently, there are legitimate questions about the theoretical possibility of training a "wide-coverage microplanner." The authors do not discuss this concern, and it is essential that they demonstrate an understanding of this issue.
(3) I am concerned about the quality of the crowdsourced texts. Many individuals may not write clearly or effectively, which raises doubts about the suitability of gathering example texts from random crowdsourcers to create a training corpus for microplanners. The ultimate goal of microplanning is to produce readable texts. Imitating human writers, as this paper and most learning approaches to microplanning do, is reasonable if we can assume that the human writers have produced well-written, easy-to-read texts. However, this assumption is questionable when the writers are random crowdsourcers, rather than professional journalists, for example.
From a presentation perspective, the authors should ensure that all text in their paper adheres to the ACL font size criteria. Some of the text in Fig 1 and, particularly, Fig 2 is extremely small and difficult to read; it should be the same font size as the text in the body of the paper.
Initially, I will rate this paper as borderline. I look forward to the authors' response and will adjust my rating accordingly.
