Strengths:
The manuscript presents a methodology that surpasses preceding approaches, yielding a state-of-the-art outcome. 
In terms of data utilization, the method leverages a combination of market and textual data. 
The approach employs word embeddings to determine the weight of each lexical term, further extending this to similar terms within the document, thus enhancing its efficacy.
Weaknesses:
It is well-established that deep learning-based methodologies can achieve commendable performance in sentiment analysis with minimal feature engineering. 
A more comprehensive literature review to compare with related studies would be beneficial, as the current approach primarily enhances performance through feature-based methods without introducing substantial novelty in either the model or the proposal of new features.
General Discussion:
The manuscript outlines an approach to sentiment analysis, distinguishing itself through the use of word embeddings to weight lexical terms, a relatively novel technique. 
However, the overall novelty of the approach is not sufficiently significant, suggesting a need for further innovation to distinguish it more markedly from existing methodologies.
