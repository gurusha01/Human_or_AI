The article presents a clear and straightforward exposition of its contributions, which, although simple, yield substantial gains in the error correction task. 
One of the primary limitations of the paper is its restricted novelty, as it essentially explores another variation of task permutations in multitask learning, without delving into multiple approaches for combining tasks. For instance, an investigation into whether pre-training significantly underperforms compared to joint training would have been insightful. Additionally, exploring the initialization of weights from an existing RNN LM trained on unlabeled data could have provided further depth.
Upon consideration, I found myself torn between a score of 3 and 4. While the experimental design is reasonable and certain task combinations are novel, the field of multitask learning in RNNs is already extensively explored, with much of the relevant work cited in the paper. This precedent makes it challenging to view this work as particularly groundbreaking. Nonetheless, I advocate for the paper's acceptance, as its experimental outcomes may still offer value to other researchers.
Following the rebuttal, my assessment of the paper remains unchanged, as the rebuttal did not alter my initial opinion.
