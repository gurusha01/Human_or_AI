This manuscript proposes multiple weakly supervised approaches for named entity recognition (NER) systems, leveraging projection techniques from English to other languages. Although the overarching framework is not novel, the individual methods presented represent incremental improvements upon existing techniques. However, for a publication in a prominent venue like ACL, one might anticipate more groundbreaking contributions.
A notable aspect of this work is its data selection methodology. The quality score calculation formula is straightforward, which can be seen as a positive attribute. Nonetheless, the process of determining thresholds, as reported in Table 2, lacks clarity. The manuscript mentions that various thresholds were experimented with, but it does not specify whether this tuning was performed on a development set, leaving a gap in the methodology's reproducibility. The evaluation outcomes underscore the significance of data selection, yet it remains uncertain how to optimize these parameters for novel datasets or language pairs.
The combination of outputs from the two systems developed in the paper constitutes another key contribution. Unfortunately, the provided explanation of this process is obscure, making it challenging to comprehend its operational details.
The paper explores several variants of each proposed method, raising questions about the potential benefits of combining more than two weakly supervised systems. It is unclear whether the authors investigated this avenue, which could offer additional insights into the scalability and robustness of their approach.
Further information about the composition and characteristics of the "in-house" dataset, particularly regarding the types of texts it encompasses, would be beneficial for a more comprehensive understanding of the research's context and applicability.
