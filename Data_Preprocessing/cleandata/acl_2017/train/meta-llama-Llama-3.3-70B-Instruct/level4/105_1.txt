Strengths:
The concept of hard monotonic attention introduces a fresh and distinct perspective, deviating significantly from existing approaches.
Weaknesses:
The experimental outcomes for morphological inflection generation yield mixed results. The proposed model demonstrates efficacy when training data is limited, such as in the case of CELEX, and when alignments are predominantly monotonic with reduced context sensitivity, as observed in languages like Russian, German, and Spanish.
General Discussion:
This paper presents a novel neural architecture for morphological inflection generation, leveraging "hard attention" and character alignments derived through a Bayesian transliteration method. This approach diverges substantially from preceding state-of-the-art neural models, which employ "soft attention" by concurrently solving character alignment and conversion within a probabilistic framework.
The underlying idea is both innovative and well-founded. The paper's clarity and comprehensive experimentation are notable strengths. However, a key concern is that the proposed methodology may not universally surpass existing standards under all conditions. Its suitability is particularly pronounced for tasks characterized by mostly monotonic alignments and less context-dependent phenomena. To enhance the paper's persuasiveness, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the practical advantages of the proposed method, including its implementation simplicity and computational efficiency.
