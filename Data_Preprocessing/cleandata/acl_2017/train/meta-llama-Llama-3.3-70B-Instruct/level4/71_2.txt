Strengths:
- The paper leverages a remarkably comprehensive resource, demonstrating significant potential for cross-lingual learning across a multitude of languages.
- The system's fully automatic nature is a notable advantage, particularly in the context of processing 282 languages and linking them to an English knowledge base.
- The evaluation methodology is robust, with assessments conducted both within and outside the Wikipedia framework, and includes a thoughtful comparison to previous works that relied on manual resources.
Weaknesses:
- There is room for improvement in terms of the paper's clarity and overall organization.
General Discussion:
This submission outlines a framework that is both straightforward and effective in extracting names from a vast array of languages and linking them to an English knowledge base. A key strength of the system is its fully automatic operation, which is crucial for cross-lingual learning on such a large scale. The authors successfully contextualize their results, providing a comprehensive evaluation that extends beyond Wikipedia and offering a nuanced comparison with prior research that utilized manual resourcesâ€”a practice that reflects good scientific rigor.
However, enhancing the paper's clarity would significantly improve its readability. Given the complexity of the process and the scale of the resource generated, the writing challenge is considerable. Unfortunately, the current structure of the paper can make it feel like a detailed list at times, which detracts from the overall flow. It would be beneficial for the authors to reorganize the paper, potentially starting with a clearer definition of the problem and high-level motivations from the outset. Additionally, more transparent exposition of the motivations, decisions, and contributions throughout the paper would add depth. While the authors have made laudable efforts in this direction, further refinement could elevate the presentation of this important work.
In conclusion, the paper offers a valuable resource and contributes meaningfully to the field. With some revisions to address the organizational and clarity issues, it would be even more effective in conveying its significant contributions. As such, it deserves consideration for presentation at ACL 2017.
