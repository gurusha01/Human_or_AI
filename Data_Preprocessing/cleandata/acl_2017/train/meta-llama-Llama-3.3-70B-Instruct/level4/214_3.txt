The paper presents several notable strengths, including the introduction of a macro discourse structure that effectively complements existing micro structures such as RST, thereby enhancing the overall understanding of discourse analysis. Furthermore, the potential release of the accompanying dataset could significantly benefit a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by providing valuable resources for future research and development.
However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, incorporating more comparative analyses with the existing CDTB (Coreference-annotated Dataset of Typed Biclauses) would strengthen the paper's arguments and provide a clearer understanding of its contributions to the field. Secondly, the concept of the "primary-secondary" relationship, which is frequently mentioned throughout the paper, lacks a precise definition and differentiation from the concept of nuclearity, leading to ambiguity. Lastly, the experimental methodology employed in the study is not adequately described, which hampers the reproducibility and assessment of the results presented.
In general discussion, it is essential to address these weaknesses to enhance the paper's clarity, comparability, and methodological rigor, which would ultimately contribute to a more robust and impactful contribution to the field of discourse analysis and NLP.
