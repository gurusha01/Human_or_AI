This paper proposes a novel approach to training a zero-resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system, leveraging training data from a pivot language. Unlike existing methods, which often employ a two-step decoding process inspired by Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the authors utilize a teacher-student framework. In this framework, the teacher network is trained on pivot-target language pairs, while the student network is trained on source-pivot data and the teacher network's predictions of the target language.
The paper's strengths lie in its promising results and the presentation of multiple sets of results that validate the authors' assumptions, demonstrating the potential of their approach.
However, several weaknesses need to be addressed before the paper is ready for publication. 
1. Crucial information is missing: The training and decoding processes within the proposed framework are not clearly described. The equations provided do not fully capture the approach, and the use of examples could enhance clarity. Additionally, the methodology behind Monte Carlo sampling is not explicitly stated.
2. Organization: The paper's structure is not well-organized, with results fragmented across multiple subsections. The presentation of tables is confusing, with references to tables out of order, making it challenging to follow the results.
3. Inconclusive results: The results section fails to provide conclusive evidence, as the comparisons made by the authors can be attributed to the small corpus size (621) used in their methods.
4. Redundant information: While the elaboration on assumptions is appreciated, dedicating an entire section and experimental results to this aspect seems excessive.
In the general discussion, several points require clarification:
- The comparison of loss from different loss functions, as stated on page 578, raises questions about validity.
- The notation in Section 3.2 is unclear, particularly the meaning of script(Y) and the derivation of p(y|x), which is not explained.
- Equation 7 lacks explanation and could potentially be removed.
- Specific details, such as the approach used (mentioned on page 320), and the correct year (potentially 2016, as mentioned on page 392), need clarification.
Minor corrections include:
- Page 742: "import" should be "important".
- Page 772: The citation style should be adjusted to inline citations.
- Page 778: The phrase "can significantly outperform" could be rephrased for clarity.
- Page 275: Assumption 2 requires rewriting for better understanding, specifically in relation to the similarity between target sentences derived from different sources.
