The paper proposes a multigraph-based approach for identifying potentially overlapping entities, where multiple edges can connect two nodes.
Strengths:
The problem addressed is intriguing, particularly in scenarios where entities intersect, making it challenging to determine which entity is being referenced in a given text. Although the empirical results do not demonstrate a significant impact, the technique appears to be effective. The authors' discussion on efficiency compared to a previous system is commendable. The paper is generally well-written, but some minor details require further refinement (see minor remarks below).
Weaknesses:
The problem's motivation is lacking. For instance, why is it crucial to detect "China" as an entity within "Bank of China"? While there is a point to be made for intersecting entities, the use case for nested entities is unclear. This could be better motivated to pique the reader's interest. Regarding the approach, essential details are missing: what criteria are used to include or exclude an edge? In lines 229-233, multiple options for the I^k_t nodes are mentioned, but it is unclear which edges should be present.
The empirical evaluation shows marginal improvements over previous approaches, but the effect size is unclear. Is a two percentage point improvement in F_1 score significant? How many critical entities are discovered that were not found by previous methods? Furthermore, how would a simplistic dictionary-based method or a commercial system like Google's NLP cloud perform on the datasets? This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results.
The result discussion could be improved by emphasizing the performance on intersecting entities, which is a more interesting subset of overlapping entities than nested ones. How many more intersecting entities are detected compared to previous methods? Which ones were missed, and why? Is the performance improvement due to better nested detection or also detecting intersecting entities? A general error discussion comparing errors made by the suggested system and previous ones would strengthen this section.
General Discussion:
While the problem of named entity recognition is interesting, the motivation for recognizing nested entities is unclear. The paper does not shed light on this point in the evaluation. Discussing errors and advantages with example cases and emphasizing results on intersecting entities compared to other approaches could have been more convincing. Therefore, the enthusiasm for the paper is lukewarm, with a slight tendency towards rejection, as it seems like another attempt without emphasizing the important question of intersecting entities.
Minor remarks:
- The first mention of a multigraph could benefit from a brief description for readers unfamiliar with the concept.
- The phrase "previously noted by... many previous" sounds odd.
- The sentence "Solving this task" is unclear; which task is being referred to?
- The use of italics for "e.g." is unnecessary.
- The statement "time linear in n" may not be significant when n represents sentence length; whether it is linear or cubic may not matter.
- The term "spurious structures" is unclear in the introduction.
- The phrase "regarded as a chunk" could be rephrased for clarity.
- "NP chunking" should be expanded to "noun phrase chunking" for readers who may not be familiar with the abbreviation.
- The sentence "Since they set" is unclear; who is being referred to?
- There is a typo: "pervious" should be "previous".
- The reference "of Lu and Roth~(2015)" could be formatted consistently with other references.
- In sentences with small numbers, it is preferable to spell them out instead of using numerals.
- The term "state" in the context of a (hyper-)graph is unclear; later, "state" seems to be used analogously to "node".
- Commas should be added after enumeration items at the end of page 2, and a period should be added after the last item.
- The concept of "child nodes" in a hypergraph is unclear.
- Figure 2 is not immediately clear as a hypergraph, especially in black and white printing. The use of colors and gray nodes/edges is unclear, and it is not obvious how the highlighted edges were selected.
- The example in Figure 2 could be improved by explaining why both entities should be detected and how this differs from simply knowing the longer entity.
- The notation for denoting entities is inconsistent, sometimes using brackets and sometimes not.
- Footnotes should be placed after punctuation marks, not directly in front of them.
- Footnote 2 mentions a missing edge but does not explain how it was determined that this edge should be missing.
- The sentence "on whether the separator defines..." is unclear; how was this determined?
- The mention of "the mention hypergraph" could be clarified.
- The last paragraph before section 4.1 mentions representing the entity separator CS but does not explain how the CS-edge is chosen algorithmically.
- A comma should be added after Equation 1 for clarity.
- The phrase "to find out" sounds odd and could be rephrased.
- The sentence "we extract entities.\footnote" could be improved for clarity.
- The phrase "we make two" sounds odd; a more conventional phrase such as "we conduct" could be used instead.
- The remark in footnote 3 about nested vs. crossing entities could be clarified with examples.
- The sentence "the combination of states alone does not" is unclear; what is being referred to?
- The phrase "the simple first order assumption" is unclear; what assumption is being made?
- The sentence "In the previous section" could be rephrased for clarity.
- The phrase "we see that our model" could be more accurately stated as "we have demonstrated" or "we have shown".
- The sentence "used in this experiments" should be "used in these experiments".
- The phrase "each of these distinct interpretations" could be rephrased for clarity.
- The sentence "published on their website" could be improved by specifying whose website.
- The sentence "The statistics of each dataset are shown" is clear but could be shortened.
- The phrase "allows us to use to make use" is redundant; "to use" could be omitted.
- The sentence "tried to follow as close..." could be rephrased as "tried to use the features suggested in previous works as closely as possible".
- The reference "Following (Lu and Roth, 2015)" should be rephrased as "Following Lu and Roth (2015)" to avoid using references as nouns.
- The phrase "using the BILOU scheme" could be clarified.
- The sentence "highlighted in bold" could be improved by discussing the effect size.
- The claim of "significantly better" results could be supported by discussing the effect size.
- The sentence "In GENIA dataset" should be "On the GENIA dataset" for clarity.
- The statement "outperforms by about 0.4 points" may not be significant; the term "outperform" might be an overstatement.
- The sentence "that the GENIA dataset" could be clarified.
- The phrase "this low recall" is unclear; which recall is being referred to?
- The sentence "due to an insufficient" could be rephrased for clarity.
- Table 5 shows F_1 scores that seem similar, making the claim of "outperform" questionable.
- The sentence "is more confident" could be clarified; why does this increase recall?
- The phrase "converge than the mention hypergraph" is unclear; what is being compared?
- The references list could be formatted consistently, with paper titles either all lowercase or all title case.
