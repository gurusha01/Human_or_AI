This paper presents a novel approach to constructing dialogue agents that engage in symmetric collaborative tasks, which require strategic communication to achieve a shared objective. 
I find this paper intriguing, particularly in its exploration of data-driven techniques for dialogue management. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the proposed method may not be uniquely tailored to symmetric collaborative tasks, but rather to tasks that can be represented as graph operations, such as identifying the intersection of objects known to both parties.
The introduction of the symmetric collaborative dialogue setting in Section 2.1 is noteworthy, yet it builds upon existing research, including the work of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (Cognition '86) and Walker's furniture layout task (Journal of Artificial Research '00).
On line 229, the authors suggest that their domain is too complex for slot-value semantics. Nevertheless, given that their domain relies on attribute-value pairs, it could potentially utilize a semantic representation based on attribute-value pairs, such as first-order logic.
Section 3.2 proves challenging to follow, with frequent references to Figure 2, which unfortunately does not provide sufficient clarity. For instance, in Section 3.1, it is unclear at what point in the dialogue the example is intended to represent, or whether it remains relevant after the query "anyone went to Columbia?"
