This paper's key strengths lie in its successful extension of A* CCG parsing to incorporate dependency information while preserving efficiency and tractability, a notable achievement. The precomputation of attachments is a clever technique that enhances the approach. The evaluation of head-rules' impact on normal-form violations is commendable, and further insights into the remaining cases would be valuable.
However, there are some weaknesses that warrant attention. A more thorough examination of specific dependency structures, particularly coordination and relative clauses, is necessary. It is crucial to investigate how these structures are handled when the predicate-argument structure of CCG conflicts with the dependency structures commonly employed by other dependency parsers.
Overall, this work is a significant contribution to the field, and I am pleased with its quality. To further enhance the paper, I suggest a more detailed analysis of the constructions that exhibited the most substantial improvement in both English and Japanese. Additionally, a discussion reconciling predicate-argument dependencies with those of other parsers would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach, addressing the potential discrepancies between CCG's predicate-argument structure and the dependency structures used by other parsers.
