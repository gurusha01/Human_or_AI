The manuscript presents a compelling and ambitious endeavor to explore the various relationships between lexical items, offering a well-reasoned justification for transcending traditional analogy testing. 
However, a notable limitation of the paper is its failure to provide a clear rationale or contextualization for the selection of clustering as an evaluation method, as opposed to a classification task, which is generally more straightforward to assess. Furthermore, the authors do not attempt to interpret the overall performance level of the results, leaving unanswered questions regarding human performance on this task when given only the words without context.
I have reviewed the authors' response to my initial comments.
