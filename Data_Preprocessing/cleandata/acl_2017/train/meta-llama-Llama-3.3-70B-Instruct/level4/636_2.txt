The paper's primary advantage lies in its potential to achieve a significant speed boost while maintaining equivalent accuracy levels.
However, the presentation of the proposed approach is lacking in clarity. Specifically, Sections 3 and 4 require substantial improvement, from the definition of key concepts to the explanation of the architecture and parameterization. Notably, Section 4.1 and the parameter tying mechanism, which is a major contribution of the paper, need to be elucidated in a more transparent and concise manner.
Further experimental evidence is necessary to substantiate the claimed substantial speed enhancements. Although the results presented in Table 2 are satisfactory, they are not particularly impressive, with a speed-up of 4-6X being somewhat underwhelming.
In the broader context, the term "Viterbi prediction" is not well-established and may be unclear to readers, who may only be able to make an educated guess as to its meaning; a more precise and descriptive phrase would be beneficial. Additionally, there is a typographical error in the reference to Weiss et al., 2015.
