Strengths
This manuscript addresses the challenge of determining word polarity orientation in an unsupervised manner, leveraging word embeddings.
Weaknesses
Although the paper proposes an intriguing and valuable concept, its current form lacks application to a specific test case. The underlying ideas are described in an intuitive sense, but a more rigorous justification is needed.
General Discussion
The work presented is certainly noteworthy. To further enhance the paper, additional experiments should be conducted, and comparisons with existing methods, such as the Normalized Google Distance approach employed by researchers like Balahur and Montoyo (2008), would be beneficial. Moreover, applying the acquired knowledge to a real-world sentiment analysis scenario would strengthen the study. Currently, the research, despite its promise, remains in its preliminary stages.
