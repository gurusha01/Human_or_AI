This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to enhancing zero pronoun resolution performance, with key contributions including: 
1) a straightforward method for automatically generating a large-scale training dataset for zero pronoun resolution tasks; 
2) a two-step learning process that effectively transfers knowledge from large datasets to specific domain data; 
and 3) a differentiation strategy for unknown words using distinct tags. The paper is well-structured, and the experiments are meticulously designed.
However, several questions arise regarding the identification of zero pronoun antecedents: 
1. When the predicted word is a pronoun, how is its antecedent determined? The proposed method involves matching the head of noun phrases, but it is unclear how this approach handles cases where the head word is not a pronoun.
2. What happens when the predicted word is a noun that does not appear in the preceding context?
3. Given the system's impressive performance on standard datasets, it would be interesting to evaluate its effectiveness in a two-stage process: 
first, assessing the model's ability to predict and recover dropped zero pronouns; 
and second, evaluating its performance in identifying antecedents.
Further clarification on the choice of attention-based neural networks would be beneficial, as a brief explanation of the rationale behind this decision would provide valuable insights for fellow researchers.
A minor suggestion: in Figure 2, consider using labels s1, s2, etc., instead of d1, d2, etc.
Overall, this is an outstanding paper that showcases innovative ideas and a robust experimental setup, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
