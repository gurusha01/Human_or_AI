This manuscript introduces a pioneering parser for UCCA, a novel meaning representation framework. The parser employs a transition-based approach, utilizing a bespoke transition set to effectively handle complex discontinuous structures and reentrancies. Experimental results confirm the parser's efficacy and highlight the challenges of constructing these representations on top of existing parsing methodologies.
The paper is well-structured and engaging, addressing a significant problem in the field. The proposed transition system is well-justified and demonstrates promising performance. The authors have conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation, exploring various classifier options for the base parser and comparing outcomes with other existing, albeit less expressive, parsing formulations. This work establishes a high standard for UCCA parsing and is likely to be of interest to researchers exploring other expressive meaning representations and complex transition systems.
One aspect that warrants further investigation is the extent to which this novel parser encompasses existing transition-based parsers for AMR, SDP, and related frameworks. It would be intriguing to explore whether the UCCA transition scheme could be adapted for these applications, potentially leveraging heuristic alignments, and whether it would learn to disregard unnecessary transitions for non-terminals. Would this approach reduce to an existing algorithm or yield improved performance? While addressing this question is not essential, it would enhance our understanding of the parser's capabilities and potentially reveal avenues for future research.
Upon reviewing the author's response, I find their arguments to be convincing and in agreement with their statements.
