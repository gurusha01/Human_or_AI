This paper presents an extension of the sequence-to-sequence generation approach to dialogue modeling, where the dialogue context is encoded into a context vector and then decoded into a response. However, such models often struggle with generating diverse and specific responses, particularly when trained on large datasets covering multiple topics. To address this, the authors introduce a latent variable, z, which induces a probability distribution over the context, allowing for sampling and greedy decoding to generate responses.
The paper showcases impressive technical proficiency in applying deep learning methods, specifically conditioned variational autoencoders, to response generation, as well as the use of Information-Retrieval techniques to obtain multiple reference responses. 
I have several conceptual comments regarding the introduction, model architecture, and evaluation, which are outlined below:
Comments on the introduction and motivations:
The authors appear to be unfamiliar with the extensive history and various aspects of this field, from both theoretical and applied perspectives.
1. The description of the dialogue manager's role is inaccurate, as it traditionally involves selecting actions in a particular dialogue context, which are then passed to a separate generation module for realization. This is typically done in the context of task-based systems, where the goal is to choose actions that are optimal in some sense, such as reaching a goal in as few steps as possible.
2. The authors fail to clearly distinguish between task-based, goal-oriented dialogue, and chatbots/social bots, which have distinct requirements and often employ different data-driven methods.
3. The concept of "open-domain" conversation is misleading, as conversation is always context-specific and goal-oriented. Coherence is also activity- and context-specific, and humans are not capable of engaging in truly open-domain dialogue.
Comments on the model architecture:
The authors' approach involves inducing a distribution over possible contexts, sampling from this distribution, and generating responses greedily with the decoder. However, this model seems counterintuitive and contradicts evidence from the linguistic and psycholinguistic literature, which suggests that people tend to resolve potential understanding and acceptance issues locally, ensuring a shared context before proceeding with the conversation.
Comments on the evaluation:
The authors aim to demonstrate that their model can generate more coherent and diverse responses. However, the evaluation method appears to address coherence but not diversity, as the precision and recall metrics measure distance between ground truth utterances and generated utterances, rather than between generated utterances themselves.
Furthermore, the increase in BLEU scores is minimal, and it is unclear how frequently the generated responses exhibit diversity and contentfulness. A more meaningful comparison with other work, such as Li et al., which uses different methods to promote diversity, would have strengthened the paper.
