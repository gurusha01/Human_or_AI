The paper exhibits several strengths, including its clarity and well-structured writing. It presents an innovative approach to abstractive sentence summarization, which can be viewed as sentence compression without the constraint of using only input words in the output.
A notable aspect of the paper is its comprehensive comparison with numerous baseline systems, providing a thorough evaluation of the proposed method.
The related work section is also commendable, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the existing literature in the field.
However, there are a few minor weaknesses that can be addressed:
- To provide a more complete picture, it would be beneficial to report the ROUGE F-Score for all three datasets. Although the reason for reporting recall on one dataset is understandable due to the uniform length of summaries, including both recall and F-Score would be more informative.
- Rearranging the paper to introduce the related work section earlier would improve the overall flow and context.
- Adding a discussion on the context and intended application of the summaries or compressions would enhance the paper's significance and relevance, highlighting why they are necessary and how they can be utilized.
In general, while the use of ROUGE as an evaluation metric is suitable for this paper, future work could benefit from incorporating human evaluations to assess the readability, coherence, and overall quality of the compressions, or conducting an extrinsic evaluation to demonstrate their practical applicability.
