This manuscript introduces a novel approach to metaphor identification, leveraging geometric principles. The work is undoubtedly intriguing and offers a fresh perspective. Nevertheless, there are several concerns that require the authors' attention, and I would appreciate their response to the following issues.
- Strengths:
* The geometric approach to metaphor interpretation represents a new and innovative research direction.
* The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
* The authors' assertion that the simplicity of their model is a key strength is well-taken. However, the implications of this simplicity could be more effectively conveyed, as discussed in the weaknesses section.
- Weaknesses:
Regarding writing
---------------
While the paper is generally well-written, a major concern is its clarity. Although the use of poetic language and elegant prose is commendable, scientific writing necessitates precision and lucidity. The importance of clear writing in scientific communication is emphasized in https://chairs-blog.acl2017.org/2017/02/02/last-minute-writing-advice/. My specific objections regarding the writing are:
* The phrase "while providing a method which is effectively zero-shot" is unclear, as the concept of zero-shot learning has not been previously introduced.
* Figure 2 categorizes examples as "most," "neutral," and "least" metaphoric, but the criteria for these distinctions are not provided.
* More information about the data used in the study would enhance the intuitiveness of the method.
* Although the analysis section is engaging, it is unclear why the proposed simple method outperforms existing techniques. Including concrete examples would strengthen this section.
Technicality
============
The authors claim that a key strength of their model is its simplicity, but the implications of this simplicity are not clearly conveyed. While the mathematical and technical definition of the problem is well-articulated, the practical implications of this definition are difficult to discern, particularly given that this simplicity is a primary contribution of the paper. Compared to previous research, the current study demonstrates only marginal improvements in accuracy.
* The comparison to only one previous work and the claim of zero-shot capability may be overstated. It is unclear whether the method can be extended to other domains, such as Twitter.
