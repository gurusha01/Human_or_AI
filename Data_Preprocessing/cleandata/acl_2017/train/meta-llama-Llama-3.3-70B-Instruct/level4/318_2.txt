The paper presents a notable approach by leveraging HowNet to enhance embeddings, yielding intriguing results and a conceptually interesting idea. 
However, a significant concern is whether the contribution substantively justifies the length of the paper. Furthermore, the comparative analysis may be biased, as it would be more meaningful for the authors to benchmark their system against others that utilize manually curated resources to ensure a fair evaluation.
While the paper is generally comprehensible, refining the English would greatly improve its clarity and readability.
