This paper introduces a novel method for evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, enabling the assessment of their performance by error type in terms of both recall and precision. This approach is significant as it overcomes the previous limitation of not being able to evaluate precision by error type due to the lack of error category annotations in system outputs.
The strengths of the paper include:
- The proposed evaluation method is a crucial step forward in analyzing GEC system behavior.
- The paper evaluates a variety of GEC systems, providing a comprehensive overview.
- The approach offers several advantages over previous work, including the computation of precision by error type, independence from manual error annotation, and the ability to assess performance on multi-token errors.
- The automatically selected error tags for pre-computed error spans are largely approved by human experts.
However, there are several weaknesses:
- A critical component, the rules for deriving error types, is not described, which is essential for the replicability and adaptability of the approach.
- The classifier evaluation lacks a thorough error analysis, which is necessary for identifying directions for future improvement.
- The evaluation is limited to English, and it is unclear how challenging it would be to apply the approach to another language.
Regarding the classifier and its evaluation, it is unclear how the error categories were established. The rules for assigning error types are not provided, making it difficult to understand the basis of the classification. The approach's independence from the alignment algorithm is noted, but the rules likely depend on it, and their description is necessary for transparency.
The paper's limitation to English is a significant concern. The approach's applicability to other languages is not explored, and the necessary adaptations for such an extension are not discussed. The language-specific nature of the rules for determining edit boundaries and error tags suggests that these would need to be adjusted for other languages, but the effort required for this is not estimated.
The error spans computed in the pre-processing step appear to be continuous, which may not accurately capture all types of errors, such as those requiring discontinuous edit spans. For instance, in German, verbs with separable prefixes can be separated in the main clause, posing a challenge for the classifier's ability to tag such errors accurately.
The evaluation of the classifier by human judges shows a high approval rate for automatically assigned error tags, but this judgment may be influenced by the noise introduced by automatic edit extraction. The evaluation methodology could be improved by assessing how human judges rate the classifier output when boundaries are manually created, thus eliminating the noise from faulty boundaries.
The comparison between gold and auto references is unclear, particularly regarding the significance test. It is mentioned that there is a mismatch between automatic and reference alignments and classifications, but the comparison seems to be only in terms of boundaries, not classification.
The error type evaluation reveals that some systems failed to correct specific error types, but it is not analyzed whether these systems were designed to handle such errors. For example, the inability of some systems to correct unnecessary token errors can be explained by their design and approach. The results in Table 6 should be accompanied by raw values for true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to facilitate comparison using other measures.
The paper concludes that all but two teams achieved the best score in at least one category, suggesting that different approaches to GEC complement different error types. This finding is in line with previous research and highlights the importance of diverse approaches in GEC.
The analysis of multi-token errors is useful for future work but requires more interpretation. Some systems may be inherently unable to correct such errors, and none of the systems were trained on a parallel corpus of learner data and fluent corrections.
Finally, the authors should note that for some GEC approaches, it was not impossible to provide error annotations before, especially for systems with submodules for specific error types. However, the proposed approach enables a unified comparison of GEC systems, including those for which producing error-tagged output is not straightforward.

In response to the author, while the approach is not fatally flawed, the paper is not ready for publication due to significant gaps, particularly in the description of the rules for classifying errors and the lack of consideration for generalization to other languages. These aspects are crucial for the approach's replicability, adaptability, and applicability beyond English.
