Review:
- Strengths:
  * The approach is knowledge-lean and language-independent, which is a notable advantage.
- Weaknesses:
  * The task and setting presented are unconventional and somewhat limiting.
  * The improvements over the existing work, W_Emb (Fu et al, 2014), are minimal.
  * There is a significant amount of unnecessary content, which wastes space.
  * The language used is not always clear, leading to confusion.
- General Discussion:
This paper bears a strong resemblance to the work by Fu et al (2014), with only slight enhancements. It suffers from redundancy, such as the repetition of related work in sections 1 and 2, and includes uninformative figures, like the comparison between Figure 1 and Figure 2. Additionally, the descriptions of MLP and RNN are not particularly useful. A more concise paper might have been more effective.
The task proposed seems peculiar and is only beneficial if a method for identifying all and only the hypernyms of a given word already exists, which appears to rely on the work by Fu et al (2013).
Regarding Figure 4, it is unclear why the first two stars are connected by conjunction and the last two by disjunction. Furthermore, the output "1" (dark star) when all three inputs are "0" (white stars) is puzzling.
In section 4.2, lines 587-589 suggest that thresholds may have been tuned on the test data, which raises concerns.
The explanation of W_Emb (lines 650-652) is inadequate.
Certain sections, such as "Combined with Manually-Built Hierarchies" and section 4.4, are difficult to understand. The significance of the red and dashed lines is also unclear.
