Strengths:
The manuscript is well-structured and provides a comprehensive comparison of its methodology with existing approaches. The authors demonstrate awareness of the limitations of their results, particularly with regards to the mean F values.
Weaknesses:
The paper contains some minor typographical errors and repetitive sentences. Overall, condensing sections 1 and 2 would allow for a more in-depth exploration of sections 3 and 4. Furthermore, the primary objective of the study is not clearly defined, which may be attributed to the ambiguity of the paper's aims.
General Discussion:
The layout of Table 1 would be improved by reducing it to a single column, whereas figures 3, 5, and 6 would benefit from being expanded to a two-column width. Initially, the paper was challenging to follow, and significant enhancements could be made by reorganizing and streamlining the content to improve clarity.
