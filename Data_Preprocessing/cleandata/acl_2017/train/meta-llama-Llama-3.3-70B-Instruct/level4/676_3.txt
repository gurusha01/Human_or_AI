Strengths:
This manuscript presents a novel approach to word prediction, offering a fundamentally distinct methodology that surpasses the efficiency of traditional softmax layers while maintaining comparable performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. The potential impact of this approach is substantial, as it could significantly accelerate prediction speeds. The paper is well-structured and enjoyable to read, with clear diagrams that facilitate understanding, particularly when cross-referencing models with Table 2. The inclusion of loss curves is also a notable strength.
Weaknesses:
One notable omission is a direct comparison with related prior work, such as hierarchical softmax and differentiated softmax, ideally through metrics like BLEU scores. This comparison would provide valuable context and help assess the manuscript's contributions.
The manuscript lacks a linguistic analysis of the proposed binary code prediction method. It would be beneficial to discuss whether this approach aligns with human word retrieval processes from memory and if there are theoretical grounds to believe binary code-based methods are more suited to this task than softmax layers.
Although the introduction promises faster training speeds, the actual speedups observed in Table 3 are modest (less than two-fold). This discrepancy suggests that other parts of the network dominate the training iteration time. Therefore, it would be insightful to isolate and report the computation time for the output layer alone.
General Discussion:
Enhancing the survey of prior work in Section 2.2 by explicitly linking these methods to the introduction's desiderata would strengthen the manuscript. This would clarify which desiderata each method satisfies.
An analysis of the qualitative aspects of binary code prediction, including the types of errors it makes and how these compare to standard softmax and its variants, would be a welcome addition.
LOW LEVEL COMMENTS
Equation 5 requires clarification on the distinction between id(w) = id(w') and w = w'.
On page 335, consider adding a definition for GPGPU to ensure readability for all audiences.
In Table 3, highlighting the best BLEU scores in bold would improve readability.
Equation 15 could be clarified by reminding readers that q is defined in Equation 6 and that b is a function of w. Initially, the absence of w and h on the right-hand side, coupled with unfamiliarity with b and q, caused confusion.
