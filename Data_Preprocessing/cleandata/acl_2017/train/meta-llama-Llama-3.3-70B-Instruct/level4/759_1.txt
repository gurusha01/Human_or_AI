This paper presents a novel joint framework for selecting salient phrases and predicting discourse relations in spoken meetings, demonstrating superior performance to an SVM-based classifier through experiments on meeting corpora.
- Strengths:
The manuscript is well-structured and accessible, providing comprehensive technical details and showcasing high performance in experimental evaluations. Additionally, it offers insightful comparisons with existing research in discourse structure analysis and key phrase identification. Notably, the paper not only evaluates the performance of phrase selection, discourse relation labeling, and summary generation but also explores the application of predicting team members' understanding consistency, making it a valuable contribution.
- Weaknesses:
While the joint modeling of salient phrase extraction and discourse relationship labeling between speaker turns is proposed, a more intuitive explanation of their interdependence and the benefits of considering this interaction would strengthen the paper.
- General Discussion:
The use of an SVM-based classifier as a comparative method in the experiment is noteworthy, and discussing the rationale behind this choice would enhance the validity of the experimental setup.
