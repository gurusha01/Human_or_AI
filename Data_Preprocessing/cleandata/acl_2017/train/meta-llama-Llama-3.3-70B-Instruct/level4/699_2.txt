This paper categorizes keyphrases into two distinct categories: (1) absent keyphrases, which do not correspond to any contiguous subsequences in the source document, and (2) present keyphrases, which fully match a portion of the text. The authors employ RNN-based generative models, specifically RNN and Copy RNN, for keyphrase prediction, utilizing a copy mechanism in RNN to predict phrases that have already occurred.
Strengths:
1. The concept of forming and extracting keyphrases that are absent from the current document is a fascinating idea with significant research potential.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to comprehend.
3. The application of RNN and Copy RNN in this context is a novel approach, building upon the existing use of deep recurrent neural networks in keyphrase extraction, which has demonstrated impressive performance; a thorough motivation to justify the use of RNN and Copy RNN over deep recurrent neural networks would be beneficial.
Weaknesses:
1. A more in-depth discussion on the convergence of the proposed joint learning process for RNN and Copy RNN is necessary to facilitate understanding of how stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained, ensuring reproducibility of the results.
2. The evaluation process compares the current system, which extracts both present and absent keyphrases, against baselines that only contain present keyphrases; a direct comparison with state-of-the-art systems on present keyphrases is lacking, and the importance of local phrases in documents is not explicitly addressed.
3. The impact of document size on keyphrase extraction is a crucial aspect, as evidenced by the superior performance of published results in [1] on the Inspec abstracts dataset.
4. The current system uses 527,830 documents for training, while 40,000 publications are held out for training baselines; it is unclear why all publications are not utilized in training the baselines, and the topical details of the training dataset are not provided, which may affect result reproducibility.
5. As the current system captures semantics through RNN-based models, a comparison with other semantic-capturing systems, such as Ref-[2], would be a strong baseline for evaluating the current system's performance.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. The example in Figure 1 suggests that absent keyphrases are, in fact, topical phrases; using tf-idf to identify topical phrases in the entire corpus and relating documents to high-ranked extracted phrases using Normalized Google Distance or PMI could provide valuable insights into evaluating absent keyphrases, similar to query expansion techniques.

Keyphrase extraction using deep recurrent neural networks on Twitter, can be used for further comparison and improvement.
