Strengths:
This manuscript presents a novel end-to-end neural architecture for parsing semantic graphs, leveraging a thoughtfully designed transition system. The research is engaging, as it explores the learning of semantic representations for DMRS, effectively addressing complexities such as scope underspecification. Notably, this work introduces an innovative approach to computational semantics, benefiting from an incremental, transition-based framework that achieves parsing at a lower cost.
Weaknesses:
A primary concern is that the introduction to DMRS and EP is somewhat generic, and the provided example lacks clarity, failing to distinctly illustrate the unique aspects of DMRS. A more detailed explanation would be beneficial, although the space constraints are acknowledged. Similarly, the description of the parsing model's transition system could be more comprehensive. Without prior knowledge of MRS and EP, it is challenging to fully appreciate the contributions of the paper, beyond recognizing its potential value.
General Discussion:
Overall, this paper is highly intriguing. The application of DMRS to semantic parsing is particularly compelling, and the manuscript is well-received. It is hoped that the release of open-source codes and datasets will further popularize this research direction, stimulating increased interest and activity in the field.
