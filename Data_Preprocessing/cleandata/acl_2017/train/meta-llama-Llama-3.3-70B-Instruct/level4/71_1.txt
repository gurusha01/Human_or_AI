Strengths:
   - The manuscript effectively introduces its key contributions from the outset, providing clarity on the authors' objectives.
   - The provision of both a system and a dataset enhances the paper's utility and reproducibility.
   - The inclusion of figures significantly aids in visualizing and understanding the proposed approach.
   - A comprehensive description of the methodology is offered, facilitating a thorough grasp of the authors' techniques.
   - The authors undertake a rigorous evaluation of their approach by testing its performance on additional datasets and comparing it to previously published works.
Weaknesses:
   - Certain sections delve excessively into methodological details without referencing related studies, and these explanations are redundantly repeated in the corresponding method sections. The authors have acknowledged this issue and committed to addressing it in the final version.
   - The dataset currently lacks a README file, an omission the authors have pledged to rectify.
General Discussion:
   - In Section 2.2, the authors reference DBpedia properties utilized as features, but it remains unclear whether all properties were employed or just a subset. Clarification on this point, ideally through a detailed listing of the features used, is essential for enhancing the paper's clarity and reproducibility, as the authors have acknowledged.
   - The application of the Bi-LSTM-CRF model, as introduced by Lample et al., in Section 2.3 could be further elucidated by specifying that the model utilizes word embeddings as input, consistent with Lample et al.'s approach.
   - Figure 3 requires clarification regarding the language in which the knowledge nodes (KNs) are represented - whether in the source language or in English, given that the mentions have been translated into English. The authors have indicated their intention to correct this figure.
   - Section 2.4 implies that topical relatedness may introduce domain-dependent features. An analysis of how these features impact performance would provide valuable insights, and the authors have agreed to include such results in the final version.
   - The related work section draws a notable comparison with the work of Sil and Florian, emphasizing the distinction between supervised and unsupervised approaches. While the proposed method involves supervised training, it innovatively avoids human interference in the generation of training data, presenting an interesting nuance in the supervised vs. unsupervised paradigm.
