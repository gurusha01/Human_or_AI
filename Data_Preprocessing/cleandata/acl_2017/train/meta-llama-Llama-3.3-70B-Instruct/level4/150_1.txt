The authors propose a unique adaptation of encoder-decoder neural machine translation (MT) that operates on characters at the beginning and end, while utilizing representations of morphemes and characters in between. 
A significant strength of this work is the release of both the code and the final learned models for French-English, Czech-English, and English-Czech, facilitating validation and replication of the results. 
The system demonstrates reasonable translation quality from the initial training epoch, with noticeable improvements in subsequent epochs. Furthermore, it appears to learn suitable morphological tokenizations and can handle unseen words, including nonce words, by implicitly reverting to morphemes.
However, several weaknesses are noted. The paper fails to explicitly specify the WMT test and development sets used to report the results, making it challenging for readers to compare them to existing work. This crucial information is only available in the code supplement's README, indicating the use of newstest2015 and newstest2013 for the test and development sets, respectively. 
The software README provides adequate instructions but lacks explicit examples for training and testing commands. Additionally, the software does not respond to a --help flag, which is a significant omission. 
The paper describes a 6-level architecture, but Figure 2 seems to depict fewer layers, creating confusion. The caption should be more detailed, and if the figure does not illustrate all layers, an additional figure, potentially in an appendix, should be included to show the complete architecture.
The results are compared to other character-based neural systems but do not include state-of-the-art results for other types of MT systems. The WMT and matrix.statmt.org have reported superior results on these datasets, which should be acknowledged and discussed.
Minor issues, such as English disfluencies, misspellings, and LaTeX problems, including reverse quotation marks, need to be corrected.
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the existing literature on character-based neural MT, offering a novel approach and releasing useful resources for the research community.
