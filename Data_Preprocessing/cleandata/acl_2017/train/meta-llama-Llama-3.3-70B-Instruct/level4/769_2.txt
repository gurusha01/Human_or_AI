This manuscript introduces a groundbreaking approach to modeling symmetric collaborative dialogue agents by leveraging dynamically updated knowledge graph embeddings. The core objective is straightforward, involving two dialogue agents - which can be bot-bot, human-human, or human-bot - engaging in conversations about their mutual acquaintances. Each participant in the dialogue has an underlying knowledge base and a corresponding knowledge graph, where items are represented as embeddings that evolve throughout the conversation to inform response generation.
- Strengths: The proposed framework exhibits considerable novelty in addressing both goal-directed and open-ended dialogue scenarios. The evaluation metrics presented demonstrate a significant advantage of the proposed model over existing approaches.
- Weaknesses: A notable limitation of the presentation lies in the lack of clarity regarding the mathematical formulation of embedding computations. Although the authors conduct an extensive evaluation, a comparison with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dialogue manager, which represents the current state-of-the-art in goal-oriented systems, is conspicuously absent. Furthermore, the scalability of this approach to more complex problems remains uncertain. While the knowledge base is reported to contain approximately 3,000 items, the actual operational scope of the agent appears to be significantly narrower, around 10 items, as inferred from Table 6.
- General Discussion: In summary, this is a commendable paper. If the theoretical underpinnings and mathematical details had been more comprehensively elaborated, it would have warranted an acceptance recommendation.
