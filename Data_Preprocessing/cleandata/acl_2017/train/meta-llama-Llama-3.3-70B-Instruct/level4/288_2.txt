Strengths:
The manuscript explores a fascinating topic, namely the variation in writing styles when concluding a story, which has the potential to resonate with attendees in the Discourse and Pragmatics community.
Weaknesses:
A major limitation of the paper is the lack of an in-depth and convincing discussion on the implications of writing style and the experimental findings for discourse and pragmatics.
(1) For instance, the authors could have delved deeper into the significance of initiating an incoherent sentence at the end of a story with a proper noun (line 582), and whether this indicates a topic shift. Similarly, they could have explored the implications of concluding a story coherently with a past tense verb.
(2) The connection between studies on deceptive language and the short or long answers in the current study is unclear, and a more comprehensive comparison would be beneficial.
(3) The usage of terms such as "cognitive load" (line 134) and "mental states" (line 671) appears ambiguous and requires clarification.
(4) The discussion on the use of coordinators (starting from line 275) is insufficient, and the paper would benefit from a more thorough examination of this issue, including the role of coordinators in short stories and discourse in general, as well as potential differences in coordinator usage across genres and the use of "no" coordinators.
(5) The target audience for this research, such as language teachers or crowd-sourcing experiment designers, is not clearly identified.
The manuscript requires revision in terms of organization, as there are repetitive sections throughout the text. Additionally, the abbreviations used in Tables 5 and 6 are unclear.
General Discussion:
Overall, the paper needs significant revisions, particularly in terms of its theoretical framework and implications for discourse and pragmatics.
In their response to the reviewers' comments, the authors express their willingness to update the manuscript and address the issues related to their experiment. However, a stronger commitment to integrating the study's implications into the Discourse and Pragmatics area would be desirable.
