Strengths:
This research presents a pioneering neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, leveraging a Pointer Network (PN) model with multi-task learning to achieve superior performance compared to previous methods on two datasets.
Weaknesses:
The proposed method essentially applies PN to argumentation mining, with the combination of PN and multi-task learning being the primary novelty. However, this innovation may not be sufficient to warrant a long publication in ACL. Furthermore, the absence of qualitative analysis and error analysis is a significant concern.
General Discussion:
In addition to the aforementioned weaknesses, the motivation for using PN is not adequately justified. Although the authors highlight three characteristics of PN (lines 138-143), these do not provide a compelling reason to prefer PN over bi-directional LSTMs and attention mechanisms. The authors should elaborate on the specific problems addressed by PN and demonstrate how these issues are resolved in the experiments.
The visualizations in Figures 2 and 3 are unclear, particularly with regards to the self-link to D1 and the links from D2 to E1 and D3/D4 to E2, which appear to be decoder outputs rather than actual links. Moreover, the decoder LSTM in these figures lacks input from e_j, contrary to Equation (3). In Figure 3, the abbreviation "FC" is not defined.
Equation (8) is unusual, as it calculates the probability of each component type based on the probability of E_i.
The experimental design is questionable, as only the "PN" model, which is not a joint model, was evaluated on the microtext corpus. It is also unclear whether the BLSTM model was trained with a joint-task objective.
The authors should discuss the differences between their work and existing studies on discourse parsing that utilize attention mechanisms.
Minor issues:
* Line 128: "should related" should be revised to "should be related"
* Line 215: The citation "(2015)" is not properly formatted
* Line 706: "it able" should be corrected to "it is able"
After considering the authors' responses, I increased my recommendation score. I strongly suggest that the authors provide improved examples demonstrating the benefits of PN, as well as detailed feature ablation analysis.
