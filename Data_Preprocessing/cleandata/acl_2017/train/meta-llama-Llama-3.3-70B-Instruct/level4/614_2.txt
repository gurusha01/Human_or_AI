Review- Strengths:
This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages word senses to enhance lexical substitutability, yielding improved results compared to existing methods.
Weaknesses:
From a broader perspective, I struggled to identify the key takeaway from this paper and its contribution to the fields of natural language processing and computational linguistics. Specifically, I questioned how the task of lexical substitutability, as presented in this paper, advances our understanding of language or improves NLP systems. Unfortunately, I found it challenging to provide a satisfactory answer to these questions after reviewing the paper.
As a practitioner aiming to enhance natural language understanding systems, I focused on the practical applications of the proposed method. Given the current state of high-performing systems, I noted that discrete clustering of words often fails to deliver when compared to continuous representations. This raises concerns about the motivation behind improving lexical substitutability, particularly since discrete lexical semantic representations have limitations. The introduction cites outdated papers with small-scale datasets, and I failed to see the relevance of this method for real-world tasks, especially considering its focus on English. I would appreciate the authors' response to this concern.
Furthermore, I examined the substitutes presented in Table 1, which highlighted the subjectivity inherent in this task. For instance:
1. Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper.
2. Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the sheet.
In certain contexts, such as if "he" was holding a paper bag, substituting "paper" with "sheet" would alter the sentence's meaning. This example illustrates the potential for lexical substitutes to significantly change the original sentence's semantics, introducing subjectivity into the task.
Minor point(s):
- Section 3.1.4 lacks citations.
Addition: After reviewing the author response, my initial evaluation of the paper remains unchanged.
