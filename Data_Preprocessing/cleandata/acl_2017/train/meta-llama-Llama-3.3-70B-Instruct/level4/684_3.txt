Strengths:
* The paper exhibits exceptional clarity and coherence, with a thorough motivation and explanation of every aspect of the proposed model.
* The authors provide a comprehensive overview of existing work in the field, demonstrating a strong understanding of the current landscape.
* The approach yields state-of-the-art results across multiple text comprehension datasets, and the experimental evaluation is meticulous and detailed.
Weaknesses:
* Although different variants of the model achieve state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, the authors do not provide a clear explanation for these variations, such as the impact of dataset size and text anonymization patterns on the results.
General Discussion:
This paper presents a novel approach to text comprehension, leveraging gated attention modules to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The proposed gated attention reader utilizes query embedding and employs a multi-hop architecture, making multiple passes over the document and applying multiplicative updates to the document token vectors before generating a classification output. This methodology bears some resemblance to human problem-solving strategies for text comprehension. The results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness on large datasets, such as CNN and Daily Mail. However, additional feature engineering is required to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CBT dataset.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the model is both novel and well-motivated. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, making it a significant contribution to the field.
My evaluation of the paper was largely positive, with only a few minor concerns. The experimental results section lacks information on the statistical significance of the improvements, including the test used and the corresponding p-value. Furthermore, the paper does not provide an explanation for the discrepancy in performance on the CBT-CN dataset, where the validation performance surpasses that of NSE, but the test performance is significantly worse.
