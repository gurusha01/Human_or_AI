Strengths:
This manuscript leverages often-overlooked argument information to enhance event detection performance, presenting a straightforward and well-structured framework. The incorporation of a supervised attention mechanism, a technique widely applied in tasks like machine translation, yields a significant improvement over the baseline, demonstrating the system's efficacy.
Weaknesses:
The calculation of the attention vector, which is currently a simple summation of two attention vectors from each part, may benefit from a more sophisticated approach. Regarding the supervised attention mechanism, the two proposed strategies, although straightforward, might be complemented by more complex alternatives that could potentially yield better results.
General Discussion:
While there are areas for refinement, the proposed framework exhibits considerable effectiveness, and the experimental results are robust. Overall, despite some potential improvements, the manuscript presents a solid contribution, making it a viable candidate for acceptance.
