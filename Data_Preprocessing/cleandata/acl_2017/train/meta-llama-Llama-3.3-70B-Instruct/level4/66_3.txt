Strengths:
The paper addresses a relatively unexplored task with significant practical implications, and its writing and motivation are of high quality.
Weaknesses:
The validation methodology relies solely on a user study, which exhibits several limitations that undermine its effectiveness.
Discussion:
This work explores various approaches to generating memorable mnemonic encodings of numbers using the "Major" system, differing from existing methods by producing a single sequence rather than multiple candidates, with the goal of enhancing memorability. Given the ambiguity of "memorability" as an optimization criterion, the authors investigate syntactic methods aimed at creating short, plausible sentences. Their final model utilizes a POS template sampled from a set of favorable structures and a tri-gram language model to fill template slots.
The approach is well-motivated, with a thorough discussion of existing tools that contextualize this work within the broader landscape of security and memorability research. The authors effectively highlight the benefits of passwords based on mnemonic phrases, which offer a balance between security and memorability, thus addressing potential skepticism about the importance and feasibility of such techniques.
The proposed methods demonstrate that baseline and n-gram models produce suboptimal encodings, while the results in Table 2 indicate that Chunk and Sentence methods generate shorter sentences. However, for shorter digits, the relevance of additional characteristics such as POS replacements and templates is questionable, suggesting that a simple n-gram model with reweighing based on the number of digits per trigram could yield comparable performance.
A significant concern lies in the evaluation methodology, which appears inadequate due to its reliance on a one-time memorization setting. Mnemonic techniques are designed to facilitate recall after repeated memorization exercises, not just a single event. A more informative approach would involve reminding users of the number and encoding over a period, followed by a buffer period, and then testing recall, thereby simulating real-life conditions such as password memorization.
The results show an interesting distinction between long-term recall and recognition, with the "Sentence" method performing better in the latter. The authors should consider providing an explanation for this disparity, potentially related to the use of unlikely words making encodings harder to remember but easier to recognize, which could undermine the approach's purpose.
Including examples of the digits and encodings presented to users during the study, possibly in an appendix, would provide valuable insight into the recall difficulty and encoding quality.
Suggestions:
Providing background information on the Major system, including its origins and the logic behind the digit-phoneme maps, would be beneficial for readers unfamiliar with it, likely a significant portion of the ACL audience.
