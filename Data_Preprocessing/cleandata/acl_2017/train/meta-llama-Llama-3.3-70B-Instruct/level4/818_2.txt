This paper proposes a novel approach to learning common sense relationships between object categories, such as comparative size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed, from unstructured text. The key contribution lies in leveraging the correlation between action verbs and these comparative relations, exemplified by the inference that if "x throws y," then "x is larger than y."
The strengths of this paper include its innovative method for addressing the important problem of mining common sense attribute relations from text, offering a fresh perspective on how to extract meaningful relationships from vast amounts of textual data.
However, several weaknesses were identified. Firstly, the paper would benefit from a more extensive collection of examples illustrating object pairs, action verbs, and the predicted attribute relations. This would provide deeper insights into the types of action verbs and their corresponding attribute relations that the model finds interesting. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the mistakes made by the model is lacking, which could offer valuable lessons for improving its performance. 
Another concern is the relatively small size of the dataset, comprising 3656 object pairs. This raises questions about the number of distinct object categories represented and the scalability of the approach to larger datasets. It is also somewhat unclear how the frame similarity factors and attributes similarity factors are selected, suggesting a need for further clarification on these methodological choices.
In the broader discussion, it would be beneficial for the authors to contextualize their work within the existing literature, particularly comparing their method to more direct approaches of mining attributes or attribute distributions and then deriving comparative measures. A relevant reference in this context is the work by Dmitry Davidov and Ari Rappoport presented at ACL 2010, titled "Extraction and approximation of numerical attributes from the Web." Discussing the advantages of the proposed method over such direct approaches could strengthen the paper's contribution.
Lastly, several minor typos were noted: 
1. The abstract mentions 'six' dimensions, whereas the paper discusses only five.
2. "Above" should be "The above" on line 248.
3. "object first" should be "first" on line 421.
4. "more skimp" could be rephrased as "a smaller" on line 654.
5. "selctional" is a typo and should be "selectional" on line 729.
