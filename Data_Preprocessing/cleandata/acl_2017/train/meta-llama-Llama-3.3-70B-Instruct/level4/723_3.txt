Strengths:
 The concept of leveraging morphological compositionality for segmentation decision-making is highly promising.
 The motivation behind the research is well-articulated and easy to follow.
 The overall structure of the paper is well-organized and logical.
Weaknesses:
 Several aspects of the paper remain unclear, including:
  -- the handling of rule ambiguity cases, as illustrated by the "null->er" examples in the general discussion
  -- the suboptimal nature of the inference stage
  -- the limitation of the approach to known words only
General Discussion:
 The paper proposes a semantic-aware approach to morphological segmentation, which relies on a set of simple morphological composition rules, typically in the form of 'stem plus suffix or prefix'. The methodology appears plausible, and the underlying motivation is well-justified and clearly explained.
 The approach employs vector difference to calculate a semantic confidence score for a proposed transformational rule. Previous studies have demonstrated that word analogies and vector differences can effectively capture morpho-syntactic relations. However, it has also been shown that the performance of this method declines substantially in the case of derivational morphology, which exhibits less regularity than inflectional morphology (as noted in Gladkova, 2016; Vylomova, 2016).
 The search space in the inference stage, although tractable, seems far from optimized, requiring the system to search through the entire R_add set and potentially large sets of other possible substitutions to find a matching rule, such as "sky->skies". Furthermore, the approach is limited to known words, for which existing rules can be applied.
 The treatment of rules for transformations that are orthographically identical but semantically distinct is unclear. For example, the "-er" suffix can transform verbs into agentive nouns (e.g., "play->player") or adjectives into comparative forms (e.g., "old->older"), and can also represent patiental meanings (e.g., "looker"). It is unclear whether these different roles are merged into a single rule or cluster.
 Additionally, the paper does not explore how the similarity threshold and measure may impact the performance of the approach.
