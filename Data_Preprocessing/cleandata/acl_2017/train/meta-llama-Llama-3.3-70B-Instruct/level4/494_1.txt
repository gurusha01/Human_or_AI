Review:
Strengths:
- The paper presents a clear and effective application of linguistic concepts to distributional semantics, yielding notable improvements in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.
- Weaknesses:
- The work can be seen as a relatively straightforward extension of existing retrofitting research, and the inclusion of additional baselines, such as character embeddings, would strengthen the comparison.
- General Discussion:
This paper introduces "morph-fitting," a retrofitting approach for vector spaces that specifically incorporates morphological constraints. The method utilizes "attract" and "repel" constraints to bring morphological variations closer together and push derivational antonyms apart. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across multiple vector spaces and languages, achieving consistent improvements in intrinsic evaluations, such as SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500. Furthermore, they show measurable improvements in the extrinsic task of dialogue state tracking compared to morphologically-unaware word embeddings.
The paper is well-written, and its simplicity and clarity make it an excellent example of how to effectively integrate linguistic knowledge into distributional semantic models. The empirical results are convincing, and while some questions and comments are raised, they do not detract from the paper's overall quality.
- Comments for Authors:
1) The use of the morph-simlex evaluation set seems unnecessary, as it may introduce bias by being constructed using the same algorithm being evaluated. The results on standard datasets are convincing, and omitting this dataset could avoid potential confusion.
2) The inclusion of the morph-fix baseline is appreciated, and a comparison to a character embeddings baseline would be beneficial, as it is a popular approach to addressing morphological variation.
3) Ideally, the resulting vector space should not only bring morphological variants closer together but also allow for the assignment of specific semantics to different inflections. It would be valuable to provide evidence that the geometry of the resulting space is meaningful, such as whether the relationship between "looking" and "look" is analogous to that between "walking" and "walk." An analysis demonstrating that morph-fitting yields a more meaningful space, rather than just improved embeddings, would be a welcome addition.
