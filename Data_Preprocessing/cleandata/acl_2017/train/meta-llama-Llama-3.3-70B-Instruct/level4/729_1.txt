The submission presents several key strengths, including the introduction of a kernel-based approach that effectively identifies high-order patterns distinguishing between various types of rumors. This is achieved by assessing the similarities in the structural composition of their propagation trees.
However, one notable weakness is that the mathematical explanations provided in Section 4 could be clarified for better comprehension.
In general, the proposal of a propagation tree kernel represents a significant contribution, as it enables the capture of complex patterns that differentiate rumor types through the evaluation of their propagation tree structures' similarities. This method demonstrates a marked improvement in both the speed and accuracy of rumor detection compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.
To further enhance the research's accessibility and reproducibility, it would be beneficial for the dataset utilized in the study to be made publicly available for the broader research community.
Additionally, the manuscript requires thorough proofreading to correct typographical errors, such as those found on pages 326/3277 ("any subgraph which have" should be "any subgraph which has"), page 472 ("TPK" should be "PTK"), and page 644 ("Table 2 show" should be "Table 2 shows"). There are also instances where information is missing, as on page 875, where the publication details of a referenced work are not provided. Furthermore, inconsistencies in formatting, evident when comparing pages 822 and 897, need to be addressed. Lastly, Figure 5 is somewhat diminutive and could be enlarged for better visibility and understanding.
