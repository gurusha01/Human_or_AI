This manuscript presents a robust and well-founded study that effectively expands upon existing research in a meaningful manner. The writing is clear and concise, making it easy to follow. 
One potential area for improvement is the avoidance of somewhat generic statements, such as those found on pages 191 and 537, which could be rephrased for greater specificity. For instance, page 191 discusses how the scoring function can be tailored to prioritize terms with similar usage across contexts, while page 537 touches upon the educational value of comparing annotations derived from the same dataset to identify similarities and differences.
Initially, the methodology presented in the early sections seemed to closely resemble previous approaches used over the past quarter century to assess similarity, albeit with some novel statistical adjustments. However, upon reaching Section 5, it becomes apparent that the work contributes a significant and valuable component that will undoubtedly benefit future research in this domain. In hindsight, the foundational material covered in Sections 2-4 provides essential context that supports the experiments outlined in Section 5, even if it may not have seemed immediately necessary at the outset.
In summary, the research and findings outlined in this paper will undoubtedly prove useful to others in the field, and the manuscript is certainly worthy of presentation at ACL. 
Some minor suggestions for improvement include verifying punctuation and wording, such as on page 264, where the description of word annotations using PPMI, SVD, and SGNS word vectors could be clarified. Additionally, the phrase "multiple methods" on page 278 could be expanded upon to specify which methods are being referred to in the context of CCLA.
