I appreciate the author's response and eagerly anticipate exploring the impact of incentives and language ambiguity within the domain in further detail.
Initially, I evaluated the paper as proposing a novel approach to constructing natural language interfaces by enabling a group of users to introduce new concepts and syntax, effectively extending the work of S. I. Wang, P. Liang, and C. Manning (2016) on learning language games through interaction.
My initial inquiries included:
- What is the scope of the vocabulary utilized in this study?
- Can this research be contextualized within the broader framework of inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning to clarify its contributions?
The paper's strengths are:
- Its clarity and coherence in presentation
- The innovative solution it offers for navigating the complexities of learning natural language interfaces amidst a vast array of potential programs
However, several weaknesses were noted:
- The discussion would benefit from an analysis of how incentives influence the ultimate performance of the method. Were alternative incentive structures considered, and if so, what were the outcomes?
- While the paper suggests potential extensions to more practical domains, the feasibility and challenges of such applications, particularly concerning vocabulary size and ambiguity in natural language, require further exploration. The current experiments do not adequately address these concerns.
- Incorporating a real-world application or case study would significantly enhance the paper's validity and impact.
