This paper proposes a unified annotation framework that integrates macrostructures and RST structure for Chinese news articles, applying RST structure to individual paragraphs and macrostructure to the paragraphs as a whole. Although the idea that nuclearity should be context-dependent rather than solely relation-dependent is intriguing, the paper is marred by significant issues in both annotation and experimentation, which are elaborated upon below:
- The concept of a "primary-secondary" relationship is heavily emphasized throughout the paper, but it later becomes apparent that this is essentially an extension of the notion of nuclearity to macrostructure, making it context-dependent. However, the statuses of nuclear-nuclear, nuclear-satellite, and satellite-nuclear are reintroduced as novel concepts, which may cause confusion.
- The descriptions of established discourse theories are often inaccurate. For instance, the paper claims that the pragmatic functions of text are understudied, despite the existence of extensive research on this topic. The related work section contains errors, such as incorrectly distinguishing between RST and the Chinese Dependency Discourse Treebank as coherence and cohesion, and the computational approach subsection lacks references to work published after 2013. Furthermore, the performance table for nuclearity classification mistakenly conflates prior work on sentence-level and document-level parsing.
- The macro structure annotation description is unclear, and statistics for the macro labels are not provided. The agreement calculation is also problematic, as the paper states that measurements are only taken at the leaf node level, which may not be sufficient to validate the annotation. The annotation procedure frequently references "preliminary experiments" that supposedly support the approach, but without explanation. Additionally, the calculation of kappa values for this structured task is unclear, and it is uncertain whether it follows the same methodology as the RST discourse treebank.
- The paper suggests that nuclearity status is closely related to the relation label itself. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a baseline performance using only the relation label. Some features, such as "hierarchical characteristics," are not explained at all. 
- The primary contribution of the paper lies in the combination of macro and micro structures. However, the experiments only evaluate relations at the micro level, and even then, only for a select few. It is unclear how this evaluation can be used to support the macro aspect of the paper, thereby validating its main contribution.
- The paper contains numerous grammatical errors and lacks text in Figure 7 to illustrate the example, which detracts from its overall clarity and presentation.
