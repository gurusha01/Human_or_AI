This manuscript extends existing research on utilizing word embeddings for unsupervised morphological segmentation, building upon prior work such as Soricut & Och (2015) and Üstün & Can (2016). The proposed approach, MORSE, employs a local optimization technique for segmenting individual words based on a combination of orthographic and semantic rules, along with several heuristic threshold values.
- Strengths:
The paper offers multiple evaluation methods for assessing segmentation hypotheses on word embeddings, which could be beneficial for other methodologies as well. The results presented for English and Turkish datasets are convincing. The manuscript is well-organized, clearly written, and includes an extensive bibliography. Additionally, the submission provides software for testing the English MORSE model and includes three small datasets used in the experiments.
- Weaknesses:
Although the ideas presented in the paper are somewhat incremental, primarily drawing from Soricut & Och (2015), the main concerns lie in the meaningful comparison to prior work and the analysis of the method's limitations. A significant limitation of the proposed method is its inability to provide a sensible way for segmenting compounds. As evident from Section 5.3, the method does segment some compounds but incorrectly identifies either constituent as an affix. This limitation is particularly pronounced in the results for Finnish, a highly compounding language. While this limitation is acknowledged in the discussion section, the introduction and experiments seem to overlook it.
The evaluation in Sections 4.4 and 5.3 is unfair due to the method's inability to model compounds effectively. Morfessor, a comparison method, excels at segmenting compounds (Ruokolainen et al., 2014), whereas MORSE appears to segment them only incidentally. Consequently, it is not surprising that Morfessor segments a much larger proportion of semantically non-compositional compounds. A fair comparison would involve including an equal number of compounds that should be segmented into their constituents.
Another issue in the evaluations (Sections 4.2 and 4.3) concerns hyperparameter tuning. While MORSE's hyperparameters are optimized on a tuning dataset, Morfessor's hyperparameters are not. Recent versions of Morfessor (Kohonen et al., 2010; Grönroos et al., 2014) have a single hyperparameter that can balance precision and recall. Although MORSE outperforms Morfessor in both precision and recall in many cases, this discrepancy should be acknowledged.
Some crucial details regarding the evaluations and results are missing. The "morpheme-level evaluation" method in Section 5.2 should be described or referenced. Furthermore, Table 7 seems to compare results from different evaluation sets, which might not affect the conclusions due to the large differences in scores but should be mentioned nonetheless.
The software package only supports testing an included model for English and does not allow for training.
- General Discussion:
The paper focuses extensively on segmenting semantically non-compositional compounds, which is problematic. First, as mentioned earlier, the proposed method does not provide a sensible way to segment any compounds. Second, identifying lexicalized base forms and morphemes as the smallest meaning-bearing units are distinct tasks with different use cases. Unsupservised segmentation methods like Morfessor typically target the latter, and criticizing them for a different goal is confusing.
The decision on the (semantic) compositionality of compounds is always somewhat arbitrary, and many gold standards, including the Morpho Challenge datasets, are inconsistent in their decisions.
Sections 4.1 and 5.1 mention computational efficiency and limitations to one million input word forms but lack details. What is the bottleneck: collecting transformations, support sets, and clusters, or the actual optimization problem? What were the computation times, and how do these scale up?
The discussion highlights several benefits of the MORSE approach, including adaptability as a stemmer, the ability to control precision and recall, and the need for only a small number of gold standard segmentations for tuning. However, these benefits are also true for many Morfessor variants (Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Kohonen et al., 2010; Grönroos et al., 2014), making this claim somewhat misleading.
- Miscellaneous:
The abstract should consider mentioning that this is a minimally supervised method. In Section 3, it should be clarified that phi represents an empty string. Section 5 should specify the variant and implementation of Morfessor used in the experiments. The claim that increasing the input vocabulary size would improve the method's performance for Finnish is doubtful, given the language's morphological complexity. The format of the datasets could be improved, such as using a format similar to the MC datasets. Many proper nouns and abbreviations in titles are written in lowercase letters in the references, and Narasimhan et al. (2015) lacks publication details.
