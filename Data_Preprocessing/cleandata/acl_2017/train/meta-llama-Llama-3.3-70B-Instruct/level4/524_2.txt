Review:
- Strengths:
The paper is well-written.
- Weaknesses:
While the title and abstract imply a comprehensive comparison of robust parsing methods for Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), the actual comparison is restricted to a limited set of techniques applied to a single grammar, the English Resource Grammar (ERG). Notably, the ERG has a unique characteristic where a treebank was created only for sentences within its coverage. This idiosyncrasy raises concerns about the paper's relevance to researchers working with other precision grammar frameworks.
A significant weakness is the lack of comparison with robustness techniques commonly applied in systems based on other precision grammars, such as Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), the Alpage system for French, and Alpino for Dutch, among others. Furthermore, the reference to supertagging cites Dridan 2013, which focuses on ERG, whereas supertagging for other precision grammar systems was proposed earlier.
The paper falls short in providing sufficient detail for replicating the results. Crucial information, such as limits on resource allocation, is not specified. Additionally, for some compared techniques (e.g., robust unification) and the evaluation metric, the paper references another paper that is still in preparation, which hinders the replicability of the findings.
The results of the various techniques are somewhat underwhelming. Except for the csaw-tb method, the parsing speed is extremely slow, often significantly slower than the baseline method, which operates without standard resource limitations. The csaw-tb method, although faster, lacks accuracy and is not a novel method introduced in this paper but rather an existing Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) approximation technique.
It would be more insightful to present results on a representative dataset that includes both sentences within and outside the grammar's coverage. This would allow for a comparison with the actual baseline system (ERG with standard settings).
A methodological concern arises from the use of datasets semcor and wsj00ab, which contain sentences that an older ERG version could not parse but a newer version could. This bias likely contributes to the better results obtained by the various techniques on these datasets, rendering these results somewhat inconsequential to this reviewer.
Minor issues include the use of EDM without prior explanation and a typo ("reverseability").
