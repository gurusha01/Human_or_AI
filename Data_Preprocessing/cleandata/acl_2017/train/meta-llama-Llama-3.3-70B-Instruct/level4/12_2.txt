The paper presents a methodology for identifying time expressions in text, leveraging a straightforward rule-based approach that serves as a significant advantage in analysis due to its fundamental role in various applications. The experimental outcomes indicate that this proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art rule-based and machine learning-based methods for time expression recognition.
However, a notable concern arises regarding the method's generality. Since the rules were formulated based on observations from the same corpora used for evaluation, there is a risk that these rules may be overly tailored to these specific datasets. Furthermore, the domains of these corpora could have influenced the design of the rules, potentially limiting their broader applicability. The absence of statistical analysis or discussion on the overlap of time expressions across the observed corpora is noteworthy. Demonstrating significant overlap in time expressions among these corpora could have provided substantial support for the rules' generality.
Ideally, conducting experiments with a novel corpus that was not involved in the rule design process would have been beneficial in showcasing the proposed method's widespread effectiveness.
