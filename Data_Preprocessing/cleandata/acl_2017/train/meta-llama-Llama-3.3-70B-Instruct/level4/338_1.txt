Strengths:
     - The literature review is comprehensive, and the comparison with the proposed approach effectively strengthens the paper's hypothesis. Additionally, the evaluation section is detailed, making the experimental results convincing.
- Weaknesses:
     - Section 3 lacks clarity regarding the specific dataset used for training the SVM and the authors' model. Moreover, only the starting date for collecting the testing data is provided, without additional information on the dataset size or collection timeframe, which could offer valuable insights into the results and statistics presented in Section 3.2.
     - Table 3 indicates that the number of reviewers is only slightly lower than the number of reviews posted, suggesting that few reviewers posted multiple reviews in the labeled dataset. A comparison with the full dataset in Table 2 would be beneficial, including the exact number of reviewers to determine the percentage of labeled reviewers. It would also be interesting to know the average number of reviews per person. If only a few reviewers post multiple reviews, a thorough discussion on the implications for the results would be necessary.
- General Discussion:
     This paper addresses the identification of spam reviews under the cold-start problem assumption, where insufficient information is available to draw conclusions. The authors propose a neural network model that learns to represent new reviews by combining embedded textual and behavioral information. Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are persuasive.
- Typos and/or grammar:                                 
     - The sentence "The new reviewer only provide us" should be revised for grammatical accuracy.
     - When referencing Jindal and Liu (2008), the past tense could be used, as the work is relatively old.
     - The use of short forms like "can't", "couldn't", and "what's" should be replaced with their preferred long forms.
     - The sentence "The new reviewer just posted one review and we have to filter it out immediately, there is not any historical reviews provided to us" is unclear and requires rephrasing.
