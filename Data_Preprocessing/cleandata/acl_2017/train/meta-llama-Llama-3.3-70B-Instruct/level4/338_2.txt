This paper explores the cold-start problem in review spam detection, where the authors conduct a thorough qualitative and quantitative analysis of the issue. They note that insufficient prior data from new users hinders traditional feature-based approaches to identifying review spam. To address this, the authors leverage the abundant textual and behavioral information of existing reviewers to augment the limited information available for new users. Specifically, they propose a neural network that represents new reviewer reviews using learned word embeddings and jointly encoded behavioral information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their model by comparing it to traditional methods.
- Strengths:
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, presenting an interesting idea of jointly encoding texts and behaviors. The cold-start problem is a pressing issue in online review analysis applications, and this paper meaningfully addresses it with a reasonable analysis. The results of the proposed model can also be utilized by downstream detection models. Notably, the authors' approach to tackling this problem is novel, as prior work has not adequately addressed this challenge.
- Weaknesses:
In the experiments, the authors set the window width of the filters in the CNN module to 2, but it is unclear whether other window widths (e.g., 1 for unigram features or 3 for trigram features) were explored. The related work section could benefit from more detailed descriptions of previous studies to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the task. Additionally, several typos need to be corrected, including errors in sections 1, 3, 4, and 5.2, which can be revised to improve clarity and grammar.
- General Discussion:
Overall, this is a good paper that merits acceptance by ACL. The authors' approach to the cold-start problem in review spam detection is innovative and well-executed, making it a valuable contribution to the field. With some revisions to address the noted weaknesses, the paper can be even more effective in conveying its message and presenting its findings.
