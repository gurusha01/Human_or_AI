Strengths:
This manuscript investigates the problem of identifying patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) through the analysis of speech transcripts from three distinct datasets. The authors propose a graph-based approach that leverages co-occurrence information between words in the transcripts. The features are encoded using various characteristics of the graph, including lexical and syntactic properties, among others. The results are presented using 5-fold cross-validation with multiple classifiers, yielding varying performance across the three datasets. The work addresses a well-defined problem and utilizes suitable datasets.
Weaknesses:
The manuscript has several limitations:
1. The paper's readability is compromised due to incorrect English usage, and a thorough review of grammar and spellings would significantly improve the manuscript.
2. The primary machine learning problem is poorly articulated, and the classification task lacks clarity. Specifically, it appears that each transcript is classified as MCI or non-MCI, but the dataset descriptions should provide transcript-level information. Tables 1-3 should focus on data description rather than the studies that generated the transcripts. The inclusion of patient age is irrelevant to the classification task, and excessive text (approximately 2 pages) is dedicated to describing datasets with unnecessary details. Furthermore, discrepancies in numerical values are observed, such as in section 4.1.1, where 326 participants are mentioned, but the total number of males and females in Table 1 is less than 100.
3. The motivation behind enriching the graph is unclear, and an alternative approach could involve representing each word as a node in the graph, connected by similarity between their vectors, regardless of co-occurrence.
4. Despite being from a biomedical domain, the authors have not leveraged domain-specific tools.
5. The unclear class distribution of the datasets raises concerns about the suitability of accuracy as an evaluation metric. For binary classification tasks, the F1 score would be a more desirable metric.
6. The results are reported with high precision (up to 4 decimal places) on small datasets (43 transcripts) without statistical tests or increment analysis, making it uncertain whether the observed gains are significant.
