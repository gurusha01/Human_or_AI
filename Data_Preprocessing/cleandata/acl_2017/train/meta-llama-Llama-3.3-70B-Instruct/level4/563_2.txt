This manuscript explores the utilization of distributional vectors of meaning in identifying semantic relations, akin to the analogical reasoning task introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013), where an expression like "X is for France what London is for the UK" can be approximated using the vector arithmetic operation London-UK+France. The authors contend that this straightforward approach is limited to capturing specific forms of analogies and propose a novel measure aimed at identifying a broader range of relations more effectively.
I find the notion of a single vector space model capturing various semantic relationships and analogies to be somewhat unconvincing and impractical. As the authors acknowledge, numerous studies suggest otherwise, and the reason lies in the underlying distributional hypothesis, which posits that words in similar contexts have similar meanings. This hypothesis imposes certain limitations on the expressive abilities of these models; for instance, words like "big" and "small" will always be considered semantically similar from a vector perspective, despite conveying opposite meanings, due to their similar contextual occurrences. Therefore, I fail to see the relevance of the example in Figure 1 to the fundamental nature of vector spaces or any other semantic model, as it seems unrealistic to expect a word space to capture "has-a" relationships like "owl-has-claws" and "hospital-has-walls".
The motivation behind the paper's primary proposal, a similarity measure involving cross-comparison between word vectors and context vectors, is not clearly articulated. Furthermore, the measure's performance on the SemEval 2010 task's relation categories is underwhelming, with a simple baseline considering partial similarities between word pairs achieving high performance, and the difference between this baseline and the best-performing model appears statistically insignificant. Consequently, the paper exhibits weaknesses from both methodological and experimental perspectives, giving the impression of work in progress, which inclines me against its presentation at ACL in its current form.
Additionally, there is a formatting issue, as the authors have used LaTeX styles for ACL 2016, which should be corrected if the paper is accepted.
In response to the authors, I reiterate my concerns regarding the idea of a metric or vector space attempting to capture both semantic and relational similarity, and I believe the manuscript lacks sufficient experimental evidence to support its claims. I concur with another reviewer that a short paper format might be more suitable for this work.
