This manuscript proposes a methodology for learning sense embeddings from unannotated corpora by employing a modular sense selection and representation process. The learning process is facilitated by a message passing scheme between the two modules, which is formulated as a reinforcement learning problem by the authors.
- Strengths:
The manuscript is well-structured, effectively conveying its ideas and making relevant comparisons to related work. The experimental design is sound, and the results are generally satisfactory, although not exceptional. However, several issues detract from the paper's overall merit, preventing a full endorsement.
- Weaknesses:
A primary concern is the exaggeration of the paper's central claims beyond their actual significance.
1) The authors utilize the term "deep" in the title and throughout the manuscript, yet they employ a skip-gram architecture, which is not deep. This constitutes a misrepresentation.
2) Additionally, reinforcement learning is a central claim of the paper, but its motivation and implementation lack clarity. Section 3.2 attempts to frame the task as a reinforcement learning problem, only to acknowledge two major drawbacks, leading to the use of a Q-learning algorithm that does not align with the initially claimed policy.
Moreover, the novelty of the modular approach remains unclear, as it bears resemblance to EM learning approaches, where an optimal sense is selected in the E-step and an objective is optimized in the M-step to yield improved sense representations. The authors fail to adequately distinguish their approach and do not provide a compelling reason for preferring reinforcement learning over EM.
3) The authors frequently use the term "pure-sense representations" and claim it as a central contribution, but its meaning and benefits are unclear.
4) They claim to achieve linear-time sense selection in their model, but this assertion is not supported by a clear explanation. Highlighting this aspect in the relevant section of the manuscript would be beneficial.
5) Finally, the authors claim to achieve state-of-the-art results, but this is only true for the MaxSimC metric. Other studies have reported better overall results using the AvgSimC metric, making the claim of state-of-the-art performance, as stated in the abstract and introduction, somewhat misleading.
