This paper presents a comprehensive framework for examining similarities and differences in term meaning and representation across various contexts.
- Strengths:
* The proposed framework exhibits versatility and can be adapted to diverse applications, accommodating different contextual notations, similarity functions, and word annotation types.
* The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to comprehend.
- Weaknesses:
* I have reservations regarding the experimental evaluation methodology. The reliance on qualitative evaluation metrics renders it challenging to assess the efficacy and validity of the proposed approach. For instance, Table 1 compares results with Hamilton et al. using different embedding vectors by listing the top 10 words that changed from 1900 to 1990. However, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the performance of CCLA. Similarly, in Experiment 2 (comparative lexical analysis over context), the top 10 words may be meaningful, but the significance of the top 20, 100, or words that practitioners actually care about remains unclear. Without addressing these evaluation concerns, it is challenging to assert that CCLA will yield benefits for downstream applications.
