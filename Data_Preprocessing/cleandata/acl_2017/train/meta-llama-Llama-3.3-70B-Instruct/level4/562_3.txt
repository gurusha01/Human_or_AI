The paper presents a novel formulation of the relation extraction problem as a reading comprehension task and builds upon a previously proposed reading comprehension model to extract unseen relations. The approach consists of two primary components:
1. Queryfication: This involves converting a relation into a natural language question, which is achieved through crowdsourcing.
2. Applying a reading comprehension model to the generated questions and sentences to obtain answer spans. The authors extend a previous approach to handle situations where no correct answer is present in the sentence.
My evaluation of the paper is as follows:
1. The paper is well-written, and the approach is clearly articulated, making it easy to follow.
2. Although the concept of utilizing reading comprehension for relation extraction is intriguing, the approach itself is not particularly innovative. A significant portion of the approach relies on crowdsourcing, while the remaining part is directly adapted from previous work.
3. Given that relation extraction is a well-studied problem with numerous recently published works, it is surprising that the authors do not compare their method to existing approaches. This omission raises concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The performance numbers presented in Table 2 are not entirely convincing, which may be attributed to the dataset used. A comparison with previous methods would provide valuable insight into how the current method stands in relation to the state-of-the-art.
4. Regarding slot-filling data preparation, the statement "we took the first sentence s in D to contain both e and a" is unclear. It is uncertain how the answer sentence for all relations of an entity can be obtained from the first sentence of the entity's Wikipedia article. Clarification on this point is necessary. For example, the paper by Wu and Weld (2010) proposes a set of rules to locate sentences corresponding to an entity property in its Wikipedia page, which could be a useful reference.
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach, its effectiveness needs to be demonstrated through comparisons with recent works on relation extraction. Until this is done, the paper is not ready for publication.
