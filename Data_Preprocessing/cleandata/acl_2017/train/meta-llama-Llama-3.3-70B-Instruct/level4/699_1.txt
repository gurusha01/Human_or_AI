This paper presents a keyphrase generation approach utilizing an encoder-decoder framework, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over other baselines when supervised data is available.
- Strengths:
The paper's organization and clarity are notable, making the proposed method's intuition easily understandable. Sufficient details are provided to facilitate replication of the experiments. Although the application of the encoder-decoder framework with a copy mechanism is relatively straightforward, the experimental results are reasonable and effectively support the paper's claim regarding the generation of absent keyphrases.
- Weaknesses:
The proposed approach, as mentioned earlier, offers little in terms of novelty. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 5.3, the trained model exhibits poor transferability to new domains, performing below unsupervised models. While the paper contributes to maintaining high-quality and sizable training corpora, this aspect is not explicitly highlighted.
- General Discussion:
I found the paper engaging and would be pleased to see it accepted. To further enhance the paper, it would be beneficial to investigate how the size and variation of the training corpus impact the proposed method's performance. Additionally, including the actual values of pg and pc in the CopyRNN model, along with examples in Figure 1, would provide valuable insight. Based on my experience with running CopyNet, I have observed unpredictable behavior from the copying mechanism, which warrants further exploration to understand its underlying causes.
