The paper presents several key strengths, including a comprehensive approach to evaluation data creation and a well-designed evaluation scheme, as well as a thorough comparison of various techniques, ranging from baseline to complex methods.
However, one notable weakness is the lack of in-depth analysis beyond the overall evaluation results, which limits the depth of insight that can be gleaned from the study.
This work provides a comparative analysis of multiple techniques for robust HPSG parsing, with its primary contribution lying in the empirical evaluation rather than the introduction of a new parsing technique. To further enhance the paper, a more detailed examination of the results presented in Tables 1 and 2 would be beneficial. Including representative example sentences and sketches of their analyses, where the compared methods yield different outcomes, would provide valuable context. 
Additionally, incorporating EDM precision and recall figures into Table 2 is recommended, as the EDM F1 score is influenced by a combination of factors including overall and partial coverage, parse ranking, and search efficiency. While the overall coverage figures in Table 1 are useful, the addition of EDM recall to Table 2 would offer a clearer understanding of the situations being compared.
A minor point to clarify is whether 'pacnv+ut' in Tables 1 and 2 refers to the same method as 'pacnv' described in section 3.4.3.
