Review- Strengths:
The paper proposes a crowdsourcing-based approach for generating concept maps, presenting a notable contribution in the form of a collected dataset that is likely to serve as a valuable resource for future research in this area. The underlying ideas are intriguing, and it is evident that considerable effort has been invested in this work.
Weaknesses:
Upon reviewing the paper, it appears that some claims may be overstated. For instance, the authors assert the development of a novel crowdsourcing scheme, which seems more like an application of established best practices in crowdsourcing rather than a genuinely innovative method. Similarly, the claim of creating a new corpus is somewhat misleading, as it is revealed in Section 4.1 that the work is actually based on an existing dataset. This criticism is more related to the presentation of the work rather than the work itself.
General discussion:
The origin of the summary sentences used in the crowdsourcing task is unclear, and it is worth noting that these sentences may still be subjective in nature. Additionally, the source of the clusters is uncertain, and it would be helpful to clarify whether they are derived from the TAC2008b dataset. In Section 4.6, the use of expert annotators to create gold standard concept maps is described, but more details are needed regarding their training and expertise, as this aspect seems crucial to the research.
