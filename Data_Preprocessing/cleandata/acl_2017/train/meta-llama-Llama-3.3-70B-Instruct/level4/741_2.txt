Strengths:
This manuscript introduces a novel approach to word sense induction utilizing synonymy dictionaries, offering a conceptual advancement over existing methods. The proposed method exhibits robust performance in empirical evaluations, which were conducted comprehensively using multiple benchmarks and strong baseline methods.
Weaknesses:
A few minor concerns warrant attention. Firstly, a more in-depth discussion on the evaluation's nature would be beneficial. Notably, all models' scores are relatively low, with F1 scores below 50%. This raises questions about the potential for significant improvement or the existence of a natural performance ceiling inherent to the task. While the authors acknowledge the lexical sparsity of the input data, it is unclear how much this sparsity contributes to the performance gap. 
Additionally, the choice of evaluation metric deserves further discussion, as word senses can be analyzed at varying levels of granularity, which may impact system scores. Furthermore, the process of obtaining vectors for word senses, as described in section 3.4, is unclear, particularly since the senses are determined subsequent to this step and are not annotated in the input corpora.
General Discussion:
I endorse this manuscript for presentation at the ACL Meeting, recognizing it as a solid contribution to the field.
