Strengths:
(1) The authors propose a novel deep CNN framework that effectively integrates cognitive features with textual features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, showcasing a promising approach.
(2) The concept presented is intriguing and demonstrates originality, offering a fresh perspective in the field.
Weaknesses:
(1) A significant concern lies in the replicability of the proposed system, as the lack of accessible data for feature extraction hinders other researchers from reproducing and potentially improving the method.
General Discussion:
Overall, the paper is well-structured and clearly written. The experiments are meticulously designed to facilitate comparisons with prior work, and the analysis provided is sound. Several points warrant further consideration:
(1) It would be beneficial to assess the model's suitability for distinguishing between sarcastic and non-sarcastic utterances. The authors should provide additional details to facilitate a more in-depth analysis.
(2) Further explanation is needed to justify the utility of eye-movement data in enhancing sarcastic/non-sarcastic sentiment classification beyond what textual features can offer, to fully understand its potential benefits.
