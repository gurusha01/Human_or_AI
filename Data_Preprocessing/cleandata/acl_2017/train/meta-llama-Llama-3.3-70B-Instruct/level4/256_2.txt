This manuscript proposes a neural sequence-to-sequence framework for encoding dialogue contexts and generating system responses in open-domain conversations, leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn latent variables that describe responses conditioned on dialogue contexts and acts. The introduced model outperforms the baseline RNN encoder-decoder model without latent variables in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.
The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations, theoretically grounded concepts, reasonable comparisons, and thorough analyses. However, I have a few minor suggestions for improvement:
- To strengthen the quantitative evaluation, it would be beneficial to provide statistical significance tests comparing the proposed models to the baseline, as the differences in some metrics appear relatively small.
- Given the crucial role of dialogue acts in the kgCVAE model, the performance of the dialogue act (DA) tagger could significantly impact the final results. Exploring the use of more advanced DA taggers, such as deep learning models which have recently surpassed SVM in performance, might lead to further improvements.
- Conducting human evaluations as part of the qualitative analysis could offer valuable insights from a more pragmatic perspective, despite the potential costs.
- A potential future direction could involve applying the kgCVAE model to task-oriented human-machine conversations, which often exhibit richer linguistic features than open-domain conversations.
- A minor correction is needed in Table 1, where 'BLUE-1 recall' should be revised to 'BLEU-1 recall' to ensure accuracy.
