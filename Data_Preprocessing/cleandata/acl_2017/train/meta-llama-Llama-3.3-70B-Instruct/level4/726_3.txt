This paper presents a novel approach to learning a semantic parser utilizing an encoder-decoder neural architecture, with a notable distinction of generating full SQL queries as semantic output. The methodology is evaluated across three datasets: Geo880, ATIS, and a newly introduced dataset related to document search.
The paper is well-structured and effectively executed, building upon established encoder-decoder techniques with enhancements such as data augmentation through paraphrasing, to produce SQL queries. The purported advantage of using SQL queries lies in their expressivity, surpassing that of commonly used semantic formalisms in the literature, and their ability to be edited by crowd workers familiar with SQL but not semantic parsing. While the expressivity of SQL is acknowledged, it is questionable whether the chosen datasets adequately demonstrate the limitations of standard semantic formalisms. Specifically, it would be beneficial to know if there were queries in the datasets that standard formalisms failed to capture fully. Furthermore, an analysis of the fraction of SQL that the model actually utilizes and whether it exhibits biases in the style of queries generated would provide valuable insights into the model's capabilities and the necessity of SQL's extra expressivity.
The assertion that directly producing SQL is more challenging is not substantiated and seems to reflect the inherent expressivity of SQL, prompting further inquiry into the extent of SQL the model generates. A more detailed discussion on the types of SQL queries produced, especially for the SCHOLAR dataset, including the nature of ill-formed queries and the effort required for crowd workers to post-edit them, would be enlightening. Additionally, assessing the accuracy of crowd workers in constructing SQL queries and including inter-annotator agreement numbers, particularly for subjective tasks like Incomplete Result queries, would enhance the paper's depth.
The paper's achievements are commendable, and its execution is of high quality. However, deeper insights into the model's true SQL generation capabilities and the subset of the language it produces would strengthen the paper. Minor suggestions include clarifying the term "non-linguists" in the context of writing SQL queries, correcting grammatical errors, and providing clearer explanations for terms like "anonymized utterance." Furthermore, ensuring consistency in references, addressing casing issues, and completing publication details for cited works would improve the paper's overall presentation.
Specific technical suggestions include introducing visual differentiation for lines in graphs for better grayscale viewing and clarifying the paraphrasing process, such as whether it excludes entities and if it paraphrases single words at a time. Addressing these points would not only enhance the paper's technical rigor but also its readability and impact.
