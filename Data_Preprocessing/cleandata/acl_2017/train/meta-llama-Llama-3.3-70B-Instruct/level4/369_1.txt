This paper proposes a two-step approach to translating morphologically impoverished languages, such as Chinese, into morphologically rich languages, such as Spanish. The process involves first translating into a simplified version of the target language, followed by the selection of morphological features for each generated target word and subsequent inflection based on those features.
Although the authors' work is limited to a single language pair, the problem they address is a significant and underexplored issue in current machine translation systems. Their approach differs from many modern methods that rely on byte pair encoding and character-level models, instead drawing inspiration from earlier work such as "Factored Translation Models" and "Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages with Synthetic Phrases", which are unfortunately not cited.
However, the presentation of only METEOR results, without accompanying BLEU scores or qualitative improvements, raises concerns. If BLEU scores do not demonstrate an increase, the authors should provide a justification for the effectiveness of their approach, supported by METEOR results and example sentences.
Furthermore, the authors focus on handling gender and number, but overlook person, which merits at least a brief discussion. Additionally, the impact of rescoring on gender accuracy is unclear, and it is unclear why the reranker does not simply retain the 1-best result if accuracy is high.
The paper also requires significant proofreading, with numerous errors in spelling, grammar, word choice, and style that render it unfit for publication in its current form. A list of identified errors is provided below.
In summary, while the content of the paper is promising, it requires revision to address the aforementioned concerns, including the evaluation of multiple language pairs, the presentation of additional evaluation metrics, and thorough proofreading. It is hoped that this work will be revisited in a future conference, with the necessary improvements and expansions.
