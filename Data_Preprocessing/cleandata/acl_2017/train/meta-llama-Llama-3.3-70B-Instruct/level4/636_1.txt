This study presents a novel approach to sequence tagging, specifically named entity recognition, by utilizing dilated convolutions. The introduction of innovative concepts, such as shared dilated convolution blocks and tag prediction at each convolution level, has the potential to contribute significantly to the field. The authors conduct comprehensive ablation experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of their method. The writing is exceptionally clear, and the experimental design is thorough.
Strengths:  
- The paper features an extensive comparison of the proposed approach with various architectures, including LSTM and LSTM + CRF, providing a robust evaluation of its performance.
- The novel architectural and training concepts, particularly the sharing of blocks, represent a valuable contribution to the community.
Weaknesses:  
- A significant limitation of the study is its exclusive application to English named entity recognition, which raises concerns given the broader implications of sequence tagging suggested by the title.
- Section 4.1 could benefit from additional clarification, such as explicitly addressing how padding is used to maintain consistent output resolution after each block, thereby enhancing the readability and understanding of the methodology.
- An additional ablation study examining the impact of the number of layers on performance could provide further insights into the model's behavior and optimization.
RESPONSE TO AUTHOR REBUTTAL:
The author's rebuttal is appreciated for its thoughtfulness. Following the authors' agreement to refine the content to specifically focus on named entity recognition rather than the broader sequence tagging, the score has been revised upward to reflect this positive adjustment.
