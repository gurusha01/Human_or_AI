The paper explores the intriguing problem of extracting relative physical knowledge of actions and objects from unstructured text by leveraging inference over a factor graph, which comprises two distinct subgraphs: an action graph and an object graph. This approach is rooted in the crucial observation that common knowledge about the physical world significantly influences how people communicate, even when such knowledge is not explicitly stated.
- Strengths:
The paper tackles a fascinating and challenging problem, with the key insight and approach being particularly inspiring, given the complexity introduced by reporting bias. 
The proposed model is innovative, well-described, and effectively addresses text sparsity through the incorporation of semantic similarity factors. 
Empirical evidence strongly supports the model's effectiveness compared to baseline methods. 
The paper is well-written, featuring informative visualizations, although minor inconsistencies, such as the dimensionality discrepancy in the abstract versus the rest of the paper, were noted.
- Weaknesses:
The discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of model components is somewhat limited, making it challenging to fully understand their implications based on the provided quantitative results. 
For instance, it is unclear how the model reconciles potential discrepancies between cross-verb frame similarity, within-verb frame similarity, and action-object compatibility. Specifically, considering verb frames like "A throw B" and "C thrown by D," which share the verb primitive "throw," should the model infer C>D based on within-verb frame similarity if A>B is given? Similarly, for frames like "C thrown by D" and "E kicked by F," which share the "XXX by" frame, if F>E is known, does the model infer D>C? Clarification on how the current model addresses such discrepancies is needed.
The inclusion of more qualitative analysis would enhance the paper, as would additional evidence to assess the task's and dataset's difficulty. 
Questions such as whether incorrectly classified actions or objects are also ambiguous for humans, the types of actions or objects the model tends to misclassify, and whether verbs with more frame types pose a greater challenge for the model, remain unanswered. 
Furthermore, understanding how mistakes are made and whether they are influenced by the proposed semantic similarity factors could provide valuable insights.
More in-depth analysis of the model components and qualitative results could potentially lead to a more general framework for this task.
- General Discussion:
Following the author's response, I am inclined to maintain my current rating and accept the paper, as the response adequately addresses my concerns. I believe that with some reorganization and potentially an additional page, the necessary background and experimental analysis can be incorporated without significant difficulty.
Initially, I found the paper to be solid and interesting, leaning towards acceptance, pending clarification on the raised questions.
