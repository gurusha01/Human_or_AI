This paper presents a novel application of UCCA as a target representation for semantic parsing, accompanied by a highly effective transition-based parser for inference. The introduction of UCCA to this community is a significant contribution, offering substantial potential for inspiring fresh perspectives on semantic text representations. The proposed model is well-designed, with reasonable and clearly explained extensions to existing transition-based schemes, providing an appropriate level of detail.
The empirical evaluation is convincing, with favorable results compared to credible baselines across multiple domains. However, a notable limitation is the absence of multilingual evaluation, particularly given the universal nature of the formalism being explored. The existence of multilingual UCCA corpora, such as the "20k leagues" corpus utilized in this study, suggests that evaluating the model's performance in languages other than English would be beneficial.
A minor observation is that the authors' reference to their model as "grammarless" in section 6 may be misleading. Although UCCA's representation is not derived from traditional syntactic notions, it does define a method for constructing a compositional abstract symbolic representation of text, which can be regarded as a form of grammar. This point is somewhat pedantic, but it warrants mention.
Edited to add: The authors' response is appreciated.
