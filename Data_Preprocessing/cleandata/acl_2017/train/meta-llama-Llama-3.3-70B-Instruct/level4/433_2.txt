Strengths:
The paper presents notable results and a valuable dataset, although it focuses less on Creole-like languages, particularly English.
Weaknesses:
The overall impression is one of familiarity, as similar techniques have been applied to other domains and resource-low languages. The approach could be seen as substituting word embeddings with clusters and neural models with outdated methods, yielding comparable results to those achieved in other languages like Urdu or out-of-domain parsing. Despite this, the paper is engaging, but it would benefit from a clearer emphasis on the authors' contributions and a more detailed positioning within the existing literature.
General Discussion:
This study conducts a series of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of a neural parser in a resource-scarce scenario and to introduce a novel dataset of Creole English, known as Singlish. Although the dataset is relatively small, comprising 1,200 annotated sentences and 80,000 unlabeled sentences for word embedding induction, the authors achieve respectable results through an intriguing approach. However, utilizing features from closely related languages is not unprecedented in the parsing community, as seen in research on Urdu, Hindi, Arabic dialects, and more. 
Considering Singlish as an extreme case of out-of-domain English, it is surprising that the authors did not explore the traditional domain adaptation technique of training with UD_EN and 90% of the Singlish data in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment. This would provide an additional baseline for comparison, with and without word embeddings, and potentially with bilingual embeddings if sufficient parallel data is available.
The paper is interesting, but a more comprehensive positioning within the context of previous work on parsing low-resource languages and extreme domain adaptation would be beneficial. A table comparing results with other small treebanks, such as Irish, would be a welcome addition. Furthermore, the low Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) regarding labeled relations warrants explanation.

Thank you for the clarifications, especially regarding the reevaluation of IAA. I have revised my recommendation to a 4, and I hope the paper will be accepted.
