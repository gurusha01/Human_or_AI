Strengths:
This manuscript addresses a highly relevant and practical issue, namely automated short answer scoring (SAS), with a specific focus on Japanese, a language that has received relatively less attention in this area compared to English.
Weaknesses:
The manuscript is primarily descriptive in nature, lacking substantial experimental validation and novel insights. The authors appear to be unfamiliar with recent advancements in English-language SAS, both in terms of methodological approaches and evaluation metrics. Notable examples of relevant work include:

Additionally, a recent Kaggle competition has yielded several innovative methodologies:

General Discussion:
To align with ACL standards, the manuscript would benefit from more comprehensive experiments, such as feature ablation studies and algorithm comparisons, to justify the final system design. Furthermore, a qualitative evaluation through a user study would provide valuable insights into how the mixed-initiative user interface features contribute to improved scoring. In its current form, the manuscript feels like an incomplete work, lacking novel methods or meaningful contributions. It is also worth noting that Pearson/Spearman correlation and kappa scores are more suitable metrics than accuracy for evaluating ordinal human scores.
