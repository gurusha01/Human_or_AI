The manuscript is well-organized and effectively substantiates its claims. Notably, the section on Related Work is comprehensive and successfully situates the proposed research within the broader field.
Two primary concerns regarding the methodology were raised: (1) the text mentions phrases in section 3.1, yet the discussion only revolves around word representations. Could the authors elaborate on how phrase representations are obtained? (2) Although M^+ and M^- are not explicitly connected in the model, they are indirectly linked through the tanh scoring function. It would be beneficial to understand how the learned matrices compare to each other (for instance, is M^- analogous to -1*M^+?). Furthermore, what are the potential advantages and disadvantages of establishing a direct connection between the two by imposing a measure of dissimilarity?
The inclusion of statistical significance tests to validate the observed improvements would be a valuable addition.
Minor typographical suggestions:
- Line 220: The phrase "word/phase pair" should be corrected to "word/phrase pair".
- Line 245: An alternative phrasing is proposed: instead of "entities are translated to", consider "entities are mapped to", as the original wording may be misinterpreted as a vector space translation operation.
- Line 587: The phrase "slightly improvement in F-measure" should be revised to "slight improvement in F-measure".
- Line 636: There are extraneous commas in the citation that require removal.
- Line 646: The phrase "The most case" is likely intended to be "The most likely case".
- Line 727: The citation contains an extraneous period and comma that need to be corrected.
