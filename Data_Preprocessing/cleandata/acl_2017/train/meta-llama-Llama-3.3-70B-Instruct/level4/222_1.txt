Strengths:
The introduction to the task is enhanced by the authors' use of descriptive examples and a clear outline of the paper's contributions. 
The Related Works section provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, effectively highlighting both the similarities and differences between existing methods and the proposed approach.
The method's presentation is notably clear, with a distinct separation between the tagging scheme and the end-to-end model, facilitating understanding.
A significant strength of this work lies in its use of baselines for comparison with traditional triplet extraction methods, offering a robust evaluation framework.
Lastly, the inclusion of dataset examples to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the methods is highly beneficial, as these outputs augment the explanation of tagging and triplet evaluation.
Weaknesses:
A primary contribution of this paper, the novel tagging scheme introduced in Section 3.1, is noteworthy, yet it exists alongside established schemes for NER and RE, such as IO, BIO, and BILOU.
It is unclear whether the authors conducted experiments utilizing alternative tagging schemes for their method.
Regarding the dataset, while the number of relations (24) is mentioned on line 14, page 5, there is an omission of details regarding the number and types of named entities.
The evaluation criteria for triplets, as presented in Section 4.1, appear to be based on prior work, but the consideration of only the head of the entity in the entity identification stage seems incomplete.
Furthermore, the correctness of the LSTM-LSTM-Bias output in example S3, as shown in Table 3, is questionable, given the text's indication of an incorrect relation role, although it is ambiguous whether the relation role is a factor in the evaluation.
General Discussion:
This paper presents a novel tagging scheme and explores end-to-end models for the joint extraction of entities and relations, contributing to the field.
The article's organization and clarity of writing make it accessible and easy to comprehend, facilitating a straightforward understanding of the proposed methodology.
