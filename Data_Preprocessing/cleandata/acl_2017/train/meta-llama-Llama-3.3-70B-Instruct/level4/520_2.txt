Strengths:
The authors present a novel software package, ShapeWorld, designed for automatic generation of data for image captioning tasks. The simplicity of the microworld used for generating image captions facilitates interpretability of both the generated data and model errors. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that various configurations of the package yield data that is sufficiently challenging to serve as a robust benchmark for ongoing research.
Weaknesses:
A significant limitation of this paper is its resemblance to a demo paper. Although the authors provide experiments evaluating a baseline image captioning system on ShapeWorld-generated data, similar experiments are typically found in demo papers. Additionally, the inclusion of a hyperlink to the software package on GitHub potentially reveals the authors' identities.
General Discussion:
Scientific advancement often relies on tackling problems with an optimal level of difficulty, akin to Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, where progress is accelerated by focusing on challenges that are neither too simple nor too complex. This paper is noteworthy as it offers a straightforward microworld that is easily comprehensible while still posing a sufficient challenge to existing models.
The strengths of this work are amplified by the fact that the software is open-source, readily available on GitHub, and generates data in a format compatible with modern deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow. The methods employed by the software package to generate artificial data are clearly explained, and the authors' experiments with different configurations and a baseline image caption model effectively demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of existing techniques.
However, my primary concern is whether the paper would be more appropriately placed in the demo section, as publishing it in the non-demo long paper track may cause confusion and be unfair to authors who have submitted similar papers to the demo track.
