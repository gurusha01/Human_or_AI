This manuscript presents a comparative analysis of various methods for inducing embeddings in polarity classification tasks, with a focus on the impact of different corpora and the combination of task-specific and generic data. The authors demonstrate that utilizing a corpus with a higher concentration of subjective content can yield more effective embeddings than relying solely on the largest available corpus. Furthermore, they show that combining embeddings from task-specific and generic corpora can outperform single-corpus embeddings, with experiments conducted in both English and Catalan.
The strengths of this paper include its well-structured and well-written presentation, as well as its addressing of an important aspect of sentiment analysis. The authors' claims are adequately supported by their experimental results.
However, several weaknesses are noted. The experimental outcomes are somewhat predictable, and the methods employed are relatively simple and ad-hoc. The paper lacks novel ideas, and the lessons learned about embeddings and sentiment analysis are not significant. The main concept of focusing on task-specific data for training more accurate embeddings has been previously explored in the context of named-entity recognition. The contributions of this paper are largely incremental.
Some experiments are found to be inconclusive due to the absence of statistical significance testing between different classifiers. For instance, the results in Tables 2, 3, and 6 show similar scores for various classifier configurations, making it difficult to determine whether the differences are meaningful without statistical significance testing. The improvement achieved by focusing on subjective subsets is plausible, but its practical applicability in resource-sparse situations is questionable, particularly given the reliance on pre-processing steps like OpinionFinder, which may not be feasible in languages other than English.
Minor issues include confusing discussions of datasets, poorly motivated variations of "splicing," and unclear isolation of subjective information. Additionally, there are discrepancies in variable definitions and formulae, as well as unclear task descriptions.
After reviewing the authors' response, some clarifications were provided, but the explanations regarding opinion holders and targets remained unclear. Ultimately, the lack of sufficient novelty and the incremental nature of the work lead to the conclusion that the manuscript does not merit a revised score.
