This paper proposes a straightforward approach to assessing the readability of Vietnamese text, utilizing a regression model trained on features such as word count and sentence length. 
A significant limitation of the paper is its failure to provide substantial technical advancements - whereas earlier readability assessment research employed simple methods akin to those presented, recent studies leverage more sophisticated techniques, including language models (e.g., http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mx223/readabilitybea2016.pdf, http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/pubs/ITL-readability-invited-article-v10-camera.pdf). A comparative analysis with these methods would enhance the paper's value, particularly if it demonstrates that simpler approaches can rival more complex models.
The inclusion of baseline experiments using established metrics like SMOG and Gunning Fog index, as well as other relevant Vietnamese metrics and datasets cited by the authors, would be beneficial. 
Furthermore, the paper's classification scheme, which categorizes documents as easy, medium, or hard, is overly simplistic compared to previous readability indices that used more granular levels corresponding to grade levels. The use of a classifier could also be explored to improve the metric's usefulness.
In its current state, the work appears to be underdeveloped and is hindered by notable weaknesses, making it unsuitable for acceptance. The authors are encouraged to address the suggested feedback to strengthen their submission.
Additionally, the paper contains numerous grammatical errors that should be corrected in any future revision.
