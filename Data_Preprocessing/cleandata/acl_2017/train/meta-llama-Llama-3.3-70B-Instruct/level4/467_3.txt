This paper proposes a self-learning approach for acquiring bilingual word embeddings, leveraging two language-specific embeddings and an initial seed lexicon. The methodology iteratively induces a new bilingual lexicon at each mapping learning step, which is then utilized to learn an updated mapping, repeating the process until convergence is achieved.
A notable advantage of this framework is its ability to directly incorporate the seed lexicon as a binary matrix into the learning process, subsequently solving a global optimization problem where the seed lexicon's role is implicit, serving only to initialize the mapping between the two embeddings, thus ensuring convergence. Moreover, the framework can operate with a relatively small initial seed lexicon, requiring as few as 25 correspondences, making it particularly suitable for language pairs with limited bilingual lexicon resources.
The compact size of the required seed lexicon is especially appealing for languages lacking extensive bilingual dictionaries. To further enhance the evaluation of this framework, it would be beneficial to assess its performance in relation to the quality of the input word embeddings. In scenarios where one or both languages have limited resources, the word embeddings may exhibit differences in structure and coverage, which could be simulated by training the embeddings on disparate subcorpora for each language, utilizing available data.
