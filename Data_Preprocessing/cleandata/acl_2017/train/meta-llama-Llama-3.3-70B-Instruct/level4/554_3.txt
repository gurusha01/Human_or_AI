This paper presents a notable exploration of the practical applications of Bayesian neural networks in NLP tasks, a relatively under-investigated area. By applying a Bayesian approach to the parameters of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the authors demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating model averaging benefits during inference. Their proposed gradient-based sampling approximation for posterior estimation offers a straightforward and potentially cost-effective alternative to established model averaging techniques, such as ensembling.
The efficacy of this approach is validated across three distinct tasks: language modeling, image captioning, and sentence classification, with observed performance gains over the baseline of single model optimization. 
However, several aspects of the experimental setup lack clarity. Crucial details regarding burn-in, the number of epochs, and sample collection, currently relegated to the supplementary material, should be integrated into the main paper for enhanced transparency. Additionally, elaboration on the inference process would be beneficial. Specifically, it is unclear whether the samples obtained following Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for a fixed number of epochs after burn-in on the training data were kept constant for inference across all test instances, as per equation 5.
An explicit clarification on the independence assumption, p(D|θ) = p(Y,X|θ) = p(Y|θ,X)p(X), which underpins the use of the conditional RNN model for the potential U(θ), would contribute to the completeness of the paper.
In terms of comparative analysis, the paper would benefit significantly from a discussion and experimental comparison with ensembling and distillation methods, such as "Sequence level knowledge distillation" by Kim and Rush, and "Distilling an Ensemble of Greedy Dependency Parsers into One MST Parser" by Kuncoro et al., which share a similar objective of incorporating model averaging effects.
Further insight into the preference for HMC-related sampling methods over other sampling techniques or variational approximations would also be valuable.
Notably, equation 8 suggests a potential equivalence between dropout and the proposed approach. A more concrete theoretical justification for combining Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and dropout would provide deeper understanding into the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The points addressed above encapsulate the primary considerations for this paper, highlighting both its contributions and areas for further development.
