In summary, the authors conduct a thorough comparison of various sub-word modeling approaches in language modeling, demonstrating that morphology-based modeling outperforms character-based modeling. Through precision experiments, they show that the greatest benefits of sub-word modeling are achieved with words exhibiting rich morphology, such as nouns and verbs. The paper is comprehensive, with experiments that substantiate its core claims.
The paper's strengths include:
1. A thorough overview of different sub-word modeling approaches and architectures, supported by numerous experiments that validate the claim that morpheme-based modeling yields the best results.
2. The introduction of a novel sub-word modeling approach based on character tri-grams, which outperforms traditional methods across multiple languages.
3. The incorporation of linguistic typology, examining the effects of models on various language types, is a valuable contribution to the field of language modeling.
4. The analysis of perplexity reduction after different word classes in Russian and Czech provides insightful results, demonstrating how character-level and morpheme-level models handle rare words more effectively. This raises questions about the extent to which language modeling requires understanding semantics versus morphosyntactic effects.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
1. The character tri-gram LSTM approach seems somewhat arbitrary, and it is unclear why the authors chose to focus on tri-grams rather than other character n-grams. The large number of possible distinct trigrams in the Latin alphabet (approximately 17,576) raises concerns about the model's complexity and whether only observed trigrams were considered.
2. The examination of character-level models on root-and-pattern morphology is limited by the use of unvocalized datasets, which lack the "pattern" aspect of this typology. Although finding transcribed Arabic and Hebrew with vowels may be challenging, it is a crucial aspect of this linguistic phenomenon.
3. The inclusion of reduplication as a separate typology is questionable, as it appears to be a distinct phenomenon from the other three, which are more strictly morphological. Indonesian and Malay, for example, exhibit both reduplication and word affixes, making it unclear whether separating reduplication from other linguistic typologies is justified.
In general, the paper is well-structured and easy to follow. However, the choice of 200-dimensional character embeddings seems unnecessary, as the dimensionality exceeds the size of the vocabulary (i.e., the number of characters in the alphabet). After reading the author response, my opinions on the paper's strengths and weaknesses remain largely unchanged.
