The paper presents a novel application of existing representations, feature sets, and methods to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in speech narratives. The problem, datasets, and domain are thoroughly described, providing a solid foundation for the study. Although the proposed solution and experiments appear reasonable, some details are lacking. Overall, the study is interesting and informative, offering valuable insights into the detection of MCI.
However, the paper requires significant editing to enhance readability. Certain key concepts, such as the multi-view learning approach and the set of "linguistic features," are not adequately clarified. Additionally, the datasets used to generate word embeddings are unclear, and the decision to remove disfluencies (e.g., filled pauses, false starts, repetitions) from the dataset is not well-justified. The omission of the popular tf-idf weighting scheme for BoW classifications is also noteworthy. Furthermore, the paper lacks tests for significance to substantiate the conclusions drawn from the experiments. The related work section is somewhat superficial, and more detailed information on the methods used in previous studies would be beneficial.
Detailed comments are provided below:
Abstract: The abstract should be condensed to improve clarity. 
Lines 22-23: The phrase "impacting in parsing results" could be rephrased as "impacting the parsing results" for better readability.
Lines 24-25: It is unclear why grammatical errors in transcripts were manually corrected, as the presence of such errors might be indicative of MCI. Including examples of disfluencies would help clarify this point.
Lines 29-30: The phrase "as it a lightweight and language-independent representation" requires rephrasing for improved clarity.
Lines 34-38: The description of the three datasets is unclear; rephrasing, such as "the other two: Cinderella and …," would be helpful.
Line 70: The phrase "15% a year" is ambiguous, and the meaning of "per year" is unclear.
Line 73: Rephrasing is necessary to improve clarity.
Lines 115-117: The explanation for why BoW would have problems with disfluencies is lacking and should be provided.
Lines 147-149: The term "the best scenario" is unclear and requires further explanation.
Line 157: A link or citation to Dementia Bank would be helpful for readers.
Line 162: A link or citation describing the "Picnic picture of the Western Aphasia Battery" would be beneficial.
Line 170: An explanation of the WML subtest would be helpful for clarity.
Line 172: Citations are missing and should be added.
Lines 166-182: The related work section is somewhat superficial and would benefit from more detailed information on the methods used in previous studies and how they compare to the current study.
Line 185: The conference citation guidelines should be followed; for example, "Aluisio et al. (2016) used…".
Line 188: The definition of "PLN" is missing and should be provided.
Lines 233-235: Rephrasing is necessary, as lemmatization is not always the final step in text pre-processing and normalization.
Lines 290-299: It is unclear whether the word embeddings were created using the MCI datasets or external datasets.
Line 322: The phrase "consisted of" should be changed to "consist of".
Lines 323-332: The text requires rewriting for clarity, including explanations of "manually segmented," "ABCD," and the datasets. 
Table 1 Caption: Additional statistics on the dataset, as described, are missing.
Lines 375-388: The removal of filled pauses, false starts, repetitions, etc. is unclear, and these features might be important in the context of MCI.
Line 399: The phrase "multidisciplinary team with psychiatrists" could be rephrased as "consisting of psychiatrists" for better clarity.
Lines 340-440: A link or citation describing the transcription norms would be helpful.
Section 4.2.1: The dataset used to generate the word embeddings is unclear.
Line 560: The definition of the shortest path, as mentioned in feature 6, is unclear.
Section 4.2.2 "Linguistic Features" requires significant expansion for clarity, and the conference guidelines regarding additional pages ("Supplementary Material") should be followed.
Line 620: The phrase "In this work term frequency was" should be rephrased as "In this work, term frequency was," and the decision not to use tf-idf, the most common weighting scheme, should be justified.
The sentence on lines 641-645 requires rewriting.
Line 662: The term "the threshold parameter" is unclear, and it is uncertain whether it refers to the threshold for the word embedding cosine distance.
Line 735: A period is missing at the end of the sentence.
Section 4.3 Classification Algorithms: Details on the multi-view learning scheme used are entirely omitted, and statistical significance of result differences is not provided.
