The paper proposes an iterative approach to generating bilingual word embeddings from large monolingual corpora, leveraging a minimal number of seed mappings between languages, which can be obtained automatically. The achieved results are noteworthy, especially considering the method's reliance on limited or no manual input, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques that utilize more extensive bilingual dictionaries or parallel/comparable corpora.
However, a limitation of the paper is the lack of discussion on the method's error rates and potential adjustments to mitigate these errors.
A broader examination of the method raises several questions: Does the frequency of seed words in monolingual corpora impact the outcome? Visualizing the iterative evolution of word mappings between languages for select words could provide valuable insights. Additionally, the method's handling of words with multiple translations or senses warrants further exploration.
The linguistic differences between languages, such as the prevalence of compounds in German, pose interesting challenges. It would be beneficial to investigate how these compounds are mapped and whether preprocessing steps, like splitting compounds using unigram information, could enhance the results.
Ultimately, understanding the upper limits of this approach and analyzing errors, such as words that are significantly distant from their counterparts, would be highly informative. A discussion on the origins of these errors and potential strategies to address them within the proposed framework would further strengthen the paper.
