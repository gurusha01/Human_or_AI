This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for generating morphology, specifically focusing on gender and number, from a morphologically simplified Spanish text. The method utilizes a classifier to reassign gender and number for each token as necessary. The authors have compared their approach with other learning algorithms and evaluated its performance in machine translation for the Chinese-to-Spanish translation direction.
The task of generating gender and number has been relatively understudied, with most morphology generation methods targeting and being evaluated on morphologically rich languages such as German or Finnish. However, referring to the work presented in this paper as "morphology generation" may be somewhat misleading, as it primarily deals with gender and number. Furthermore, the incorporation of handcrafted rules for this specific task raises concerns about the method's applicability to more complex morphology generation tasks for morphologically rich languages.
The paper is relatively clear in its presentation of the proposed method, and it is evident that significant effort has been invested in designing the approach. The method has the potential to make interesting contributions to various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, the evaluation section is lacking in clarity, with many details omitted, making it difficult to assess the method's improvements over state-of-the-art methods or replicate the experiments. Additionally, no analysis of the results is provided, and the motivation behind using deep learning for gender and number generation is not clearly explained.
The use of the term "contribution" in the paper could be more judicious, as it is unclear what the actual contributions are. Several specific points require clarification, including the meaning of "unbalanced languages" in the abstract, the claim of using deep learning as a main contribution in Section 1, and the assertion that neural machine translation does not achieve state-of-the-art results for Chinese-to-Spanish in Section 2.
In Section 5.1, the use of the Chinese-to-Spanish language pair is mentioned as a main contribution, although using a language pair is not a contribution in itself. The numbers provided in Table 2 lack context, and it is unclear whether they were computed before or after preprocessing. The removal of sentences longer than 50 tokens and the method of obtaining development and test sets require explanation. The experiments, as described, are not replicable due to these omissions.
Section 5.2 mentions the use of Moses with its default parameters, but the version of Moses used should be specified, as default parameters vary between versions. In Section 5.3, the term "hardware cost" is unclear, and more details are needed regarding the values in Table 3, including how they were obtained and what data were used for training and testing the classifiers.
Section 6 presents a comparison with other classification algorithms, but it does not provide insight into how the proposed method performs compared to state-of-the-art methods. The choice of classification algorithms for comparison and the impact of the handcrafted rules on the results require explanation. The implementation of these classification algorithms and the training of the phrase table on simplified Spanish should be clarified.
The evaluation of the results using METEOR instead of BLEU is appreciated, but the version of METEOR used should be specified, as it has undergone significant changes since 2005. The statistical significance of the METEOR scores should also be addressed.
The future work section mentions "further simplifying morphology," which is misleading, as the paper does not present any simplification of morphology. Several typos, including "femenine," "ensambling," and "cuadratic," should be corrected. The style of citations should be revised to follow the standard format, and the captions of tables should be placed below the tables with more space in between. The paper should be reformatted according to the ACL 2017 template, and the FAQ and submission instructions on the ACL 2017 website should be consulted to improve the paper.
In response to the authors' reply, clarification is still needed regarding the application of rules and their impact on classification results. The simplification of Spanish, as shown in Table 1, lacks a clear explanation of how these simplifications were obtained. The classification algorithms presented in Table 5 are not state-of-the-art, and a comparison with other state-of-the-art morphology generation approaches designed for machine translation is necessary to make the paper more convincing.
