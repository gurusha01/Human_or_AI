Strengths:
This manuscript tackles a longstanding challenge in the field of automatic evaluation of generation and translation systems, providing a significant contribution to the existing body of research.
The authors conduct an exhaustive analysis of available metrics, presenting a thorough and comprehensive examination of the current state of the field.
A novel metric is introduced, demonstrating a higher correlation with human judgments and offering a promising approach for future research.
The provided bibliography serves as a valuable resource for newcomers to the field, offering a comprehensive overview of relevant literature.
Weaknesses:
The paper's focus on numerical analysis comes at the expense of insightful discussions on linguistic aspects of generation, including the generation method, system output differences, and comparisons to human-generated references.
The effectiveness of crowd-sourced references in the context of language generation applications remains unclear, highlighting a need for further clarification.
General Discussion:
To enhance the manuscript's clarity and readability, the inclusion of linguistic examples and system descriptions could be beneficial, potentially at the expense of redundant tables. This addition would provide readers with a more intuitive understanding of the research, ultimately strengthening the overall impact of the paper.
