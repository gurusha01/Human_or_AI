The authors have compiled a novel dataset consisting of 1200 Singaporean English (Singlish) sentences, annotated with Universal Dependencies, and demonstrated that incorporating English syntactic knowledge via a neural stacking model can enhance the performance of a part-of-speech (POS) tagger and a dependency parser on the Singlish corpus.
- Strengths:
Singlish is a low-resource language, and the accompanying dataset is a valuable contribution to the NLP community, which requires more data for such languages. Furthermore, the paper makes a notable contribution to the area of creole language analysis using transfer learning. The experimental setup is well-defined, and the authors provide convincing evidence that integrating knowledge from an English-trained parser into a Singlish parser outperforms both English-only and Singlish-only parsers on the Singlish data. They also offer a comprehensive overview of the relevant differences between English and Singlish for syntactic parsing and a useful analysis of how various parsing models handle Singlish-specific constructions.
- Weaknesses:
This paper has three primary issues:
*  The comparison to the UD annotation of non-English languages is inadequate. Many constructions highlighted as specific to Singlish are also present in other UD languages, and the annotations should ideally be consistent between Singlish and these languages.
*  An analysis of the impact of training data size is lacking. A central claim of this paper is that using English data can improve performance on a low-resource language like Singlish. It is essential to determine how much more Singlish data would be needed before the English data becomes unnecessary.
*  The authors should investigate the performance of a single POS/dep parsing model trained on the concatenated UD Web and Singlish datasets, as this approach is simpler than incorporating neural stacking. The case for neural stacking is stronger if it can outperform this baseline.
- General Discussion:
Line 073: The statement "POS taggers and dependency parsers perform poorly on such Singlish texts based on our observations" should be clarified to indicate that this will be quantified later, as it currently appears somewhat anecdotal.
Line 169: The comparison to neural network models for multi-lingual parsing is incomplete, as the approach of mapping Singlish and English word embeddings into the same embedding space is not directly attempted.
Line 212: The introduction of UD Eng should note that the Singlish data is also web data, resulting in a domain match with UD Eng.
Line 245: The annotation of borrowed words according to their original meanings should be clarified to indicate whether they retain the same POS as in the language from which they were borrowed or the POS of their usage in Singlish.
Figure 2: Including standard English glosses would facilitate understanding the constructions and verifying the correctness of the UD relations used.
Line 280: The topic prominence syntax described should be compared to the "dislocated" label in UD, as it appears similar to a topic-comment-style syntax.
Line 294: The analysis of noun phrases used to modify the predicate with a preposition as "nsubj" (nominal subject) requires clarification, ideally with a gloss, to determine if this analysis is accurate. If the phrase is indeed modifying the predicate, it should not be labeled as "nsubj."
Line 308: The discussion of copula handling in UD-Eng standards should acknowledge the explicit decision to increase parallelism with non-copular languages, such as Singlish.
Line 322: The phenomenon of NP deletion, resulting in null subjects or objects, is common in other languages and should be noted, along with how it is handled in UD for those languages.
Line 330: The analysis of subj/verb inversion should ensure consistency with other languages where this construction is present, such as in interrogatives.
Sec 3.3 Data Selection and Annotation:
The method of selecting Singlish sentences may bias the results, as an English parser is expected to perform poorly on these sentences. It would be beneficial to investigate how a standard English parser performs overall on Singlish, without filtering, and to determine the frequency of sentences with out-of-vocabulary terms or the constructions discussed in 3.2.
Line 415: The inter-annotator agreement scores (UAS: 85.30%, LAS: 75.72%) should be accompanied by the agreement on POS tags and an explanation for the discrepancy with the 94% inter-annotator agreement reported in Silveira et al (2014) for UD-Eng.
POS tagging and dep parsing sections:
An analysis of the effect of training set size on both POS-tagging and dep parsing would be valuable, including the amount of Singlish data required to train a model entirely on Singlish and achieve the same accuracy as the stacked model. Additionally, the performance of a model trained on a hybrid dataset of English and Singlish should be evaluated.
Line 681: A typo ("pre-rained" instead of "pre-trained") should be corrected.
Line 742: The neural stacking model's performance on "NP Deletion" cases could be improved by deleting subj/obj from some English sentences to reduce the parser's bias towards expecting explicit subjects or objects.
