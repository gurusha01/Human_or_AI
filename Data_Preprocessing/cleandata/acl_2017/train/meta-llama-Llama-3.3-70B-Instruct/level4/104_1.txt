Review:
Strengths:
* The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance to ALIGN in the supervised entity linking task, indicating an improvement in the joint learning of text and knowledge representations.
* A direct comparison is made with a closely related approach using similar input data, providing a meaningful baseline for evaluation.
* The analysis of the smoothing parameter offers valuable insights, as the impact of popularity is a longstanding issue in entity linking that warrants further examination.
Weaknesses:
* The comparison with ALIGN could be more comprehensive. Notably, ALIGN employs a content window size of 10 compared to this paper's 5, and a vector dimension of 500 versus 200. Furthermore, it is unclear whether N(ej) exclusively includes entities that link to ej, and whether the graph's adjacency is defined as it would be for an undirected graph. Given that ALIGN defines an entity's context as the set of entities that link to it, any differences in N(e_j) may contribute to the disparity in entity similarity task scores, making it challenging to discern the true impact of the proposed framework.
* The terminology surrounding "mention" can be ambiguous, sometimes referring to a string type and other times to a specific mention within a document. Although "mention embedding" is used, it appears that embeddings are only learned for mention senses, which may lead to confusion.
* The effect of sense disambiguation order on the results is difficult to assess without a comparison to other unsupervised entity linking methods, which would provide a more complete understanding of its influence.
