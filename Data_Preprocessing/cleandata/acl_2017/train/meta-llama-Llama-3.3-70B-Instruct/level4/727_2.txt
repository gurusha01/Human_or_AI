The authors tackle a complex and subtle issue in political discourse analysis, achieving a notable degree of success. The topic of political framing detection is likely to resonate with the ACL community. The paper's writing quality is also commendable.
However, the quantitative results are limited to the authors' PSL model, without comparison to traditional baseline classification algorithms, making it uncertain whether their model is truly necessary. The lack of comparison with alternative approaches hinders the interpretation of the paper's findings.
The qualitative investigation is intriguing, but the chosen visualizations are perplexing and contribute little to the discussion. Consideration could be given to aggregating data across individual politicians to create a clearer visual representation.
In general, the submission is well-written and addresses a potentially interesting topic for the ACL community. Nevertheless, it falls short in providing adequate quantitative baselines for comparison.
Some minor points to consider:
- Line 82: A specific year should be provided for the Boydstun et al. citation.
- The assumption that similar tweeting behavior implies similar framing lacks citation and clarification.
- The related work section could be improved by providing more in-depth discussion of relevant areas, such as PSL models and political discourse, while minimizing the focus on tangential topics.
- In Section 4.2, it is unclear whether Word2Vec was trained on the authors' dataset or if pre-trained embeddings were used.
- The choice of unigrams for frame prediction and bigrams/trigrams for party prediction lacks intuitive explanation.
- The optimal performance of temporal similarity with one-hour chunks warrants further discussion on the importance of this assumption and its potential impact on the results.
- Table 4's caption should explicitly state that the values represent F1 scores and specify the weighting method used (e.g., micro or macro), with similar clarification in the "evaluation metrics" section on page 6.
