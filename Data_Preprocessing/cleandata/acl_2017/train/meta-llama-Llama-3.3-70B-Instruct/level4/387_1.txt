Strengths:
This manuscript addresses a compelling research question and presents a novel approach to integrating cognitive and textual features for sentiment analysis and irony detection, which appears to be a new contribution to the field. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides a wealth of detailed information, accompanied by informative examples and plots. The majority of the results are persuasive, and the authors have done an excellent job of comparing their methodology and findings to existing work.
Weaknesses:
1. Upon reading the abstract, I anticipated that the proposed approach would substantially surpass previous methods, with the consistent combination of eye-gaze and textual features yielding the optimal results. However, the actual results presented in the paper are more nuanced. To better align expectations with outcomes, I suggest revising the abstract and introduction to reflect these mixed findings.
2. When evaluating the model's performance on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, it is unclear whether sarcastic utterances were included in the analysis. Additionally, did the model exhibit better performance in classifying non-sarcastic utterances compared to sarcastic ones?
3. While the utility of eye-movement data in sarcasm detection is understandable, its benefits for sentiment classification beyond textual features are less apparent, particularly for non-sarcastic cases.
General Discussion:
This paper offers a significant amount of intriguing content, with a methodology that appears both sound and innovative. Although the results were not as strong as I initially expected based on the abstract, I believe they still hold value for the broader research community and warrant publication.
