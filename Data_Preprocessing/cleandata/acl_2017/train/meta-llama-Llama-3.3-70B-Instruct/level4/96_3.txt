This paper presents a novel approach to identifying and interpreting sarcasm in Twitter posts by leveraging sentiment words and a machine translation engine to generate equivalent non-sarcastic tweets.
The strengths of this work include the introduction of a parallel corpus, which has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers studying sarcasm in social media. The authors' effort to evaluate the parallel corpora using existing measures, such as those employed in machine translation tasks, is also commendable. Furthermore, the use of human judgments to assess the corpora in terms of fluency, adequacy, and equivalent sentiment is a significant contribution.
However, there are areas that require improvement. The approach of tackling sarcasm interpretation as a monolingual machine translation task is intriguing, but the comparison between the two architectures, "Neural interpretation" and "Moses interpretation," is limited by the relatively small dataset used. As the authors acknowledge, the "Neural interpretation" performs worse than the "Moses interpretation," which was predictable given the dataset size. To strengthen this comparison, it would be beneficial to explore other configurations of the machine translation system used with Moses or provide a justification for the chosen configuration. 
Additionally, the evaluation of the SING system's components is incomplete. While the machine translation component is assessed, the clustering of positive and negative words using k-means is not thoroughly evaluated. The choice of clustering 10 words and the selection of k-means as the clustering algorithm require further justification. It would be useful to investigate the impact of varying the number of clusters or exploring alternative clustering algorithms, such as the star clustering algorithm.
The process of replacing sentiment words with cluster IDs in the SING system is not entirely clear. It is assumed that there is no limit to the number of sentiment words that can be replaced, and the machine translation system determines the number of replacements. For instance, in the example tweet "Constantly being irritated, anxious and depressed is a great feeling," the clustering stage of SING would presumably replace the sentiment words with their corresponding cluster IDs, resulting in a modified tweet. Clarification on this process would be beneficial.
Minor comments include a question regarding the discrepancy between the human interpretations and the original sarcastic tweets. In Section 7, it is stated that SIGN-context's interpretations differ from the original sarcastic tweet in 68.5% of the cases, which is close to the 73.8% in the gold standard human interpretations. This implies that approximately 25% of the human interpretations are identical to the original tweet, which warrants further explanation.
In Section 6, the footnote 7 could be eliminated by adding a brief phrase, such as "its cluster ID" or "its cluster number," to improve the clarity of the text.
