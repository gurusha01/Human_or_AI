Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper evaluates three models of referential word meaning—TRANSFER, WAC, and SIM-WAP—that link visual object representations to lexical representations in a distributional vector space. The primary contribution of the paper is the experimental comparison of these models in both standard and zero-shot object naming tasks, with a focus on their complementary strengths. The authors argue that combining visual and lexical information improves performance in referential word use, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. While the combination of models yields promising results, the novelty of the SIM-WAP model, which uses fine-grained similarity signals during training, is not sufficiently detailed or contextualized. The paper also highlights the potential of leveraging distributional knowledge for referential word meaning but does not fully explore its implications.
Strengths
1. Model Combination for Complementary Strengths: The paper demonstrates that combining TRANSFER, WAC, and SIM-WAP models improves performance in object naming tasks. This finding is significant as it highlights the complementary nature of different approaches to integrating visual and lexical information.
2. Zero-shot Learning Insights: The experiments on zero-shot naming provide valuable insights into the challenges of generalizing referential word meaning to unseen categories. The SIM-WAP model's ability to generalize better than TRANSFER and WAC in these scenarios is a notable result.
3. Empirical Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough empirical evaluation of the models, including detailed analysis of their strengths and weaknesses in both standard and zero-shot setups. The inclusion of cosine similarity metrics and qualitative examples adds depth to the evaluation.
Weaknesses
1. Unclear Novelty of SIM-WAP: The paper positions the SIM-WAP model as a key contribution but fails to provide sufficient detail about its novelty compared to prior work. It appears to be an incremental extension of previously cited models, raising questions about its originality.
2. Limited Vocabulary in Zero-shot Experiments: The zero-shot experiments are constrained by a small vocabulary size (159 words), which limits the generalizability of the findings. Scaling up to larger vocabularies is necessary to validate the conclusions.
3. Lack of Statistical Significance Scores: The absence of significance testing for accuracy results weakens the empirical claims. Without statistical validation, it is difficult to assess the reliability of the reported improvements.
4. Insufficient Explanation in Section 4.2: The choice of top-N values for distributional vectors in the WAC model is not adequately justified or experimentally explored. This omission leaves a gap in understanding the model's design decisions.
5. Abstract and Language Issues: The abstract does not effectively highlight the novelty or key findings of the paper. Additionally, the draft contains several typos and language issues, which detract from its readability and professionalism.
Questions to Authors
1. Can you clarify the specific novelty of the SIM-WAP model compared to prior work? How does it advance beyond existing methods like WAC or TRANSFER?
2. Why was the vocabulary size for zero-shot experiments limited to 159 words? Are there plans to scale up these experiments to larger datasets?
3. Could you provide significance scores for the accuracy results to strengthen the empirical claims?
4. What motivated the choice of top-N values for distributional vectors in Section 4.2? Have alternative values been tested?
Recommendation
While the paper provides interesting insights into the complementary strengths of different models for referential word meaning, its contributions are undermined by unclear novelty, limited experimental scope, and methodological gaps. I recommend major revisions to address these issues before acceptance. Specifically, the authors should clarify the novelty of SIM-WAP, expand the zero-shot experiments, and provide statistical significance scores for their results. Additionally, the abstract and language should be revised for clarity and professionalism.
