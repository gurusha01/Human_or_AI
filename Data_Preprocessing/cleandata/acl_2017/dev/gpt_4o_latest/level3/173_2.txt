Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions
This paper introduces a novel document clustering framework leveraging the Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover's Distance) to quantify dissimilarity between documents represented as empirical measures over word embedding space. The proposed approach avoids fixed-length vector representations and high-level assumptions, offering a robust and intuitive alternative to traditional clustering methods. The authors demonstrate that their method consistently outperforms established techniques across a variety of datasets, including short-text, long-text, and domain-specific corpora. The two primary contributions of the paper are: (1) the development of a computationally efficient, nonparametric clustering tool that achieves state-of-the-art performance, and (2) the ability to quantitatively evaluate the benefits of word embeddings over traditional bag-of-words models in document clustering tasks.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Performance: The proposed clustering framework is innovative in its use of Wasserstein distance and nonparametric clustering, achieving superior results compared to established methods. Its performance is particularly notable on short-text datasets, where traditional methods often struggle due to sparsity.
   
2. Thorough Analysis: The paper provides a detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. It compares the framework against a wide range of baseline methods across multiple datasets and metrics, offering convincing evidence of its robustness and effectiveness.
3. Clear Presentation: Despite the technical density of the content, the paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The inclusion of sensitivity analyses and runtime comparisons further strengthens the empirical validation.
4. Impact Potential: The framework's ability to isolate the gains from word embeddings and its applicability to diverse datasets make it a valuable tool for document analysis. Its potential to influence future research in clustering and embedding evaluation is significant.
Weaknesses
1. Software Availability: The paper does not provide sufficient information about the availability of the described software or implementation details. While the authors mention using existing numerical toolboxes, the lack of clarity on reproducibility may hinder adoption by the research community.
2. Language and Typos: The manuscript contains minor English errors and typos that detract slightly from its readability. For example, phrases like "subject to the interest of task" and "jargons that have knowledge dependencies" could be revised for clarity.
Questions to Authors
1. Is the implementation of the proposed framework publicly available? If not, do you plan to release it to facilitate reproducibility and adoption?
2. Could you provide more details on the computational resources required for the experiments, particularly for large datasets? This would help assess the scalability of the approach.
Additional Comments
Overall, this paper makes a strong case for the adoption of Wasserstein-based clustering in document analysis. Addressing the minor weaknesses, particularly around software availability, would further enhance its impact and usability. The work is a valuable contribution to the field and merits acceptance.
