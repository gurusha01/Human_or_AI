Review of the Paper
Summary and Contributions  
This paper presents a novel nonparametric clustering framework for document analysis that leverages the Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover's Distance) to quantify dissimilarities between empirical measures over word embedding spaces. The authors propose a scalable D2-clustering approach that avoids fixed-length vector representations and high-level assumptions, offering a principled and robust alternative to existing methods. The paper claims two key contributions: (1) the development of a computationally efficient document clustering tool that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets, and (2) the ability to quantitatively assess the gains of word embeddings over traditional bag-of-words models in clustering tasks. The authors validate their method on six datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to nine baseline approaches.
Strengths  
1. Innovative Use of Wasserstein Distance: The paper effectively integrates the Wasserstein distance into a clustering framework, which is both intuitive and theoretically grounded. This approach sidesteps the limitations of fixed-length vector representations and provides a robust metric for document dissimilarity.  
2. Scalability and Computational Efficiency: The modified Bregman ADMM algorithm for computing Wasserstein barycenters is well-implemented, enabling the proposed method to scale to large datasets. The runtime analysis and pruning strategies (e.g., Elkan's algorithm) further highlight the efficiency of the approach.  
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on six datasets, covering both short and long texts, as well as domain-specific data. The results consistently show that D2-clustering outperforms traditional methods, particularly in short-text scenarios where bag-of-words models struggle with sparsity.  
4. Practical Utility: The framework is easy to use, with minimal hyperparameters, and provides actionable insights into the effectiveness of word embeddings for specific tasks. This makes it a valuable tool for practitioners in natural language processing (NLP).  
Weaknesses  
1. Limited Novelty in Algorithmic Design: While the application of Wasserstein distance to document clustering is compelling, the core algorithm relies heavily on existing methods (e.g., Bregman ADMM). The novelty lies more in the application than in the methodological advancements.  
2. Domain-Specific Limitations: The method shows limited improvement on domain-specific datasets like Ohsumed, where the semantic knowledge embedded in pre-trained word embeddings may not capture domain-specific nuances. This highlights the need for task-specific embeddings, which the paper does not address in depth.  
3. Computational Overhead: Despite the efficiency improvements, the method remains computationally expensive compared to simpler clustering techniques, particularly for large-scale datasets. This trade-off between computational cost and clustering quality could limit its adoption in resource-constrained settings.  
4. Lack of Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the paper does not provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the clustering framework, such as convergence guarantees or sensitivity to hyperparameters like the number of clusters (K) and support size (m).  
Questions to Authors  
1. How does the performance of D2-clustering vary with different pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., domain-specific vs. general-purpose embeddings)?  
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to incorporate hierarchical or multi-level clustering for more complex datasets?  
3. What are the practical implications of the computational overhead for real-world applications, and are there further optimizations that could mitigate this issue?  
Conclusion  
Overall, this paper presents a robust and effective clustering framework that advances the state of the art in document analysis. While the novelty lies more in the application of existing techniques than in algorithmic innovation, the empirical results and practical utility make it a strong contribution to the field. Addressing the limitations related to computational cost and domain-specific embeddings could further enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
