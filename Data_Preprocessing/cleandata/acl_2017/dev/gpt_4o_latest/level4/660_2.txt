The paper presents two methodologies for the automatic generation of rhythmic poetry, both of which utilize neural networks. The second methodology, however, offers enhanced control over the poem's form.
- Strengths:
Effective procedure for generating rhythmic poetry.
Proposals for incorporating control over theme and poetic devices (e.g., alliteration, consonance, assonance).
Strong performance in rhythm evaluation.
- Weaknesses:
Insufficient review of existing literature on poetry generation.
Lack of comparison with prior approaches to poetry generation.
No evaluation of results concerning theme and poetic devices.
- General Discussion:
The introduction frames the problem of poetry generation as comprising two subtasks: content (the poem's semantics) and form (the aesthetic rules the poem adheres to). The solutions proposed in the paper address both subtasks to a limited extent. Neural networks, trained on poetry corpora (represented at either the phonetic or character level, depending on the approach), are employed to ensure linguistic coherence in the generated outputs. While this guarantees that the outputs resemble meaningful text, it would be an exaggeration to claim that this fully resolves the issue of providing appropriate semantics to the poems. 
The problem of form is addressed effectively in terms of rhythm, and partial solutions are proposed for certain poetic devices. However, aspects of form at a larger structural scale (e.g., stanzas and rhyme schemes) remain unaddressed. Despite these limitations, the paper represents a commendable contribution to advancing the field of poetry generation.
The related work section (Section 2) is notably weak. It fails to include even the prior efforts that the authors themselves later reference in the paper (e.g., the work of Manurung et al., 2000, and Misztal and Indurkhya, 2014, which are mentioned on page 4 but omitted from Section 2). 
The authors should also consider the following relevant research efforts:
1. Barbieri et al. (2012):  
   - Gabriele Barbieri, François Pachet, Pierre Roy, and Mirko Degli Esposti. 2012. Markov constraints for generating lyrics with style. In Proceedings of the 20th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'12), IOS Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 115-120.  
   - DOI: [https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-115](https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-115)  
   This work tackles similar problems, such as n-gram-based generation and the use of additional constraints to guide the generation process. The authors should review this work and discuss its similarities and differences with their own approach.
2. McGregor et al. (2016):  
   - Stephen McGregor, Matthew Purver, and Geraint Wiggins. Process-Based Evaluation of Computer-Generated Poetry. In Proceedings of the INLG 2016 Workshop on Computational Creativity and Natural Language Generation, pages 51–60, Edinburgh, September 2016.  
   This work is relevant as it models language at a phonological level, incorporates a word-level n-gram model, and includes a sentiment layer. Additionally, its considerations regarding the evaluation of computer-generated poetry are pertinent to the extrinsic evaluation described in the current paper.
3. Ghazvininejad et al. (2016):  
   - M. Ghazvininejad, X. Shi, Y. Choi, and K. Knight. Generating Topical Poetry. Proceedings of EMNLP, 2016.  
   This work combines finite-state machinery with deep learning to generate iambic pentameter. A comparison between this approach and the methods proposed in the current paper would be insightful.
Furthermore, while less directly relevant, the authors should consider expanding their classification of poetry generation systems. They currently mention rule-based expert systems and statistical approaches but omit evolutionary methods. For instance, they reference the work of Manurung, which employs an evolutionary approach using TAG grammars, but this is not explicitly discussed in the classification.
Overall, the paper lacks sufficient effort to compare its contributions with prior work in poetry generation. The authors should contextualize their research within the broader landscape of previous efforts, particularly when addressing similar problems (e.g., Barbieri et al., 2012) or employing comparable methods (e.g., Ghazvininejad et al., 2016).
