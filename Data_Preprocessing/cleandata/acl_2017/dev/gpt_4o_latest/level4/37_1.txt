- Strengths:
The paper provides a relatively clear explanation of the context and structure of the proposed approach. It also includes a fairly comprehensive mathematical description and compares the method to a wide range of alternative systems.
- Weaknesses:
The results and summary of the "side-by-side human" comparison in Section 5 are weak. Additionally, there are instances of disfluency and agrammaticality in the text.
- General Discussion:
The paper introduces a principled approach to modeling utterance context, which involves a sequence of prior utterances. However, there are some minor issues:
1. Numbering the past turns in Table 1 could improve readability, as it would make the associated text (lines 095-103) easier to follow. Currently, readers must manually count the turns to match the references in the description, which could lead to confusion about whether terms like "second," "third," and "last" refer to side-specific or global enumeration.
2. The term "segment" in "segment level" (line 269) should be explicitly defined to reduce ambiguity. Earlier, on line 129, a similar concept was referred to as "a sequence-sequence [similarity matrix]." These terms appear to be used interchangeably, but their precise meaning is unclear. It seems the authors may be referring to "word subsequence" or "word subsequence to word subsequence," where "sub-" implies "not the whole utterance," but this is not certain.
3. The variable "n" is used inconsistently, representing both the enumeration of words in an utterance (line 306) and the enumeration of utterances in a dialogue (line 389). Using distinct letters for these different purposes would help avoid confusion when readers work through the equations.
4. The claim at the end of Section 5—"This indicates that a retrieval-based chatbot with SMN can provide a better experience than the state-of-the-art generation model in practice"—is not adequately supported. The two approaches are deemed comparable in 555 out of 1000 cases, with the baseline outperforming the proposed method in 238 of the remaining 445 cases. The authors should evaluate and report the statistical significance of this comparison. If the difference is not statistically significant, the claim should be revised to state that the proposed method is "no worse" rather than "better" than the VHRED baseline.
5. Adding explicit labels such as "first layer," "second layer," and "third layer" to Figure 1, as referenced in the accompanying text, would enhance clarity.
6. The pervasive use of the phrase "to meet," as in "a response candidate can meet each utterance" (line 280), is unclear and difficult to interpret.
7. Spelling and grammatical issues: "gated recurrent unites" should be corrected; "respectively" on line 133 should be removed; punctuation errors on lines 186 and 188 should be fixed; "baseline model over" should be revised to "baseline model by"; and "one cannot neglects" should be corrected.
