- Strengths:  
Presents a novel document clustering method and evaluates it against several well-established techniques, demonstrating improved performance in most scenarios. The analysis is comprehensive and meticulous—though quite dense in parts, requiring close attention to detail.  
The paper is well-structured and clearly presented. I am particularly impressed by the breadth of comparisons and the consideration of various influential factors. The arguments are persuasive, and the work is likely to shape future methodologies in this area.  
- Weaknesses:  
The paper does not mention whether the software described is publicly available.  
- General Discussion:  
The manuscript requires minor revisions for English language and typographical errors. Below are a few examples:  
Line 124: "regardless the size" → "regardless of the size"  
Line 126: "resources. Because" → "resources, because"  
Line 205: "consist- ing mk" → "consisting of mk"  
Line 360: "versionand" → "version and"
