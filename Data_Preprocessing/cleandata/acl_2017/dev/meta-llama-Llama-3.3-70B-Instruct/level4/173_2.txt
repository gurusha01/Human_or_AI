Line 126: A comma is required after "resources" to improve sentence clarity, resulting in "resources, because".
Line 205: The term "consist-ing mk" contains a typographical error and should be corrected to "consisting of mk".
Line 360: The text "versionand" requires a space between "version" and "and" to read correctly as "version and".
