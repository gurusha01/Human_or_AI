AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE
I acknowledge the authors' response regarding the emphasis on the novelty of the task and the comparison with prior work. Additionally, I have increased my ratings for the dataset and software, as they are expected to be made publicly available prior to the publication of the article.
======================
GENERAL 
The paper presents an intriguing empirical comparison of three referring expression generation models, with the primary novelty stemming from the comparison of the yet-unpublished SIM-WAP model (currently in press by Anonymous), which is described in Section 4.3. However, it remains unclear whether this model has been extended or modified in any way for the purposes of this paper.
The paper's novelty may be viewed as the comparison of the unpublished SIM-WAP model to two existing models. This complicates the evaluation of novelty, as similar experiments have already been conducted for the other two models, and it is unclear why this comparison was not performed in the original paper presenting the SIM-WAP model. A significant contribution could be the combined model, although this is not explicitly stated, and the combination is not described in sufficient detail.
The paper's contributions can be considered as follows: a side-by-side comparison of the three methods for referring expression generation; an analysis of zero-shot experiment results, which largely confirms similar observations in previous studies; and an analysis of the complementarity of the combined model.
WEAKNESSES
The paper's novelty and significance of contributions are unclear. The work appears to be an experimental extension of the cited Anonymous paper, where the primary method was introduced.
Another weakness is the limited vocabulary size in the zero-shot experiments, which seems to be the most contributive aspect of the paper.
Furthermore, the authors fail to provide significance scores for their accuracy results, which would have strengthened the empirical contribution of the work, its primary value.
In my opinion, the paper would be more suitable for a conference focused on empirical methods, such as EMNLP.
Additionally, I was unable to find a link to any usable software, and the paper relies on existing datasets.
Observations by Sections:
ABSTRACT
The statement "We compare three recent models" could be improved by highlighting the experimentation with the combination of approaches, as mentioned in Section 2. A more accurate summarization of the paper's novelty could be: "We present a model that exploits distributional knowledge for learning referential word meaning and explore different ways of combining visual and lexical aspects of referential word meaning." This rephrased abstract could better convey the value of the work.
My suggestion is to rewrite the abstract (and potentially some sections of the paper) to focus on the novel model and results, rather than simply stating the comparison of existing models.
INTRODUCTION
A typo is present in the sentence "Determining such a name is is." Additionally, "concerning e.g." should be replaced with "concerning, e.g.," and the phrase "having disjunct extensions" could be clarified with examples. The sentence "building in Figure 1" should be revised to "building in Figure 1 (c)".
SECTION 4
The phrase "Following e.g. Lazaridou et al. (2014)" should be rephrased to omit "e.g."
SECTION 4.2
The sentence "associate the top n words with their corresponding distributional vector" lacks specificity regarding the values of N used. If experiments were conducted to determine the optimal values, they should be described, as this is original work. The choice of top N = K is not obvious, and it is unclear why it should be considered optimal (e.g., why not find similar vectors to each 5 in the top 20?).
SECTION 4.3
The sentence "we annotate its training instances with a fine-grained similarity signal according to their object names" could be exemplified to provide clarity.
LANGUAGE
The draft contains several typos, and the language should be refined ("as well such as"). It is recommended to use the American English spelling standard (e.g., "summarise" -> "summarize"). The authors should verify this with the conference track chairs.
