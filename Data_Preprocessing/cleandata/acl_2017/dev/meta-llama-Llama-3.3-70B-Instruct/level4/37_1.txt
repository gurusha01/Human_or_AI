Strengths:
The proposed approach is described with relative clarity in terms of its context and structure, and the mathematical components are thoroughly explained. Furthermore, the authors provide a comprehensive comparison with a wide range of alternative systems.
Weaknesses:
The results and summary of the "side-by-side human" comparison presented in Section 5 are somewhat underwhelming. Additionally, there are instances of disfluency and agrammaticality throughout the text.
General Discussion:
This article introduces a principled method for modeling utterance context, which is based on a sequence of preceding utterances. However, there are several minor issues that need to be addressed:
1. To enhance readability, it would be beneficial to number the past turns in Table 1, making the associated text (lines 095-103) easier to follow. Currently, readers have to manually count the turns from the top when referencing the authors' description, which may lead to confusion regarding whether the terms "second", "third", and "last" refer to a side-specific or global enumeration.
2. Explicitly defining the term "segment" in "segment level" (line 269) would help eliminate potential reader confusion. Although this term appears to be used interchangeably with "a sequence-sequence [similarity matrix]" (line 129), its actual meaning remains unclear despite the explanation provided in section 3.3. It seems that the authors might be referring to "word subsequence" and "word subsequence to word subsequence", where "sub-" implies a part of the utterance rather than the entire utterance, but further clarification is needed.
3. The variable symbol "n" is used to enumerate both words in an utterance (line 306) and utterances in a dialogue (line 389), which may cause confusion among readers. To avoid this, the authors could use distinct letters for these two purposes in their equations.
4. The statement at the end of section 5, "This indicates that a retrieval-based chatbot with SMN can provide a better experience than the state-of-the-art generation model in practice," appears to be unsupported. Given that the two approaches are deemed comparable in 555 out of 1000 cases, and the baseline is better than the proposed method in 238 out of the remaining 445 cases, the authors should assess and present the statistical significance of this comparison. If the comparison is weak, they can only claim that their proposed method is no worse than the VHRED baseline, rather than superior.
5. Adding explicit labels for the "first layer", "second layer", and "third layer" to Figure 1, as used in the accompanying text, would improve clarity.
6. The pervasive use of the phrase "to meet" (e.g., "a response candidate can meet each utterance" on line 280) is difficult to understand and may require rephrasing for better comprehension.
7. Several minor errors were noted, including spelling mistakes ("gated recurrent unites"), unnecessary words ("respectively" on line 133), punctuation errors (lines 186 and 188), and grammatical errors ("baseline model over" should be "baseline model by", and "one cannot neglects" is incorrect).
