Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a sequential matching network (SMN) for response selection in multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based chatbots. The SMN model matches a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of granularity and accumulates the matching information in a chronological order using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The model is evaluated on two public datasets, Ubuntu Corpus and Douban Conversation Corpus, and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
Main Contributions
1. Proposal of a new context-based matching model for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots.
2. Publication of a large human-labeled data set, Douban Conversation Corpus, for multi-turn response selection.
3. Empirical verification of the effectiveness of the model on public datasets.
Strengths
1. The SMN model effectively captures the relationships among utterances in the context and identifies important information for response selection.
2. The model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets.
3. The publication of the Douban Conversation Corpus provides a valuable resource for the research community.
Weaknesses
1. The model relies on a heuristic method for candidate retrieval, which may not be optimal.
2. The model does not explicitly model logical consistency of responses, which may be an important aspect of conversation.
3. The model's performance may degrade with longer context lengths or more complex conversations.
Questions to Authors
1. How do you plan to improve the candidate retrieval method to make it more effective?
2. Can you provide more details on how the SMN model captures logical consistency of responses?
3. How do you plan to extend the SMN model to handle longer context lengths or more complex conversations?
