This paper proposes a novel approach to response selection for multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based chatbots. The authors introduce a sequential matching network (SMN) that matches a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of granularity and accumulates the matching information through a recurrent neural network (RNN). The SMN model is designed to address the challenges of identifying important information in the context and modeling relationships among utterances.
The main contributions of this work are:
1. The proposal of a new context-based matching model, SMN, which can effectively capture the relationships among utterances in a conversation context.
2. The publication of a large human-labeled data set, Douban Conversation Corpus, which can facilitate research on multi-turn response selection.
3. The empirical verification of the effectiveness of the SMN model on public data sets, including the Ubuntu Corpus and the Douban Conversation Corpus.
The strengths of this paper are:
1. The SMN model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on both data sets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the relationships among utterances.
2. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance, including visualization of the similarity matrices and gates of the RNN, which helps to understand how the model identifies important information in the context.
3. The paper publishes a new data set, Douban Conversation Corpus, which can facilitate research on multi-turn response selection and provide a more realistic evaluation of chatbot models.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. The SMN model requires a large amount of labeled data to train, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.
2. The model's performance may degrade when the context length increases, as the RNN may struggle to capture long-range dependencies.
3. The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art models, such as those using attention mechanisms or graph-based approaches.
Questions to authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of requiring large amounts of labeled data to train the SMN model?
2. Can the authors provide more details on how the SMN model captures long-range dependencies among utterances, and how it can be improved to handle longer context lengths?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the SMN model to handle more complex conversation scenarios, such as those involving multiple topics or speakers?
