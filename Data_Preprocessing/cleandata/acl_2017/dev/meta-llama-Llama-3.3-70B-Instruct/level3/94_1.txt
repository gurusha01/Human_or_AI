This paper proposes a novel approach to dependency parsing by extending non-monotonic transition systems and dynamic oracles to unrestricted non-projective dependency parsing. The authors provide a clear and insightful theoretical and algorithmic analysis, making significant contributions to the field.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. The proposal of a new context-based matching model for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots.
2. The publication of a large human-labeled data set for multi-turn response selection, which can facilitate further research in this area.
3. The empirical verification of the effectiveness of the proposed model on public data sets.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The novel approach to dependency parsing, which extends non-monotonic transition systems and dynamic oracles to unrestricted non-projective dependency parsing.
2. The clear and insightful theoretical and algorithmic analysis, which provides a thorough understanding of the proposed model.
3. The significant improvements in parsing accuracy over the monotonic counterpart for most languages studied.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper, including:
1. The lack of empirical error analysis focusing on non-projective structures, which would have further strengthened the paper.
2. The limited discussion on the relationship between the empirical results and the state of the art, particularly with recent improvements using word embeddings and neural network techniques.
Some questions to the authors include:
1. Why only 9 out of 13 CoNLL-X shared task data sets were used in the experiments?
2. Why does the accuracy decrease for certain languages like Basque with the non-monotonic system?
3. How does the proposed model handle cases where the context is very long or very short?
Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of dependency parsing and provides a novel approach to multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. However, some weaknesses and questions need to be addressed to further improve the paper.
