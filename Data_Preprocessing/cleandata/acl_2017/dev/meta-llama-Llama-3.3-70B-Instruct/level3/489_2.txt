This paper presents an empirical comparison of three referring expression generation models, with a focus on the unpublished SIM-WAP model. The main contribution of the paper is the side-by-side comparison of the three models, including an analysis of their performance in a zero-shot experiment and an examination of the complementarity of the combined model.
The paper's strengths include its thorough evaluation of the models, which provides valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the benefits of combining visual and lexical information when modeling referential word meaning. The use of a corpus of referring expressions produced by human users under natural, interactive conditions adds to the paper's strengths, as it allows for a more realistic evaluation of the models.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. One of the main limitations is the unclear novelty and significance of the contributions, as similar experiments have already been performed for the other two models. Additionally, the limited size of the vocabulary in the zero-shot experiments may not be representative of real-world scenarios. The lack of significance scores for accuracy results also makes it difficult to determine the statistical significance of the differences between the models.
Furthermore, the paper may be more suitable for a conference on empirical methods, and the authors should consider rewriting the abstract to focus on the novel model and results. The paper also contains several typos and language errors, which should be cleaned up to improve clarity and readability.
In terms of contributions, the paper provides three main contributions: (1) a side-by-side comparison of the three models, (2) an analysis of the zero-shot experiment results, and (3) an examination of the complementarity of the combined model. These contributions are significant, as they provide new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models and highlight the benefits of combining visual and lexical information when modeling referential word meaning.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and provides a thorough evaluation of the models. However, the authors should address the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above to improve the paper's clarity, readability, and significance. 
Questions to authors:
1. Can you provide more details on the SIM-WAP model and how it differs from the other two models?
2. How do you plan to address the limited size of the vocabulary in the zero-shot experiments?
3. Can you provide significance scores for the accuracy results to determine the statistical significance of the differences between the models?
4. How do you plan to improve the clarity and readability of the paper, particularly in terms of typos and language errors?
