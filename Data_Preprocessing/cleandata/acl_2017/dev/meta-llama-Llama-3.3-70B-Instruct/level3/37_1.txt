This paper proposes a sequential matching network (SMN) for response selection in multi-turn conversation. The SMN model matches a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of granularity and accumulates the matching information through a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model relationships among the utterances. The model is evaluated on two public data sets, Ubuntu Corpus and Douban Conversation Corpus, and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
The main contributions of this paper are: 
1. Proposal of a new context-based matching model for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots.
2. Publication of a large human-labeled data set for multi-turn response selection.
3. Empirical verification of the effectiveness of the model on public data sets.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The proposed SMN model is able to capture important information in the context and leverage it in matching, which is essential for response selection in multi-turn conversation.
2. The model is evaluated on two public data sets, which demonstrates its effectiveness and generalizability.
3. The paper publishes a new human-labeled data set, which can facilitate future research in multi-turn response selection.
However, there are some weaknesses in this paper:
1. The results and summary of the "side-by-side human" comparison are weak and lack clarity, with some disfluency and agrammaticality issues.
2. The claim that the proposed method provides a better experience than the state-of-the-art generation model is unsupported and lacks statistical significance.
3. There are several minor errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar throughout the article.
Some questions to the authors include:
1. How did you determine the optimal hyperparameters for the SMN model, and what is the sensitivity of the model to these hyperparameters?
2. Can you provide more details on the "side-by-side human" comparison, such as the evaluation metrics and the number of human evaluators?
3. How do you plan to address the issue of logical consistency of responses in future work?
