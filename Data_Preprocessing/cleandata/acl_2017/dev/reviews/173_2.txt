- Strengths: Introduces  a new document clustering approach and compares it to
several established methods, showing that it improves results in most cases.
The analysis is very detailed and thorough--quite dense in many places and
requires careful reading.
The presentation is organized and clear, and I am impressed by the range of
comparisons and influential factors that were considered. Argument is
convincing and the work should influence future approaches.
- Weaknesses:
 The paper does not provide any information on the availability of the software
described.
- General Discussion:
Needs some (minor) editing for English and typos--here are just a few:
Line 124: regardless the size > regardless of the size
Line 126: resources. Because > resources, because
Line 205: consist- ing mk > consisting of mk
Line 360: versionand > version and
