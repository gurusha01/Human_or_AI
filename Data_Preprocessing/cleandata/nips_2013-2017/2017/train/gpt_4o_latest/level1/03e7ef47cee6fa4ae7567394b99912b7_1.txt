Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the problem of interactive clustering with an oracle, where the goal is to minimize the number of pairwise queries required to recover the true clustering of a dataset. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical study of the query complexity of this problem, presenting both information-theoretic lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds. A key contribution is the demonstration of how side information, in the form of a noisy similarity matrix, can drastically reduce the query complexity. The paper introduces efficient, parameter-free algorithms that work without prior knowledge of the number of clusters or the distributions of the similarity values. The authors also establish connections to the stochastic block model (SBM), a widely studied model for community detection, and propose a general framework for proving lower bounds in the interactive setting.
The paper builds on prior work in clustering, active learning, and community detection, particularly heuristic approaches that use side information to guide queries. While previous works lacked theoretical guarantees, this paper bridges that gap by providing both lower bounds and efficient algorithms with provable guarantees. The use of Hellinger divergence as a measure of separation between distributions is novel and well-motivated, and the iterative-update method for designing parameter-free algorithms is a significant contribution.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides strong information-theoretic lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds, advancing the understanding of query complexity in interactive clustering.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient and parameter-free, making them highly applicable to real-world scenarios where prior knowledge of parameters is unavailable.
3. Connection to SBM: The generalization of SBM to arbitrary distributions and the study of how query complexity changes with side information are valuable contributions.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on the Cora dataset demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed algorithms, showing that they achieve high precision and recall with a small number of queries.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly articulates the separation in query complexity with and without side information, providing insights into the power of side information in clustering tasks.
Weaknesses:
1. Logarithmic Gap: There remains a logarithmic gap between the lower and upper bounds, which the authors acknowledge but do not fully resolve. Closing this gap would strengthen the theoretical contribution.
2. Assumptions on Oracle: The paper assumes a perfect oracle, which may not always be realistic in practical crowdsourcing settings. While the authors briefly mention handling noisy oracle responses, this is not explored in depth.
3. Complexity of Analysis: The proofs, while rigorous, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with information theory or large deviation principles. Simplifying or summarizing key steps could improve accessibility.
4. Limited Dataset Evaluation: The experimental results are based on a single dataset (Cora). Additional experiments on diverse datasets would strengthen the empirical validation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by providing both lower bounds and efficient algorithms for interactive clustering with side information.
- The proposed algorithms are novel, parameter-free, and computationally efficient, addressing practical challenges in clustering tasks.
- The connection to SBM and the use of Hellinger divergence are innovative and open up avenues for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The logarithmic gap between lower and upper bounds leaves room for improvement in the theoretical results.
- The assumption of a perfect oracle may limit the applicability of the results in noisy real-world settings.
- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation and practical algorithms for interactive clustering, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Addressing the logarithmic gap and expanding the experimental evaluation would further enhance its impact.
