This paper introduces TranSync, a robust and scalable algorithm for solving the 1D translation synchronization problem, a fundamental task in applications such as point cloud alignment and ranking from relative comparisons. The authors propose an iterative truncated least squares approach, where noisy measurements are progressively pruned based on residuals. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for TranSync under both deterministic and randomized noise models, demonstrating its robustness to biased noise and its ability to handle a higher fraction of incorrect measurements compared to linear programming approaches. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that TranSync outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Theoretical Contributions: The paper is technically rigorous, providing detailed theoretical analysis of TranSync's robustness and stability. The deterministic and randomized noise model analyses are well-constructed, and the recovery guarantees are clearly articulated. The results demonstrate that TranSync tolerates a higher fraction of biased noise than linear programming approaches, advancing the state of the art.
   
2. Scalability and Efficiency: TranSync's computational efficiency is a significant strength, as it scales to large datasets where traditional methods such as interior point methods fail. The iterative warm-start approach for solving linear systems is particularly noteworthy.
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The paper demonstrates TranSync's superiority over baseline methods like coordinate descent in terms of accuracy and runtime, particularly on dense and irregular graphs.
4. Practical Applications: The application of TranSync to real-world problems, such as point cloud alignment and movie ranking, highlights its practical utility. The results, especially the recovery of the Patriot Circle Lidar dataset and the improved rankings in the Netflix dataset, are compelling.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is thorough, it is dense and could benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations in some sections. For example, the notation-heavy algorithm description may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with graph Laplacians and iterative optimization techniques.
2. Limited Baseline Comparisons: The experimental section compares TranSync primarily to coordinate descent. Including additional baselines, such as other robust optimization techniques or recent non-convex methods, would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
3. Recovery Rate Gap: The authors acknowledge a gap between the current recovery rate and the theoretical lower bound, which could be addressed in future work. Closing this gap would further solidify TranSync's theoretical contributions.
4. Generality: While the paper focuses on 1D translation synchronization, it would benefit from a discussion of how the approach generalizes to higher dimensions or other synchronization problems, such as rotations or permutations.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem with significant theoretical and practical implications.
- It provides a novel and effective algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical results.
- TranSync's scalability and robustness make it highly relevant for large-scale, noisy datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The clarity of the presentation could be improved, particularly for readers less familiar with the domain.
- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive with additional baselines.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of synchronization problems and optimization. While there are minor weaknesses in clarity and baseline comparisons, the strengths far outweigh these issues. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the experimental evaluation.
