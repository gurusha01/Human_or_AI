This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling human-like question generation, treating questions as programs that operate on the state of the world to produce answers. The authors propose a probabilistic generative model that balances informativeness and complexity, leveraging a compositional grammar to synthesize semantically meaningful and contextually relevant questions. The model is evaluated on a dataset of 605 natural language questions collected from humans playing an information-search game, demonstrating its ability to predict human question frequencies and generate novel, human-like questions. The work builds on prior research in active learning, cognitive science, and program synthesis, advancing the state of the art in modeling open-ended human question asking.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a unique approach to question generation by framing it as a program synthesis problem. This perspective is innovative and bridges active learning, cognitive science, and AI, offering a fresh lens to study question asking.
2. Technical Soundness: The probabilistic model is well-formulated, and the use of compositional grammars and Bayesian belief updating is methodologically rigorous. The inclusion of features like Expected Information Gain (EIG) and complexity reflects a thoughtful design.
3. Empirical Validation: The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset, demonstrating strong predictive performance and the ability to generate novel, contextually appropriate questions. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach strengthens the reliability of the results.
4. Significance: The work addresses a challenging and underexplored problem in AIâ€”creating systems capable of asking rich, human-like questions. The proposed framework has potential applications in active learning, dialogue systems, and cognitive modeling.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the model, dataset, and evaluation. The use of examples (e.g., specific questions generated by the model) aids comprehension.
Weaknesses
1. Domain Specificity: While the grammar is partially domain-general, the model relies heavily on domain-specific knowledge (e.g., the Battleship game). Extending this approach to other domains may require significant engineering, which limits its generalizability.
2. Natural Language Gap: The model operates on semantic representations rather than raw natural language, which may hinder its applicability in real-world scenarios where natural language input is required.
3. Sparse Human Data: The dataset is relatively small, and the sparsity of human questions limits the robustness of the evaluation. This is particularly evident in the modest alignment between model predictions and human question frequencies in certain contexts.
4. Computational Complexity: The reliance on importance sampling and the large hypothesis space make the model computationally expensive, which could pose challenges for scaling to larger datasets or more complex domains.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper tackles a novel and important problem with an innovative approach that advances the state of the art.
- The technical contributions are sound, and the results are compelling, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
- The work has broad implications for AI and cognitive science, with potential applications in active learning and human-machine interaction.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The domain-specific nature of the grammar and the reliance on semantic representations limit the model's generalizability and practical applicability.
- The dataset is small and context-specific, which may constrain the broader impact of the findings.
- The computational overhead of the approach could hinder its scalability.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions to modeling human-like question generation are significant and innovative. While there are limitations, the strengths of the work outweigh the weaknesses, and it represents a meaningful step toward more capable and human-like AI systems.
