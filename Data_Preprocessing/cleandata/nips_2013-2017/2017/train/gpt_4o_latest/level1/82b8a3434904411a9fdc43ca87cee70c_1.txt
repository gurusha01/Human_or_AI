The paper introduces a novel stochastic optimization algorithm, Stochastic MISO (S-MISO), designed for composite and strongly convex objectives in the presence of stochastic perturbations, such as those induced by data augmentation. The authors address a key limitation of existing variance reduction techniques, which are incompatible with stochastic settings where the objective is not a finite sum. By leveraging variance reduction, S-MISO achieves faster convergence than stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with a smaller constant factor dependent only on the variance introduced by perturbations. The algorithm bridges the gap between incremental methods for finite sums and stochastic approximation methods, making it applicable to hybrid scenarios. The authors provide theoretical guarantees, including a convergence rate of \(O(1/t)\) for the Lyapunov function, and demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy in practical machine learning scenarios, such as data augmentation and Dropout regularization.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses an underexplored problem—variance reduction in stochastic settings with data perturbations—and proposes an innovative solution. The method extends variance reduction techniques to a broader class of problems, filling a gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous convergence analysis, including iteration complexity and step-size strategies. The introduction of iterate averaging to improve convergence for ill-conditioned problems is a valuable contribution.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithm is well-motivated by real-world applications, such as data augmentation in computer vision and Dropout in gene expression and text data. The empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over SGD and related methods like N-SAGA.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the algorithm, theoretical results, and experimental setup. The inclusion of practical step-size strategies and memory considerations enhances its applicability.
Weaknesses:
1. Memory Requirements: S-MISO requires storing auxiliary variables for each data point, which scales with the dataset size. While this is reasonable for non-huge datasets, it limits the algorithm's applicability to very large-scale problems.
2. Comparison with Alternatives: The paper could include a more detailed discussion of trade-offs between S-MISO and other variance reduction methods, such as SVRG or SAGA, particularly in terms of computational and memory costs.
3. Limited Exploration of Non-Uniform Sampling: While the authors mention non-uniform sampling, its theoretical and practical implications are not explored in depth, leaving room for further investigation.
4. Empirical Validation: Although the experiments are comprehensive, additional benchmarks on larger datasets or alternative tasks (e.g., reinforcement learning) could strengthen the paper's claims about the generality of S-MISO.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution by extending variance reduction techniques to stochastic settings with data perturbations.

Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The memory requirements may limit the algorithm's scalability to very large datasets.
- The paper could provide a more detailed comparison with alternative methods and explore broader applications.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it advances the state of the art in stochastic optimization and provides a valuable tool for machine learning practitioners dealing with data perturbations. The strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations, and the proposed method has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
