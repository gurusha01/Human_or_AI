The paper revisits the classical analysis of generative versus discriminative models, extending it to general exponential families and high-dimensional settings. The authors develop a novel notion of separability for loss functions, which is used to derive `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators. This framework is applied to analyze the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models, focusing on the differential parameter estimation problem. The paper provides theoretical insights into the nuanced behaviors of these models in high-dimensional settings, demonstrating that the choice between generative and discriminative models depends on their respective separabilities. The authors also propose a methodological fix for generative models in high dimensions and validate their findings using isotropic and non-isotropic Gaussian examples, supported by simulations.
Strengths
1. Novel Contributions: The introduction of a generalized notion of separability for loss functions is a significant theoretical advancement. This concept enables a unified analysis of `1 convergence rates for M-estimators and provides deeper insights into the sample complexity of generative and discriminative models.
2. High-Dimensional Focus: Extending the classical generative-discriminative analysis to high-dimensional regimes is timely and relevant, given the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data in machine learning.
3. Thorough Theoretical Analysis: The paper rigorously derives `1 and `2 convergence rates for both generative and discriminative models, offering a comprehensive comparison. The results are well-supported by mathematical proofs and clearly articulated assumptions.
4. Practical Implications: The findings have practical implications for model selection in high-dimensional settings, particularly in scenarios where the separability of the loss function or sparsity of parameters plays a critical role.
5. Empirical Validation: The simulations corroborate the theoretical results, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed framework.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the theoretical contributions are substantial, the paper is dense and challenging to follow, especially for readers unfamiliar with high-dimensional statistics or M-estimators. The authors could improve clarity by providing more intuitive explanations and visualizations of key concepts, such as separability.
2. Limited Scope of Empirical Validation: The experiments focus primarily on isotropic Gaussian models. While these are illustrative, additional experiments with more complex generative models (e.g., non-Gaussian distributions) would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Practical Applicability: The proposed framework assumes access to high-quality generative models, which may not always be feasible in real-world applications. The paper could discuss the implications of model misspecification in more detail.
4. Comparisons with Prior Work: Although the authors reference related work, the discussion could be expanded to more explicitly highlight the differences and advantages of their approach compared to existing methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing a novel framework for analyzing convergence rates in high-dimensional settings.
- The results are well-supported by rigorous proofs and validated through simulations.
- The work addresses a relevant and challenging problem, advancing the understanding of generative and discriminative models in modern machine learning contexts.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
- The empirical validation is somewhat narrow in scope, focusing primarily on Gaussian models.
- Practical challenges, such as model misspecification, are not adequately addressed.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its theoretical contributions are substantial and advance the state of the art in understanding generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. However, the authors should consider improving the clarity of presentation and expanding the empirical validation in future work.
