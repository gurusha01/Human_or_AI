This paper introduces Hierarchical Implicit Models (HIMs), a novel class of Bayesian hierarchical models that leverage implicit densities, and proposes Likelihood-Free Variational Inference (LFVI), a scalable inference algorithm tailored for these models. HIMs extend the flexibility of implicit models, such as simulators and GANs, by incorporating rich latent structures like priors, hierarchies, and sequences. LFVI, in turn, addresses the challenges of inference in HIMs by employing implicit variational families and density ratio estimation, enabling accurate posterior approximations even for high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The paper demonstrates the utility of these contributions through diverse applications, including ecological simulation, Bayesian GANs for discrete data, and implicit sequence generation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The introduction of HIMs and LFVI represents a significant advancement in Bayesian modeling, merging implicit densities with hierarchical structures. This is a novel contribution that broadens the applicability of implicit models.
2. Scalability: LFVI is designed to handle large datasets, a critical requirement for modern machine learning applications. The experiments demonstrate scalability to datasets with 100,000 time series, which is infeasible with traditional methods like ABC.
3. Diverse Applications: The paper showcases the versatility of HIMs and LFVI through compelling use cases, including ecological simulations, Bayesian GANs for classification, and implicit sequence generation. The ability to handle discrete data in Bayesian GANs is particularly noteworthy, addressing a known limitation of traditional GANs.
4. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a detailed derivation of the LFVI algorithm, including the use of ratio estimation and reparameterization techniques. This ensures that the proposed methods are grounded in solid theoretical foundations.
5. Clarity of Experiments: The experiments are well-designed and compare the proposed methods against strong baselines like ABC and Bayesian neural networks. The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of HIMs and LFVI.
Weaknesses:
1. Stability of Ratio Estimation: While the paper acknowledges the instability of ratio estimation in LFVI, it does not provide a robust solution. This could limit the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.
2. Complexity: The proposed methods, particularly LFVI, are technically complex and may require significant expertise to implement. This could hinder adoption by practitioners.
3. Limited Real-World Applications: While the experiments are diverse, they are largely synthetic or small-scale. Demonstrating the methods on a large-scale, real-world application would strengthen the paper's impact.
4. Clarity of Writing: While the technical content is rigorous, the paper could benefit from improved clarity in certain sections, particularly in the derivation of LFVI. Non-expert readers may find it challenging to follow.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. The contributions are novel, significant, and well-supported by theoretical and experimental evidence. However, the authors should address the stability of ratio estimation and provide clearer explanations of the technical details to enhance accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contributions to Bayesian modeling and inference.
- Demonstrated scalability and versatility across diverse applications.
- Advances the state of the art in handling implicit models with hierarchical structures.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Stability issues with ratio estimation remain unresolved.
- Limited demonstration on large-scale, real-world datasets.
- Complexity may hinder adoption by non-expert users.
In summary, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field and aligns well with the goals of NIPS. It advances the state of the art in implicit modeling and scalable inference, and its acceptance would benefit the community.
