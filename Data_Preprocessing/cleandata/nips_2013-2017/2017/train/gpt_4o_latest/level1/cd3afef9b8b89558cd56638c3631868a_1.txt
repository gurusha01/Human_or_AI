The paper revisits the problem of online isotonic regression, focusing on the random permutation model as a practical alternative to the fixed design model. The authors address the challenge of fitting monotonic functions to sequentially arriving data, where the goal is to minimize regret relative to the best isotonic function in hindsight. They establish a connection between regret and excess leave-one-out loss, presenting efficient algorithms with matching lower bounds for the random permutation model. Additionally, they analyze forward algorithms, a class of practical methods, and propose a new "Heavy-γ" algorithm that shows promise for achieving optimal regret bounds.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Scope: The introduction of the random permutation model is a significant contribution, addressing the impracticality of the fixed design assumption in real-world scenarios. This model aligns well with natural data collection processes and bridges a gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical results, including regret bounds for the random permutation model and a connection between regret and leave-one-out loss. The proposed online-to-batch conversion is an elegant approach that leverages existing fixed design algorithms.
3. Practical Relevance: The analysis of forward algorithms, which are computationally efficient and widely used, makes the work accessible to practitioners. The authors also highlight the potential of the Heavy-γ algorithm for generalizing to partial orders, a critical area for future research.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear problem definitions, theoretical insights, and discussions of related work. The use of intuitive examples, such as the noise-free case and well-specified settings, aids understanding.
Weaknesses
1. Experimental Validation: While the theoretical analysis is robust, the paper lacks empirical results to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, particularly the Heavy-γ algorithm. Numerical experiments would strengthen the claims and provide practical insights.
2. Open Conjecture: The conjecture regarding the optimality of Heavy-γ with weight \(c = \Theta(t^{1/3})\) is intriguing but unproven. This leaves a key contribution incomplete and raises questions about its practical applicability.
3. Limited Generalization: The focus is primarily on linear orders, with only a brief discussion of partial orders. While the authors acknowledge this as an open problem, the lack of concrete results for partial orders limits the broader impact of the work.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pro:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in online isotonic regression by introducing the random permutation model.
- It provides strong theoretical contributions, including regret bounds and insights into forward algorithms.
- The work is relevant to both theoretical and practical audiences, with potential applications in various domains.
Con:
- The lack of empirical validation weakens the practical impact of the results.
- The conjecture on Heavy-γ remains unproven, leaving a key contribution speculative.
- Limited exploration of partial orders reduces the generality of the findings.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of online learning and isotonic regression, introducing a practical model and providing strong theoretical insights. However, the authors should address the lack of empirical validation and provide more discussion on the conjecture and its implications. These additions would significantly enhance the paper's impact and completeness.
