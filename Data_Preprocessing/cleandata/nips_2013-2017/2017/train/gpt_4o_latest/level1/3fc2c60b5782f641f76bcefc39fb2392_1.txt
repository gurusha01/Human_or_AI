This paper proposes an innovative end-to-end approach for training probabilistic machine learning models that directly optimize task-based objectives within the context of stochastic programming. The authors argue that traditional methods, which train models based on generic loss functions like log-likelihood, often fail to align with the ultimate task objectives. Instead, they suggest a framework that propagates task-specific loss through the stochastic programming process to update the model parameters. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through three experimental evaluations: a synthetic inventory stock problem, a real-world electrical grid scheduling task, and an energy storage arbitrage task. Across these applications, the proposed method outperforms both traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approaches and black-box policy optimization techniques.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a critical gap in machine learning by focusing on task-specific optimization rather than generic loss functions. This is a significant contribution to the growing body of work on end-to-end learning and stochastic programming.
2. Technical Soundness: The methodology is rigorously defined, with clear mathematical formulations and derivations. The authors also provide a detailed explanation of how gradients are computed through the stochastic programming process, which is a non-trivial technical challenge.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed and span a range of applications, from synthetic to real-world tasks. The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, including substantial performance improvements in grid scheduling (38.6%) and reduced variability in energy storage tasks.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and logically organized. The authors provide sufficient background on stochastic programming, end-to-end learning, and alternative loss optimization, making the work accessible to a broad audience.
Weaknesses
1. Generality of Results: While the experiments are compelling, the generalizability of the approach to other domains or more complex stochastic programming settings (e.g., multi-round decision-making) is not fully explored. The authors acknowledge this as future work, but additional discussion would strengthen the paper.
2. Computational Complexity: Differentiating through the "argmin" operator in stochastic programming is computationally intensive, and the scalability of the approach to larger or more complex problems is unclear.
3. Comparison Baselines: While the paper compares its approach to MLE and policy optimization, additional baselines, such as recent advancements in task-specific optimization or hybrid methods, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Limited Statistical Significance: In the energy storage task, the performance improvements are not statistically significant, which weakens the claim of consistent superiority.
