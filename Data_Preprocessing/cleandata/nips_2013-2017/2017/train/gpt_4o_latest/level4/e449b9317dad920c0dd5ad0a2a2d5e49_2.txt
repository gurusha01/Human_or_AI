The authors present a matrix factorization approach grounded in a one-sided Huber loss within the robust estimation framework. They provide asymptotic proofs of optimality for the proposed method. The approach is applied to the matrix factorization task of extracting cells and time courses from optogenetic neural measurements, demonstrating improvements over the CNMF matrix factorization method and ICA.
As I lack sufficient expertise in robust regression, I am unable to thoroughly evaluate the proofs. However, I trust the authors' claims regarding the novelty and correctness of their contribution. Within this context, the work represents a clear advancement by enabling matrix factorization tailored to the calcium imaging application.
The method is inherently more resilient to disruptive noise, which plausibly gives it an advantage over existing approaches.
In the evaluation on synthetic data, it might have been beneficial to explore more systematic variations in overlap and temporal similarity, comparing the results against other methods. This could provide deeper insights into the proposed method's limitations and systematically highlight its comparative strengths.
