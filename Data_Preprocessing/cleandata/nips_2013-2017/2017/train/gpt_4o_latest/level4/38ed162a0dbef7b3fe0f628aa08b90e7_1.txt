The paper investigates some appealing properties of deep convolutional kernel networks (CKNs), specifically their near invariance to groups of transformations and stability under the action of diffeomorphisms, provided that the patch extraction operator, kernel mapping operator, and pooling operator are carefully designed. The authors further demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, these desirable properties of CKNs also extend to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Overall, the paper is well-written and technically robust. The main limitation, however, is the absence of empirical experiments to support the theoretical findings. It would be valuable to include experimental results that confirm the conclusion that CKNs, when appropriately configured, exhibit invariance to transformations and diffeomorphisms.
Additionally, a related question arises regarding whether random projections or explicit kernel mappings using a finite number of Fourier series could serve as alternative solutions for kernel approximation. If so, it would be interesting to understand their impact on stability.
