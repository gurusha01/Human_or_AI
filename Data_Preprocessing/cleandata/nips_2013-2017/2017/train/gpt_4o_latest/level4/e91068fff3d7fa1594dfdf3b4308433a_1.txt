This paper introduces a novel gradient estimator for Variational Bayes that achieves zero variance when the variational distribution perfectly matches the true posterior distribution of the latent variables. The manuscript is well-written and clear. I believe it is suitable for acceptance after addressing a few minor revisions.
It would strengthen the paper to include an analysis of the scenario where the variational distribution deviates from the true posterior \( p(z|x) \). In such cases, the expectation of the score function is no longer zero, which implies that the proposed estimator may introduce bias. How significant or adversarial could the impact of this bias be?
Additionally, regarding the mixture ELBO in line 188, shouldn't there be a variational distribution defined over \( \pic \)? The manuscript does not seem to explicitly define \( zc \). How are these components selected in the variational mixture, and what implications does this selection have for reparameterization?
