This paper builds upon the recently introduced PointNet framework. Its primary contribution lies in enhancing PointNet by incorporating spatial relationships between points through grouping, thereby introducing a notion of locality and shift invariance for the low-level descriptors, making it more analogous to CNNs.
Although the contribution is relatively straightforward and represents an incremental step from PointNet, it is well-articulated and thoroughly evaluated. Implementing the method efficiently likely required significant effort, and it would be beneficial to include runtime performance metrics in the paper, as I did not notice them. Techniques such as sampling and centering could potentially improve computational efficiency significantly. The results are satisfactory, though not groundbreaking. For classification, the most relevant comparison would be between PointNet and PointNet++ without normals, yielding 89.2% and 90.7%, respectively. For segmentation, a similar comparison without normals should also be provided.
As an additional note, I found the results on SHREC non-rigid shape classification particularly interesting. It is uncommon to see papers that evaluate performance on both SHREC and ModelNet, which I appreciated.
