The paper introduces a variance reduction stochastic optimization algorithm tailored for scenarios involving data perturbations, explicitly addressing the fact that variance across datapoints is significantly higher than the variance among perturbations of a single datapoint. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the algorithm's improvements.
I appreciate the motivation to separately address perturbation variance, which leads to enhanced convergence. The convergence results are intriguing, though I was unable to fully verify their correctness.
There appear to be minor (non-critical) typographical errors in the derivation; for instance, on line 428: should it be (1-\alphat) instead of \alphat?
After reviewing the rebuttal, I maintain my original score.
