This paper addresses the challenge of representing simple routes on a graph as a probability distribution using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). Representing complex structures like graphs is inherently challenging, and the authors tackle this by transforming the graph into a Boolean circuit, enabling straightforward inference. As an application, they test their method on a route prediction task for San Francisco taxi cabs, where it outperforms two baseline methods.
PSDDs provide a framework for representing probability distributions over structured objects through Boolean circuits. Once the object is expressed as a Boolean circuit, it becomes easier to parameterize. Specifically, PSDDs are parameterized by defining a distribution over each or-gate, and they can represent any distribution (with uniqueness under certain conditions). The authors focus on the specific task of learning distributions over simple routes â€” those that are connected and acyclic. A key advantage of SDD circuits is their ability to handle graphs that would be computationally prohibitive to model using Bayesian networks. However, for large maps, PSDDs still face tractability issues. The authors address this by employing hierarchical approximations, dividing the map into hierarchical regions to ensure that representing distributions remains polynomial, provided the size of each region is constrained.
The paper is well-written, with clear and concise definitions of PSDDs provided by the authors.
However, the results presented in the paper feel incremental to me. The authors apply an existing representation framework to graphs and, after introducing some approximations, utilize established inference techniques. Furthermore, the paper dedicates several pages to theorems that appear to be relatively straightforward algorithmic results.
I am also not fully convinced by the choice of baselines in the experimental evaluation. For the task of predicting edges given a sequence of prior edges, the baselines include a naive frequency-based model and a Markov model that only considers the most recent edge. It seems likely that a deep learning approach or even a more sophisticated probabilistic diagram could have produced more meaningful and competitive results. While such methods might require longer training times, comparing model complexity alongside accuracy would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. To be persuaded by the proposed approach, I would need to see additional experiments and comparisons.
