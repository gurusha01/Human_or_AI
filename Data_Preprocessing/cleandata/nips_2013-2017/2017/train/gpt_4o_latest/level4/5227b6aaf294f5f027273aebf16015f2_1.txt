This paper introduces an innovative approach by employing a novel operator to replace the standard convolutional filter operation, traditionally based on matrix inner product. Rather than calculating the similarity between filter weights and pixel values (or activation values in intermediate layers), the proposed method computes the angle between them within the hypersphere space. The authors further define three types of operators, all expressed as functions of this angle: linear, cosine, and sigmoid. To complement this operation, they also redefine the regularization term and loss function. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of each proposed component, leading to improved performance on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as on image feature embedding tasks. The improvements are evident in terms of both higher accuracy and faster, more efficient convergence.
The paper is theoretically robust, well-structured, supported by well-organized experiments, and presented with clarity and elegance.
However, a limitation of the work is the lack of experiments on larger and more realistic image classification datasets, such as ImageNet, without any discussion or indication of future plans to address this. Additionally, it would be valuable to evaluate the method on a broader range of tasks, such as small-scale reinforcement learning problems.
