Review - Summary:  
This paper introduces the TranSync algorithm to address the 1D translation synchronization problem. Unlike many existing approaches, the proposed method leverages truncated least squares to mitigate the impact of noisy measurements. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm and validate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Qualitative:  
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The theoretical framework is clearly presented, with detailed proofs relegated to the supplementary materials. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated across a diverse range of experiments. However, including a brief overview of the key proof ideas in the main text would enhance the exposition. Overall, I find this work commendable.
