The authors investigated the link between Bayesian sparsity and LSTM networks, subsequently broadening the scope to include gated feedback networks. In particular, the paper initially examined the connection between sparse Bayesian learning and iterative reweighted l1 regularization, proceeded to analyze its relationship with LSTM networks, and ultimately extended the discussion to gated feedback networks. Experimental results were presented using both synthetic and real-world datasets.
