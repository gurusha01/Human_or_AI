This paper introduces a two-stage approach for robust submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint \( k \). In the first stage, the authors develop a robust streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which is based on a partitioning framework and a decreasing thresholding mechanism. In the second stage, the simple greedy algorithm is employed. The STAR-T algorithm is shown to provide a constant approximation guarantee when \( k \) approaches infinity (Theorem 4.1). Furthermore, Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 demonstrate that the combination of STAR-T with the simple greedy method can handle the loss of elements effectively.  
 
The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well on tasks such as influence maximization and personalized movie recommendation.  
This work is notable as it presents the first streaming algorithm for robust submodular maximization. The streaming setting proposed here has the potential for a broad range of applications, making this work highly insightful. The STAR-T algorithm includes two hyperparameters, \( \tau \) and \( w \). In Theorem 4.5, the authors provide a method to approximate \( \tau \), and experimental results suggest that setting \( w = 1 \) yields good performance. This makes STAR-T user-friendly, as it does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning.  
However, a major concern is that the experimental evaluation lacks expressiveness. The STAR-T-Greedy algorithm does not consistently outperform the Sieve-Stream algorithm. Additionally, the objective function for influence maximization, defined as \( f(Z) = |N(Z) \cup Z| \) (line 219), differs from the function used in the referenced work by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos ("Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network," SIGKDD 2003). It remains unclear how STAR-T performs under the standard influence spread model.
