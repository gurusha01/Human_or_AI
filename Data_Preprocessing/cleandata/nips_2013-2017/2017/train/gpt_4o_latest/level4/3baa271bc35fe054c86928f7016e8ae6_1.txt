Paraphrased Review:
Problem Studied: This paper addresses the following question: how to identify a set of elements \( T \) from a ground set \( E \) in a streaming setting such that, even after removing any subset of \( m \) elements from \( T \), it is still possible to select a subset \( S \) of \( k \) elements that maximizes \( f(S) \), where \( f \) is a submodular function.
Applications: Submodular function maximization has numerous applications, and streaming algorithms for this problem are well-established. The robust variant studied here is useful in scenarios where a solution is computed, but some elements may later need to be removed (e.g., recommending a set of movies to a user and subsequently discovering that the user is uninterested in certain movies).
Results: The paper presents a constant-factor approximation for this problem, producing a set \( T \) of size \((m \cdot \log k + k) \cdot \log^2 k\).
Comments: To the best of my understanding, the results presented in the paper are correct. The solution is non-trivial, and both the algorithm and its analysis involve significant technical depth. However, while the problem is interesting, my primary concern lies with the paper's relevance to the conference. The applications and their motivation appear relatively weak, and the problem itself lacks sufficient generality.
