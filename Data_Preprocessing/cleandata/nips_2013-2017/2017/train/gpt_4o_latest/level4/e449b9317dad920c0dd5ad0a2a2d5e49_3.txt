This paper addresses an important and timely topic in the automated signal detection of calcium imaging in neurons. The authors propose a novel methodology grounded in a carefully constructed noise model and robust statistical techniques. With the growing prevalence of calcium imaging experiments, there is increasing demand for advanced analytical methods to decipher correlations in neuronal firing patterns, and this work represents a significant contribution to the field.
The application of a robust location estimator is particularly compelling, especially given the substantial variability in signal and noise, as well as the pronounced presence of outliers in the neuropil. It is somewhat unexpected that prior methods have not incorporated this approach.
The authors' noise model, which characterizes the signal as a superposition of positive sources and a lower-amplitude normal component, is intriguing and enhances the statistical power of their analysis. However, in equations (2), these components should be labeled more explicitly to improve clarity for readers.
The authors provide a rigorous justification for the algorithm's convergence rate, which is shown to be fast.
The comparison of the proposed EXTRACT algorithm with two alternative methods on manually labeled microendoscopic single-photon imaging data is well-executed and demonstrates superior performance. That said, this section could benefit from further elaboration, with more explicitly stated performance metrics to complement the well-designed Figure 4.
In conclusion, this is a strong and impactful paper on a timely and relevant topic. Including details about the availability of the code and its potential deployment would further enhance its utility.
