The authors examine the functional form of the reparameterization trick for computing the gradient of the ELBO, highlighting that one term depends on the gradient with respect to the sample \( z \), referred to as the path derivative, while the other term does not depend on this gradient and is commonly referred to as the score function. They note that the score function has zero expectation but is not necessarily zero at specific samples of \( z \). The authors propose removing the score function term from the gradient, demonstrating that this can be achieved with a simple one-line modification in widely used autodiff software. They argue that this modification can reduce variance, particularly as the variational posterior approaches the true posterior, where the variance of the stochastic gradient approaches zero. Furthermore, they extend this idea in a nontrivial manner to more complex models.
While this is a practical and straightforward technique, especially given its implementation in autodiff software, the contribution does not appear to be sufficiently novel. The properties of the score function are well-established, and removing or rescaling the score function seems like a natural experiment to conduct.
The discussion of control variates in lines 124–146 is unclear and appears contradictory. My understanding is that setting the control variate scale \( c = 1 \) corresponds to including the score function term, i.e., using the standard ELBO gradient, while their method effectively sets \( c = 0 \), excluding the score function term. However, lines 140–146 suggest that better experimental results were obtained with \( c = 1 \) (the standard ELBO gradient) compared to \( c = 0 \) (the gradient without the score function term). This seems to contradict their experimental claims. It is possible that I have misunderstood this section, but after multiple readings, I am unable to arrive at a coherent interpretation.
The experimental results show only marginal improvements, though the proposed method is essentially cost-free.
