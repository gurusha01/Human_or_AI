This paper introduces a novel greedy coordinate descent algorithm that employs an innovative Gauss-Southwell coordinate selection rule. The proposed rule involves solving a convex minimization problem based on the squared l_1-norm to determine the coordinates to be updated. This selection strategy is both intriguing and designed with practical considerations in mind, which is a significant strength. Additionally, the authors have incorporated an acceleration mechanism and presented the ASGCD algorithm (Accelerated Stochastic Greedy Coordinate Descent). 
Greedy coordinate selection methods are currently gaining significant attention, and I believe this strategy will attract interest from many researchers. However, the paper contains numerous typographical errors, and the quality of English requires improvement. I recommend that the authors carefully proofread the manuscript to address these issues. Furthermore, while the numerical experiments provide evidence supporting the proposed algorithm, the test problems are relatively small in scale. It would have been beneficial for the authors to evaluate the algorithm on larger-scale problems to better demonstrate its effectiveness.
