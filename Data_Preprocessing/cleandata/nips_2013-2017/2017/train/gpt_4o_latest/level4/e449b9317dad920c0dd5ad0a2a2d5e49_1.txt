This paper introduces a robust statistical estimator designed to analyze calcium imaging data, extracting both timecourses and spatial filters of cells. This represents a significant application in neuroscience, where advancements that enhance algorithmic handling of cross-talk would be highly beneficial to the field. The proposed framework appears to be closely related to the CNMF method but incorporates a robust loss function. While I am not fully equipped to evaluate the novelty or validity of the statistical framework, I will focus my comments on its practical application.
My primary concern lies with Fig. 2d, where the estimation accuracy seems to deteriorate with each iteration. This might be due to the authors initializing the algorithm with ground truth cell locations, which is an unrealistic scenario and is not adequately justified in the paper. As a result, it is challenging to assess the claim that the EXTRACT algorithm outperforms CNMF (or ICA).
Additional comments:
- Line 47: The non-negativity of signals in calcium imaging data is not due to their origin from photons. Rather, it stems from the biological regulation of calcium in neurons, where baseline free calcium concentrations are near zero, and calcium levels increase dramatically upon the opening of voltage-gated ion channels.
- Why not simulate the data using a Poisson distribution to model photon shot noise? This would provide a more realistic noise model for fluorescence imaging data.
