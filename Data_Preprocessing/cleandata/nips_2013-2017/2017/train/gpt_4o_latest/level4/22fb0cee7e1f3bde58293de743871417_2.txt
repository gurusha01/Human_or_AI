The paper aims to identify the optimal policy for patient screening based on relevant information. To derive this policy, the disease is modeled as a finite-state stochastic process. The goal of the policy is to minimize both screening costs and delays. The authors present an approximate solution that is computationally efficient. Experiments conducted on simulated breast cancer data suggest that the proposed algorithm can reduce delays while maintaining the same cost compared to a simple baseline.
Strengths:
+ Personalized screening is a significant and impactful research area.  
+ The proposed algorithm is well-conceived and thoughtfully developed.  
+ The experimental results are encouraging.  
+ The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.  
Weaknesses:
- The proposed algorithm appears to be purely theoretical, as it assumes the disease model for a given patient is known. This assumption is unrealistic in practice, where the central challenge in personalized screening lies in inferring the disease model from data rather than designing a policy based on a known model.  
- The methodological contribution is modest.  
- The experiments only compare the proposed algorithm to a baseline involving annual screening. Considering the earlier point about the disease model, it is crucial to experimentally evaluate the robustness of the proposed method to inaccuracies in the disease model. Specifically, the sensitivity of the policy to uncertainties in the disease model should be investigated.  
Conclusion:  
The topic is compelling, and the proposed algorithm is reasonable. However, the methodological contribution is limited, and the paper needs to make a stronger case for its practical relevance.
