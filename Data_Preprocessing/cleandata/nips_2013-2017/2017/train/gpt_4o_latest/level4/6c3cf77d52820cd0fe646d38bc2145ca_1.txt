The paper investigates the impact of altering the transaction-flooding protocol in the Bitcoin network to counter deanonymisation attacks observed in the original pre-2015 protocol. The authors develop models for both the original protocol (trickle) and its updated version (diffusion), concluding that deanonymisation can be achieved with comparable effectiveness under both protocols. These claims are substantiated through simulations based on the respective models.
Quality of Presentation:
The paper is well-structured and generally well-written, though there are minor issues such as incomplete sentences and an unresolved reference. It provides sufficient background information for readers to understand the context and technical details. 
The depiction of the transaction-flooding protocols is thorough, and the assumptions underlying the models are clearly articulated.
Content-Related Questions:
- The authors cite a 30% probability of detecting participants, which, while relatively low, is still significant. However, a key assumption for deanonymisation is that the listening supernode must establish connections with all active Bitcoin nodes. Given the anticipated growth of the network, how feasible would this assumption be in the future? -- Edit: The authors' argument regarding the use of botnets offers a compelling counterpoint to this concern.
- Despite the depth of the analysis, the paper does not fully address the central claim that trickle and diffusion protocols perform equivalently in preserving anonymity. For instance, Figure 6 reveals a difference of approximately 0.1 in detection probability between the two protocols in simulations, with diffusion performing worse than trickleâ€”a difference that is not negligible. Meanwhile, Figure 7, which examines a real network snapshot, shows the opposite trend: diffusion outperforms trickle. (It is worth noting that the probabilities converge as the number of eavesdropper connections increases.) These conflicting results warrant further discussion, and the assertion that the two protocols exhibit "similar probabilities of detection" requires clarification. Specifically, how is "similarity" being defined and assessed in this context?
