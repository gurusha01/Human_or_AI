In this paper, the authors introduce a novel hyperspherical convolution framework leveraging angular representations. Unlike traditional CNNs, this framework employs SphereConv as its fundamental convolution operator. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations. Nonetheless, several concerns need to be addressed.
Firstly, regarding the Sigmoid SphereConv, how should the value of k be selected? Are there any specific recommendations? Secondly, what criteria should be used to select the appropriate SphereConv operator? To achieve optimal results, is it necessary to experiment with each SphereConv operator? Additionally, how does the complexity of the proposed convolution compare to that of the original convolution? From the reported results, the performance improvement achieved by the proposed convolution appears to be somewhat limited.
