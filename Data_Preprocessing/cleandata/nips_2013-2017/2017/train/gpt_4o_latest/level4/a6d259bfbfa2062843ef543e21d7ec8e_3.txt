The paper investigates the game tree structure of a two-player zero-sum game, where the payoff at each leaf node is stochastic, and the tree can have arbitrary depth. The objective is to determine the optimal move at the root that yields the highest payoff. The authors adopt a PAC framework, allowing for a sub-optimal move within a tolerance parameter $\epsilon$. Notably, the Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem can be viewed as a special case of this setup, corresponding to a tree of depth 1. The paper introduces two algorithms inspired by UGapE and LUCB, which are adapted to handle the hierarchical structure of the tree, including its depth and branching factors. The algorithms maintain confidence intervals for each leaf node and propagate these intervals upwards toward the root. Additionally, they designate a "representative" leaf for each internal node, which is the leaf to be sampled when updating the confidence interval of the corresponding internal node. The algorithms then proceed similarly to the BAI setting, identifying the two marginal children of the root in each iteration and sampling the representative leaf of one (or both, depending on the specific algorithm) of these children. The stopping condition mirrors the standard criterion used in BAI. Theoretical upper and lower bounds are derived, with the upper bounds resembling those of LUCB in BAI and the lower bounds also aligning closely with results from the BAI setting.
Overall, the paper is well-motivated, and the contributions significantly advance prior work both theoretically and experimentally. The experimental results are particularly notable, as the proposed algorithms require only about 1/7 of the samples compared to the state-of-the-art method. Furthermore, the paper is clearly written and easy to understand. However, while the problem addressed generalizes the BAI problem, the proposed algorithms and their analyses bear substantial similarity to those in the BAI setting. Additionally, although the paper cites the work by Jamieson et al. (2014) on the LIL technique, it does not explore whether incorporating this technique could enhance the results, either theoretically or experimentally. Given that LIL is known to improve confidence-bound-based approaches in the BAI setting, investigating its potential impact in the current context would strengthen the paper.
In conclusion, this is a strong paper, particularly due to the substantial improvements demonstrated in the experimental results.
