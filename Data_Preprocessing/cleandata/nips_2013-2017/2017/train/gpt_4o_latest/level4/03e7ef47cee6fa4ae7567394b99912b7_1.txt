This paper investigates the query complexity of clustering in the presence of 'side information.' The 'side information' is given in the form of a similarity matrix W, where the entry Wij is distributed according to f+ if i and j belong to the same cluster and f- if they belong to different clusters. The primary contribution of the paper is the demonstration that, in the absence of side information, Theta(nk) queries are required, whereas with side information, only O(k log n / H^2(f+||f-)) queries are necessary, where H denotes the Hellinger distance. Furthermore, the authors establish that this bound is tight up to a log(n) factor.
I find this to be a compelling theoretical result for several reasons. It is closely related to the stochastic block model (SBM), a topic that has garnered significant attention in recent years, but it explores the novel question of how the inclusion of queries alters the threshold. The work highlights that incorporating side information can dramatically reduce query complexity. While this observation is perhaps unsurprising—since the side information could, in principle, encode the complete cluster structure—the paper makes an important contribution by providing a framework to evaluate the quality of the similarity matrix.
