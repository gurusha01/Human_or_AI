POST-REBUTTAL REVIEW (PARAPHRASED):
The authors have addressed my concerns and clarified the point of confusion. I am updating my recommendation from a marginal accept to an accept.

Summary of the Paper (Paraphrased):
This work introduces a "safe" algorithm for contextual linear bandits. The notion of safety here assumes the presence of an existing "baseline policy" for action selection. The algorithm is deemed "safe" because it ensures that it only deviates from the baseline policy when the new action is expected to yield a higher reward than the baseline policy's action. Given the stochastic nature of rewards, this guarantee holds with high probability (at least \(1 - \delta\)).

Summary of Review (Paraphrased):
The paper is well-written and highly polished, making it an enjoyable readâ€”my compliments to the authors. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed problem setting and approach are novel. The problem is both interesting and well-motivated. The authors provide sufficient theoretical and empirical evidence to support the feasibility of their approach.
That said, I raised several questions that required clarification. While I initially recommended weak acceptance, I was open to stronger acceptance if my concerns were addressed.

Questions (Paraphrased):
1. Clarification of Definition 1:  
   Definition 1 introduces a desirable performance constraint. However, the high-probability nature of this constraint should be explicitly clarified. For instance, line 135 does not explicitly state that inequality (3) must hold with high probability. This should be made clear.
2. Ambiguity in Guarantee:  
   A more critical issue is the ambiguity in how inequality (3) is guaranteed. Upon first reading, it seems that (3) must hold with probability \(1 - \delta\) over the entire time horizon. However, this is not what the algorithm achieves. If I understand correctly (please correct me if I am wrong), the algorithm ensures that (3) holds with high probability at each time step. In other words:
   \[
   \forall t \in \{1, \dotsc, T\}, \Pr \left( \sum{i=1}^t r{bi}^i - \sum{i=1}^t r{ai}^i \leq \alpha \sum{i=1}^t r{b_i}^i \right) \geq 1 - \delta
   \]
   and not:
   \[
   \Pr \left( \forall t \in \{1, \dotsc, T\}, \sum{i=1}^t r{bi}^i - \sum{i=1}^t r{ai}^i \leq \alpha \sum{i=1}^t r{b_i}^i \right) \geq 1 - \delta
   \]
   The current phrasing suggests the latter, which (to my understanding) is not guaranteed by the algorithm. Could you please clarify which of these guarantees your algorithm satisfies?
3. Implications of Per-Step Guarantees:  
   If your algorithm indeed provides the former guarantee (a per-time step guarantee), this has implications for the motivation of the paper. Specifically, the limitations of this approach should be acknowledged upfront in the introduction.
   Consider the guarantee provided in the empirical study. The algorithm is run for 40,000 time steps with \(\delta = 0.001\). The algorithm is designed to ensure that "with high probability," it performs at least as well as the baseline. However, the guarantee only bounds the probability of playing a suboptimal action at each time step to 0.001. Over 40,000 time steps, the probability of playing a suboptimal action at least once is approximately 1 (since \(1 - 0.999^{40000} \approx 1\)). This bound is not particularly meaningful. This limitation should be discussed.
   I would also appreciate your perspective on why a per-time step high-probability guarantee is meaningful in systems with a large number of time steps. If a single failure is catastrophic, then a high-probability guarantee that holds simultaneously for all time steps is necessary. On the other hand, if a single failure is not critical and the amortized cost over many time steps is what matters, why focus on per-time step guarantees?
