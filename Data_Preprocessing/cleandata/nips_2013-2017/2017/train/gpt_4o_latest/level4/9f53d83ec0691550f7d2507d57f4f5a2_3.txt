In this paper, the authors present TranSync, a robust and scalable algorithm designed to address the 1D translation synchronization problem. The algorithm is notably straightforward, involving the solution of a truncated least squares problem at each iteration, and it demonstrates computational efficiency that surpasses state-of-the-art methods based on the linear programming formulation. Furthermore, the authors analyze TranSync under both deterministic and randomized noise models, showcasing its robustness and stability. Specifically, even when pairwise measurements are biased, TranSync achieves a sub-constant recovery rate, whereas the linear programming approach fails when more than 50% of the measurements are biased. The paper is well-written, with clear and seemingly correct proofs of the main theorems. However, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide additional intuition behind the theorems. The numerical experiments are thorough and well-presented.
