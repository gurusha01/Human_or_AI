The paper introduces a novel approach to conditional independence testing.
Strengths  
1) The authors recognize that for a conditional independence test to be effective, an assumption about the smoothness of the conditional density is necessary. They propose such an assumption and derive a bound on the total variation distance between the density under the null hypothesis and the density obtained via bootstrap under this assumption. This contribution is original.  
2) The proposed assumption is further utilized to bound the error of the optimal classifier on the training set, as detailed in Section 1.1 (iii).  
3) Theorem 1 integrates the smoothness assumption, the assumption that the error of the classifier \(\hat{R}\) can be bounded by \(\eta\), and the assumption regarding the difference in errors between the optimal and trained classifiers. This result is both novel and non-trivial, offering valuable insights.  
Weaknesses  
The paper is challenging to follow and provides limited interpretation of the results, making it difficult to fully grasp the implications. For instance, consider the inequality in Section 1.1 (iii). Under the alternative hypothesis, assume \(r0 = 0.1\). If \(G\) represents a small class, such as linear functions, and these functions lack sufficient expressiveness to distinguish between \(f\) and \(f^{CI}\), how can the small probability of error (\(\hat{R} < 0.1 + o1 < 0.2\) for large \(n\)) be achieved? An intuitive explanation of this scenario would greatly enhance clarity.
