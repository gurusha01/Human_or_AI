This paper introduces a multi-output Gaussian process covariance function formulated in the spectral domain. The approach of constructing covariances in the spectral domain represents a significant contribution to Gaussian processes, which, in my opinion, has not received the recognition it merits. This work extends the spectral domain methodology to the multi-output setting. While the paper builds upon the work presented in [1], it addresses the unique challenge of defining cross-covariances in the multi-output case, which are not necessarily positive-definite. The authors propose a method to address this challenge, resulting in the spectral mixture covariance function for multi-output Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, offering a concise and clear introduction to the problem and the fundamentals of Gaussian processes. The explanation of the spectral mixture kernel is presented in a straightforward manner, and the proposed extensions appear novel to the best of my knowledge. The connections to prior work are well-articulated, and I believe the paper demonstrates sufficient originality to warrant publication.
The experimental evaluation is adequate for a paper of this nature, though it does not provide much intuition, particularly regarding the Jura dataset, which is somewhat difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, I find the experimental results sufficient for the scope of this work.
