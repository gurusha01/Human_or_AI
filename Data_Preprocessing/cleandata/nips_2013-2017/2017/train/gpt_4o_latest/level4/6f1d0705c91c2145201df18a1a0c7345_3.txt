Thank you for providing an engaging and thought-provoking manuscript.
This paper introduces a hierarchical probabilistic model that leverages implicit distributions. To facilitate posterior inference, the authors propose a variational approach grounded in GAN-related density ratio estimation techniques. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated across a range of tasks, including ABC, supervised learning, and generative modeling.
While the core idea is intriguing, there are several aspects that could benefit from further clarification:
1. How does your method compare to AVB [36] and ALI [13]? While I can discern some connections, these may not be immediately apparent to all readers within your target audience.
2. The AVB paper discusses an important technique (adaptive contrast) for enhancing density ratio estimation in high-dimensional settings. Your evaluation primarily focuses on a toy example (2D linear regression) to illustrate the stability of your method, and your observations align with those in the AVB paper, which showed that naive density ratio estimation performs well in low-dimensional scenarios. It would strengthen your work to include an analysis in a high-dimensional context, such as your BNN example.
3. Regarding the hinge loss: could you elaborate on why the optimal \( r \) corresponds to the log ratio?
4. For generating discrete data, while using \( r(x, w) \) instead of \( r(x) \) can provide gradients, this requires feeding \( w \) into the discriminator network. Given that realistic data generation often necessitates deep and wide neural networks, \( w \) could potentially have very high dimensionality. How scalable is your approach in such cases?
5. I am concerned about the lack of quantitative results for the sequence generation task. Relying solely on generative samples and leaving fidelity assessment to the readers may not be the most rigorous approach.
In conclusion, I find this paper to be borderline. I would welcome further clarifications if the authors believe I have overlooked any critical points.
