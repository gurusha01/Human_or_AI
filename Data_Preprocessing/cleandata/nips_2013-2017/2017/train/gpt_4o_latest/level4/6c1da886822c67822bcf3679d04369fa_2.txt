SUMMARY  
* This paper introduces a method for density estimation that leverages a stack of autoregressive models, utilizing a normalizing flow perspective on these models. The approach aims to enhance the flexibility of the conditionals in masked autoregressive density estimation, offering an alternative to methods like mixture models.
CLARITY  
* The manuscript is exceptionally well-written and effectively explains the connections between existing methods.  
* The experiments are presented convincingly, and the authors have made the code available.  
RELEVANCE  
* The proposed method appears well-founded and demonstrates notable advantages over other approaches, particularly for conditional density estimation.  
* The experimental results highlight the strong performance of the proposed techniques. While some methods excel by incorporating domain-specific knowledge, the proposed approach is shown to be a competitive option for general-purpose density estimation.  
* The discussion section outlines intriguing directions for future research.
