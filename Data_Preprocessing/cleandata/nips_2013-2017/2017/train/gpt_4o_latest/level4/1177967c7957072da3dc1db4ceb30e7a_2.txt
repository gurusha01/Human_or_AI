This paper presents an interesting study and offers valuable insights into RCD and SGD algorithms. Conclusion 2 in Theorem 3.2 is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates that the proposed sampling method outperforms the commonly used L-based sampling strategy. Below, I outline several comments and suggestions for the authors to consider:
1. In Line 85, the denominator of \( p^*i \) should use \( xk \) instead of \( x \).
2. In Line 135, consider removing the subscript \( k \) from \( \hat{p} \) and \( \hat{c} \) to maintain consistency.
3. The figures are too small, and I am unable to discern any ticks, labels, numbers, or text. To address this, please consider moving some figures to the appendix to create more space, allowing the remaining figures to be displayed at a larger size.
4. If feasible, please provide a result analogous to Conclusion 2 in Theorem 3.2, but compare the proposed sampling method with uniform sampling (\( p = 1/n \)) instead of the \( L_i \)-based method.
5. Please comment on how the new sampling method impacts the overall complexity of RCD or SGD. For instance, what would the total complexity be (accounting for the \( O(n) \) time required to update \( lk \) and \( uk \)) for RCD to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal solution?
