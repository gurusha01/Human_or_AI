The paper introduces an approach that reformulates sparse Bayesian learning within a recurrent neural network framework, facilitating function learning without the need for manually designing the iterative process.
The manuscript is well-written and effectively communicated. The proposed concept is compelling and resonates with recent studies in the literature that explore connections between sparse representation and deep neural networks, including methods like sparse encoders and LISTA.
The experiments conducted on DOA estimation and 3D geometry reconstruction are engaging and demonstrate the versatility and broad applicability of the proposed technique.
