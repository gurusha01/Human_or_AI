The paper introduces two variants of SMDP-UCRL (SUCRL), named FSUCRLv1 and FSUCRLv2, and examines their regret performance. The key distinction lies in the fact that, unlike SUCRL, which assumes prior knowledge of certain parameters related to option behavior, the proposed variants estimate these parameters directly from the data. The two variants differ in their approach: one explicitly estimates the parameters and their confidence intervals, while the other employs a "nested" procedure to implicitly derive the parameters. The regret bounds achieved by the proposed methods are comparable to those of SUCRL, apart from an additional cost incurred due to parameter estimation. The paper also includes some empirical results to support the theoretical findings.
The paper is well-written for the most part. Given the technical nature of the contribution, some sections are understandably dense. The central insight of the work is the application of the irreducible Markov chain representation for an option. However, since the primary contribution is encapsulated in Theorem 1, it would be beneficial to include some intuition for the proof within the main text. At present, the entire proof is relegated to the appendix.
