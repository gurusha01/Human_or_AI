This paper enhances PointNet [19] by employing a recursive framework to incorporate local context learning across progressively larger scales.
+ The presentation is well-structured, and the mathematical formulations are straightforward to understand.  
+ The experimental results demonstrate that PointNet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on pointset benchmarks.  
- While the motivation emphasizes the recovery of local details by PointNet++, the experimental evidence does not strongly substantiate this claim.  
I am inclined to recommend acceptance, as the paper provides clear experimental validation on benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art results.
