The paper introduces a novel class of covariance functions for multi-output Gaussian processes. Rather than directly defining the cross-covariance functions, the authors propose specifying the cross-power spectral densities and then applying the inverse Fourier transform to derive the corresponding cross-covariances. This approach builds on a concept previously introduced in [6] for single-output Gaussian processes, where the power spectral density was modeled as a mixture of Gaussians and subsequently transformed back to yield a robust kernel function with extrapolation capabilities. The proposed covariance function is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets: the weather dataset and the Swiss Jura dataset for metal concentrations.
Extending the methodology from [6] appears to be an innovative approach for constructing new types of covariance functions for multi-output scenarios. A key motivation in [6] was to develop a kernel function capable of extrapolation, and it would have been valuable to explore whether the proposed multi-output covariance function inherits this property. However, the experimental evaluation relies on commonly used datasets, and the results achieved are comparable to those obtained with existing multi-output covariance functions. The paper's impact could be enhanced by including experiments on datasets where other models are less effective or fail to perform adequately.
Additionally, did you assess the statistical significance of the results presented in Tables 1 and 2? It appears that, given the standard deviations, the performance of most models is nearly indistinguishable.
