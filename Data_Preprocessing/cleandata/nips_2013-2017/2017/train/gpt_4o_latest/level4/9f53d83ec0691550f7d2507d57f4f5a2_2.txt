This paper addresses the problem of translation synchronization, which involves reconstructing latent coordinates from noisy pairwise observations. The authors propose an algorithmic approach that iteratively solves a truncated least squares problem, accompanied by a thorough convergence analysis and exact recovery guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art techniques. Overall, this work is both comprehensive and engaging.
