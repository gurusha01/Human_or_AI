This paper addresses optimization problems over a convex cone, parameterized as the conic hull of a potentially infinite set of atoms. The authors derive optimization convergence results for the proposed algorithms, which are applicable to general atom sets and objective functions. Overall, the paper is well-written, with a clear presentation of its contributions and connections to existing literature.
1. The paper explores an intriguing topic: the parameterization of optimization problems over the conic hull of a potentially infinite atom set. This approach lies between, yet distinct from, matching pursuit over the linear span of a finite atom set and Frank-Wolfe over the convex hull of a set of atoms. This framework enables the development of algorithms with optimization-theoretic guarantees for general objective functions and atom sets.
2. The paper addresses a gap in the literature by establishing optimization convergence rates for greedy algorithms in matching pursuit and Frank-Wolfe, even when the atom set does not necessarily include an atom aligned with a descent direction for all possible suboptimal iterates. This provides valuable insights into understanding these types of problems.
3. Additionally, the authors introduce away-step, pairwise, and fully corrective variants of matching pursuit, complete with theoretical guarantees, further enriching the study.
