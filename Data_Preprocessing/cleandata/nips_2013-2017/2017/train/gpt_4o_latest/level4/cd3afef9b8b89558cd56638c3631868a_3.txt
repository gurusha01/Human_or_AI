I am not an expert in online learning and did not examine the proofs provided in the appendix. My overall impression of the paper is favorable, though I am unable to assess the significance of the results or the novelty of the analytical techniques. My somewhat neutral score reflects this limitation rather than any shortcomings in the quality of the paper.
Summary: The paper investigates isotonic regression in an online framework, where an adversary pre-selects the dataset, but the examples are presented in a random order. The regret is evaluated relative to the optimal isotonic function for the dataset.
The primary contribution of the paper appears to be in Section 4, which introduces a class of "forward algorithms" that generalize several well-known methods and achieve a regret bound of \( \sqrt{T} \). Additionally, the authors establish a range of complementary results, including lower bounds and findings for alternative settings and loss functions.
Could the authors provide further justification for focusing on the random permutation model? The practical motivation mentioned in lines 46-47 does not seem particularly compelling. Expanding on what makes this setting challenging or interesting for the learner, as well as how the analysis differs from prior work (e.g., [14]), could strengthen the paper.
Section 3: How do Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 contribute to the overall narrative of the paper? Are they merely supplementary results, or do they play a critical role in supporting the findings in Section 4?  
- The estimator in (3) appears computationally impractical. Footnote 2 mentions that the result holds in expectation when sampling a single data point and permutation, but this approach likely suffers from high variance. Could the authors discuss how the variance is mitigated when sampling multiple data points and permutations?
Clarity: Despite my limited expertise in this area, I was able to follow most of the paper's content. However, the presentation felt overly mathematical in certain sections, such as lines 149-157 and 242-250, which could benefit from simplification.
Although there seem to be some gaps in the results, the authors have been diligent in exploring various directions (e.g., Sections 4.3-4.6). The paper offers several intriguing contributions that have the potential to advance this area of research.

Post rebuttal: After reviewing the authors' rebuttal, I find their justification for the setting convincing. Consequently, I have increased my score.
