This paper introduces a novel method, termed MPMG, for addressing the quadratic programming (QP) graph matching problem. The problem is framed as maximizing \( \text{argmax}_x(x^T W x) \), where \( W \) encodes both pair-to-pair and node-to-node affinities, and \( x \) represents the desired permutation matrix in vectorized form. The target solution is a permutation matrix that encodes the optimal matching, constrained to be doubly stochastic (entries \( \geq 0 \), rows and columns summing to 1) and discrete (entries restricted to \( \{0,1\} \)). Traditional approaches to solving this NP-hard QP problem typically involve relaxing either the doubly-stochastic or the discrete constraint. The proposed MPMG method employs the Lagrange multiplier technique, incorporating the doubly-stochastic constraint into the error term. This approach, along with the provided proofs for convergence and KKT-optimality, represents a novel contribution to this graph matching formulation. Experimentally, the authors demonstrate that the method converges to a solution close to being sparse and discrete, even though these constraints are not explicitly enforced, which is a particularly promising feature of the method. Nonetheless, there are concerns regarding the experimental setup that could undermine the empirical claims made in the paper.
While other state-of-the-art techniques also rely on iterative solutions, the paper should explicitly discuss the convergence criteria, particularly for experiments such as those in Figure 1, where MPMG is initialized using RRWM. It would be helpful to confirm that the convergence criteria for RRWM are appropriately tuned for these specific problems.
Additionally, it appears that RRWM is used for initialization in Figure 1, whereas SM is used for initialization in subsequent experiments. Regarding the experimental setup, it is unclear how performance time is measured. Does the reported time include the initialization procedure, or does it only account for the MPMG iterations following initialization?
It is also worth noting that RRWM itself requires an initialization. In [3], the algorithm is outlined as using uniform initialization. This raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison, as MPMG leverages an established algorithm for initialization, while RRWM uses uniform initialization. If this discrepancy has been addressed, the paper should provide further clarification in the text to ensure transparency. Without such details, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the experimental results.
Another point of concern is the determination of node-to-node affinities, represented by the diagonal entries of \( W \). The paper does not appear to describe how these values are computed, which leaves a gap in the experimental methodology.
Finally, the application of the method to image feature point matching may not be practical in real-world scenarios. This is due to several factors, including the large number of features, the complexity of pair-to-pair affinities, and the robustness required to handle a significant number of outliers. While the paper acknowledges that the QP formulation is applicable to other practical labeling problems, emphasizing these alternative applications could enhance the paper's impact and relevance.
