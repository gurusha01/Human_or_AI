To be honest, I found the problem setup unclear. Could you clarify what \(\mathcal{X, Y, Z}\) represent? Are these compact sets in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), unbounded sets, or perhaps finite sets?
While I understand that the authors propose an end-to-end optimization scheme similar to [29], I am not familiar with the specific stochastic programming problems discussed (e.g., inventory stacking). The results for the load forecasting task appear potentially impressive, but again, my lack of familiarity with these types of problems makes it difficult to fully assess their significance.
I would have appreciated seeing results on problems that are more familiar to me (and likely to the broader NeurIPS audience), such as continuous control tasks.
