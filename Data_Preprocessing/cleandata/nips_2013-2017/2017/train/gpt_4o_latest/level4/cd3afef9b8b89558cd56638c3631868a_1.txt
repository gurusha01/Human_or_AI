In this work, the authors investigate isotonic regression on linear orders within online settings. They note that prior research has established that online isotonic regression is unlearnable under a fully adversarial model, which motivates their exploration of the problem through the introduction of a more practical random permutation model.
While the paper is generally well-written, clear, and addresses a compelling topic—aside from a few typos and grammatical inconsistencies—it is challenging to verify the validity and accuracy of the claims presented due to the lack of experimental results.
To substantiate the claims made in the paper, it would be beneficial to simulate specific examples and demonstrate how isotonic regression on linear orders functions in online settings.
