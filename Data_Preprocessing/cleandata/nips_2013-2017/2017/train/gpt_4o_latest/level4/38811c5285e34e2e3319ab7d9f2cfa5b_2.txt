The authors present an approach for parallelizing learners (subject to certain assumptions) utilizing Radon points. The key contribution of the paper, in comparison to similar works, lies in the use of Radon points as opposed to averaging, which serves as the baseline approach in the study. The proposed method is evaluated against three alternatives: 'no parallelization,' the 'averaging schema,' and 'Spark-based' algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate reduced learning time and comparable or improved accuracy relative to the other methods.
However, it appears that the theoretical foundation of this work has been previously explored in another paper, "Parallelizing Randomized Convex Optimization," which may be authored by the same researchers. This prior work is not cited in the current submission, and the paper needs to clarify its specific contributions to the theoretical aspect in light of the earlier publication.
