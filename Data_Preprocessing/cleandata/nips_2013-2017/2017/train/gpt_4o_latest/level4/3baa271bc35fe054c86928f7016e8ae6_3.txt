This paper addresses the problem of submodular maximization in a streaming and robust setting. The objective in this setting is to select k elements of high value from a limited subset of elements retained during the stream, even when up to m items might be removed after the stream. Streaming submodular maximization has been widely studied due to its relevance in large-scale applications where only a few passes over the data are feasible. Robustness has also gained attention recently, driven by scenarios where some elements may be removed, necessitating solutions that are resilient to such removals. This work is the first to jointly tackle the challenges of streaming and robust submodular maximization.
The authors propose the STAR-T algorithm, which retains O((m log k + k) logÂ² k) elements after the stream and guarantees a constant (0.149) approximation while being robust to the removal of m elements. The algorithm leverages partitioning and thresholding techniques for submodular optimization, utilizing buckets. While similar bucket-based ideas have been employed in prior work on robust submodular optimization, the method of filling the buckets here is distinct. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in applications such as influence maximization and movie recommendation, even when compared to streaming algorithms that have prior knowledge of the elements to be removed.
The combination of streaming and robustness makes this problem setting challenging, and achieving a constant-factor approximation is a significant accomplishment. However, there are several areas where the paper could be improved. The inclusion of non-trivial lower bounds to complement the upper bound would have strengthened the theoretical contributions. The analysis section could also be clearer; while the authors refer to their approach as "innovative," they do not elaborate on what makes it innovative, and the proof sketch does not clearly convey the key ideas and steps of the analysis. Lastly, the influence maximization application could be more compelling. The experiments rely on a simplified objective for influence maximization, which considers only the size of the neighborhood of the seed nodes. It remains unclear how traditional influence maximization objectives, where the function value depends on the entire network for any set of seed nodes, could be adapted to the streaming setting.
