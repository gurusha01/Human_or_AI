The paper extends Nesterov's method to address geodesically convex problems on Riemannian manifolds. This represents a significant theoretical advancement in the field, particularly by demonstrating the feasibility of such a construction. Additionally, the derivation of the quantities for the Karcher mean problem is notably compelling.
