This paper is exceptionally well-written and offers a unified perspective on several state-of-the-art techniques for density modeling. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that autoregressive models, normalizing flows, inverse autoregressive flows, and RealNVP/NICE can all be interpreted through a shared framework. While certain elements of this perspective have been previously explored, such as in the IAF paper by Kingma et al., this work provides a much more detailed and accessible exposition of the connections between these models and techniques. Moreover, leveraging this unified perspective, the authors propose a novel variant and present highly promising results that rival (or surpass) various state-of-the-art methods.
