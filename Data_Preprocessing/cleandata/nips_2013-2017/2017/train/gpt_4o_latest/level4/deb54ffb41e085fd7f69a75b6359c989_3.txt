The paper introduces the hierarchical Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD) and evaluates its performance in route prediction. It demonstrates how the hierarchical extension retains the core properties of SDD while improving route prediction accuracy. Additionally, it explains why the hierarchical PSDD achieves more efficient computation compared to probabilistic graphical models, attributing this to its ability to effectively represent feasible combinatorial structures.
Overall, the paper is well-executed, though it only demonstrates the hierarchical PSDD on a single dataset/task. It would be valuable to assess whether the observed advantages generalize across other datasets.
Another point of inquiry is the computational cost of the hierarchical PSDD compared to the original PSDD. While the hierarchical model is more flexible, it is likely to incur higher computational costs. Understanding the extent of this increase would be an interesting and important contribution.
