As stated in the title, this paper builds upon the PointNet framework introduced in [19], which is set to appear at CVPR 2017. The primary objective is to classify and segment 3D point clouds. The key innovations over [19] include the introduction of a hierarchical network that utilizes neighborhoods at multiple scales and a mechanism to accommodate varying sampling densities, thereby creating data-dependent receptive fields. These advancements enable the method to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
PointNet++ represents a significant improvement over PointNet, as it effectively captures local spatial information. However, the overall performance gain is limited to just 1-2 percent.
Additional experimental or theoretical analysis would enhance the paper. For example:
- While the text mentions several alternative sampling strategies beyond the farthest point sampling, these are not evaluated in the experiments.
- The conclusions state that MSG is more robust than MRG but less computationally efficient. This claim would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost or at least some indicative performance metrics to substantiate it.
