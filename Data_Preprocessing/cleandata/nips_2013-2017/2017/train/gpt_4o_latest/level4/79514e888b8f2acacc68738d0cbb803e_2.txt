In this paper, the authors present a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm grounded in GANs. They show that, given the discriminator's objective, effective semi-supervised learning necessitates a suboptimal generator. The authors derive an innovative formulation that significantly outperforms feature matching GANs. Experimental results highlight state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. The paper is engaging and well-written, contributing meaningfully to the GANs algorithm family. However, I have several concerns as outlined below:
1. As demonstrated in W-GAN, GANs often struggle to converge when minimizing the KL divergence between the generator distribution and the target distribution. It would be beneficial if the authors could explore whether their algorithm is compatible with more advanced GAN architectures.
2. It is widely recognized that generating diverse and high-quality samples, such as high-resolution images, remains a challenge for GANs. The authors are encouraged to discuss how their proposed model could be adapted to scenarios where sample generation is particularly difficult.
3. Clarification on how "bad" a generator needs to be for optimal semi-supervised classification would be valuable. The authors are encouraged to provide more insights or experiments on this aspect.
4. It would be intriguing to investigate whether incorporating human-specified labels could enhance the generator's performance, potentially enabling the generation of more satisfactory samples.
