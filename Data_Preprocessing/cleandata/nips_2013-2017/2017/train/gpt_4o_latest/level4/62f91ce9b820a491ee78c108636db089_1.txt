Thank you for your response, which I have carefully reviewed.
I had previously overlooked the fact that the experiments do not precisely implement the method for which the theoretical results are derived. As a result, I have adjusted my overall score downward by one level.
This is an excellent paperâ€”meticulously crafted, well-written, and highly impressive. It presents robust theoretical results for deterministic quadrature methods as alternatives to random Fourier features. While I have a few comments, I believe this paper would make a fantastic contribution to NIPS.
- On page 2, lines 72-74, I wonder if the evaluation of QMC might be overly cautious. Was higher-order QMC employed in the cited reference? Is there a fundamental reason to believe that no QMC method could surpass the proposed approach? Specifically, could higher-order digital nets, which are associated with weighted RKHS and share some similarities with the ANOVA construction, be applied within QMC? For further details, see the 2010 book by Dick and Pillichshammer.
- Use \top for transpose in LaTeX.
- Introduce the Cartesian basis \( e_i \) before it is referenced.
- On page 4, lines 151-155, the comparison to RFF could be further nuanced with a clarification that the novel result relies on stronger assumptions compared to the rate provided for RFF. In other words, is it evident that RFF would not achieve better performance under the additional assumptions introduced in this paper?
- Please provide a definition for \(\tilde{\Omega}\) in Section 4.
