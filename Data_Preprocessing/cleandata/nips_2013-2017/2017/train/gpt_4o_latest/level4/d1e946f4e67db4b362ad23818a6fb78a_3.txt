The paper aims to develop an iterative method for updating a solution that converges to the KKT optimal solution. Beginning with the KKT solution (line 141), the authors reformulate it into an iterative recurrence by decomposing the square term into x(t) * x(t+1).
Subsequently, they derive an auxiliary lower bound function (involving two variables: the previous and current solutions) for the Lagrangian, ensuring that its solution defines the update rule. This lower bound is a concave function that introduces a new variable (representing the previous solution) alongside the variable in the Lagrangian, with the goal of establishing a recurrence relationship between the current and previous solutions.
Additionally, the authors design the method to empirically converge to a sparse solution by construction. However, this aspect warrants further investigation. Did you explore alternative update rules that do not yield sparse solutions? It would be beneficial to identify the specific characteristics of your update rule that drive the sparsity of the solution.
