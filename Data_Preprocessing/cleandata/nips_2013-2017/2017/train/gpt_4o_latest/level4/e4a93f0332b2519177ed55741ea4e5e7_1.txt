The paper introduces a novel RNN architecture called the Fast-Slow RNN, demonstrating improved performance on several language modeling datasets.
Strengths:  
1. The proposed approach effectively integrates the benefits of a deeper transition matrix (fast RNN) and a shorter gradient path (slow RNN).  
2. The method is simple and versatile, making it applicable to any RNN cell type.  
Weaknesses:  
1. The first two sections of the paper are difficult to follow. While the authors reference numerous prior methods, they fail to provide clear explanations for each. For example:  
   (1) In line 43, it is unclear why the stacked LSTM in Fig. 2(a) is described as "trivial" to convert into the sequential LSTM in Fig. 2(b). Specifically, the roles of \( h{t-1}^{1..5} \) in Fig. 2(b) and the meaning of \( h{t-1} \) in the same figure are not explained.  
   (2) In line 96, the phrase "our lower hierarchical layers zoom in time" and the subsequent sentence are ambiguous and difficult to interpret.  
2. The claim regarding multi-scale operation appears somewhat misleading. The fast and slow RNNs do not operate on distinct physical time scales but rather on logical time scales when the stacks are sequentialized in the computational graph. Consequently, the primary advantage seems to lie in the reduction of the gradient path length by the slow RNN.  
3. To address the issue of gradient path length in stacked RNNs, simpler alternatives such as Residual Units or fully connecting the stacked cells could be employed. However, the paper neither discusses nor compares these approaches.  
4. The experimental results lack standard deviations, making it challenging to assess the statistical significance of the reported improvements.
