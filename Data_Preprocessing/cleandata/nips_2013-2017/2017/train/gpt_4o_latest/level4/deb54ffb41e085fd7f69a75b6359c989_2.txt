The authors present a hierarchical extension of probabilistic sequential decision diagrams (PSDD) to model distributions over routes in a discrete graph, where edges are represented as binary random variables. Since valid loop-free paths are functions of all edges along the path, a straightforward graphical model representation would result in high treewidth. PSDDs offer a more efficient way to represent distributions over structured binary spaces, but they struggle to scale to practical scenarios. To address this, the authors propose a hierarchical decomposition of the problem, where both sub-problems and the overarching structure are modeled using separate PSDDs. This approach enables the method to handle real-world problems, such as route planning in the financial district of San Francisco.
The authors leverage specific structural properties of simple path-finding to ensure tractability (e.g., the simple-route constraint, which reduces 2^|Bi| to |Bi|^2). While Theorem 4 and Proposition 1 provide theoretical support for the validity of their assumptions, evaluating these assumptions on particularly challenging problems may prove difficult in practice (as is often the case). Additionally, I find the comparison to a Markov model somewhat limited, as the authors themselves acknowledge that it does not account for destination information. A more relevant comparison might have been with route-planning heuristics commonly used in practice, though I lack sufficient expertise in this domain to suggest specific alternatives.
Overall, despite these minor limitations, the paper is well-written, and the proposed idea is both novel and broadly applicable. I recommend its acceptance.
