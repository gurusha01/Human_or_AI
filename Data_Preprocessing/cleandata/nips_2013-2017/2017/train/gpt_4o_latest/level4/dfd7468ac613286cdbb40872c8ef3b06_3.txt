Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have garnered significant attention in recent years. While they are capable of producing sharp samples, this capability comes at the expense of optimization challenges. An alternative to GANs, known as Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), leverages two-sample hypothesis testing. GMMNs are more stable compared to GANs but tend to generate lower-quality samples and require large batch sizes during training. This paper aims to enhance the efficiency and architecture of GMMNs to improve their performance. The proposed method incorporates feature matching into the kernel definition and jointly learns the parameters of the feature map and the generator within a minimax framework. Overall, I found the paper interesting and have outlined my comments below:
1. The paper does not adequately discuss why adversarial learning of the kernel improves test power. This is a critical point that warrants further elaboration.
2. The experimental section, including the complexity analysis, is executed exceptionally well.
3. The manuscript would benefit from thorough proofreading, as numerous typos detract from the clarity and impact of the work.
