Review - Overview:  
This paper introduces a method to make nonparametric approaches robust to noise from positive definite distributions by leveraging estimated characteristic functions, focusing solely on the phase while ignoring the magnitude. The proposed method is applied to two-sample testing and nonparametric regression on measures, where each "sample" represents a collection of samples. The authors validate their approach through experiments on synthetic data and demonstrate reasonable performance of the proposed two-sample tests and regression features on real and semi-synthetic datasets.
Theory:  
The central idea of the paper—ignoring the magnitude of a characteristic function—is not groundbreaking but is nonetheless elegant, intriguing, and potentially useful, making it deserving of publication. While the concept is somewhat technical, the authors present it in a clear and accessible manner. They explain the idea using population versions of estimators and propose what appear to be reasonable finite-sample estimators. However, the inclusion of a consistency-type result would strengthen the theoretical contribution and provide a more complete picture.
Experiments:  
The synthetic experiments effectively illustrate that the new features behave as expected for a two-sample test. However, it is disappointing that the proposed method significantly reduces test power compared to existing nonparametric techniques, particularly in the >=2000 sample regime, where the difference is quite pronounced. While the method is not effective for the Higgs Boson two-sample test, this ineffectiveness is itself intriguing, as it seems to highlight a psd noise phenomenon distinguishing the two classes. In the final two experiments, the proposed method performs well on the semi-synthetic dataset (real data augmented with synthetic noise) but does not show a clear advantage in the real-world dataset experiment. Overall, the method does not exhibit consistently superior performance in testing or regression on real-world datasets, though it does show slight improvements in specific sample regimes.
Exposition:  
The paper is well-written and enjoyable to read, though there are some errors and issues that need to be addressed. These are detailed at the end of this review.
Final Evaluation:  
In summary, the idea presented in this paper is sufficiently interesting and valuable to merit publication.
--Corrections By Line--  
3: Replace "rarely" with "rare."  
14: Change "recently" to "which have recently been" for improved clarity.  
53: To ensure mathematical precision, explicitly restate that E is a psd random variable.  
115: Insert "the" after "However."  
116: Clarify whether "characteristic function" was intended to follow "supported everywhere."  
119: Provide additional explanation or justification for why these "cases appear contrived."  
123: The notation \( PX \) and \( PY \) has not been introduced; consider clarifying, though it may be intuitive enough.  
123: On line 88, \( K \) is defined as a function of two collections of data, but here it is described as a function on a pair of probability measures. Ensure consistency.  
134: Justify why this is an unbiased estimator, as many estimators in the MMD and related literature are not unbiased.  
208: Correct the statement about \( \chi^2(4)/4 \); it is the sample, not the measure, that is divided by 4.  
268: Provide details about the dataset, specifically the space in which the labels lie (presumably \( \mathbb{R} \)).  
Update:  
After reviewing the rebuttal and other reviews, I have revised my evaluation upward. My initial assessment may have been overly critical.
