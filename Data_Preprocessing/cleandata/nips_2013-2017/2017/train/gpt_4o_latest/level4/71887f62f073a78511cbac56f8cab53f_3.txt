This paper integrates several established techniques to broaden the applicability of the coordinate descent method to a wider class of problems. While I find the work to be well-executed and rigorous, it lacks significant novelty. The proofs appear to be adaptations of those in prior works, and the convergence rate aligns with expectations. Below, I outline several issues that I hope the authors will address:
1. (Major) Assumption 1(c) states that \( h^ \) must have a bounded domain. However, this condition is violated in Equation (9). Specifically, when \( h \) is the indicator function of a singleton set \( \{c\} \), \( h^(u) = u^T c \), whose domain is \( \mathbb{R}^n \). Consequently, the results in Section 3.4, including Theorem 3.5, lack justification. I am concerned there might be an error in the proof of Theorem 3.5. For instance, how can \( D{h^} \) be finite if the domain is unbounded? Moreover, if \( D{h^} \) is indeed unbounded, how can the right-hand side of Equation (12) depend on \( D_{h^*} \)?
2. (Minor) In Theorem 3.5, both \( y^* \) and \( y^\star \) are used. Please ensure the notation is consistent throughout the paper. Additionally, I could not find explicit definitions for these terms, though I assume they refer to the dual optimal solution.
3. There is a missing reference [?] on line 165. Please provide the appropriate citation.
