This paper introduces DPSCREEN, a method designed to optimize screening policies for a broad range of diseases. Unlike prior work in this domain, DPSCREEN incorporates both the patient's clinical (screening) history and individual features relevant to the specific disease model. This dual consideration enables DPSCREEN to personalize the screening process, leading to efficiency improvements over existing policies while maintaining the timeliness of disease detection.
In general, I found the paper to be well-written and technically robust. The proposed approach is well-justified, engages with relevant prior work, and includes a clear yet comprehensive explanation of the algorithm's mathematical foundation, including its computational complexity. DPSCREEN is validated using a substantial dataset of 45,000 patients from the Athena Health Network, effectively demonstrating the benefits of personalization. Additionally, the method is tested across different disease models. The result is a paper that offers a meaningful technical contribution with promising potential for practical application.
