Review - Summary:
The authors introduce the concept of phase discrepancy between distributions and phase features for embedding distributions. These are grounded in the use of a phase function that remains invariant to additive SPD noise components, targeting two key tasks: two-sample testing and learning on distributions. The phase discrepancy shares a mathematical resemblance to MMD but is specifically designed to incorporate invariance to additive SPD noise. Since the phase discrepancy induces a shift-invariant kernel (as established in Propositions 1 and 2), applying random Fourier features to this kernel naturally yields phase features. Extensive experimental results effectively highlight the advantages of the proposed methods.

In Line 120, the explanation for introducing the subset of indecomposable probability measures, for which phase functions are uniquely determined, appears insufficient. For instance, how does this lack of identifiability constrain the applicability of the phase discrepancy? Alternatively, does this subset encompass a sufficiently broad range of distributions to be practically relevant?

Given that MMD has been extensively studied within the framework of RKHS, which has significantly enhanced its theoretical understanding and ensured its practical utility, could the authors establish a connection between the proposed phase discrepancy and certain properties of the RKHS?
