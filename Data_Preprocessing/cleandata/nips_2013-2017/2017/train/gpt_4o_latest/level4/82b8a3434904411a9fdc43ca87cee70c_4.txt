Summary of the Paper  
====================  
The paper examines finite-sum optimization problems where each individual function is subject to a random perturbation. The authors propose an adaptation of the finite-sum algorithm MISO/Finito, named S-MISO, tailored for this scenario. They provide a convergence analysis that depends on the noise and analytic parameters of the model, supported by experimental results on datasets from diverse domains.  
Evaluation  
==========  
The proposed algorithm, S-MISO, appears to effectively leverage the additional structure of this setting (compared to general stochastic optimization scenarios). Theoretically, S-MISO demonstrates improvements over SGD by a factor related to the overall variance and the average individual variance. Empirically, S-MISO outperforms both SGD (designed for general stochastic problems) and N-SAGA (designed for related settings). This setting encompasses significant applications where data augmentation or perturbation has been shown to be effective, particularly in image and text classification, making the work both relevant and compelling.  
However, the convergence analysis is somewhat loosely articulated (e.g., the use of epsilon bar), and the algorithm involves non-trivial user-specified parameters that require careful tuning. Additionally, while the paper discusses expected performance on multi-layer networks, the experimental results in Section 4 only address two-layer networks. This omission is disappointing, as multi-layer networks are a key promise of the paper. On a positive note, the paper is relatively easy to follow.  
Comments  
========  
- L8: Convergence rates are typically expressed using O-notation, so the meaning of "smaller constant factor" is unclear.  
- L17: What is meant by "simple"? Does it imply proximal-friendly?  
- L21: Please provide references or cross-references to substantiate the term "fundamental." Consider rephrasing this sentence.  
- L47: Consider rephrasing this sentence for clarity.  
- L65: In Table 2, the term "data radius" does not appear to be defined in the text.  
- L66: How does focusing on a quantity dependent solely on the minimizer influence the asymptotic properties of the convergence analysis?  
- L69: There is a missing space in "note that\nabla."  
- L77: In what sense is this rate "unimprovable"?  
- L78: This paragraph seems misplaced. It might be better suited under "Related Work."  
- L90: This paragraph also appears out of place and seems more relevant to Section 4.  
- L116+L121: The phrase "when f_i is an expectation" is somewhat ambiguous. Please clarify.  
- L183+L185: The use of epsilon bar is unconventional and makes the statement difficult to interpret. Consider restating the convergence analysis using a predefined accuracy level or providing additional explanation of the upper bound parameters.  
- L192: Could you elaborate on specific choices for gamma?  
- L198: Does "as large as allowed" refer to Equation 9? Please clarify.  
- L200: In Figure 1, could you elaborate on what is meant by "satisfies the theory"?  
- L208: Some experiments appear to run for 400 epochs. Please clarify.  
- L226: Numbers here and elsewhere are missing thousands separators.  
- L261: Comparisons might be more fair if a non-uniform version of SGD were used.  
- L271: This line seems out of place.
