The paper introduces a novel approach termed Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), which applies a multiplicative update technique to address the general Quadratic Programming problem. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed update steps possess a closed-form solution, ensure convergence, and seamlessly incorporate doubly stochastic constraints into the optimization process.
The work is technically robust, with its claims being both theoretically and experimentally well-supported.
The manuscript is well-written, with clear articulation and a well-structured organization.
Although I am not deeply familiar with graph matching and its associated literature, the proposed method appears to be innovative. Based on the provided description, as well as the qualitative and quantitative results, the contribution over the current state-of-the-art seems adequate.
Graph Matching is a well-established problem, and having an algorithm with guaranteed convergence is a significant contribution.
