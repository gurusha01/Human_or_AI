This paper presents a neural network designed to predict the regions of an image that are significant for another neural network tasked with object categorization. The manuscript is well-written, and the findings are compelling, particularly given that the experiments demonstrate strong performance compared to prior work. The results are evaluated on challenging datasets using state-of-the-art neural networks.
I would suggest providing a clearer motivation for applications where real-time efficiency is critical. Additionally, it would have been valuable to include insights from an analysis of the learned salient regions (e.g., identifying object categories that leverage background biases for object recognition).
