This paper investigates the fast approximation of the "mismatch string kernel" introduced by Leslie et al. [17], where the kernel distance between two strings is defined based on the number of matches between k-mers, allowing up to m mismatches. Given the high computational complexity of the original algorithm, the authors propose an approximation method.
The proposed approach is divided into two main components: (1) determining the size of the m-mismatch neighborhoods for two k-mers, and (2) calculating the number of k-mer pairs within a Hamming distance of d.
To address the first problem (1), the authors introduce an O(m^3) algorithm to precompute all m-mismatch neighbors. For the second problem (2), they employ locality-sensitive hashing. The proposed algorithm provides probabilistic guarantees regarding the quality of the solution, along with analytical bounds on its runtime.
Through computational experiments on both simulated and synthetic datasets, the authors demonstrate that the proposed algorithm approximates the exact computation effectively and achieves significantly faster runtimes, particularly for large values of m.
The paper is well-written, with the proposed algorithm clearly presented step by step, including essential proofs.
MINOR COMMENTS
As noted by the authors, the proposed bound (Theorem 3.13) is loose. Would it be possible to improve this bound, or is it inherently challenging?
