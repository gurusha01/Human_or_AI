Multiple hypothesis testing is a critical step in many high-throughput analyses. When a set of features is associated with each tested hypothesis, these features can be leveraged to weight the hypotheses and enhance statistical power, a strategy referred to as independent hypothesis weighting. This approach specifically involves learning the discovery threshold on P-values as a function of the hypothesis features.
In this work, the authors introduce a novel method, neuralFDR, which employs a neural network to model this relationship. Through simulations and two real-world data applications, the authors demonstrate that (i) neuralFDR can boost statistical power while maintaining control of the false discovery rate and (ii) it can outperform existing weighting methods, particularly when multiple hypothesis features are utilized. The results are compelling, the manuscript is well-written, and the proposed method shows promise for application in high-throughput hypothesis testing scenarios. However, I have two main points to address:
1) The authors do not provide a discussion on the computational demands of their method or how it compares to alternative approaches. This information is crucial, as it will influence a potential user's decision when selecting a correction method.
2) In the GTeX dataset application, the authors observe that increasing the number of features considered leads to a rise in the number of discoveries for neuralFDR, while the number of discoveries for IHW (a competing method) decreases. In the most favorable case (3 features), the authors report 37,195 discoveries for neuralFDR compared to 35,598 for IHW, representing a 4.5% increase. Given this relatively modest percentage improvement, is there a specific reason why the authors did not incorporate additional features to further enhance the number of discoveries? In eQTL mapping, there is a wide array of variant and gene features available for consideration.
Minor comments:
- Line 215: The phrase "800 more discoveries" should also include the corresponding percentage increase for clarity.
- Table 2: Reporting both absolute and percentage increases would improve the table's readability and provide a clearer comparison.
