This paper introduces a variant of the linear UCB algorithm tailored for the contextual linear bandit problem, designed to be "conservative" in the sense that it ensures its performance remains above a fixed percentage of a specified baseline method. The authors establish the validity of their conservative approach by deriving fundamental regret bounds. While the core idea of the method is relatively straightforward, the proofs are fairly standard, and the techniques employed are not particularly novel. Despite this, the problem formulation and the proposed approach are practical, and the findings presented in the paper have the potential to positively impact real-world applications.
