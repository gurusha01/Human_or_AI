This paper explores the reproduction of user questions in a game of Battleship, substituting questions about individual squares with queries framed in an artificial language that incorporates compositional logical (Montagovian) semantics. The approach employs a log-linear model based on four straightforward features of the questions: expected information gain (informativeness), answer type (Boolean or numerical), and whether the question pertains to features of the board.
While the motivation, framed in the context of active learning, is reasonable at a high level, the ideas presented in this work are fairly straightforward. Additionally, the task itself is overly simplistic, highly constrained, and logically unambiguous. As a result, I do not believe this paper would be of significant interest to the NIPS community.
