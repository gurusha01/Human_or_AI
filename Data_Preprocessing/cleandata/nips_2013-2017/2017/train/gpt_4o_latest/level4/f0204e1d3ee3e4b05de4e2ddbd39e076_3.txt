The paper addresses sequential hypothesis testing problems, where hypotheses are evaluated one at a time rather than jointly. The goal is to manage the false discovery rate (FDR) or modified FDR (mFDR) while maintaining a high best arm discovery rate (BDR). 
The proposed approach integrates pure-exploration multi-armed bandit (MAB) techniques with methods for online FDR control. Leveraging an appropriate pure exploration strategy ensures a high BDR, while the online FDR control framework keeps FDR low. The primary contribution of the paper lies in the careful combination of these two components, providing guarantees for the simultaneous control of both FDR and BDR. 
In summary, the paper is well-written, with ideas that are clearly presented and easy to understand. The technical contribution is both interesting and highly relevant to the NIPS community.
