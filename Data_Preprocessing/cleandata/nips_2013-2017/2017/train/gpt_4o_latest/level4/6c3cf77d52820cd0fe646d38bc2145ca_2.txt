The paper is highly engaging, well-motivated, and an absolute pleasure to read!
1.] The manuscript is exceptionally well-written and, on the whole, very clear.
2.] Are comparisons with existing methods feasible? If so, why were these not included?
3.] Could the authors provide a detailed discussion on the robustness of the model to misspecification, addressing both its strengths and weaknesses?
4.] Could the authors elaborate on the sensitivity of any fixed tuning parameters in the model, highlighting both advantages and limitations?
5.] What is the scalability of the proposed model, and what is its computational complexity? Will the authors make the code publicly accessible along with the data? Are all results reproducible using the provided code and data?
6.] What key takeaways should a user derive from this work? The applications section felt somewhat underwhelming given the strong motivation of the paper. A more in-depth discussion would significantly enhance the paper's impact and overall success. Please expand on this.
