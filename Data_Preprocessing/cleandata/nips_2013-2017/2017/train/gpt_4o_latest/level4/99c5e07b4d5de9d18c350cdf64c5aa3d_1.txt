This paper introduces a dynamic Bayesian network aimed at enhancing the performance of iBCI decoders by reducing errors. The proposed approach leverages a longer history of neural signals to achieve this improvement.
The current state of the art appears to involve the use of Kalman filters for decoding neural signals to determine motion angles. If this is accurate, the authors demonstrate an advancement over this method by incorporating an improved tuning curve and a modified Kalman filter.
It would be valuable to clarify the minimum recording duration required to initialize both the tuning curve and the decoder.
The authors mention: "While the Kalman filter state solely encodes the vector of desired cursor movement, we expand our decoder's state to also include the two-dimensional final location (or goal position) on the screen to which the participant wants to move the cursor." Does this imply that the goal position must be known in advance? If so, does this make the approach supervised? If this is the case, the authors should explicitly highlight this limitation.
