The paper introduces a novel approach to learning hash codes by leveraging both label and similarity data within the framework of deep neural networks. The core contribution of the paper lies in Eq. (6), where the authors present a loss function that integrates pairwise similarity information alongside label information.
The experimental section is reasonably thorough, exploring various aspects of the proposed algorithm, such as the significance of incorporating label information and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
A few points to consider:
- There exists related work in K. Lin, H.-F. Yang, J.-H. Hsiao, and C.-S. Chen's "Deep learning of binary hash codes for fast image retrieval." A comparison in terms of both network architecture and performance would provide valuable context.
- In Eq. (4), could a softmax classifier be used in place of the linear one?
