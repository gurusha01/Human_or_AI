In this paper, the authors focus on an "intermediate case" between two domain parameterizations: the linear span and the convex hull of an atom set. Specifically, they consider the parameterization of the optimization domain as the conic hull of a potentially infinite atom set. This approach contrasts with greedy optimization methods such as matching pursuit (MP) and Frank-Wolfe algorithms, which operate over the linear span and the convex hull of atom sets, respectively. The authors provide explicit convergence rates for non-negative MP algorithms.
The alignment assumption inherent in existing MP methods does not hold when the optimization domain is a cone. To address this, the authors propose modifications to existing non-negative MP variants, thereby tackling this issue. They introduce MP-type algorithms tailored for conic problems and provide corresponding convergence guarantees. Three algorithmic variants are proposed, and it would be interesting to explore under which conditions each algorithm performs best. This insight would be valuable for practitioners seeking to apply the most suitable method to their specific problems.
In lines 202-205, the authors highlight a trade-off: choosing a small value for tau risks failing to recover an optimal solution, while selecting a large tau may lead to slower convergence. Does this imply that a larger tau is generally preferred to ensure convergence guarantees, irrespective of the associated time complexity?
To validate their proposed algorithms, the authors conduct experiments on three problems. However, the descriptions of the experimental setups and the analysis of the results are somewhat superficial. A more detailed discussion would improve the clarity and depth of the evaluation. Additionally, computational time could serve as an interesting and informative criterion for comparing the performance of the proposed methods and their variants.
