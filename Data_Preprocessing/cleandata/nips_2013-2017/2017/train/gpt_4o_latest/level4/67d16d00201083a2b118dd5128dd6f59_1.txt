The authors propose an approach that leverages a Fourier feature-based distance between the phase functions of probability distributions. This distance metric, along with the associated kernel function, is rooted in the concept of Maximum Mean Discrepancy. By utilizing the phase function, the authors introduce a statistical test for comparing distributions that have been corrupted by additive noise. The noise distribution is assumed to be unknown, with only certain properties, such as the positivity of the characteristic function, being specified. Additionally, the phase features are shown to be applicable in learning scenarios where samples are grouped into labeled bags. The proposed framework is subsequently applied to various datasets to evaluate non-parametric two-sample tests.
The approach presented in the paper is a promising one. While it is clearly tailored for statistical problems with a specific structure, such problems are often challenging to address using conventional methods. The model can be interpreted as a type of error-correcting mechanism for measurements affected by a particular class of noise. It would be interesting to see the framework applied to data sources more directly related to signal decoding problems, such as communication between mobile devices or satellites, as these could provide more compelling and practical testing scenarios.
However, some of the conditions assumed in the paper, such as the indecomposability of the random variable, may warrant further investigation or relaxation. Verifying these conditions might prove to be even more challenging than the primary problem addressed by the authors.
