The authors present an approximation algorithm for k-mer (with mismatches) based string kernels. The primary contribution lies in deriving a closed-form expression for the intersection size of mismatching neighborhoods. The algorithm is evaluated in the context of sequence classification using SVMs.
Overall, I find this to be an excellent paper: it has a clear motivation, a well-written introduction, a distinct contribution, solid theoretical support, and strong experimental results.
However, I have some concerns regarding the presentation and structure of the paper, as well as questions about the relevance of the presented theoretical results.
Presentation.  
- Section 3 is overly technical, with excessive notation and clutter that obscure the main ideas. At the same time, it lacks intuition for key concepts. I recommend moving some details to the appendix and instead focusing on elaborating the high-level ideas.  
- Including a table summarizing all relevant quantities (with explanations) would make it easier for readers unfamiliar with string kernels to follow the derivation of Theorem 3.3. Additionally, an intuitive description of the theorem and its proof idea would be beneficial.  
- Algorithm 1 is not well-integrated into the main text. It is first mentioned in Theorem 3.10 but is sparsely annotated and explained. For instance, the meanings of its parameters are not clarified, and its subroutines lack annotation. The algorithm deserves a more central role in Section 3, with the text providing a high-level overview of its workings.  
- The authors should emphasize more clearly that Theorem 3.3 addresses the open combinatorial problem mentioned in the abstract.  
- To improve readability, the authors should clarify what their algorithm approximates, the parameters controlling the approximation quality, and potential failure cases.  
- Theorem 3.13, which presents a concentration inequality, is the paper's main theoretical result and should remain in the main text. However, the results leading up to it (Theorem 3.11, Lemma 3.12, and Lemma 3.14) should be moved to the appendix. Instead, the implications of Theorem 3.13 should be discussed in greater depth. I appreciate that the authors acknowledge the looseness of these bounds.  
Theory.  
- Theorem 3.13 is a valuable first step toward understanding the approximation quality and consistency of the algorithm. However, it is limited in practical utility because the focus is on kernel approximation rather than the generalization error of the downstream algorithm. There is substantial existing work in kernel method theory addressing this issue (e.g., for Nystr√∂m and Fourier feature methods). The authors should acknowledge this literature or, ideally, extend their work to address it. A straightforward approach would be to conduct a perturbation analysis using the kernel approximation error, while a more ambitious approach would involve directly bounding the error of the SVM's estimated decision boundary.  
Experiments.  
- The runtime should be evaluated for various values of \( m \).  
- The authors should provide an example where the approximation fails. A synthetic example would help illustrate when the algorithm is suitable and when it is not.  
- The authors claim that their algorithm enables previously infeasible settings of \( (k, m) \). However, Table 3 shows only one case where their method outperforms the exact algorithm, and the improvement is marginal. The authors should either provide stronger evidence to support this claim or revise it.  
Minor Comments.  
- Figure 1 lacks axis units.  
- Typo on line 95: "theset" should be corrected.  
- Typo on line 204: "Generating these kernels days;" needs revision.
