The paper introduces the application of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) for estimating point process intensity or hazard functions. It highlights the advantages of employing objective functions beyond maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and proposes a computationally efficient distance metric. The method leverages a regularized dual formulation for optimization and utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the generator and discriminator. However, the paper provides limited details on the methods and datasets used in the real-world analyses, which hampers reproducibility and could benefit from clearer documentation.
The experimental results indicate that WGANTPP performs reasonably well across various tasks using both simulated and real data. However, the comparison baselines appear to be overly simplistic. For instance, the kernel mixture process is restricted to three components, resulting in visibly three humps in all outputs, and the self-exciting and self-correcting processes rely on fixed baselines despite the existence of extensive literature on semi-parametric hazard function settings. Incorporating more flexible and comparable baseline models, such as those proposed in Goulding (ICDM 2016), Weiss (ECML 2013), and Jing (WSDM 2017), would strengthen the comparisons.
The proposed distance metric may struggle with noise in the form of extraneous events, as it aligns the ith element of one sequence with the ith element of another. Would a distance metric based on local alignment provide greater robustness in such scenarios? Additionally, in which specific applications would this distance metric offer advantages over log-likelihood-based approaches?
In Equation 3, it seems that the second summation should be written as \(\sum{j=i+1}^m yj\).
In Section 3.1 on inhomogeneous processes, it appears that the settings for \(\alpha\) and \(c\) are switched.
There are minor typographical errors, such as "demosntrate," that should be corrected.
