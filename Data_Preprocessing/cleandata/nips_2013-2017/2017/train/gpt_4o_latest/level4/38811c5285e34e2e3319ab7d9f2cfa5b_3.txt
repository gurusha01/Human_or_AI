The authors propose a parallelization algorithm for aggregating weak learners using Radon partitioning. They provide theoretical analysis to justify the algorithm, complemented by empirical results that validate the theory. The theoretical contributions are compelling, and the empirical findings highlight improvements in training time and/or AUC compared to several baseline algorithms across multiple datasets. Additionally, the authors proactively and effectively address potential questions and concerns in the Evaluation and Discussion sections. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
Specific Notes  
--------------  
- Line 51: Replace "the the" with "the."  
- Line 79: Is the math font size consistent with the rest of the paper? It appears smaller and slightly difficult to read.  
- Figures 1-3: The text in the figure images should be enlarged for better readability.  
- Figure 3: This figure might be challenging to interpret if printed in grayscale.  
- Lines 318-320: "the Radon machine outperforms the averaging baseline..." Could you clarify if this is based on an average of paired comparisons?  
- Line 324: Avoid using the term "significant" unless referring to statistical significance.  
- Lines 340-341: There are missing spaces in "machineachieved" and "machineis."  
- Lines 341-349: The performance difference with the AverageAtTheEnd method seems relatively minor. Why wasn't this result included in Figure 1? Could you provide stronger advocacy for your method here?  
- Line 377: "Long and servedio [22]" The citation format here is inconsistent with others in the paper (even those immediately following).
