The paper explores continuous improvement through a sequence of A/B tests and instead advocates for the adoption of adaptive testing frameworks, such as the multi-armed bandit problem, while maintaining control over the false discovery rate. This is a significant and unresolved issue within statistical literature.
The proposed approach in this paper appears to address these challenges effectively. It is a compelling contribution that, despite some minor concerns outlined below, has the potential to open up a novel research direction.
Lines 24-37: The paper discusses well-known issues, but it would be beneficial to include citations. While the authors primarily focus on CS/ML literature, there is a pertinent body of work in biometrics. For example, see the survey by Villar, Bowden, and Wason (Statistical Science 2015), along with the references within and the more recent studies citing this survey.  
Line 37: Replace "testing multiple literature" with "multiple testing literature."  
Lines 38-47: A comparable concept exists in biometrics, referred to as "platform trials." Please clarify how your proposed concept differs from this.  
Line 112: Correct "and and" to "and."  
Line 115: Provide a reference for and a description of LUCB.  
Line 153: Correct "samplesas" to "samples as."  
Line 260: The phrase "are ran" is unclear—please revise for clarity.  
Line 273: The term "truncation time" is not well-defined, and its introduction is unclear. It appears to have a significant impact on the results presented in Figure 2—please elaborate.  
Lines 288-291: While the motivation discussed here is intriguing, it seems misplaced. Consider moving this discussion to the introduction, where it could be presented alongside examples such as website management and clinical trials.
