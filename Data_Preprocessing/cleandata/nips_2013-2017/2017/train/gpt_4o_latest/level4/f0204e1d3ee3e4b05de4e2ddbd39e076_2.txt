If no appropriate correction is implemented, the repetition of individually robust high-confidence tests inevitably results in absurd "statistically certified" discoveries.  
False discovery rate (FDR) control offers an alternative to family-wise test corrections, such as Bonferroni's, which are often criticized for being overly conservative.  
This paper presents a general framework for repeated A/B/n tests that incorporates several innovative ideas:  
- Introduces a "best-arm identification with control" variant of the (epsilon, delta)-PAC best-arm identification problem, which could also be referred to as "better-arm identification";  
- Replaces inefficient static A/B/n testing procedures with adaptive PAC "better-arm" algorithms;  
- Proposes a modified version of the LUCB algorithm tailored for this purpose;  
- Incorporates anytime p-value computation to enable continuous FDR control.  
The proposed "better-arm identification" algorithm is analyzed in Section 3.2.  
The meta-procedures introduced are rigorously analyzed and demonstrated to ensure FDR control.  
The paper concludes with experimental results to support the proposed methods.  
Initially, I was somewhat surprised by this highly application-focused, cross-disciplinary paper. However, I found the novel ideas and the practical as well as theoretical implications they offer for multi-armed bandits (MABs) to be very compelling.
