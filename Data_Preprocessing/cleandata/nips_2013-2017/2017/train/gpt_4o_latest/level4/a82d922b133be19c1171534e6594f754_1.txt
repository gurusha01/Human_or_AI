As is widely recognized, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) error for ridge regression can be computed efficiently using established formulas that adjust the loss function value when a single data point is excluded. In this work, the authors extend this concept by proposing an approximate formula for LOOCV applicable to other models.
To the best of my knowledge, this approach has not been proposed before and seems to hold significant potential.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, polished, and appears to be technically sound.
I was unable to identify any typos or other minor issues, aside from the following:
