The paper proposes a neural network model for learning graph embeddings that simultaneously preserves the local graph structure and incorporates a global node ranking akin to PageRank. The model employs a Siamese network architecture, which processes pairs of node embeddings as inputs and generates updated (output) representations for each node. The learning process is unsupervised, relying solely on the graph structure. The loss function combines a weighted inner product of the output embeddings (local loss) with a node ranking objective (global loss). Additionally, the paper explores connections between the proposed method and a community detection criterion. The model's performance is evaluated on multiple tasks, including node ranking, classification, regression, and link prediction, and is benchmarked against other unsupervised graph embedding methods.
The paper introduces novel loss functions and an innovative approach for learning graph embeddings. The incorporation of a node ranking term derived from the graph structure is particularly original. The authors demonstrate that this term enhances the quality of the learned embeddings, enabling their method to outperform other unsupervised baselines across various tasks. The connections drawn to community detection criteria are also noteworthy. However, the paper's organization and presentation make it challenging to follow in certain sections. The rationale for adopting a Siamese architecture is not adequately explained. Two distinct representations are learned for each node (denoted as u and z in the paper), but since z is deterministically derived from u, it is unclear why both representations are necessary or why the optimization does not directly target the initial u representation. Furthermore, the justification for the specific proximity-preserving loss term is insufficient. For instance, while the paper claims that this criterion captures "second-order" proximity, the term is never formally defined. Although the results appear promising, lemma 3.4, which discusses connections to community detection, is presented in a confusing manner.
In the experimental section, a more detailed explanation of the baseline methods is needed to clarify how they differ from the proposed approach. While the proposed method consistently outperforms the baselines across all tasks, the paper lacks an analysis of the underlying reasons for its superior performance.
In summary, the paper presents intriguing and promising findings. The proposed method includes several innovative elements, but the paper would benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations to fully convey its contributions.
