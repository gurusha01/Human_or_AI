The authors introduce a novel smooth primal-dual randomized coordinate descent method tailored for the three-composite optimization problem \( F(x) = f(x) + g(x) + h(Ax) \), where \( f \) is smooth, \( g \) is nonsmooth, separable, and admits a block-wise proximal operator, and \( h \) is a general nonsmooth function. This method extends the accelerated, parallel, and proximal coordinate descent approach of Fercoq and Richtárik, as well as the coordinate descent method with arbitrary sampling by Qu and Richtárik, to the more challenging three-composite setting. The primary difficulty in this extension arises from the nonsmooth nature of \( h \) when composed with the linear operator \( A \). The authors address this challenge by devising an efficient implementation that avoids full vector updates. They demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal \( O(n/k) \) convergence rate. Additionally, restart schemes are incorporated to enhance practical performance. The paper also examines and analyzes specific instances of the three-composite problem.
The contributions are well-articulated, and overall, this is a strong paper. The proposed method is versatile, applicable to a wide range of objective functions, and leverages various advanced techniques to ensure both speed and efficiency.
Comments:
- While the smoothing and non-uniform sampling techniques in Algorithm 1 are clearly explained in Section 2, the homotopy and acceleration techniques are not explicitly described. These techniques are directly applied in Algorithm 1 without sufficient explanation, making the algorithm somewhat opaque for readers unfamiliar with these methods. Algorithm 1 would benefit from additional clarification, either through a detailed verbal explanation or by explicitly linking each step to its corresponding method or approach.
- Building on the previous point, the origin of the formula for \( \tau \) in line 9 of Algorithm 1 is unclear. Similarly, the adapted \( \tau \) formula for the strongly convex case mentioned in line 153 is not adequately justified. These derivations should be clarified.
- The initialization values for \( \hat{x} \), \( \tilde{x} \), and \( \bar{x} \) in Algorithm 1 are not specified. Providing these details would improve the algorithm's clarity.
- The "given" value of \( \dot{y} \) referenced in line 73 and equation (6) is not defined. This should be explicitly stated.
- There is an unknown reference in line 165 that needs to be addressed.
