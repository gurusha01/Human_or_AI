The paper proposes an intriguing method for deanonymizing the Bitcoin network. It is well-structured and includes sufficient figures to effectively illustrate the approach and experimental results. The probabilistic analysis, in particular, stands out as a strong point, offering thought-provoking ideas. I did not identify any issues with the work and recommend it for acceptance.
However, despite the paper's clear presentation, I am uncertain whether it aligns well with the scope of NIPS or would have a significant impact on the NIPS community.
