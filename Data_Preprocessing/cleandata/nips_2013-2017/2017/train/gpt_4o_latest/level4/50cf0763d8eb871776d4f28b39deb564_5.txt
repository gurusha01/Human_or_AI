In this paper, the authors investigate the convergence of maximum likelihood estimates with respect to sample complexities for both generative and discriminative models. I find the paper to be engaging and well-written, though there is room for improvement in terms of exposition.
The authors demonstrate that under certain sparsity-related conditions, generative models can surpass discriminative methods when the sample size is small, and the data dimensionality is high. The theoretical analysis is presented as novel and is expected to have a long-term impact on real-world applications. Logistic regression is used as an example of a discriminative model, while Gaussian and Gaussian Graphical models are employed as examples of generative models. The authors have successfully maintained an exposition that appeals to a broad machine learning audience, which is commendable given the theoretical nature of the paper.
I have a few suggestions for improvement:
(1) Could the authors include a figure to illustrate the concept of separability as referenced in Definition 1?  
(2) The argument preceding Corollary 5, regarding the comparison between Corollaries 3 and 4, was unclear to me.  
(3) There are a few notational errors that need to be corrected.
Additionally, it would be beneficial to extend the paper with additional simulations and make the extended version available on platforms like ArXiv.
