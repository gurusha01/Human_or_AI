This paper extends the work of Fruit & Lazaric, 2017, addressing the problem of exploration and exploitation with temporal abstraction within the framework of options. It relaxes prior assumptions regarding the structure of the provided set of options: specifically, it does not require the inclusion of primitive options or impose upper bounds on the distributions of sojourn times or cumulative returns.
A notable contribution of this work is its novel analytical approach, which utilizes the MDP structure "within" options rather than restricting the analysis to the SMDP level. This perspective aligns with the spirit of the foundational options framework described in "between mdps and smdps [...]", which advocated for a model capable of integrating multiple time scales (MDP and SMDP).
The analysis is built upon the insight that the internal structure of each option can be treated as an MDP with a random horizon determined by the termination function. The authors demonstrate how an optimistic policy can be expressed in terms of the "internal" stationary distributions induced by each option. Instead of focusing on cumulative returns and sojourn times, as in Fruit & Lazaric, 2017, the confidence bounds are derived over these stationary distributions.
The theoretical guarantees established in this work reveal intriguing properties that align with empirical observations, such as the increased difficulty of learning long options and the facilitation of learning by options with transition models that exhibit sparser support.
Despite the technical nature of the work, the main paper remains comprehensible, and the core results on regret are accessible to a broad audience. This makes the paper valuable to readers from diverse backgrounds.

- The paper adopts the average reward criterion throughout. Could the proposed analysis also accommodate the discounted reward setting, which is more commonly used in practice?
- Although the appendix provides motivation for the assumption on initiation sets (specifically, one state per option), it does not address the issue of compositionality in Assumption 1. How can this compositionality assumption be generally satisfied?
Line 251: "[...] somewhat worst-case w.r.t. to the correlation."
This statement is unclear. However, the topic of correlation between options is an interesting one and warrants further elaboration in the main text.
