This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of convergence rates for M-estimators in generative and discriminative models, with a focus on differential parameter estimation. The authors introduce a novel concept of "local separability" to quantify the separability of loss functions, which is a significant theoretical contribution. By leveraging this concept, they derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for both generative and discriminative models, addressing both low- and high-dimensional settings. The results demonstrate that generative models generally outperform discriminative models in terms of sample complexity and convergence rates, particularly in high-dimensional regimes.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Contributions: The introduction of local separability as a flexible measure of loss function separability is innovative and provides a unifying framework for analyzing convergence rates. This concept is likely to be of independent interest to the community.
2. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper extends classical results on generative vs. discriminative models to high-dimensional settings, which is a non-trivial and impactful extension. The theoretical results are supported by detailed proofs and simulations.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with the topic. The authors clearly outline their contributions and provide detailed explanations of their methodology.
4. Practical Implications: The results have practical implications for high-dimensional classification tasks, as demonstrated by the experiments on isotropic Gaussian models. The findings suggest that generative methods are more robust to sparsity levels in high dimensions.
Weaknesses:
1. Originality and Context: While the paper builds on prior work, it is unclear how it significantly differs from or advances beyond existing results, such as those in [11] and [5]. The authors could better contextualize their contributions relative to recent literature.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments focus solely on isotropic Gaussian models, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additional experiments on non-Gaussian or real-world datasets would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Clarity of Definitions: Some definitions, such as local separability, are mathematically dense and may benefit from additional intuitive explanations or examples. This would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
4. Minor Issues: There are typographical errors, inconsistent notation, and missing punctuation in some equations and lines. These minor issues detract from the overall presentation and should be addressed.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the understanding of generative and discriminative models, particularly in high-dimensional settings. While the originality and broader implications could be better articulated, the technical rigor and clarity of the work are commendable. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the minor issues and expand the experimental validation to include more diverse datasets.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical framework (local separability).
- Comprehensive analysis of convergence rates in both low- and high-dimensional settings.
- Clear and well-structured presentation.
- Practical relevance to high-dimensional classification.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental validation.
- Insufficient contextualization of contributions relative to prior work.
- Minor typographical and notational inconsistencies.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing theoretical and practical understanding of machine learning models.
