The paper addresses the computational challenges of the "mismatch string kernel" proposed by Leslie et al., which is widely used in sequence classification tasks. By introducing a novel approximation algorithm, the authors significantly improve the scalability of this kernel, enabling its application to larger values of k (subsequence length) and m (mismatch parameter). The proposed algorithm consists of two main components: (1) precomputing m-mismatch neighborhoods with a complexity of \(O(m^3)\), and (2) leveraging locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate the number of k-mer pairs within a Hamming distance of \(d\). The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on solution quality and runtime, with empirical results demonstrating substantial speedups and accurate approximations compared to exact computations.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper resolves a long-standing combinatorial problem by deriving a closed-form expression for the intersection size of m-mismatch neighborhoods, which is a significant theoretical advancement. Additionally, the use of LSH to estimate pairwise k-mer distances is innovative and well-justified.
2. Scalability: The algorithm achieves a runtime of \(O(k^2n \log n)\), making it feasible for larger values of k and m, where existing methods fail due to exponential complexity.
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on real-world biological and music datasets demonstrate that the proposed method approximates exact kernel values with high accuracy. The reported speedups (up to an order of magnitude) and comparable classification performance highlight the practical utility of the approach.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, theoretical proofs, and detailed experimental results. The inclusion of probabilistic guarantees and error bounds adds rigor to the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Loose Theoretical Bound: Theorem 3.13 provides a very loose additive approximation bound, which, while sufficient for practical purposes, could be tightened to better reflect the empirical performance.
2. Writing Issues: Section 4 contains incomplete sentences, which slightly detracts from the overall readability. Additionally, some parts of the paper, particularly the mathematical derivations, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with combinatorial optimization or LSH.
3. Limited Comparison: While the paper compares its method to existing exact algorithms, it does not benchmark against other approximate methods (if any exist), which would provide a broader context for evaluating its performance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in sequence classification by enabling the use of larger k and m, which are known to improve classification accuracy.
- The theoretical contributions and practical speedups are substantial and advance the state of the art in kernel-based sequence classification.
- The work is relevant to the NIPS community, given its focus on scalable machine learning algorithms and applications in bioinformatics and signal processing.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The loose theoretical bounds and minor writing issues could be improved for better clarity and rigor.
- The lack of comparison with other approximate methods (if applicable) leaves a gap in the evaluation.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a significant and well-validated contribution to the field of sequence classification. The combination of theoretical innovation, practical efficiency, and empirical validation makes it a strong candidate for presentation at the conference. However, the authors should address the minor writing issues and consider tightening the theoretical bounds in future revisions.
