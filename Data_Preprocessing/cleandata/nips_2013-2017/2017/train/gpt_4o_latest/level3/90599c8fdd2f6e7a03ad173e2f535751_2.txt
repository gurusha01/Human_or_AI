The paper introduces FSUCRL, a novel algorithm designed to address limitations in regret estimation for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) with options. Unlike previous methods such as SUCRL, FSUCRL does not require prior knowledge of cumulative reward or option duration distributions, which are often impractical to obtain. The authors achieve this by transforming the inner Markov Decision Process (MDP) of options into irreducible Markov chains, merging terminal states with the initial state. The stationary distribution of these chains is then used to compute optimistic reward gain, improving robustness to parameter estimation errors. Two algorithmic variants, FSUCRL Lvl1 and Lvl2, are proposed, differing in how they approximate the stationary distribution or compute the optimal bias.
The paper is theoretically sound, offering a rigorous regret analysis that compares FSUCRL Lvl2 to SUCRL. It identifies conditions under which FSUCRL Lvl2 outperforms SUCRL, such as when options overlap in their actions or when state accessibility is high. Numerical experiments on gridworld environments corroborate these findings, demonstrating that FSUCRL Lvl2 retains the benefits of temporal abstraction while outperforming SUCRL and FSUCRL Lvl1 in cumulative regret.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper addresses a significant limitation of prior work by eliminating the need for strong assumptions about option parameters. This makes the approach more practical and broadly applicable.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The regret bounds are well-analyzed, and the additional regret term introduced by FSUCRL is shown to be manageable in many scenarios.
3. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments effectively demonstrate the practical advantages of FSUCRL, particularly its ability to leverage overlapping options.
4. Significance: The work advances the state of the art in HRL by providing a parameter-free approach that is competitive with existing methods and retains the benefits of temporal abstraction.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally clear, certain sections, such as the connection between Assumptions 1 and 2, could benefit from more explicit explanations. Additionally, minor grammatical errors and typos detract from readability.
2. Practical Implications: Although the theoretical analysis is strong, the practical scalability of FSUCRL, particularly in more complex environments, is not thoroughly explored.
3. FSUCRL Lvl1 Performance: The performance of FSUCRL Lvl1 is notably weaker, suffering from linear regret in some cases. A deeper discussion of its limitations and potential improvements would strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and practical approach to HRL with options, addressing a key limitation of prior methods.
- It provides a strong theoretical foundation and empirical evidence supporting the proposed method.
- The work is relevant to the NeurIPS community, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications of HRL.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Minor clarity issues and typos could hinder comprehension for some readers.
- The scalability of FSUCRL in more complex environments remains unclear.
- FSUCRL Lvl1's poor performance raises questions about its utility.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance, as the paper makes a significant contribution to HRL by proposing a parameter-free method that is both theoretically sound and empirically validated. Addressing the minor clarity issues and providing additional insights into the scalability of FSUCRL would further strengthen the work.
