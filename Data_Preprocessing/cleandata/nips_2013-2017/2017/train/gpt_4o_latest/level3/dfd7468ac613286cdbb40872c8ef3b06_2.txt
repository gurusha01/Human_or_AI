The paper proposes an improvement to the Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN) by introducing adversarial kernel learning, resulting in a novel framework called MMD GAN. The key idea is to replace the fixed Gaussian kernel in GMMN with an adversarially learned kernel, which maximizes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance between the model and data distributions. The generator is then trained to minimize this distance, creating a min-max game similar to GANs. The kernel is designed to be characteristic, composed of Gaussian kernels, and parameterized by an injective function learned via an autoencoder. The authors demonstrate that MMD GAN achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art GANs on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN, while being computationally more efficient than GMMN.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Connections: The paper bridges the gap between GMMN and GAN, introducing a novel adversarial kernel learning framework. The theoretical connection to Wasserstein GAN (W-GAN) and the use of higher-order moment matching through the kernel trick are insightful and could inspire future work.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous proofs for the continuity, differentiability, and weak topology properties of the proposed method, which strengthen the theoretical foundation of MMD GAN.
3. Empirical Performance: The experimental results demonstrate that MMD GAN outperforms GMMN and achieves competitive results with GANs on challenging datasets. The qualitative and quantitative analyses, including inception scores, support the claims.
4. Efficiency: The ability to train with smaller batch sizes compared to GMMN is a significant improvement, addressing a key limitation of GMMN.
Weaknesses:
1. Autoencoder Design: The role of the autoencoder in ensuring the injectivity of the kernel function is not fully justified. The reviewer questions whether the decoder is merely the transpose of the encoder and seeks more details on its architecture and up-sampling method. Additionally, the necessity of the autoencoder is unclear, as the authors note it is not mandatory in practice.
2. Injectivity of Encoder: The encoder, modeled after the DCGAN discriminator with max-pooling layers, raises concerns about its injectivity. The paper does not address how this property is preserved, nor does it provide evidence of reconstruction quality in the low-dimensional latent space.
3. Comparison with W-GAN: While the paper draws theoretical parallels to W-GAN, the practical advantages of MMD GAN over W-GAN remain somewhat ambiguous. The reviewer doubts whether the higher-order moment matching provides a significant performance boost in real-world applications.
4. Computational Complexity: Although the authors argue that GPU parallelization mitigates the quadratic complexity of MMD GAN, the method still scales poorly with large batch sizes compared to W-GAN.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically grounded approach to generative modeling, combining ideas from GMMN and GAN.
- The empirical results are promising, demonstrating competitive performance on benchmark datasets.
- The theoretical contributions and connections to existing methods provide valuable insights for the community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The necessity and design of the autoencoder are not adequately justified, leaving gaps in the methodological clarity.
- The practical advantages over W-GAN are not convincingly demonstrated, and the performance improvement may be incremental rather than groundbreaking.
- The computational complexity, while mitigated, could still be a concern for large-scale applications.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of generative modeling by introducing adversarial kernel learning and connecting moment matching networks with GANs. However, the authors should address the concerns regarding the autoencoder design, injectivity, and practical advantages over W-GAN. With these clarifications, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance.
