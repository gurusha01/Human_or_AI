This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the convergence rates of maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for generative and discriminative models, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The authors extend classical results by introducing a novel notion of separability for loss functions, which allows for a unified framework to derive `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators. The paper focuses on the nuanced behaviors of generative and discriminative models under different conditions, using logistic regression as a discriminative model and Gaussian models (isotropic and graphical) as generative examples. The results highlight that generative models can outperform discriminative models in sparse, high-dimensional regimes with small sample sizes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom in low-dimensional settings.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Significance: The introduction of a generalized separability framework for loss functions is a significant theoretical contribution. This framework not only advances the understanding of MLE convergence rates but also has potential applications in differential parameter estimation and high-dimensional classification.
2. Clarity and Accessibility: Despite its theoretical nature, the paper is well-written and accessible to a broad machine learning audience. The authors provide clear definitions, proofs, and intuitive explanations, making the work approachable.
3. Impact on Real-World Problems: The insights into when generative models outperform discriminative ones are highly relevant for real-world applications involving high-dimensional data, such as genomics and text classification.
4. Experimental Validation: The theoretical findings are corroborated with simulations, which demonstrate the practical implications of the results, particularly in high-dimensional classification tasks.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity in Specific Sections: The argument leading to Corollary 5 could benefit from additional clarification, as it is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Similarly, the definition of separability (Definition 1) would be more intuitive with a visual figure.
2. Notation Issues: There are minor inconsistencies in the notation, which could confuse readers. For example, the use of `r` and `n` in different contexts is not always clear.
3. Limited Simulations: While the theoretical results are strong, the experimental section could be expanded to include more simulations, particularly for non-Gaussian generative models or real-world datasets, to further validate the findings.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Add a figure to visually explain the concept of separability (Definition 1), which would make the notion more intuitive.
2. Provide additional clarification and restructuring of the argument before Corollary 5 to improve readability.
3. Fix the minor notation inconsistencies throughout the paper.
4. Extend the experimental section with more simulations, including non-Gaussian models and real-world datasets, to demonstrate the broader applicability of the results.
5. Consider publishing an extended version of the paper on platforms like ArXiv to include these additional simulations and clarifications.
Recommendation
This paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to understanding the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. Its novel framework for analyzing separability and its implications for sample complexity are both timely and impactful. While there are minor issues with clarity and experimental breadth, these do not detract from the overall quality of the work. I recommend acceptance, with the expectation that the authors address the suggested improvements in the final version.
