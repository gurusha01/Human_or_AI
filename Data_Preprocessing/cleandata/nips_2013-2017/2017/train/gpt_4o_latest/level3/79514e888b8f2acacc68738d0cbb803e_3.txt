This paper investigates the role of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in semi-supervised learning (SSL), specifically addressing the interplay between the discriminator and generator in the "K+1" classification setting. The authors propose a novel framework that leverages a "bad" generator to improve SSL performance by targeting low-density regions in the input space. The paper combines feature matching with density estimation (via Pixel CNN) and entropy regularization to encourage diversity in generated samples. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novel Insights: The theoretical analysis provides a compelling explanation for why a "bad" generator, rather than a perfect one, is beneficial for SSL. The concept of a complement generator and its connection to low-density boundary assumptions is well-motivated and aligns with classical SSL principles.
2. Empirical Performance: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its practical utility. The ablation study further clarifies the contributions of individual components, such as entropy regularization and low-density sampling.
3. Thorough Analysis: The paper conducts a detailed exploration of the limitations of feature matching GANs, identifying issues like collapsing and high-density sample generation. The proposed solutions, including entropy maximization and low-density sampling, are well-justified.
4. Connection to Prior Work: The paper situates its contributions within the broader context of SSL and GAN literature, referencing related methods like VAT and Ladder networks. The theoretical and empirical connections to low-density boundary assumptions strengthen its relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical Limitations: While the theoretical analysis is insightful, it operates in the feature space, whereas the proposed method is implemented in the input space. This mismatch raises concerns about the validity of convexity assumptions and the practical applicability of the theoretical guarantees.
2. Ad-hoc Design Choices: The use of Pixel CNN for density estimation and entropy regularizers feels somewhat ad-hoc. Alternative approaches for low-density sampling could have been explored to generalize the method further.
3. KL Divergence Issue: The KL expression in the generator objective is incorrect, as noted in the rebuttal. This oversight requires a reworking of the objective to optimize the constant term, which could impact the reported results.
4. Insufficient Emphasis on SSL Assumptions: The connection to classical SSL assumptions, such as the cluster and low-density boundary principles, is underexplored. Lines 162-163, which discuss this connection, require further elaboration.
5. Ablation Study Gaps: While the ablation study is comprehensive, it lacks a detailed exploration of performance across varying \(\epsilon\) thresholds and does not justify the choice of the 10-quantile threshold.
Minor Issues:
- Typographical error in line 178 ("the a bounded").
- Missing proof for Corollary 1.
- Unclear claims about uniformity over all \(X\) and \(|G| \to \infty\).
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with a score of 7. The paper makes a significant empirical and theoretical contribution to GAN-based SSL, advancing the state of the art. However, the theoretical-methodological mismatch and some ad-hoc design choices leave room for improvement. Addressing these concerns in a future revision would further strengthen the paper.
