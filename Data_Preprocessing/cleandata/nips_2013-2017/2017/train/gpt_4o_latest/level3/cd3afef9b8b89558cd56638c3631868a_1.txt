The paper addresses the problem of online isotonic regression on linear orders and proposes a novel random permutation model as a practical alternative to the fixed design model. The authors highlight the limitations of learning isotonic regression in a fully adversarial setting and demonstrate that the random permutation model provides a feasible framework for designing efficient algorithms. The paper establishes theoretical bounds on regret and explores the connection between regret and leave-one-out loss, presenting both upper and lower bounds. Additionally, the authors analyze forward algorithms, a class of practical methods, and propose the Heavy-γ algorithm as a potential improvement.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles an important and challenging problem in online learning, contributing to the understanding of isotonic regression in non-fixed design settings. The introduction of the random permutation model is a significant step forward, as it bridges the gap between the overly restrictive fixed design model and the infeasibility of fully adversarial settings. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with well-defined bounds and a clear connection to leave-one-out loss, which is a valuable tool for understanding regret. The exploration of forward algorithms is particularly interesting, as these methods are computationally efficient and widely applicable. The conjecture regarding the Heavy-γ algorithm opens up avenues for future work and demonstrates the authors' forward-thinking approach.
Weaknesses:  
The primary limitation of the paper is the absence of experimental validation. While the theoretical results are compelling, the lack of simulations or empirical examples makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed methods. For instance, the conjecture about the Heavy-γ algorithm remains unverified, and numerical experiments could provide evidence to support or refute its claims. Additionally, while the paper is generally well-written, there are minor typos and grammatical errors that detract from its overall clarity. These issues should be addressed in a revised version.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and practical model for online isotonic regression, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis. It addresses a significant gap in the literature and proposes practical algorithms with potential for broad applicability.  
- Con: The lack of experimental results limits the ability to validate the theoretical claims and assess the real-world utility of the proposed methods. Minor clarity issues also slightly hinder readability.
Recommendation:  
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the absence of experiments is a notable drawback. I recommend acceptance conditional on the inclusion of simulations or examples in a revised version. These additions would significantly enhance the paper's impact and demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach.
