The paper introduces TranSync, a novel algorithm for addressing the 1D translation synchronization problem, which involves recovering global coordinates from noisy pairwise measurements. Unlike prior approaches, TranSync employs truncated least squares to iteratively prune noisy measurements, thereby enhancing robustness and scalability. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, including exact recovery conditions under both deterministic and biased random noise models, with proofs included in supplementary materials. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate TranSync's superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, such as coordinate descent.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, offering both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation. The proofs, while relegated to the supplementary materials, are rigorous and support the claims made in the main text.
2. Novelty: The use of truncated least squares for translation synchronization is innovative and distinguishes TranSync from existing convex optimization-based methods. The algorithm's ability to handle biased noise is particularly noteworthy.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers with a background in optimization and synchronization problems. The exposition of the algorithm and its theoretical underpinnings is clear and concise.
4. Significance: The results are impactful, as TranSync advances the state-of-the-art in translation synchronization. Its scalability and robustness make it applicable to large-scale datasets, as demonstrated in the experiments on point cloud alignment and global ranking.
5. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The comparison with baseline methods, such as coordinate descent, highlights TranSync's advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
Weaknesses:
1. Proof Accessibility: While the theoretical analysis is rigorous, including a brief overview of the key proof techniques in the main text would enhance accessibility for readers who may not delve into the supplementary materials.
2. Generality: The paper focuses exclusively on 1D translation synchronization. While the authors mention potential extensions to other synchronization problems (e.g., rotations), these are not explored, leaving room for future work.
3. Empirical Baselines: The experimental section could benefit from comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly those leveraging non-convex optimization techniques.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem with a novel and theoretically sound approach.
- TranSync demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods in both accuracy and scalability.
- The clear exposition and rigorous analysis make this work a strong contribution to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The omission of proof summaries in the main text slightly detracts from the paper's accessibility.
- The scope is limited to 1D translation synchronization, with no immediate extensions demonstrated.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper for its significant contributions to translation synchronization, its rigorous theoretical foundation, and its strong empirical results. Including a brief overview of the proof techniques in the main text would further strengthen the paper.
