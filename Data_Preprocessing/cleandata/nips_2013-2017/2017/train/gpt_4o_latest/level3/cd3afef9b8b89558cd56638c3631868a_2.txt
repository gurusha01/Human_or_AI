The paper addresses the problem of online isotonic regression under the random permutation model, a significant extension to prior work in this area. The authors aim to minimize regret, a key metric in online learning, and provide theoretical insights into algorithmic performance. Previous research demonstrated that online isotonic regression is unlearnable in fully adversarial settings and achieves optimal \( \tilde{O}(T^{1/3}) \) regret in the fixed design model. This paper advances the field by analyzing the random permutation model, which is more practical and avoids the fixed design assumption. The authors achieve the optimal \( \tilde{O}(T^{1/3}) \) regret using a computationally inefficient algorithm and propose efficient "Forward Algorithms" that achieve \( \tilde{O}(T^{1/2}) \) regret generally and \( \tilde{O}(T^{1/3}) \) regret for isotonic labels.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces the random permutation model, bridging the gap between the fixed design and fully adversarial models. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of online isotonic regression.
2. Theoretical Insights: The authors provide rigorous regret bounds, demonstrating that learning is feasible in the random permutation model. The connection between regret and leave-one-out loss is particularly insightful and could inspire future work in related areas.
3. Practical Relevance: The analysis of Forward Algorithms, which are computationally efficient and widely used in practice, adds practical value to the theoretical contributions.
4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the models, algorithms, and theoretical results. The inclusion of lower bounds and conjectures further enriches the discussion.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Inefficiency: While the authors achieve optimal regret with their primary algorithm, its computational inefficiency limits its practical applicability. This is acknowledged but remains a drawback.
2. Regret Notion: A concern is raised about the naturalness of the regret definition, as it can potentially be negative. This issue is not fully addressed and could impact the interpretation of results.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks experimental results to validate the theoretical findings, particularly for the conjectured performance of the Heavy-\( \gamma \) algorithm. Empirical evidence would strengthen the claims and provide practical insights.
4. Open Problems: While the authors pose the design of efficient algorithms for partial orders as an open problem, the paper could have explored this direction further, even if only preliminarily.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. The work makes a substantial theoretical contribution to online isotonic regression, particularly through the introduction of the random permutation model and the analysis of Forward Algorithms. Despite the computational inefficiency of the optimal algorithm and concerns about the regret definition, the techniques and insights presented are valuable for advancing the state of the art. Future work could address the open problems and validate the results empirically, further enhancing the impact of this research.
