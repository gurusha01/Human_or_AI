The paper introduces the PixelGAN autoencoder, a hybrid generative model combining adversarial autoencoders and PixelCNN autoencoders. The proposed model leverages a GAN-based inference network to impose priors on the latent code, while a PixelCNN decoder captures the remaining structure of the data. The authors provide theoretical justification via ELBO decomposition and demonstrate how different priors (Gaussian and categorical) enable distinct decompositions of information, such as global vs. local statistics or style vs. content. The model is evaluated on semi-supervised classification tasks (MNIST, SVHN, NORB) and unsupervised clustering (MNIST), showing competitive results.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a clear discussion of ELBO decomposition and its implications for balancing latent code representation and autoregressive decoding. This theoretical grounding enhances the model's interpretability.
2. Performance: The model achieves competitive results in semi-supervised learning and clustering tasks, particularly excelling in NORB and MNIST datasets.
3. Flexibility of Priors: The ability to impose different priors (Gaussian or categorical) is a notable strength, enabling diverse applications such as clustering, semi-supervised learning, and disentangling content and style.
4. Architectural Insights: The exploration of location-dependent vs. location-independent biases and their impact on information decomposition is well-motivated and experimentally supported.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: The model closely builds upon adversarial autoencoders (Makhzani et al.), raising concerns about its originality. The differences from related works like VLAE and PixelVAE are insufficiently discussed.
2. Missing Metrics: The paper lacks results on standard generative model metrics, such as likelihood bounds or Inception scores, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's generative capabilities.
3. Experimental Gaps: There is no direct comparison of location-dependent and location-independent biases in quantitative terms, leaving the impact of these design choices somewhat ambiguous.
4. Clarity Issues: Some formulations, such as "limited stochasticity" and KL divergence optimization, are vague. Additionally, important content, including cross-domain relations, is relegated to the appendix, which detracts from the paper's readability.
5. Bibliographic Inconsistencies: The inconsistent citation of ICLR-published papers as arXiv preprints reflects a lack of attention to detail.
6. Organization: The paper could better highlight its contributions and motivation upfront, as the current structure makes it challenging to discern the key takeaways.
Recommendation:
The paper presents promising results and a well-motivated model but falls short in terms of novelty, clarity, and experimental thoroughness. The writing requires polishing to better emphasize the contributions, clarify ambiguous formulations, and improve organization. Additionally, a more detailed comparison with prior work and inclusion of standard generative metrics would strengthen the paper. I recommend accepting the paper as a poster, provided these issues are addressed in the final version.
