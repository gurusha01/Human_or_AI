This paper introduces Hierarchical Implicit Models (HIMs), a novel framework combining implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling to address challenges in likelihood-free inference. The authors propose a new inference algorithm, Likelihood-Free Variational Inference (LFVI), which leverages a GAN-style discriminator to estimate the density ratio between the variational joint and true model joint densities. This enables the use of implicit variational models, referred to as "variational programs," for scalable and flexible posterior approximation. The paper demonstrates applications in ecological simulation, Bayesian GANs, and sequence modeling with stochastic RNNs, showcasing the versatility of HIMs and LFVI.
Strengths:
1. Conceptual Contribution: The paper provides a clean synthesis of hierarchical Bayesian modeling and implicit probabilistic models, offering a general framework that extends the applicability of implicit models to richer latent structures.
2. Algorithmic Innovation: LFVI is a significant contribution, enabling scalable variational inference for implicit models without requiring tractable likelihoods or variational densities. The use of ratio estimation for the KL objective is well-motivated and aligns with recent advances in GANs and density ratio estimation.
3. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-written, with clear exposition of technical details, making it accessible to readers familiar with Bayesian modeling and variational inference.
4. Potential Impact: HIMs and LFVI have the potential to expand Bayesian inference to new classes of models, including simulators and neural samplers, with applications in diverse fields such as ecology, generative modeling, and sequence generation.
Weaknesses:
1. Restrictive Assumptions: The iid factorization assumption limits the applicability of HIMs to models with temporal dependencies, such as stochastic RNNs and the Lotka-Volterra model. This is a notable limitation for hierarchical models in real-world scenarios.
2. Experimental Weaknesses: The experimental evaluation is limited and somewhat artificial, with the exception of the Lotka-Volterra simulation. The results do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of LFVI over existing methods, especially in large-scale or real-world settings.
3. Discussion on Extensions: The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on extending HIMs to structured data like time series, text, or graphs, which are common in practical applications.
4. Objective Interpretation: Subtracting log q(x) from the ELBO removes its interpretation as a lower bound, and the paper does not adequately clarify the meaning of the modified objective.
5. Errors in Lotka-Volterra Model: Potential errors in the equations and parameter definitions for the Lotka-Volterra model raise concerns about the correctness of the implementation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper introduces a general and flexible framework for likelihood-free inference, which could significantly impact Bayesian modeling.
- LFVI is a novel algorithm that addresses key challenges in inference for implicit models.
- The paper is well-written and theoretically sound.
Cons:
- The experimental results are weak and do not fully validate the proposed approach.
- The restrictive factorization assumption limits the generality of the framework.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on extending HIMs to structured or temporal data.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in its conceptual and algorithmic contributions, the experimental weaknesses and restrictive assumptions temper its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on addressing the Lotka-Volterra model issues and providing a more thorough discussion on extending HIMs to structured data. This work represents a valuable step forward in likelihood-free Bayesian inference, even if its practical validation is currently limited.
