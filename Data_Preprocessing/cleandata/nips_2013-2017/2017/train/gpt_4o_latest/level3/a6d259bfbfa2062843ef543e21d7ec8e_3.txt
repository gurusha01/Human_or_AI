The paper presents a significant contribution to the problem of identifying the optimal root move in two-player zero-sum game trees with stochastic payoffs, leveraging a PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) framework. The authors propose two novel algorithms, UGapE-MCTS and LUCB-MCTS, which adapt existing best-arm identification techniques to the structured setting of game trees with arbitrary depth and branching factors. These algorithms propagate confidence intervals from leaf nodes upwards through the tree, employing a "representative" leaf sampling strategy to guide exploration efficiently.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical analysis and well-supported claims. The authors derive upper and lower bounds on sample complexity, demonstrating that their algorithms improve significantly over the state-of-the-art, particularly the FindTopWinner algorithm. Notably, the proposed methods achieve a 15-fold reduction in sample complexity in some experimental settings, which is a substantial improvement. The experimental results are comprehensive, covering depth-two, depth-three, and random tree ensembles, and convincingly validate the theoretical findings. The clarity of the paper is commendable; it is well-organized and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility. The authors also situate their work effectively within the broader literature on bandit problems and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), drawing connections to related methods such as LUCB and UGapE.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper makes strong contributions, the novelty of the algorithms may be questioned, as they are closely related to existing methods in the Multi-Armed Bandit literature, particularly in the context of the MAI (Maximin Arm Identification) problem. The theoretical and algorithmic similarities to prior work, such as LUCB and M-LUCB, limit the originality of the contribution. Additionally, the authors do not explore the potential impact of incorporating advanced techniques such as the LIL (Lower Confidence Bound) techniques from Jamieson et al. (2014), which could further enhance the performance of their algorithms. This omission represents a missed opportunity to push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art further.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper addresses a challenging and significant problem, providing both theoretical and practical advancements. The experimental results are compelling, and the clarity of the exposition makes the work accessible to a broad audience.  
- Con: The algorithms' novelty is somewhat limited due to their reliance on existing techniques, and the lack of exploration of LIL techniques leaves room for improvement.  
Recommendation:  
Overall, this is a strong paper with substantial experimental and theoretical contributions. While the originality of the algorithms could be questioned, the demonstrated improvements in sample complexity and the clear presentation of results make this work a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to the authors to explore LIL techniques in future work to further enhance their methods.
