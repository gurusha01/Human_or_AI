Review
This paper introduces a novel framework for error detection and correction in 3D neuronal segmentation, utilizing two multiscale 3D convolutional networks: one for detecting segmentation errors and another for correcting them. The proposed approach is particularly relevant to connectomics, where accurate segmentation of neuronal structures is crucial. The authors demonstrate that the error-detecting network can provide "advice" to the error-correcting network, significantly improving segmentation accuracy while reducing computational costs by focusing correction efforts on likely error regions.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Contribution: The decomposition of the segmentation task into error detection and correction is an interesting and practical approach. The use of the error-detecting network to provide "advice" to the error-correcting network is a novel contribution that improves both accuracy and efficiency.
2. Experimental Results: The paper provides strong empirical evidence, showing significant improvements in segmentation performance compared to a baseline. The precision and recall of the error-detecting network are impressive, exceeding 90%.
3. Computational Efficiency: The authors effectively demonstrate how the error-detecting network reduces the computational burden of error correction by limiting its application to error-prone regions.
4. Relevance to Connectomics: The work addresses a critical bottleneck in connectomics, making it a valuable contribution to this specialized field.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Generalizability: While the contributions are impactful for connectomics, the methods and insights lack broader applicability to the wider NIPS audience. The paper does not sufficiently address how the proposed framework could generalize to other segmentation tasks or domains.
2. Consensus Problem: The paper does not explore the consensus problem for the entire volume, which could have strengthened the framework's robustness and applicability.
3. Greedy Algorithm: The greedy algorithm used for segmentation updates is informally described and appears tailored specifically to the connectomics domain, limiting its utility in other contexts.
4. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is generally well-written, technical sections (3, 4, and 5) lack sufficient detail and formalism. For example, the iterative refinement procedure and the error-correcting network's architecture could benefit from clearer explanations and diagrams.
5. Overstated Comparisons: The comparison of error detection to supervoxel agglomeration tasks is overstated. This concept is well-known in computer science and should be presented more modestly.
6. Speculative Connections: The speculative connections to GANs and visual attention are not substantiated and should be moved to a future work or outlook section.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong contribution to connectomics, its relevance to the broader NIPS community is limited. The lack of generalizability and the informal presentation of key algorithms detract from its overall impact. However, the novelty of the proposed framework and the demonstrated improvements in segmentation performance warrant recognition.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and practical decomposition of segmentation into error detection and correction.
- Strong empirical results and computational efficiency.
- High relevance to the connectomics community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited generalizability beyond connectomics.
- Informal and unclear presentation of key technical details.
- Overstated claims and speculative connections to unrelated fields.
Final Decision: Borderline Accept. The paper is a valuable contribution to connectomics but would benefit from clearer presentation, broader applicability, and more formal algorithmic descriptions.
