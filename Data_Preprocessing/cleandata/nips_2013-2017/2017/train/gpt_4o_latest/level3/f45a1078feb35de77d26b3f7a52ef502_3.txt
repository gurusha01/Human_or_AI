The paper presents a novel approach for modeling 1D point processes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (W-GAN), bypassing traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors propose an intensity-free generative model that leverages Wasserstein distance as a training objective, combined with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for sequence generation. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to model diverse point processes without prior parametric assumptions. The authors claim that their approach outperforms conventional maximum likelihood-based methods, particularly when the underlying generative process is unknown or misspecified.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces an innovative intensity-free framework for point process modeling, which is a significant departure from traditional intensity-based methods. The use of W-GAN for point processes is novel and well-motivated, addressing limitations such as mode dropping in likelihood-based approaches.
2. Technical Soundness: The paper provides a rigorous mathematical formulation of Wasserstein distance for point processes and demonstrates its applicability through detailed experiments. The use of Lipschitz regularization to stabilize training is a thoughtful addition.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets are comprehensive. The method's robustness across diverse datasets and its ability to handle heterogeneous data are commendable.
4. Significance: The approach has potential applications in domains where point processes are prevalent, such as healthcare, finance, and social networks. Its ability to model complex, multimodal distributions without prior parametric assumptions is a notable contribution.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope Limitation: The proposed method is restricted to 1D point processes, which limits its applicability to higher-dimensional settings. A discussion on extending the approach to multidimensional point processes would strengthen the paper.
2. Training Complexity: The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of training W-GANs for point processes. Given the iterative nature of GAN training, this omission is significant.
3. Comparison with Simpler Models: While the paper demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches, it does not adequately address whether simpler models (e.g., Kernel Density Estimation with truncation or parametric Hawkes processes) might perform comparably in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.
4. Clarity of Evaluation Metrics: The origin and definition of the "real" evaluation metrics used in Figure 3 are unclear. A more explicit explanation would improve the paper's clarity.
5. Abstract and Related Work: The abstract does not adequately situate the work within the broader context of Bayesian inference methods for point processes. Additionally, the related work section could benefit from more comprehensive citations to recent advancements in the field.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound method with significant potential impact.
- The empirical results substantiate the claims of improved performance over traditional methods.
- The approach addresses a challenging problem in point process modeling and opens avenues for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The method's applicability is limited to 1D point processes, and the scalability to higher dimensions is not discussed.
- The lack of clarity in evaluation metrics and training complexity detracts from the paper's overall quality.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the performance of simpler baseline models in comparison to the proposed method.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. While the paper has some limitations, its novelty, technical rigor, and potential impact outweigh the weaknesses. Addressing the clarity of evaluation metrics, training complexity, and broader applicability would significantly enhance the paper.
