The paper introduces the Deep Dynamic Poisson Factorization (DDPFA) model, a novel approach for analyzing sequential count data by incorporating temporal dependencies through a simplified recurrent neural network (RNN). The model builds on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) and employs a deep hierarchical structure to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies. Variational inference is used for parameter estimation, with an additional optimization step for neural network parameters. The authors evaluate the model on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in prediction and interpretability compared to baseline methods like PGDS, LSTM, and PFA.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses a critical limitation in existing Poisson factorization models by incorporating deep and dynamic structures to capture complex temporal dependencies. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of time-series analysis for count data.
2. Experimental Evaluation: The authors validate the model on diverse datasets, including synthetic and real-world data, showcasing its robustness and interpretability. The comparison with established methods like PGDS and LSTM highlights the advantages of DDPFA.
3. Interpretability: The model's ability to capture long-term dependencies and its hierarchical structure provide interpretable latent factors, which is a valuable feature for real-world applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Technical Clarity: The paper lacks clarity in several key areas. For instance, the parameterization of the Gamma distribution in Eq. 4 and the distribution for \(\theta_t\) in Eq. 3 are not adequately explained. Additionally, the loss function in Eq. 15 is poorly defined, making it difficult to fully understand the optimization process.
2. Incorrect Claims: The discussion on "implicit distributions" is misleading, as Eqs. 9 and 10 explicitly define Gamma distributions. This misrepresentation undermines the technical rigor of the paper.
3. Evaluation Metrics: The use of MSE and PMSE as evaluation metrics is inadequate for Poisson factorization models. Predictive log-likelihood should be included to provide a more appropriate assessment of model performance.
4. Experimental Design: The choice of \(K\) (number of factors) in experiments is too small (e.g., \(K=3\) for some datasets). Increasing \(K\) to at least 100, as suggested, would likely yield more insightful results.
5. Writing Quality: The manuscript suffers from poor writing quality, including excessive use of passive voice, typos, and grammatical errors. This significantly hampers readability and comprehension.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper proposes a novel and potentially impactful model for sequential count data analysis, with promising experimental results and interpretability.
- Con: The technical presentation is incomplete and unclear, and the evaluation metrics and experimental design are suboptimal.
Recommendation: While the paper presents an interesting idea with strong potential, the technical and presentation issues must be addressed before publication. I recommend a major revision to improve clarity, correct inaccuracies, and enhance experimental design.
