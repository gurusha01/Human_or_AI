The paper proposes an efficient approximation for Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV), termed Approximate Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (ALOOCV), applicable to parametric learning models with regularization. The authors extend existing efficient LOOCV formulas, previously limited to ridge regression, to broader classes of models. This work is novel and addresses a significant computational bottleneck in LOOCV, which is often impractical for large-scale datasets due to its high computational cost. The proposed ALOOCV is shown to be computationally efficient, theoretically sound, and empirically effective, with applications to model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
The paper is well-written, technically rigorous, and polished. The authors provide clear theoretical guarantees for ALOOCV's performance, demonstrating its asymptotic equivalence to the Takeuchi Information Criterion (TIC) under certain conditions. They also show that ALOOCV simplifies to exact LOOCV for kernel ridge regression, further validating its correctness. The use of ALOOCV to develop a gradient-based optimization algorithm for hyperparameter tuning is a notable contribution, as it enables efficient tuning of multiple regularization parameters, a task that is computationally prohibitive with standard LOOCV. The experimental results on ridge regression, logistic regression, and elastic net regression convincingly demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of ALOOCV compared to traditional LOOCV and influence function-based approximations.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The work generalizes LOOCV approximations beyond ridge regression, which is novel and impactful. The connection to TIC and influence functions is well-articulated.
2. Quality: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results are comprehensive, covering diverse models and datasets. The experiments validate both the accuracy and computational efficiency of ALOOCV.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, theorems, and proofs. The numerical experiments are presented with sufficient detail.
4. Significance: The proposed method has broad applicability in machine learning, particularly for large-scale problems where LOOCV is infeasible. The ability to tune multiple hyperparameters efficiently is a valuable contribution.
Weaknesses:
1. References: Minor issues with capitalization in references (e.g., "Bayesian" and words in book/journal titles) should be corrected.
2. Practicality: While the authors claim ALOOCV scales well for large datasets, additional experiments on extremely large-scale problems would strengthen the paper's claims about scalability.
3. Extensions: The discussion on extending ALOOCV to non-smooth loss functions (e.g., L1 regularization) is somewhat limited and could benefit from further elaboration.
Arguments for acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical problem in machine learning with a novel and theoretically grounded solution.
- The contributions are significant, with potential for widespread adoption in both research and practice.
- The writing and experiments are of high quality, making the paper accessible and convincing.
Arguments against acceptance:
- The scalability claims could be further substantiated with experiments on larger datasets.
- The discussion on handling non-smooth regularizers could be expanded.
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. The minor issues identified do not detract from the overall quality and impact of the work.
