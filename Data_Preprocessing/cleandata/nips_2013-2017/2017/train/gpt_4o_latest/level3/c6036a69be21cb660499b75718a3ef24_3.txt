The paper introduces a novel two-stage decoding process for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, termed "deliberation networks," where a second-pass decoder refines the output of an initial decoder. This approach is inspired by human cognitive processes of iterative refinement, aiming to leverage the entire target sequence context for improved generation quality. The method is evaluated on neural machine translation (NMT) and text summarization tasks, demonstrating improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores, with a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.5 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task.
Strengths:
1. Motivation and Novelty: The paper is well-motivated, drawing parallels between human deliberation and the proposed refinement process. The introduction of a second-pass decoder to incorporate global context is a novel contribution to the Seq2Seq framework.
2. Performance Gains: The method achieves measurable improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores across tasks, with notable gains over baseline models, including a new state-of-the-art result in NMT.
3. Thorough Evaluation: The experiments are conducted on multiple tasks (NMT and text summarization) and datasets, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the approach. The qualitative examples further illustrate the benefits of the deliberation process.
4. Comparison with Related Work: The paper positions its contributions well against related methods, such as statistical post-editing (SPE) and review networks, highlighting the advantages of joint end-to-end optimization.
Weaknesses:
1. Baseline Model: The primary baseline, RNNSearch, is outdated compared to modern architectures like Transformer models. Testing the proposed method on state-of-the-art models would strengthen the results and relevance.
2. Efficiency Concerns: The deliberation network significantly increases computational cost, requiring 50% more training time and doubling decoding time. This limits its practicality for real-time applications.
3. Comparison to Simpler Alternatives: The paper does not adequately compare its method to simpler baselines, such as forward-backward decoding or ensembling techniques, which could provide similar benefits with less complexity.
4. Clarity on Beam Search: It is unclear whether beam search is consistently applied to both decoders, which could impact the reported results. This should be clarified for reproducibility.
5. Limited Exploration of Multi-Pass Decoding: While the paper mentions the potential for multiple passes, it does not explore this direction, which could provide additional insights into the method's scalability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to improving Seq2Seq models, addressing a key limitation of one-pass decoding.
- It demonstrates significant performance improvements on challenging tasks, including setting a new state-of-the-art BLEU score.
- The method is grounded in a clear theoretical framework and supported by extensive experimental results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on an outdated baseline model limits the generalizability and impact of the results.
- The computational inefficiency of the method raises concerns about its practicality for large-scale or real-time applications.
- The lack of comparison to simpler baselines and modern architectures weakens the evaluation.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper presents an interesting and impactful idea with strong experimental results, but the reliance on outdated baselines and computational inefficiencies are notable drawbacks. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, emphasizing the need to test on modern architectures and clarify efficiency trade-offs.
