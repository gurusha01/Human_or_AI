The paper presents a novel multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) covariance function, the Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel, designed in the spectral domain. This work builds on prior research, particularly the spectral mixture kernel for single-output GPs, and extends it to the multi-output setting using Cramér's theorem. The authors propose a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities, enabling the modeling of delays, phase differences, and variable auto-covariance parameters across channels. This approach provides a principled and interpretable framework for designing multivariate covariance functions, addressing the challenge of constructing cross-covariances that need not be positive-definite.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending spectral mixture kernels to multi-output GPs, addressing an underexplored area in the spectral domain. The ability to model delays and phase differences across channels is a unique and valuable addition.
2. Clarity and Explanation: The introduction and explanation of the MOSM kernel are concise and well-written. The theoretical foundation, based on Cramér's theorem, is rigorously presented, and the spectral interpretation of the parameters enhances the interpretability of the model.
3. Relation to Prior Work: The paper clearly situates its contribution within the context of existing methods, such as the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC), Convolution Model (CONV), and Cross-Spectral Mixture (CSM) kernel. The MOSM kernel is shown to generalize these approaches, offering greater flexibility and expressiveness.
4. Experimental Validation: The synthetic example effectively demonstrates the model's ability to capture complex cross-covariances, including delays and phase shifts. The real-world experiments on climate and heavy metal datasets show competitive performance, particularly for the Cadmium prediction task.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Insights: While the experiments are adequate, they lack intuitive insights into why the MOSM kernel outperforms or matches other methods in specific scenarios. For instance, the Jura dataset results could benefit from a deeper discussion of the model's behavior with non-Gaussian data.
2. Computational Complexity: The paper does not explicitly discuss the computational cost of the MOSM kernel compared to simpler models like SM-LMC or CONV. This could be a concern for large-scale applications.
3. Sparse Implementation: The lack of a sparse implementation limits the scalability of the proposed method. While the authors mention this as future work, its absence in the current study is a limitation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and underexplored problem in MOGPs, making a significant theoretical and practical contribution.
- The proposed MOSM kernel is novel, interpretable, and generalizes existing methods.
- The experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, particularly in capturing complex dependencies in synthetic and real-world datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of intuitive insights into experimental results, particularly on the Jura dataset, weakens the empirical evaluation.
- The absence of a sparse implementation limits the method's applicability to large datasets.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of Gaussian processes and spectral modeling. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in experimental analysis and scalability, the novelty and significance of the proposed method outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses noted above.
