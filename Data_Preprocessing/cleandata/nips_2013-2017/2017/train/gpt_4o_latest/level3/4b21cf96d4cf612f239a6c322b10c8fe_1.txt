Review
This paper investigates image-conditioned caption generation using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) and introduces two novel latent space priors: a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) prior and an Additive Gaussian (AG) prior. The authors aim to address the limited variability of captions generated by standard CVAEs with fixed Gaussian priors. By structuring the latent space around multiple semantic components, the proposed AG-CVAE model achieves more diverse and accurate captions compared to a strong LSTM baseline and a "vanilla" CVAE. The paper is well-written, provides sufficient experimental details, and contributes to the growing body of work on diverse image captioning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The introduction of the AG prior is a novel approach to structuring the latent space for CVAEs. The additive mechanism allows for modeling object co-occurrence in images, which is particularly relevant for complex scenes containing multiple objects.
2. Empirical Results: The experiments demonstrate that AG-CVAE outperforms the LSTM baseline and vanilla CVAE in terms of diversity and controllability. The quantitative results on the MSCOCO dataset are compelling, and the qualitative examples highlight the model's ability to generate diverse and contextually relevant captions.
3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the proposed methods and sufficient implementation details to enable reproducibility. The inclusion of ablation studies and comparisons across multiple baselines strengthens the empirical evaluation.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Strong Evidence for AG-CVAE Superiority: While AG-CVAE shows promise, the paper does not provide side-by-side qualitative comparisons with GMM-CVAE, making it unclear whether AG-CVAE offers significant representation power beyond GMM-CVAE.
2. Unclear Diversity Evaluation: The diversity evaluation metrics are insufficiently explained. For instance, AG-CVAE performs worse than CVAE in some diversity metrics, but the reasons for these discrepancies are not discussed. Diversity evaluation curves with varying numbers of sentences would provide a more comprehensive analysis.
3. Limited Exploration of Priors: The additive Gaussian prior is a promising idea, but its design could benefit from additional constraints (e.g., sparsity or orthogonality on cluster means) to improve performance. This is acknowledged by the authors as a direction for future work.
4. Controllability Limitations: While AG-CVAE allows for some degree of control over generated captions, its ability to handle complex object combinations is limited, as noted in the qualitative examples.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in image captioning and proposes a novel approach with promising results.
- The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the proposed AG-CVAE model demonstrates clear advantages over baselines in terms of diversity and controllability.
- The work has the potential to inspire future research on structured latent spaces and controllable generative models.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of qualitative comparisons with GMM-CVAE and insufficient diversity analysis weaken the evidence for AG-CVAE's superiority.
- The paper does not fully explore the potential of the proposed priors, leaving room for improvement in both methodology and evaluation.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image captioning, but addressing the identified weaknesses—particularly the diversity evaluation and comparisons with GMM-CVAE—would strengthen its impact.
