The paper introduces Population Matching Discrepancy (PMD) as a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions based on samples. PMD is defined as the minimum weight matching between sample populations, making it a strongly consistent estimator of the first Wasserstein metric. The authors propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for optimizing PMD and demonstrate its application in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks. PMD is positioned as an alternative to Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), addressing key limitations such as kernel bandwidth sensitivity, weak gradients, and large mini-batch size requirements. The paper also compares PMD with MMD and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), highlighting its advantages in terms of parameter efficiency and convergence speed.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper introduces PMD as a differentiable and parameter-free approximation of the Wasserstein metric, which is a significant contribution to the field of statistical divergence estimation. The theoretical analysis, including strong consistency proofs, is rigorous and well-grounded.
2. Practical Advantages Over MMD: PMD eliminates the need for kernel bandwidth tuning, provides stronger gradients, and supports smaller mini-batch sizes, which are compelling improvements over MMD. These advantages are well-supported by both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence.
3. Applications and Experiments: The application of PMD to domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks is well-motivated. The experiments demonstrate that PMD outperforms MMD in terms of performance and convergence speed. The inclusion of additional experiments in the rebuttal further strengthens the empirical validation.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Comparisons: The paper provides a clear and detailed comparison between PMD, MMD, and WGAN, highlighting the trade-offs and advantages of each approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Large N Requirement: The method's reliance on large population sizes (N) for accurate estimation limits its practicality for datasets with limited samples or computational resources. While approximate matching algorithms (O(N²)) mitigate this to some extent, the computational cost remains significant for large-scale tasks.
2. Optimization Challenges with Small N: The paper acknowledges that for small N, optimization may converge to suboptimal minima, leading to lower entropy in the learned distributions. This limitation is evident in the low diversity of generated samples, particularly in the SVHN dataset (e.g., frequent repetition of digit 8 in Figure 4).
3. Image Quality: The generated images, while less noisy than MMD, are not as visually compelling as those produced by WGAN. This suggests that PMD may not yet be the optimal choice for generative modeling tasks requiring high-quality outputs.
4. Typographical Error: A minor typo ("usally" instead of "usually" on line 141) detracts slightly from the overall polish of the manuscript.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a novel and theoretically sound contribution, its practical limitations—particularly the reliance on large N and suboptimal performance in generative modeling—should be considered. The work is a valuable addition to the field, especially for tasks where MMD's limitations are a bottleneck. However, further refinement and exploration of PMD's scalability and diversity in results are needed.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Rigorous theoretical foundation and strong consistency proof.
- Demonstrated advantages over MMD in convergence speed and parameter efficiency.
- Well-executed experiments in domain adaptation and generative modeling.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Computational inefficiency for large N and challenges with small N.
- Limited diversity and quality in generated images.
- Incremental improvement over existing methods like WGAN in generative modeling.
Overall, the paper is a solid contribution with clear theoretical and practical implications, but its limitations suggest that it may be more impactful in specific applications rather than as a general-purpose solution.
