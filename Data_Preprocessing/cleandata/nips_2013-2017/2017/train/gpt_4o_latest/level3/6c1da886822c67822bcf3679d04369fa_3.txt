This paper introduces Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF), a novel approach to density estimation that builds on autoregressive models by stacking multiple MADE layers to form a normalizing flow. MAF is positioned as an expressive and flexible density estimator, capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in general-purpose density estimation tasks. The authors provide a detailed theoretical exposition, connecting MAF to related methods such as Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) and Real NVP, and demonstrate its empirical performance across several datasets.
The paper is technically sound and well-grounded in prior work. The connection between MAF and IAF is particularly insightful, as it clarifies the trade-offs between the two approaches in terms of computational efficiency and application suitability. The authors also highlight the relationship between MAF and Real NVP, framing MAF as a more flexible generalization. The experimental results are robust, with MAF outperforming competing methods on several benchmarks, including POWER and MNIST. The inclusion of a conditional version of MAF further strengthens its applicability, particularly in tasks where side information is available.
However, the paper has some limitations. While the techniques are incremental, the authors do a commendable job of situating MAF within the broader context of generative modeling. That said, the motivation for density estimation as a preferred approach over alternatives like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be more compelling. The paper briefly mentions applications like Bayesian inference and likelihood-free inference but does not delve deeply into why MAF is particularly advantageous in these settings. A more thorough discussion of practical use cases would enhance the paper's significance.
Additionally, some technical clarifications are needed. For instance, it is unclear whether the conditionals in the normalizing flow must be Gaussian, given the transformations involved. Similarly, the distinction between the base density of MAF as the density of \(u\) (Equation 3) versus \(p(xi|x{1:i-1})\) (Equation 1) could be more explicitly addressed. Finally, while MAF MoG achieves superior performance on some datasets, the necessity of using a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) base density when MAF is theoretically universal with multiple MADE layers warrants further explanation.
Strengths:
- Clear theoretical contributions connecting MAF to IAF and Real NVP.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.
- Effective use of MADE layers to enable efficient density estimation.
- Inclusion of a conditional version, which significantly enhances performance.
Weaknesses:
- Limited discussion of practical advantages of density estimation over VAEs or GANs.
- Ambiguities in the technical details regarding conditionals and base density.
- Insufficient justification for the use of MoG in MAF configurations.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a meaningful contribution to the field of density estimation and generative modeling. However, the authors should address the noted weaknesses, particularly by elaborating on the practical relevance of MAF and clarifying the technical ambiguities.
