The paper introduces a novel algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), for solving general Quadratic Programming (QP) problems with doubly stochastic constraints. The authors position MPGM as a significant advancement in the field of graph matching, addressing a well-known NP-hard problem in computer vision and machine learning. Unlike existing methods, MPGM directly integrates doubly stochastic constraints into the optimization process, offering closed-form update steps and guaranteed convergence to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality. The paper also highlights MPGM's ability to produce sparse solutions that approximate discrete constraints naturally, making it efficient and easy to implement.
The technical contributions of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide rigorous proofs of MPGM's convergence and optimality, leveraging auxiliary functions to demonstrate monotonic improvement of the objective function. Empirically, MPGM outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as IPFP, FGM, and RRWM on synthetic, image sequence, and real-world datasets. The experiments convincingly demonstrate MPGM's superior matching accuracy, objective scores, and robustness to outliers, while maintaining computational efficiency.
The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to algorithm design, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The authors provide sufficient background on related work, situating MPGM within the broader context of graph matching and optimization. However, while the theoretical guarantees are strong, the lack of a formal proof for the sparsity property is a minor limitation. The authors acknowledge this and propose it as a direction for future work.
In terms of originality, MPGM introduces a novel multiplicative update mechanism that directly handles doubly stochastic constraints, distinguishing it from prior approaches that rely on relaxation or projection techniques. The paper also extends the applicability of MPGM beyond graph matching to other QP problems in machine learning, which enhances its significance.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Rigor: Guaranteed convergence and KKT optimality are valuable contributions.
2. Empirical Performance: Demonstrates clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
4. Efficiency: MPGM is computationally efficient and simple to implement.
Weaknesses:

Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. MPGM represents a meaningful advancement in graph matching and optimization, with strong theoretical underpinnings and practical utility. Addressing the sparsity proof in future work would further solidify its contributions.
