The paper presents a novel and rigorous analysis of deanonymization in the Bitcoin network, focusing on the impact of the 2015 protocol change from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading. By modeling the problem as epidemic source inference over graphs, the authors provide a fresh perspective on Bitcoin's networking stack and its anonymity properties. This work is particularly significant as it bridges the gap between practical attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network and theoretical source detection literature, introducing new models and analysis techniques to the field.
The paper's quality is commendable. The theoretical claims are well-supported by probabilistic analysis, and the results are validated through simulations on both regular-tree models and a real Bitcoin network snapshot. The authors' use of maximum-likelihood estimators and lower bounds derived from suboptimal estimators is methodologically sound and thought-provoking. The clarity of the presentation is another strength; the paper is well-organized, with sufficient figures and detailed explanations that make the complex analysis accessible to readers. The inclusion of related work, such as prior studies on epidemic source detection and Bitcoin deanonymization, helps situate the contributions within the broader research landscape.
In terms of originality, the paper stands out by introducing new models for Bitcoin's spreading protocols and analyzing their anonymity properties in a rigorous, quantitative manner. The use of tools like nonlinear differential equations and generalized PÃ²lya urns to analyze diffusion spreading is particularly innovative and extends the scope of epidemic source detection literature.
However, the paper's significance to the NIPS community is less clear. While the technical contributions are robust and the topic of Bitcoin anonymity is timely, the paper's focus on a specific application (Bitcoin) may limit its broader impact on the machine learning and neural information processing community. The authors could strengthen the paper by explicitly discussing how their methods and findings could generalize to other decentralized systems or inspire new machine learning approaches for graph-based inference problems.
Pros for acceptance:
1. Rigorous and novel probabilistic analysis of Bitcoin's anonymity properties.
2. Clear and well-structured presentation with sufficient figures and explanations.
3. Innovative use of theoretical tools and models new to the epidemic source detection literature.
Cons for acceptance:
1. Limited discussion on the broader relevance to the NIPS community.
2. Focus on a specific application (Bitcoin) may narrow its appeal.
In conclusion, this paper is a high-quality scientific contribution that advances the state of the art in Bitcoin anonymity analysis and epidemic source detection. While its relevance to the NIPS community could be better articulated, the technical rigor and originality of the work merit its acceptance.
