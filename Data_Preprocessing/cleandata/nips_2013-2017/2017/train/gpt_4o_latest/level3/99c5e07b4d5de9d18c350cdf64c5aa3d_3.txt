The paper proposes a novel approach for improving intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) cursor control by introducing a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with goal position as a latent variable and a flexible likelihood model. The authors also incorporate semi-Markov dynamics with a latent counter variable to integrate information over longer histories, addressing limitations of the standard Kalman filter. The inference is performed using an online variant of the junction tree algorithm, enabling real-time decoding. Offline experiments demonstrate significant improvements in motion direction prediction compared to Kalman filter baselines, while online results show smoother and straighter cursor trajectories, albeit with less conclusive performance gains.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses an important problem in iBCI research, advancing cursor control for individuals with tetraplegia. The introduction of semi-Markov dynamics and the flexible likelihood model is a thoughtful extension to existing methods, allowing the model to better capture multiscale dynamics and multimodal neural activity. The use of a dynamic Bayesian network to explicitly model goal positions is a meaningful contribution, as it enables the decoder to leverage longer histories of neural activity. The offline results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the Kalman filter, and the real-time implementation is a significant step toward clinical applicability. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers outside the immediate field.  
Weaknesses:  
While the proposed method shows promise, its novelty is somewhat limited, as it primarily builds on existing techniques (e.g., semi-Markov models and Bayesian networks). The inclusion of goal position as a latent variable raises questions about the added complexity of inferring both movement intent and final goal, which is not fully justified in the paper. The online experimental results, particularly those in Figure 7, are less compelling, with only slight improvements over the Kalman filter. This raises concerns about the practical significance of the proposed method in real-world settings. Additionally, the supplementary materials contain typos in the derivation of the inference algorithm, which need to be corrected for reproducibility.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Addresses a critical problem in iBCI research with a well-motivated approach.  
- Demonstrates significant offline performance improvements.  
- Introduces a flexible likelihood model and semi-Markov dynamics, which could inspire future work.  
- Real-time implementation shows potential for clinical use.  
Con:  
- Limited novelty; builds on established techniques without groundbreaking innovation.  
- Online results are less conclusive, with marginal improvements over the Kalman filter.  
- Added complexity of modeling goal positions is not fully justified.  
- Minor clarity issues in supplementary materials.
Recommendation:  
Overall, this paper presents a well-executed study with meaningful contributions to iBCI research, though its novelty and online performance could be stronger. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly addressing the motivation for modeling goal positions and correcting the supplementary materials.
