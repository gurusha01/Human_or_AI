This paper introduces an Approximate Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (ALOOCV) method and a gradient-based algorithm for jointly optimizing regularization and model parameters. The contributions are novel and impactful, addressing the computational inefficiency of traditional LOOCV while maintaining accuracy. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for ALOOCV and demonstrate its utility in tuning hyperparameters, making it widely applicable across machine learning tasks. The paper also positions its contributions within the context of prior work, such as PRESS for linear regression and influence functions, while highlighting its advantages in terms of computational efficiency and robustness to overfitting.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Applicability: The proposed ALOOCV method is a significant innovation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to LOOCV. Its asymptotic equivalence to LOOCV under certain conditions and its demonstrated utility in diverse tasks (e.g., logistic regression, elastic net regression) make it broadly applicable.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed theoretical analysis, including error bounds and asymptotic characterizations, which enhance the credibility of their claims.
3. Practical Impact: The empirical results convincingly show that ALOOCV closely approximates LOOCV while being computationally efficient, even for large datasets. The gradient-based optimization algorithm for tuning regularization parameters is another practical contribution.
4. Clarity in Experiments: The experiments are well-designed, comparing ALOOCV with LOOCV and influence functions across multiple datasets. The runtime analysis and scalability discussion are particularly insightful.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity in Definitions and Notation: Some definitions (e.g., Definition 7) and equations could be better aligned with their preceding text. For instance, the applicability of the displayed equation to analytic functions needs clarification.
2. Missing Comparisons: While the paper demonstrates ALOOCV's efficiency, a direct computational cost and approximation accuracy comparison between ALOOCV and LOOCV on a subset of data points would strengthen the results.
3. Overloaded Introduction: The introduction is clear but devotes excessive space to groundwork, leaving less room for dense sections later in the paper. Condensing this section could improve the overall balance.
4. Typographic and Terminological Issues: Minor issues, such as the unclear reference to "PRESS" (l75), the ambiguous phrasing of "no assumptions on the distribution" (l90), and typographic errors (e.g., "few" instead of "a few" on l200), detract from the paper's polish.
Recommendations:
- Pro Acceptance: The paper addresses a critical problem in machine learning, provides a novel and efficient solution, and demonstrates strong theoretical and empirical results. It is likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners.
- Con Acceptance: Minor clarity and presentation issues, as well as the lack of a direct computational comparison between ALOOCV and LOOCV, could be addressed to further strengthen the paper.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide a computational cost and accuracy comparison between ALOOCV and LOOCV on a subset of data points.
2. Clarify the reference to "PRESS" (l75) and explicitly name it.
3. Rephrase l186-187 for clarity and address the applicability of Definition 7 to analytic functions.
4. Address typographic issues and ensure proper capitalization in references (e.g., "Bayes").
In summary, the paper is a strong contribution to the field, offering a practical and theoretically grounded solution to a well-known problem. With minor revisions, it would be an excellent candidate for acceptance.
