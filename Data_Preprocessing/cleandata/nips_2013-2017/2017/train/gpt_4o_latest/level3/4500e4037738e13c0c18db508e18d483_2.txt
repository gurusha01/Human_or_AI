This paper introduces a targeted error detection and correction framework for connectomics, focusing on improving the 3D reconstruction of neurons from electron microscopic imagery. The authors propose two tasks: error detection, which identifies split and merge errors in candidate object masks, and error correction, which prunes these masks to approximate the true object. Both tasks are implemented using multiscale 3D convolutional networks. The framework demonstrates well-quantified improvements over baseline segmentation, with the error-detecting network providing "advice" to enhance the accuracy of the error-correcting network. This modular approach is novel and addresses the challenges of high-resolution neuronal segmentation by decomposing the problem into two simpler tasks.
The paper builds on prior work in neuronal boundary detection and segmentation, incorporating recent advancements in convolutional network architectures, such as U-Net-inspired designs and feedback recurrent convolutional networks. The authors also explore a novel vector-field-based representation for error correction, which blurs the distinction between semantic and instance segmentation. This approach is a meaningful contribution to the field, as it leverages shape priors and morphological cues to achieve high accuracy, even without access to raw image data.
Strengths:
1. Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous experimental validation. The authors provide quantitative metrics (e.g., precision and recall exceeding 90% for error detection) and qualitative results to substantiate their claims. The iterative refinement process demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation accuracy.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed descriptions of the tasks, architectures, and training procedures. The inclusion of visual examples and computational cost analysis enhances the reader's understanding.
3. Originality: The decomposition of segmentation into error detection and correction is innovative, particularly the use of error detection to provide "advice" for error correction. The vector-field representation for error correction and the feedback recurrent convolutional net interpretation are also novel contributions.
4. Significance: The framework addresses a critical bottleneck in connectomics by reducing human proofreading effort and computational costs. The modular design has potential applications beyond connectomics, such as general image segmentation tasks.
Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on a baseline segmentation with sparse errors limits the generalizability of the framework to datasets with higher error rates or noisier initial segmentations.
2. While the authors mention potential improvements through data augmentation and co-training, these are not explored in the current work.
3. The computational cost of error correction, though reduced, remains significant, and further optimization could enhance the framework's scalability.
Pro and Con Arguments:
- Pro: The paper presents a novel and effective framework with demonstrated improvements in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It addresses a critical problem in connectomics and has broader implications for image segmentation.
- Con: The framework's reliance on a high-quality baseline segmentation and its computational demands may limit its applicability in certain scenarios.
In conclusion, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of connectomics and segmentation. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the proposed framework outweigh its limitations. I recommend acceptance, as the work advances the state of the art and provides a foundation for future research.
