The paper introduces the Deep Dynamic Poisson Factor Analysis (DDPFA) model, which leverages recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and gamma distributions to model long-time dependencies in sequential count data. By combining Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) with deep hierarchical structures, the model captures both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. The use of variational inference and neural networks to approximate the shape parameters of gamma distributions allows the model to incorporate prior and likelihood information effectively. The authors demonstrate the model's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting its superior predictive and fitting capabilities compared to baseline models such as PGDS, LSTM, and PFA.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The integration of RNNs and gamma distributions within a deep hierarchical framework is a novel approach to modeling sequential count data. This combination effectively addresses the limitations of shallow models like PGDS in capturing long-time dependencies.
2. Technical Soundness: The use of variational inference for latent variable estimation and parameter updates is well-grounded in theory. The reduction in variance through latent variable expectations is a notable improvement in computational efficiency.
3. Performance: Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness in prediction and fitting tasks. The interpretability of the latent factors further enhances its utility in practical applications.
4. Relevance: The paper addresses a significant challenge in sequential count data analysis, which has applications in diverse fields such as recommendation systems, text analysis, and disaster prediction.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Presentation: The paper suffers from critical typos, such as in Equation 10, which can confuse readers. Additionally, the lack of detailed graphical illustrations of the model architecture makes it harder to understand the proposed framework.
2. Experimental Limitations: The experiments lack comparisons with simpler models, such as single-layer and multi-layer variants of PFA, to isolate the contributions of the deep structure. Parameters like window size and the number of factors are not systematically analyzed.
3. Discussion on Fixed Parameters: The fixed scale parameters in the gamma distributions are not adequately justified or analyzed. This omission raises questions about the model's flexibility and robustness.
4. Contextualization: The introduction does not sufficiently discuss recent advancements in deep Poisson factor analysis models, which would provide better context and highlight the paper's contributions more clearly.
Recommendations:
- The authors should address the critical typos and improve the clarity of the manuscript. Adding detailed diagrams of the model architecture would significantly enhance comprehension.
- A more thorough experimental evaluation, including ablation studies and parameter sensitivity analyses, is recommended.
- The fixed scale parameters in the gamma distributions should be discussed in greater depth, possibly with experiments to evaluate their impact.
- The introduction should be expanded to include a discussion of recent related work, such as deep Poisson factor analysis models, to better position the paper within the existing literature.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Novel and technically sound approach to modeling sequential count data.
- Strong experimental results demonstrating superior performance.
- Addresses a significant and challenging problem in the field.
Cons:
- Clarity issues due to typos and lack of graphical illustrations.
- Limited experimental comparisons and parameter analyses.
- Insufficient discussion of fixed parameters and related work.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in terms of novelty and performance, the clarity and experimental limitations need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided the authors improve the presentation and expand the experimental and contextual discussions.
