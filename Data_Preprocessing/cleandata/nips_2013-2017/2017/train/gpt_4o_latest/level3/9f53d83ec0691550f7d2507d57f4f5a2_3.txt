This paper presents TranSync, a robust and scalable algorithm for solving the 1D translation synchronization problem using a truncated least squares approach. The authors address a fundamental problem in map synchronization, with applications in point cloud alignment and ranking from relative comparisons. TranSync iteratively prunes noisy measurements and solves a weighted least squares problem, leveraging warm-starts for computational efficiency. The paper demonstrates TranSync's superiority over state-of-the-art convex optimization methods in terms of both computational efficiency and robustness, particularly under biased noise models.
Strengths:
1. Algorithm Description: The paper introduces a novel iterative algorithm that builds on the truncated least squares framework. The theoretical analysis under deterministic and randomized noise models is rigorous and demonstrates TranSync's robustness and stability. The algorithm's ability to handle biased pairwise measurements with a sub-constant recovery rate is a significant advancement over linear programming methods, which are limited to 50% bias tolerance.
   
2. Computational Efficiency: TranSync achieves remarkable scalability, with a running time of \(O(|E| \log(n) k_{\text{max}})\), making it suitable for large-scale datasets. The warm-start strategy for solving linear systems at each iteration is particularly effective.
3. Numerical Experiments: The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. TranSync consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The results on point cloud alignment and movie ranking demonstrate its practical applicability.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed proofs of the main theorems. The inclusion of pseudo-code for TranSync and a comprehensive discussion of related work further enhances clarity.
Weaknesses:
1. Intuition Behind Theorems: While the proofs are rigorous, the paper would benefit from providing more intuition behind the theoretical results. For instance, a high-level explanation of why TranSync achieves sub-constant recovery rates under biased noise models would make the results more accessible to a broader audience.
2. Experimental Scope: Although the experiments are extensive, additional comparisons with other non-convex optimization methods (e.g., spectral techniques) could strengthen the evaluation. Furthermore, the impact of hyperparameters, such as the truncation parameter \(\delta_k\), could be explored in more detail.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in synchronization, advancing the state-of-the-art both theoretically and practically.
- TranSync's scalability and robustness make it a valuable contribution to the field, with potential applications in various domains.
- The clarity of presentation and thorough experimental evaluation ensure that the results are reproducible and convincing.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of intuitive explanations for the theoretical results may limit the accessibility of the paper to non-experts.
- The experimental comparisons could be broadened to include additional baselines.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to algorithm design, theoretical analysis, and practical performance are significant, and the weaknesses are relatively minor and addressable in future work. The paper is a strong scientific contribution to the field of synchronization and optimization.
