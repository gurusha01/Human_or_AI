The paper introduces the "PixelGAN autoencoder," a novel generative model that combines a PixelCNN decoder with a GAN-based adversarial inference network. The key contribution lies in replacing the traditional KL divergence term in variational autoencoders (VAEs) with an adversarial loss, enabling the model to impose arbitrary priors on the latent space. This design allows for flexible decomposition of information between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder, with applications in unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised learning, and cross-domain mapping.
The proposed model demonstrates strong performance on the MNIST dataset, effectively separating global and local information when a Gaussian prior is used. Additionally, by imposing a categorical prior, the model captures discrete class information in an unsupervised manner, achieving competitive clustering and semi-supervised classification results on MNIST, SVHN, and NORB datasets. The authors highlight the flexibility of the PixelGAN autoencoder in disentangling style and content, which is particularly valuable for downstream tasks like clustering and semi-supervised learning.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The paper presents a compelling variation of VAE/AdvNet/PixelCNN combinations, replacing the KL divergence with adversarial loss on the latent space. This is a novel and meaningful contribution to the field of generative modeling.
2. Effective Representation Learning: The model successfully disentangles global and local information or discrete and continuous factors, depending on the imposed prior. This flexibility is well-demonstrated through experiments.
3. Strong Experimental Results: The PixelGAN autoencoder achieves competitive performance in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, particularly excelling in clustering tasks.
4. Clarity of Experiments: The experiments are well-designed and insightful, with clear visualizations (e.g., Figures 2 and 6) that illustrate the model's ability to separate style and content.
5. Potential Applications: The discussion on cross-domain mapping and semi-supervised learning highlights the broader applicability of the approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Dataset Generalization: While the model performs well on MNIST, SVHN, and NORB, it is unclear whether the unsupervised separation of information generalizes to more complex datasets. Figure 6 raises questions about the model's robustness in such cases.
2. Comparative Analysis: Although the paper compares PixelGAN autoencoders to related methods, a more detailed comparison with VAE-PixelCNN models using different KL term scalings (e.g., Figure 2c) would strengthen the claims.
3. Dependence on Network Design: The claim in Line 98 regarding where information is stored depends heavily on function approximations and network design. This dependency could limit the broader applicability of the approach.
4. Clarity of Some Claims: While the paper is generally well-written, certain claims (e.g., the decomposition of information in Section 2.1) could benefit from more rigorous theoretical backing.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Novel and technically sound approach to generative modeling.
- Strong experimental results in clustering and semi-supervised learning.
- Flexible architecture with potential applications beyond the presented tasks.
Cons:
- Limited exploration of generalization to complex datasets.
- Insufficient comparative analysis with alternative methods.
- Some claims rely on empirical observations without theoretical support.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to generative modeling by introducing a novel architecture that effectively combines PixelCNN and GAN-based inference. While there are minor weaknesses, the strengths outweigh them, making this a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with suggestions to address the noted weaknesses in a future revision.
