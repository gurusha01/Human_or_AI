The paper presents a novel approach to nonparametric regression by addressing the challenge of identifying group-additive structures where the groupings of predictor variables are unknown. Building on the limitations of traditional additive models and functional ANOVA models, the authors propose a method that balances flexibility and interpretability while accounting for interactions between variables. The introduction of a penalty function based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) covering numbers is a key innovation, enabling the simultaneous estimation of group structure and regression functions.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The use of RKHS covering numbers to quantify group complexity is a well-motivated and innovative contribution. This approach bridges a gap in the literature by providing a systematic way to identify intrinsic group structures.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors establish strong theoretical guarantees, including consistency in group structure estimation and convergence of empirical risk to true risk. These results are supported by clear mathematical derivations.
3. Practical Algorithms: Two algorithms—exhaustive search and a backward stepwise approach—are proposed to handle the optimization problem. While computationally intensive, these methods are practical for different problem scales.
4. Experimental Validation: The method is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to recover true group structures and provide interpretable results. The application to the Boston Housing dataset is particularly compelling, as it highlights the method's utility in uncovering meaningful relationships.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: The optimization problem becomes computationally challenging for high-dimensional datasets with many variables. While the backward stepwise algorithm mitigates this to some extent, its greedy nature may fail to explore the full solution space.
2. Writing Quality: The paper contains numerous typos and unclear phrasing, particularly in equations and algorithm descriptions. This detracts from the overall readability and may hinder reproducibility.
3. Minor Gaps: The paper does not fully address how variable interactions are characterized beyond group membership. Additionally, the use of terms like "almost surely" and kernel terminology could benefit from more precise definitions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper tackles a significant problem in high-dimensional nonparametric regression and provides a novel, theoretically grounded solution.
- The proposed method advances the state of the art by combining interpretability, flexibility, and theoretical guarantees.
- Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The computational limitations of the proposed algorithms may restrict their applicability to large-scale problems.
- The writing quality needs substantial improvement to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Address the scalability issue by exploring more efficient algorithms or approximations.
2. Improve the clarity of the manuscript by fixing typos, refining equations, and providing more detailed algorithmic descriptions.
3. Expand the discussion on variable interactions and kernel terminology to enhance the paper's accessibility.
Conclusion:
This paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of nonparametric regression by introducing a novel approach to group-additive structure identification. While there are some limitations in scalability and writing quality, the theoretical and practical advancements justify its acceptance, provided the authors address the identified weaknesses.
