The paper presents a novel algorithm, TranSync, for solving the 1D translation synchronization problem, which involves recovering global coordinates from noisy pairwise measurements. The authors propose an iterative truncated least squares approach that prunes noisy measurements progressively. They provide a rigorous convergence analysis and exact recovery conditions under both deterministic and randomized noise models. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TranSync over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Completeness: The paper is technically robust, offering both theoretical guarantees (e.g., convergence analysis and exact recovery conditions) and empirical validation. The authors carefully analyze their algorithm under various noise models, demonstrating its robustness to biased noise, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The mathematical formulation, algorithmic details, and theoretical analysis are clearly presented, making it accessible to readers familiar with optimization and synchronization problems.
3. Originality: The proposed method is novel in its use of iterative truncated least squares for translation synchronization. The authors also extend the theoretical understanding of reweighted least squares in this context, which is a meaningful contribution to the field.
4. Significance: The results are impactful, as TranSync addresses key limitations of linear programming-based methods, such as scalability and sensitivity to biased noise. The application of TranSync to real-world problems, including point cloud alignment and ranking from relative comparisons, highlights its practical relevance and potential for broader adoption.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Scope: While the experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of TranSync, the comparison is limited to coordinate descent as the baseline. Including additional state-of-the-art methods, particularly non-convex optimization techniques, would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
2. Scalability Analysis: Although the authors claim scalability, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity in comparison to other methods, especially on very large-scale datasets.
3. Recovery Rate Gap: The authors acknowledge a gap between the current recovery rate and the theoretical lower bound. While this is an area for future work, addressing this limitation in the current paper would enhance its theoretical contribution.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in synchronization with a novel and well-justified approach.
- The theoretical and experimental results are strong, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.
- The work is relevant to multiple application domains, making it a valuable contribution to the community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental comparisons could be more comprehensive.
- The theoretical recovery rate, while promising, leaves room for improvement.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. It is a high-quality contribution that advances the state of the art in translation synchronization, both theoretically and practically. Addressing the minor weaknesses in future work would further solidify its impact.
