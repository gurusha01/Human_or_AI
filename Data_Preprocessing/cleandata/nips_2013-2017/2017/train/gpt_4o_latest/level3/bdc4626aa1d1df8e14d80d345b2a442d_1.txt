This paper addresses the critical issue of safety in contextual linear bandits by introducing a conservative constraint that ensures cumulative rewards remain above a baseline policy threshold. The authors propose two algorithms, CLUCB and CLUCB2, tailored for scenarios with known and unknown baseline rewards, respectively. The algorithms are based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework and are designed to balance exploration and exploitation while adhering to the safety constraint. Theoretical regret bounds are derived for both algorithms, showing that the regret consists of two terms: one corresponding to the standard linear UCB and another constant term accounting for the conservative constraint. Simulations validate the theoretical findings, particularly for the known baseline reward case.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The paper tackles a significant real-world challenge—ensuring safety during the learning process in online decision-making scenarios. This is particularly relevant for applications like personalized recommendations, where unsafe exploration can have severe consequences.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The regret bounds derived for both algorithms are rigorous and provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between conservatism and regret. The improvement over prior work, such as Wu et al. (2016), where the regret due to conservatism grows with time, is noteworthy.
3. Algorithm Design: The proposed algorithms are natural extensions of the linear UCB framework, and their design aligns well with the safety constraints. The distinction between known and unknown baseline rewards is well-motivated and handled effectively.
4. Empirical Validation: Simulations confirm the theoretical guarantees and provide a clear illustration of the algorithms' behavior, particularly the conservative phase and its dependence on the parameter α.
Weaknesses:
1. Visualization: Figure 1(a) does not effectively capture the initial conservative phases of CLUCB. A more detailed visualization, such as zooming in on the early rounds, would enhance clarity.
2. Experimental Scope: While the simulations validate CLUCB for the known baseline reward case, experiments for CLUCB2 (unknown baseline rewards) are missing. This is a significant gap, as the unknown baseline scenario is more realistic in many applications.
3. Clarity of Writing: While the paper is generally well-written, certain sections, particularly the regret analysis, are dense and could benefit from additional explanation or simplification for accessibility to a broader audience.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to safe learning in contextual bandits, a topic of growing importance.
- The proposed algorithms are well-designed, and the theoretical analysis is robust.
- The empirical results, though limited to CLUCB, support the theoretical claims.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental results for CLUCB2 undermines the completeness of the work.
- Visualization issues in Figure 1(a) and the dense presentation of theoretical results could hinder comprehension.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, contingent on addressing the weaknesses. Specifically, the authors should improve Figure 1(a) and include experimental results for CLUCB2 to strengthen the empirical validation. Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of safe reinforcement learning and contextual bandits.
