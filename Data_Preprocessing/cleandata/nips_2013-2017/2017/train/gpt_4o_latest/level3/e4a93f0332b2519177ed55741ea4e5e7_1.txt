Review
This paper introduces the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), a novel recurrent neural network architecture that combines the strengths of multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN incorporates a "Fast" layer, which learns complex transition functions over short timescales, and a "Slow" layer, which facilitates the learning of long-term dependencies. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of FS-RNN on character-level language modeling tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia datasets. Notably, an ensemble of FS-RNNs surpasses the best-known text compression algorithm in terms of bits-per-character (BPC). The architecture is generalizable, as any RNN cell can be used as a building block, making it adaptable to a variety of tasks.
Strengths:
The paper presents a novel and effective combination of multiscale and deep transition RNNs, addressing the challenge of processing sequential data with variable lengths. The proposed architecture is simple and adaptable, allowing for the use of any RNN cell, which enhances its generalizability. The experimental results are compelling, with FS-RNN achieving state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. The empirical analysis of network dynamics provides valuable insights into the model's ability to store long-term dependencies (via the Slow layer) and adapt quickly to unexpected inputs (via the Fast layer). The inclusion of code for reproducibility is another strong point.
Weaknesses:
The initial sections of the paper are difficult to follow, particularly the explanation of prior methods and figures, which lack clarity. The claim of "multi-scale" processing is somewhat misleading, as it refers to logical rather than physical timescales. Additionally, the paper does not compare FS-RNN to simpler alternatives, such as Residual Units or fully connected stacked cells, which could provide a baseline for assessing the model's complexity and performance trade-offs. The absence of standard deviations in the experimental results makes it challenging to assess the statistical significance of the reported improvements. Lastly, while the paper demonstrates strong performance on language modeling tasks, its applicability to other domains remains unexplored.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
1. Novel architecture combining multiscale and deep transition RNNs.
2. State-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
3. Generalizable framework adaptable to various RNN cells and tasks.
4. Empirical insights into the model's dynamics and performance.
Cons:
1. Lack of clarity in the introduction and related work sections.
2. Misleading use of "multi-scale" terminology.
3. No comparison with simpler baseline models.
4. Absence of standard deviations in experimental results.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in terms of novelty, adaptability, and empirical performance, the weaknesses in clarity, baseline comparisons, and statistical rigor detract from its overall quality. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided the authors address the clarity issues, include comparisons with simpler baselines, and report standard deviations for experimental results. The FS-RNN architecture represents a meaningful contribution to the field, and its generalizability could inspire further research in sequential data processing.
