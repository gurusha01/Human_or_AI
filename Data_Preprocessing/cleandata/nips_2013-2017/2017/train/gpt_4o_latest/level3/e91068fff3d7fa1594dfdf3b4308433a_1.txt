The paper introduces a novel gradient estimator for Variational Bayes that achieves zero variance when the variational distribution matches the true posterior. This is a significant contribution to the field of variational inference, as it addresses a key challenge in reducing gradient variance, which can hinder optimization. The authors propose removing the score function term from the gradient estimator, resulting in a path derivative estimator that maintains unbiasedness while achieving lower variance under specific conditions. The paper extends this method to more complex variational distributions, such as mixtures and importance-weighted posteriors, and demonstrates its efficacy through experiments on MNIST and Omniglot datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The proposed gradient estimator is a novel approach that builds on the reparameterization trick, offering a theoretically grounded method to reduce variance. The zero-variance property when the variational approximation is exact is a compelling feature.
2. Generalization: The extension of the method to mixtures and importance-weighted posteriors is well-motivated and demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.
3. Practical Implementation: The method is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to existing computation graphs in popular automatic differentiation frameworks, making it accessible to practitioners.
4. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on benchmark datasets (MNIST and Omniglot) provide strong evidence of the method's effectiveness, showing consistent improvements in most scenarios.
Weaknesses and Suggestions:
1. Bias in Non-Exact Cases: While the estimator is unbiased when the variational distribution matches the true posterior, the paper does not sufficiently analyze the bias introduced when this condition is not met. The authors should explore the practical implications of this bias, particularly in cases where the variational approximation is far from the true posterior.
2. Adversarial Impact of Bias: The potential adversarial effects of the introduced bias on optimization, especially in complex models, remain unclear. A discussion or empirical analysis of this aspect would strengthen the paper.
3. Mixture ELBO Clarifications: The paper lacks clarity on the definition and role of the variational distribution over \(\pi_c\) in the mixture ELBO. The authors should explicitly address how this impacts reparameterization and the gradient estimator.
4. Choice of \(zc\): The choice of \(zc\) in the variational mixture and its implications on the estimator are not adequately discussed. Providing more details or experiments to validate these choices would enhance the paper's completeness.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Theoretical novelty with a clear reduction in gradient variance.
- Practical and easily implementable method.
- Strong empirical results on standard benchmarks.
- Generalization to richer variational families.
Cons:
- Limited analysis of bias in non-exact cases.
- Insufficient discussion of potential adversarial impacts.
- Lack of clarity on certain aspects of the mixture ELBO.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong contribution to the field of variational inference, offering both theoretical insights and practical benefits. However, minor revisions are necessary to address the concerns regarding bias, adversarial impacts, and clarity in the mixture ELBO. With these revisions, the paper would be a valuable addition to the conference. Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions.
