The paper presents a significant generalization of prior work on `ℓ∞` recovery in high-dimensional models, extending the analysis from linear regression to general loss functions. The authors introduce a novel notion of separability for loss functions, which enables them to derive `ℓ1` convergence rates for general M-estimators. They apply this framework to compare generative and discriminative models, focusing on their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensional settings. The results are particularly relevant for differential parameter estimation and provide insights into the interplay between sample complexity and separability of loss functions.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Generalization: The paper extends classical results on generative vs. discriminative models to high-dimensional settings and general exponential families, which is a meaningful contribution to the field. The introduction of a softer notion of separability for loss functions is innovative and could have broader implications for analyzing other high-dimensional problems.
2. Unified Framework: The authors provide a unified approach to `ℓ1` convergence rates for both generative and discriminative models, which is a step forward compared to prior work that often treated these models separately.
3. Practical Implications: The theoretical results are corroborated with experiments on high-dimensional classification, demonstrating the practical relevance of the findings. The insights into sample complexity and separability are particularly valuable for practitioners working with high-dimensional data.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The presentation of the paper is disorganized, making it difficult to follow the key arguments. For instance, the discussion following Corollary 3 is unclear, particularly regarding isotropic Gaussian design and its implications for generative vs. discriminative models. The paper would benefit from a more structured exposition and clearer explanations of technical results.
2. Comparative Analysis: The paper does not adequately compare its results with related work, such as Ren et al.'s study on `ℓ∞` bounds and optimal rates for precision matrix recovery. A detailed comparison would help contextualize the contributions and highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.
3. Incoherence and Generalization: While the authors propose links between separability and incoherence, this connection is not sufficiently explored. A deeper discussion on how these concepts generalize in the context of high-dimensional models would strengthen the paper.
4. Overstated Claims: Some claims, such as those about sample requirements (e.g., line 218), are too strong given that lower bounds are not established. These statements should be softened to reflect the limitations of the analysis.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a valuable contribution by generalizing results on `ℓ1` recovery and introducing the notion of separability. However, its disorganized presentation and insufficient discussion of related work detract from its impact. I recommend major revisions to improve clarity, provide a more thorough comparison with prior studies, and expand on the proposed links to incoherence. Addressing these issues would make the paper a strong candidate for acceptance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and generalizable theoretical contributions.
- Practical relevance demonstrated through experiments.
- Unified framework for analyzing generative and discriminative models.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poorly organized and unclear presentation.
- Insufficient comparison with related work.
- Lack of detailed discussion on incoherence and generalization.
- Overstated claims about sample complexity.
Final Assessment:
The paper has significant potential but requires substantial revisions to meet the standards of clarity and rigor expected at the conference.
