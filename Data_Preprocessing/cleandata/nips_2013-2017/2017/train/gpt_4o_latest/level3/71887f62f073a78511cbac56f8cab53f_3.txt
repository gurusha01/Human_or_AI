The paper proposes a new randomized coordinate descent method (SMART-CD) for solving a general convex optimization problem involving the sum of three functions, extending the applicability of coordinate descent methods. By leveraging a combination of smoothing, acceleration, homotopy, and non-uniform coordinate sampling, the authors achieve the best-known convergence rate of \(O(n/k)\) under specific structural assumptions. The paper also provides numerical evidence comparing SMART-CD to state-of-the-art algorithms across several applications, including support vector machines, total variation regularization, and degenerate linear programming.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides the first rigorous convergence rate guarantee for randomized coordinate descent methods applied to the three-composite convex optimization template, which is a significant theoretical advancement.
2. Algorithm Design: The integration of smoothing, acceleration, and homotopy strategies into a primal-dual framework is well-motivated and addresses challenges in handling non-smooth functions and linear constraints.
3. Numerical Validation: The experiments demonstrate the practical utility of SMART-CD in diverse applications, with competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods.
4. Efficiency: The efficient implementation of SMART-CD avoids full vector updates, making it well-suited for large-scale problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Novelty: While the paper combines existing techniques innovatively, the individual components (e.g., smoothing, acceleration, and homotopy) are well-established in the literature. The contribution lies more in the integration of these techniques than in introducing fundamentally new ideas.
2. Technical Validity: A major concern arises from Assumption 1(c) on the bounded domain of \(h^*\), which is violated in Equation (9). This undermines the validity of Section 3.4 and Theorem 3.5, casting doubt on the results for constrained optimization problems.
3. Clarity Issues: The notation in Theorem 3.5 is inconsistent, with \(y^*\) and \(y^\star\) used interchangeably without clear definitions. This could confuse readers and detracts from the paper's clarity.
4. Incomplete References: A missing reference indicated by "[?]" in line 165 suggests a lack of thoroughness in citing prior work.
Recommendations:
- Address Assumption Violation: The authors should revise Section 3.4 to ensure that Assumption 1(c) is satisfied or provide a justification for its applicability in the constrained case.
- Improve Notation Consistency: The inconsistent use of \(y^*\) and \(y^\star\) should be corrected, and all terms should be explicitly defined.
- Cite Missing References: The missing reference in line 165 should be addressed to ensure the paper meets scholarly standards.
- Highlight Novelty: To strengthen the paper's impact, the authors could emphasize how their integration of techniques leads to new insights or practical benefits beyond existing methods.
Decision:
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to randomized coordinate descent methods, the lack of significant novelty and the technical issue with Assumption 1(c) are major concerns. If these issues are addressed in a revision, the paper could be a valuable addition to the conference. For now, I recommend a weak reject.
