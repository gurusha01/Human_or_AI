This paper introduces a novel approach to likelihood-free inference by proposing Hierarchical Implicit Models (HIMs) and a corresponding inference algorithm, Likelihood-Free Variational Inference (LFVI). HIMs extend the flexibility of implicit probabilistic models by incorporating hierarchical Bayesian structures, enabling the modeling of complex latent structures. LFVI, in turn, leverages implicit variational families and log density ratio estimation to approximate posterior distributions without requiring tractable likelihoods. The paper demonstrates the applicability of this framework across diverse tasks, including ecological simulations, Bayesian GANs for classification, and sequence generation using implicit models.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by combining implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, a relatively unexplored area. The proposed LFVI algorithm is innovative in its use of log empirical distribution subtraction to transform the ELBO, enabling log density ratio estimation for likelihood-free inference.
2. Scalability: LFVI is designed to scale to large datasets, a key limitation of traditional methods like ABC. This is demonstrated in experiments involving 100,000 time series, which would be infeasible for standard methods.
3. Applications: The paper showcases the versatility of the proposed method through diverse applications, including Bayesian GANs and deep implicit models for text generation. The ability to handle discrete data in Bayesian GANs is particularly noteworthy, as this remains a challenge for standard GANs.
4. Clarity of Methodology: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the LFVI algorithm, including its reliance on standard tools like reparameterization and stochastic optimization, making it accessible to readers familiar with variational inference.
Weaknesses:
1. Stability Issues: The paper acknowledges instability in the proposed method, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The reliance on log density ratio estimation, which is inherently challenging in such spaces, leads to biased gradients during early optimization stages. This is a critical limitation that undermines the robustness of the approach.
2. Bayesian GANs: The use of Bayesian GANs for classification, rather than standard GANs, suggests potential instability in the method when applied to high-dimensional data. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach to more complex tasks.
3. Experimental Validation: While the experiments are diverse, they lack a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods in all domains. For example, the performance of Bayesian GANs is only compared to Bayesian neural networks, leaving out comparisons with other advanced GAN-based methods.
4. Clarity of Writing: While the methodology is well-detailed, some sections, particularly those on ratio estimation and its challenges, could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive examples.
Recommendation:
The paper addresses an important problem and introduces a novel approach with significant potential. However, the instability of the algorithm and the lack of robust experimental validation in high-dimensional settings are major concerns. If the authors can address these issues, particularly by providing evidence of a stable algorithm and more comprehensive comparisons, the paper would make a strong contribution to the field.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel combination of implicit models and hierarchical Bayesian inference.
- Scalable algorithm with diverse applications.
- Addresses a challenging problem in likelihood-free inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Algorithmic instability in high-dimensional spaces.
- Limited experimental validation against state-of-the-art methods.
- Lack of clarity in some methodological explanations.
Final Decision: Weak Accept. The paper is a promising contribution but requires further refinement to address its limitations.
