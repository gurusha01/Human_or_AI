The paper presents a novel approach to defining covariance structures for multioutput Gaussian Processes (MOGPs) by generalizing the spectral mixture kernel using Bochner's and Cram√©r's theorems. The proposed Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel introduces a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities, enabling the modeling of delays and phase differences between channels. This work addresses a challenging problem in MOGPs and provides a theoretically sound framework with demonstrated effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:  
The paper's primary strength lies in its innovative use of spectral methods to design interpretable and flexible covariance functions for MOGPs. The ability to model delays and phase differences between outputs is a significant advancement over existing methods, such as the Cross-Spectral Mixture (CSM) kernel. The interpretability of parameters, such as delay and phase, is particularly appealing for applications requiring physical insights into the relationships between outputs. The authors validate their method on synthetic data, demonstrating its ability to recover known auto- and cross-covariances, and on real-world datasets, where it performs competitively against established models. The paper is well-written, with clear theoretical exposition and illustrative examples that effectively communicate the contributions. The MOSM kernel's potential to become a standard in MOGPs is evident, provided parameter learning remains manageable.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is technically sound, some limitations warrant attention. First, the method's performance with limited training data is not thoroughly evaluated, which is critical for real-world scenarios where data is often scarce. Second, the ability of the MOSM kernel to handle correlations between channels with differing length-scales is not explicitly addressed. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly for large-scale datasets, is not discussed in detail. The paper would also benefit from specifying the number of training points used in the synthetic example (Section 4.1) for reproducibility. Minor editorial issues, such as missing words on lines 74 and 140, should be corrected.
