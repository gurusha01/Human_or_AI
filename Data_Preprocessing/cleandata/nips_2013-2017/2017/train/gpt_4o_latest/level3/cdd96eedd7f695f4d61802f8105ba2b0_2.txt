The paper introduces PRUNE, a novel neural network model for unsupervised graph embedding that preserves both local graph structure and global node ranking. The model employs a multi-task Siamese neural network architecture and a carefully designed loss function that combines a proximity-preserving term and a global ranking term. The authors provide theoretical connections between their proximity objective and community detection, as well as an upper-bound-based formulation for global ranking inspired by PageRank. The proposed method is evaluated on tasks such as node ranking, classification, regression, and link prediction, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing unsupervised baselines.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The inclusion of a global node ranking term in the embedding process is a novel contribution. This aspect is well-motivated and addresses a gap in existing research, where global ranking is often overlooked.
2. Performance: The experimental results show that PRUNE consistently outperforms other methods across multiple tasks, including node ranking, classification, regression, and link prediction. This demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed approach.
3. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides theoretical insights connecting the proximity-preserving loss to community detection and the global ranking loss to PageRank. These connections strengthen the scientific foundation of the work.
4. Scalability and Simplicity: The model is computationally efficient, with linear time complexity per epoch, and achieves strong results with a single hidden layer and minimal hyperparameter tuning.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is difficult to follow in several sections due to poor organization and lack of clarity. For example, the motivation for using a Siamese architecture and the distinction between the two node representations (u and z) are not well-explained. The connection between the proximity-preserving loss and "second-order" proximity is also unclear.
2. Lemma 3.4: The explanation linking the method to community detection is confusing and lacks sufficient detail, making it hard to understand the implications of the theoretical results.
3. Experimental Analysis: While the results are promising, the experimental section lacks detailed descriptions of the baselines and an analysis of why PRUNE outperforms them. Additionally, robustness experiments could be expanded to include more diverse datasets.
4. Related Work: Although the paper references prior work, it does not sufficiently differentiate PRUNE from existing methods like SDNE or NRCL in terms of theoretical and practical contributions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and impactful idea by incorporating global node ranking into graph embeddings, which has clear practical benefits.
- The experimental results are strong and demonstrate the method's effectiveness across diverse tasks.
- The theoretical connections to community detection and PageRank add depth to the work.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and organization need significant improvement, particularly in explaining key concepts and theoretical results.
- The experimental section lacks sufficient analysis and discussion of the baselines, which weakens the empirical claims.
- Some theoretical aspects, such as Lemma 3.4, are underdeveloped and poorly communicated.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents an original and promising contribution, its clarity and organization require substantial revision. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, contingent on improving the manuscript's readability, expanding the experimental analysis, and clarifying the theoretical contributions.
