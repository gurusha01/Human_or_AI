This paper addresses the critical issue of aligning machine learning model training with task-specific objectives in the context of stochastic programming. The authors propose an end-to-end optimization framework that directly incorporates task-based loss into the training of probabilistic models. This approach is evaluated on three applications: inventory stock management, electrical grid scheduling, and energy storage arbitrage. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional modeling approaches and black-box policy optimization in most cases, particularly when the predictive model is imperfect.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper introduces a compelling approach to task-based learning, which is particularly relevant for applications where predictive accuracy alone is insufficient. The integration of stochastic programming with end-to-end learning is a valuable contribution to the field.
2. Experimental Validation: The authors provide thorough experimental results across synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating the practical benefits of their method. The 38.6% improvement in grid scheduling performance is particularly noteworthy.
3. Technical Rigor: The paper presents a detailed formulation of the problem, including the derivation of gradients through the stochastic programming solution. This level of rigor is commendable and ensures reproducibility.
4. Broader Implications: The approach has potential applications in various domains, such as energy, finance, and logistics, where decision-making under uncertainty is critical.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Problem Setup: The definitions of \(\mathcal{X, Y, Z}\) are unclear. It is not specified whether these sets are compact, unbounded, or finite, which makes it difficult to fully understand the scope of the proposed method.
2. Stochastic Programming Context: While the method is grounded in stochastic programming, the paper assumes familiarity with this domain. For readers unfamiliar with concepts like inventory stacking, additional background or examples would be beneficial.
3. Load Forecasting Results: Although the results for load forecasting are promising, they are not well contextualized for readers outside the energy domain. Presenting results on more familiar tasks, such as continuous control, could make the work more accessible to the NIPS audience.
4. Complexity of the Approach: The differentiation through the "argmin" operator and the reliance on sequential quadratic programming may limit the method's scalability and applicability to more complex or non-convex problems.
Suggestions for Improvement:
- Clarify the mathematical definitions of \(\mathcal{X, Y, Z}\) to improve the accessibility of the problem setup.
- Include an additional experiment on a more universally recognized task, such as continuous control, to better align with the NIPS audience.
- Provide a more intuitive explanation of the stochastic programming context for readers unfamiliar with the domain.
- Discuss the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger or more complex problems.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a novel and technically sound contribution, its accessibility and relevance to the broader NIPS audience could be improved. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and include results on a more familiar task to enhance the paper's impact.
