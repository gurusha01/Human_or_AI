Review of the Paper
This paper presents a novel approach for constructing deterministic feature maps for subgaussian kernels using Gaussian quadrature, offering an alternative to the widely-used random Fourier features. The authors demonstrate that their method significantly reduces computational complexity for sparse ANOVA kernels, from \(O(D^3)\) to \(O(D)\), and validate its effectiveness on MNIST and TIMIT datasets. The proposed method achieves comparable or better classification accuracy while being computationally more efficient. Below, I evaluate the paper based on the conference review criteria.
Quality
The paper is technically sound and provides a thorough theoretical foundation for the proposed method. The use of Gaussian quadrature for deterministic feature mapping is well-motivated, and the reduction in sample complexity is rigorously analyzed. The proofs, while relegated to the appendix, are complete and address key claims. However, the authors should explicitly reference the appendix in the main text to guide readers seeking detailed derivations. The experimental results on MNIST and TIMIT datasets are convincing, demonstrating both the practical impact and scalability of the method. The paper also highlights the advantages of deterministic integration over Monte Carlo methods in specific scenarios, which is a significant contribution.
Clarity
The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear introduction to kernels and quadrature methods that serves as an excellent primer for readers unfamiliar with these concepts. The theoretical sections are dense but sufficiently detailed, and the experimental results are presented clearly with appropriate comparisons. However, the discussion of related work could be expanded to include probabilistic Gaussian quadrature methods (e.g., Särkkä et al.), which might offer complementary insights. Additionally, the reliance on a key reference ([18]) that is an arXiv submission raises concerns about the reliability of some claims.
Originality
The work is original and addresses an important problem in kernel methods: the reliance on randomness in feature mapping. By leveraging deterministic Gaussian quadrature, the paper introduces a novel approach that reduces computational complexity and provides deterministic error guarantees. The focus on sparse ANOVA kernels, which encode sparse dependencies and resemble convolutional layers in CNNs, is particularly innovative and relevant given the resurgence of interest in structured kernels.
Significance
The results are significant both theoretically and practically. The reduction in computational complexity for sparse ANOVA kernels is a notable advancement, and the demonstrated performance on MNIST and TIMIT suggests that the method is applicable to real-world tasks. The paper also opens up avenues for further research, such as integrating probabilistic Gaussian quadrature methods or exploring other structured kernels. Given the growing interest in deterministic methods and the limitations of random feature maps, this work is likely to inspire follow-up studies and practical applications.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. The paper introduces a novel and theoretically grounded approach to deterministic feature mapping.
2. It achieves significant computational improvements for sparse ANOVA kernels.
3. Experimental results validate the method's effectiveness on real-world datasets.
4. The work advances the state of the art in kernel methods and has potential applications in various domains.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. The reliance on an unreviewed arXiv reference ([18]) raises concerns about the robustness of some claims.
2. The paper does not explore probabilistic Gaussian quadrature methods, which could provide valuable comparisons or extensions.
3. The theoretical sections, while rigorous, may be challenging for readers without a strong background in numerical integration.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper. It makes a significant contribution to the field of kernel methods by introducing a novel deterministic approach with strong theoretical and practical implications. Addressing the minor concerns raised above would further strengthen the work.
