The paper addresses the important problem of personalized patient screening by modeling diseases as finite state stochastic processes and proposing a computationally efficient approximate solution to minimize screening costs and delays. The authors present a novel framework that incorporates patient features, dynamic history, and external information, such as self-examinations, to construct personalized screening policies. Using a breast cancer dataset, the proposed algorithm demonstrates significant reductions in the number of screenings (28-68%) while maintaining comparable delays in disease detection relative to current clinical policies.
Strengths:
The paper tackles a highly relevant problem in healthcare, where personalized screening can significantly improve patient outcomes and resource allocation. The proposed methodology is general and applicable to a wide range of diseases, making it a valuable contribution to the field. The algorithm is computationally efficient, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error. The experimental results are promising, showing substantial reductions in screenings without compromising detection delays. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides sufficient technical details to reproduce the results. Additionally, the inclusion of robustness analysis and sensitivity to model inaccuracies is commendable.
Weaknesses:
Despite its strengths, the paper has several limitations. First, the assumption that disease models are known a priori is impractical in real-world scenarios, where disease progression models often need to be estimated from noisy and incomplete data. While the authors address estimation error theoretically, the practical implications of this limitation are not thoroughly explored. Second, the methodological novelty is somewhat limited, as the approach builds on existing techniques like Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) for POMDPs. The primary contribution lies in adapting these methods to the screening context, which may not be sufficiently groundbreaking for a top-tier conference. Third, the experimental evaluation compares the proposed algorithm only to trivial baselines (e.g., annual screening). A more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art personalized screening methods would strengthen the paper. Finally, the experiments do not adequately address robustness to significant inaccuracies in disease models, which is critical for practical deployment.
Overall Assessment:
The paper presents an interesting and relevant application of computational methods to personalized healthcare. While the results are promising and the algorithm is well-developed, the limited methodological novelty and practical relevance of the assumptions restrict its impact. I recommend acceptance only if the authors can address the concerns regarding robustness and provide comparisons with more sophisticated baselines. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Addresses an important problem in healthcare.
- Promising experimental results with significant reductions in screenings.
- General framework applicable to various diseases.
- Theoretical guarantees on approximation error.
Arguments against Acceptance:
- Assumes known disease models, which is unrealistic in practice.
- Limited methodological novelty.
- Experimental evaluation lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
- Insufficient exploration of robustness to model inaccuracies.
In summary, the paper makes a reasonable contribution to personalized screening but requires further work to enhance its practical relevance and novelty.
