Review
The paper introduces a novel approach to making nonparametric techniques invariant to additive symmetric noise by focusing on the phase of characteristic functions. This method is applied to two-sample testing and nonparametric regression on measures. The authors propose two main techniques: (1) a phase discrepancy (PhD) measure that disregards the magnitude of characteristic functions to encode invariance, and (2) a symmetry-based test on paired differences (SME). These methods aim to disentangle noise from signal in data, addressing a critical challenge in real-world applications where irrelevant variability often obscures meaningful differences.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The core idea of leveraging phase functions to achieve noise invariance is elegant and well-motivated. While not groundbreaking, it is a valuable addition to the literature on kernel embeddings and nonparametric methods. The theoretical exposition is clear, with rigorous proofs and well-defined propositions.
2. Practical Relevance: The paper addresses a significant problem in data analysisâ€”how to isolate meaningful differences between distributions while ignoring irrelevant noise. This is particularly relevant for applications like high-energy physics (Higgs dataset) and astronomy (dark matter dataset), where measurement noise is pervasive.
3. Experimental Validation: The synthetic experiments effectively demonstrate the expected behavior of the proposed methods, such as controlling Type I error and achieving invariance to additive symmetric noise. Real-world experiments highlight the practical utility of the methods, particularly the robustness of phase features under covariate shift.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Limitations: While the synthetic experiments validate the theoretical claims, the real-world results are mixed. For instance, the proposed methods underperform on some datasets (e.g., Aerosol dataset) compared to standard approaches, and the trade-offs between noise invariance and test power are not fully explored.
2. Reduced Test Power: The SME and PhD tests are conservative, leading to reduced power in large-sample regimes. While this is a trade-off for achieving noise invariance, it limits the applicability of the methods in scenarios where high sensitivity is required.
3. Exposition Issues: Although the paper is generally well-written, there are minor errors and ambiguities. For example, the distinction between the SME and PhD tests could be clarified further, and some experimental details (e.g., choice of hyperparameters) are not fully transparent.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and theoretically sound contribution to nonparametric methods, with clear practical implications.
- The proposed methods address a critical gap in the literature by encoding invariance to additive symmetric noise, a problem of significant relevance in many domains.
- The experiments, while not uniformly strong, provide sufficient evidence of the utility and robustness of the methods in specific scenarios.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reduced test power and mixed performance on real-world datasets raise concerns about the general applicability of the methods.
- The paper could benefit from additional clarity and a more thorough exploration of the trade-offs between invariance and sensitivity.
Final Evaluation:
Overall, the paper offers an interesting and valuable contribution to the field of nonparametric statistics and kernel methods. While there are some limitations in experimental performance and exposition, the core idea is compelling and merits publication. I recommend acceptance, with the expectation that the authors address the identified weaknesses in the final version.
