This paper introduces a novel "deliberation network" architecture for sequence generation tasks, addressing the limitations of traditional encoder-decoder frameworks that rely on one-pass decoding. The proposed model incorporates a two-pass decoding process, where the first-pass decoder generates a draft sequence, and the second-pass decoder refines it by leveraging global contextual information. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on neural machine translation (NMT) and text summarization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task and notable improvements in ROUGE scores for summarization.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper presents a unique approach by integrating a deliberation mechanism into the encoder-decoder framework, inspired by human cognitive processes. This is a significant departure from traditional one-pass decoding methods.
2. Performance: The proposed method achieves substantial improvements over baselines, including outdated models and more competitive alternatives like stacked decoders and review networks. The results on both NMT and text summarization tasks are compelling, with a new state-of-the-art BLEU score for English-to-French translation.
3. Generalizability: The deliberation network is applied to both shallow and deep models, demonstrating its adaptability across different architectures and tasks.
4. Clarity of Results: Quantitative results are well-documented, and qualitative examples effectively illustrate how the second-pass decoder refines translations to improve fluency and coherence.
Weaknesses:
1. Weak Baselines: While the deliberation network outperforms existing methods, the baselines used (e.g., RNNSearch) are not representative of the latest state-of-the-art models, such as Transformer-based architectures. This limits the broader applicability of the results.
2. Lack of Qualitative Analysis: The paper does not provide sufficient analysis to explain why the proposed method performs better, particularly in generating sentence beginnings. A deeper investigation into error patterns or linguistic improvements would strengthen the claims.
3. Clarification on Example Selection: The authors should clarify whether the qualitative examples provided were randomly selected or cherry-picked. Additionally, a more comprehensive quantitative analysis of sentence-level improvements would enhance the evaluation.
4. Beam Search and Likelihood Maximization: While the paper discusses the difficulty of beam search recovering from early errors, it does not adequately address how this aligns with the full-sentence likelihood maximization objective used during training and testing.
5. Reasoning Behind the Method: The explanation of how left-to-right decoding indirectly considers future words is insufficient. A more detailed theoretical or empirical justification is needed to support this claim.
6. Context of Prior Work: The paper does not sufficiently position itself in the context of related work, such as automatic post-editing or globally consistent decoding methods. A more thorough comparison with these approaches would provide a clearer picture of the contribution.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a promising and innovative approach, the concerns regarding weak baselines, insufficient qualitative analysis, and lack of contextual positioning need to be addressed. If these issues are resolved in the final version, the paper would make a valuable contribution to the field of sequence generation. Conditional acceptance is recommended, contingent on addressing these major concerns.
