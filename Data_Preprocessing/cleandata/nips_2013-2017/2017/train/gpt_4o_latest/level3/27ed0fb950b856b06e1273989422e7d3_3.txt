The paper introduces the Deep Dynamic Poisson Factorization Analysis (DDPFA) model, which combines Poisson factorization with a deep hierarchical structure to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies in sequential count data. By incorporating a recurrent neural network (RNN)-like structure, the model addresses limitations in prior approaches, such as the inability to model complex temporal relationships. Variational inference is employed for parameter optimization, and the model demonstrates strong performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including ICEWS, NIPS corpus, and EBOLA. The authors compare DDPFA with existing methods like PGDS, LSTM, and PFA, showing competitive or superior results in most cases.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The integration of deep hierarchical structures with Poisson factorization is innovative and addresses a key limitation in prior models, namely the inability to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the model on diverse datasets, including both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its robustness and applicability to a variety of domains.
3. Interpretability: The model provides interpretable latent structures, as evidenced by the analysis of factors in datasets like ICEWS, which highlights its utility in understanding temporal patterns.
4. Comparison with Baselines: The inclusion of comparisons with PGDS, LSTM, and PFA provides a clear context for the model's performance, though some comparisons (e.g., with LSTM) are not fully aligned due to differing learning algorithms.
Weaknesses:
1. Grammatical and Factual Errors: The paper contains numerous grammatical errors and typos, which detract from its readability. For example, the incorrect statement on modeling nonnegative numbers (lines 86-87) should be revised to accurately reflect the use of the Poisson Randomized Gamma distribution.
2. Evaluation Metrics: While MSE and PMSE are acceptable metrics, the use of held-out perplexity in Section 4.2 could have provided a stronger evaluation framework, particularly for text-based datasets like the NIPS corpus.
3. Lack of Direct Comparisons: The paper does not provide a direct comparison with single-level dynamic Poisson factorization models, making it harder to justify the need for multiple hierarchical levels.
4. Presentation Issues: The best results in Table 2 should be highlighted in bold for clarity. Additionally, the paper could benefit from better organization and clearer explanations of complex equations and inference steps.
5. Scalability Concerns: The discussion on "pruning" and the limited utility of adding more layers suggests potential scalability issues, which are not fully addressed in the paper.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to sequential count analysis by proposing a novel model that effectively captures complex temporal dependencies. However, the grammatical errors, factual inaccuracies, and lack of direct comparisons with simpler models weaken its overall impact. I recommend acceptance contingent on revisions to address these issues, particularly the correction of the modeling statement, improved clarity in presentation, and a stronger justification for the hierarchical structure. Highlighting the best results in tables and refining the evaluation metrics would further enhance the paper's quality.
