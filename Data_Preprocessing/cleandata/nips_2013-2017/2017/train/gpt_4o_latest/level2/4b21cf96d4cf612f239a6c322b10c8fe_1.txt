This paper introduces two novel approaches for enhancing image caption diversity and accuracy using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs): GMM-CVAE with a Gaussian Mixture Model prior and AG-CVAE with an Additive Gaussian prior. The authors address the limitations of "vanilla" CVAEs, which tend to collapse to a single mode and produce less diverse captions. By structuring the latent space around multiple components corresponding to different image content types, the proposed methods aim to generate captions that better reflect the complexity and variability of image content. Experiments on the MSCOCO dataset demonstrate that both models outperform LSTM and vanilla CVAE baselines, with AG-CVAE showing superior diversity and controllability.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing structured priors (GMM and AG) to CVAEs for image captioning, a task where diversity is crucial. The AG-CVAE model, in particular, offers an interpretable and flexible mechanism for generating captions conditioned on multiple objects.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, with evaluations using standard metrics (BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, and ROUGE) and diversity measures. The results convincingly show that AG-CVAE achieves the best diversity and controllability while maintaining competitive accuracy.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The mathematical formulations of the models are clearly presented, and the experimental setup is detailed, making the work reproducible.
4. Practical Relevance: The ability to generate diverse and controllable captions has practical implications for applications like assistive technologies and content generation.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Exploration of Controllability: While AG-CVAE demonstrates some controllability by modifying object vectors, the paper acknowledges that it struggles to generate captions with more than two or three objects in unusual combinations. Further exploration of this limitation would strengthen the work.
2. Dependence on Object Detection: The reliance on object detection for generating cluster vectors (c(I)) may limit the applicability of the method in scenarios where object annotations are unavailable or detection models are unreliable.
3. Re-ranking Gap: The gap between oracle and re-ranking performance suggests that the generated captions, while diverse, may still lack coherence or relevance in some cases. This highlights the need for better re-ranking strategies, which could have been explored further.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:
- The paper addresses a well-motivated problem and proposes innovative solutions.
- AG-CVAE shows clear advantages in diversity and controllability, advancing the state of the art.
- The experiments are rigorous, and the results are compelling.
Con Acceptance Arguments:
- The controllability of AG-CVAE is not fully realized, and its limitations are not deeply analyzed.
- The reliance on object detection may restrict generalizability.
Recommendation: Accept. While there are some limitations, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of image captioning by introducing novel methods for improving diversity and controllability. The proposed AG-CVAE model, in particular, has significant potential for further development and practical applications.
