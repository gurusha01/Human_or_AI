The paper proposes a novel intensity-free generative model for temporal point processes, trained using a likelihood-free approach based on the Wasserstein distance. This work addresses key limitations of traditional intensity-based models, such as their reliance on parametric assumptions and the susceptibility of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to mode dropping in multi-modal distributions. The authors extend Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) to point processes, leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation. The paper claims four main contributions: (i) introducing the first intensity-free generative model for point processes, (ii) adapting WGANs for point processes, (iii) employing statistical and quantitative evaluation metrics, and (iv) demonstrating superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces an innovative approach to modeling point processes without relying on intensity functions, which is a significant departure from traditional methods. The use of WGANs in this context is novel and well-motivated.
2. Technical Soundness: The theoretical framework is well-developed, with clear definitions of Wasserstein distance for point processes and its application in adversarial training. The authors provide detailed explanations of the generator and discriminator architectures and enforce Lipschitz constraints effectively.
3. Experimental Rigor: The paper includes extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed model across diverse scenarios. The evaluation metrics, such as QQ plots and empirical intensity deviation, are appropriate and provide objective comparisons.
4. Practical Significance: The intensity-free approach is particularly useful for real-world applications where the underlying generative process is unknown or complex. The model's ability to handle heterogeneous data and avoid mode dropping is a significant advantage.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the technical content is thorough, the paper is dense and could benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations, particularly in the mathematical derivations. For instance, the discussion of Wasserstein distance and its computation is complex and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with optimal transport theory.
2. Evaluation Metrics: Although the paper uses objective metrics, it relies heavily on empirical intensity and QQ plots, which may not fully capture the model's performance in downstream tasks like prediction or simulation accuracy.
3. Comparative Baselines: The comparison with MLE-based methods is insightful, but the paper could include additional baselines, such as recent neural point process models that do not rely on explicit intensity functions.
4. Computational Cost: The paper does not discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed method, particularly in comparison to traditional intensity-based models. The use of RNNs and Wasserstein distance may introduce significant overhead.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong contribution to the field of generative modeling for point processes and addresses a critical gap in the literature. Its novel approach, rigorous experimentation, and practical relevance make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, the authors should improve the clarity of the presentation and provide additional insights into computational efficiency and downstream applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Novel and well-motivated approach to point process modeling.
