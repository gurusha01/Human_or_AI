This paper introduces a novel framework for error detection and correction in 3D neuronal segmentation from electron microscopy imagery, addressing a critical bottleneck in connectomics. The authors propose two tasks: error detection, which identifies split and merge errors in segmentation masks, and error correction, which prunes erroneous regions to recover the true object. These tasks are implemented using multiscale 3D convolutional networks, and the authors demonstrate that the error-detecting network can provide "advice" to enhance the performance of the error-correcting network. The paper claims significant improvements over a baseline segmentation pipeline and highlights computational efficiency gains by selectively applying error correction only where errors are predicted.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The decomposition of the segmentation problem into error detection and correction is innovative and practical. The use of error detection to guide error correction, both spatially and through advice masks, represents a meaningful advancement over prior work.
2. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-documented architectures and training procedures for both networks. The use of vector fields for error correction is a creative approach that bridges semantic and instance segmentation.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide strong empirical support for their claims, including quantitative metrics (e.g., precision, recall, and variation of information) and qualitative examples. The results demonstrate clear improvements over the baseline.
4. Practical Utility: The proposed framework reduces human proofreading effort and computational costs, making it highly relevant for large-scale connectomics projects.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with detailed explanations of the tasks, architectures, and experimental setup. Figures and tables effectively illustrate the results.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Generalization: While the framework is well-suited for neuronal segmentation, its applicability to other image segmentation tasks is not explored. A broader discussion of generalizability would strengthen the paper.
2. Error Detection Limitations: The error-detecting network's performance without the raw image is impressive but raises questions about its robustness in more complex datasets where shape cues alone may not suffice.
3. Baseline Comparisons: The paper compares its approach to a single baseline segmentation pipeline. Including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Reproducibility: While the architectures and training procedures are described, some implementation details (e.g., hyperparameters, data augmentation specifics) are relegated to the appendix, which may hinder reproducibility.
5. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The authors briefly mention that their method cannot fix errors at the supervoxel level, but a more thorough discussion of limitations and potential failure cases would be beneficial.
Recommendation:
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of connectomics and 3D image segmentation. Its innovative approach to error detection and correction, combined with strong experimental results, makes it a valuable addition to the conference. However, addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly regarding generalizability and broader comparisons, would further enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
