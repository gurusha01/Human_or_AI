The paper introduces Hierarchical Implicit Models (HIMs) and a novel inference algorithm, Likelihood-Free Variational Inference (LFVI), to address challenges in specifying complex latent structures and performing scalable inference in implicit probabilistic models. HIMs combine the flexibility of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, enabling models with rich latent structures to be defined via simulators. LFVI extends variational inference to implicit models by employing implicit variational families, allowing for accurate posterior approximations without requiring tractable densities. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach through diverse applications, including ecological simulations, Bayesian GANs for discrete data, and deep implicit models for text generation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a significant advancement by merging hierarchical Bayesian modeling with implicit densities, an underexplored area in probabilistic modeling. The development of LFVI is a notable contribution, as it enables scalable inference in implicit models, addressing a key limitation of existing methods.
2. Practical Applications: The paper demonstrates the versatility of HIMs and LFVI through diverse and relevant applications, such as ecological modeling and Bayesian GANs. The ability to handle discrete data in Bayesian GANs is particularly noteworthy, as this is a known challenge in traditional GANs.
3. Scalability: LFVI's scalability to large datasets is convincingly demonstrated, particularly in the predator-prey simulation with 100,000 time series, which is infeasible with traditional methods.
4. Clarity of Algorithm: The LFVI algorithm is well-detailed, with clear mathematical derivations and practical implementation steps. The use of ratio estimation to handle intractable densities is innovative and well-justified.
Weaknesses:
1. Stability of Ratio Estimation: While ratio estimation is central to LFVI, the paper acknowledges stability issues, particularly in large-scale applications. Although potential solutions are hinted at, a more thorough exploration of these challenges and mitigation strategies would strengthen the work.
2. Limited Comparison: The experimental results, while promising, lack comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods beyond ABC approaches. For example, comparisons with other scalable inference techniques for implicit models would provide a clearer picture of LFVI's relative performance.
3. Reproducibility: While the algorithm is described in detail, the paper does not provide sufficient implementation details or links to code repositories, which could hinder reproducibility.
4. Clarity in Writing: Although the paper is generally well-written, certain sections, such as the derivation of the KL objective and ratio estimation, are dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the topic to follow.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical gap in probabilistic modeling by enabling scalable inference in implicit models with hierarchical structures.
- The proposed methods are novel, technically sound, and supported by diverse applications.
- The work has the potential to significantly impact fields like ecology, generative modeling, and Bayesian inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Stability issues in ratio estimation remain unresolved, which could limit the practical applicability of LFVI.
- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, particularly in benchmarking against alternative methods.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide additional experiments comparing LFVI with other inference techniques for implicit models.
2. Include more discussion on the stability of ratio estimation and potential solutions.
3. Share implementation details or code to enhance reproducibility.
4. Simplify the presentation of complex mathematical derivations for broader accessibility.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper makes a strong contribution to the field, but addressing the noted weaknesses would further enhance its impact and clarity.
