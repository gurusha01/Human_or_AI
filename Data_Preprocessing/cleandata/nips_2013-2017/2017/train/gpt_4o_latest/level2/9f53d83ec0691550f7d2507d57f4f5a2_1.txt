The paper introduces TranSync, a robust and scalable algorithm for solving the 1D translation synchronization problem, which aims to recover global coordinates from noisy pairwise measurements. The authors propose an iterative truncated least squares approach that prunes noisy measurements at each step, leveraging a warm-start strategy to improve computational efficiency. The paper provides theoretical guarantees under deterministic and randomized noise models, demonstrating TranSync's robustness and stability. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that TranSync outperforms state-of-the-art convex optimization methods in both accuracy and efficiency.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a novel iterative algorithm for translation synchronization, addressing limitations of existing convex optimization approaches. The use of truncated least squares combined with warm-start initialization is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Theoretical Analysis: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for TranSync under both deterministic and biased random noise models. The analysis demonstrates the algorithm's ability to tolerate a higher fraction of noisy measurements compared to linear programming formulations.
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The superiority of TranSync in terms of accuracy and scalability is convincingly demonstrated, particularly in challenging scenarios such as biased noise and large-scale datasets.
4. Practical Relevance: The application of TranSync to real-world problems, such as joint alignment of point clouds and ranking from relative comparisons, highlights its practical utility. The results on the Patriot Circle Lidar dataset and Netflix movie rankings are compelling.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, certain sections, such as the algorithmic details and theoretical proofs, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Simplifying the notation and providing more intuitive explanations would improve accessibility.
2. Comparison with Baselines: Although TranSync is compared to coordinate descent and linear programming, the inclusion of additional state-of-the-art non-convex optimization methods (e.g., spectral techniques or gradient-based approaches) would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Reproducibility: The paper lacks sufficient details on implementation, such as parameter tuning and stopping criteria, which may hinder reproducibility. Providing code or pseudocode for key components, such as the warm-start strategy, would be beneficial.
4. Limitations: While the paper acknowledges some limitations, such as the gap between theoretical recovery rates and lower bounds, it does not discuss potential failure cases or scenarios where TranSync might underperform (e.g., extremely sparse graphs or adversarial noise).
Recommendation
TranSync is a significant contribution to the field of translation synchronization, offering both theoretical and practical advancements. The paper is technically sound, and the experimental results are convincing. However, the authors should address clarity and reproducibility issues to make the work more accessible and impactful. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving clarity, expanding comparisons, and providing more implementation details.
