The paper presents a novel framework, MAB-FDR, that integrates multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms with online false discovery rate (FDR) control to address the limitations of traditional A/B testing in sequential experimentation. The authors propose replacing sequences of A/B tests with best-arm MAB instances and demonstrate that this approach achieves low sample complexity while maintaining online FDR control. The paper's main contributions include: (i) defining a null hypothesis for MAB instances, (ii) deriving always-valid sequential p-values for continuous monitoring, and (iii) showing that combining MAB algorithms with online FDR thresholds results in sample efficiency, high power, and robust FDR control. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world data from the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The proposed framework is innovative, combining adaptive sampling (MAB) with statistical rigor (FDR control). This integration addresses critical issues in sequential experimentation, such as high false alarm rates and inefficient sample usage, advancing the state of the art.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including guarantees for mFDR control and power, which are crucial for the reliability of the proposed method.
3. Practical Applicability: The framework is highly relevant to industries like tech and pharmaceuticals, where sequential A/B testing is common. The ability to continuously monitor experiments while controlling FDR is particularly impactful.
4. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct thorough experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the framework's advantages in terms of sample complexity, power, and FDR control compared to baseline methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections, particularly the derivation of always-valid p-values and the interaction between MAB and FDR, are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids.
2. Assumptions: The framework assumes sub-Gaussian rewards and independence between experiments, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. A discussion on how violations of these assumptions affect performance would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Real-World Evaluation: Although the New Yorker dataset is a compelling use case, additional real-world applications (e.g., clinical trials or large-scale A/B testing in tech) would further validate the framework's practicality and generalizability.
4. Computational Overhead: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of implementing the combined MAB-FDR framework, which could be a concern for large-scale applications.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by addressing a critical gap in sequential experimentation. While some clarity and real-world evaluation aspects could be improved, the strengths of the framework outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and address practical considerations.
