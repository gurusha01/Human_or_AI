The paper presents a rigorous theoretical study of the query complexity of interactive clustering with side information, addressing a fundamental problem in machine learning. The authors propose a framework that leverages a noisy similarity matrix to drastically reduce the number of pairwise queries required to recover the true clustering. The main contributions include information-theoretic lower bounds, nearly matching upper bounds, and efficient, parameter-free algorithms for clustering with side information. The work also establishes connections to the stochastic block model (SBM) and provides experimental validation on real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles an important and underexplored problem in interactive clustering, providing a significant theoretical advancement. The introduction of side information to reduce query complexity is a novel and impactful contribution, with practical implications for active learning and crowdsourcing.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors derive strong information-theoretic lower bounds and propose algorithms that nearly match these bounds within a logarithmic factor. The use of Hellinger divergence as a key metric is well-justified and aligns with the problem's requirements.
3. Parameter-Free Algorithms: The proposed Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms are computationally efficient and do not require prior knowledge of parameters such as the number of clusters or the distributions of similarity values. This makes the methods broadly applicable in real-world scenarios.
4. Connections to SBM: The paper generalizes the stochastic block model, a well-studied framework in community detection, and explores how query complexity interacts with SBM recovery thresholds. This connection is both insightful and opens avenues for future research.
5. Experimental Validation: The experiments on the Cora dataset demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the greedy strategy achieves high precision and recall with a minimal number of queries, even when using approximate distributions.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the theoretical contributions are robust, the paper is dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with information theory or clustering. The proofs, though rigorous, are lengthy and could benefit from additional high-level explanations or visual aids.
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to a single dataset (Cora) and focus primarily on precision and recall. Additional datasets and metrics, such as runtime or scalability to larger datasets, would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
3. Practical Assumptions: The assumption that the oracle always provides correct answers may not hold in real-world crowdsourcing scenarios. While the authors briefly mention handling noisy oracle responses, this is not explored in depth.
4. Gap Between Bounds: There remains a logarithmic gap between the lower and upper bounds on query complexity. While this is acknowledged as future work, closing this gap would provide a more complete theoretical understanding.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. The work is a significant contribution to the field of interactive clustering, combining theoretical rigor with practical relevance. The proposed algorithms and their parameter-free nature make them highly applicable, and the connections to SBM provide a strong theoretical foundation. Addressing the clarity of presentation and expanding the experimental evaluation in a future revision would further enhance the impact of this work. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contributions to interactive clustering.
- Strong theoretical foundation with information-theoretic bounds.
- Practical, parameter-free algorithms validated on real-world data.
- Opens multiple avenues for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense presentation may limit accessibility.
- Limited experimental scope and focus on a single dataset.
- Assumption of perfect oracle responses may not generalize.
Overall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable addition to the conference.
