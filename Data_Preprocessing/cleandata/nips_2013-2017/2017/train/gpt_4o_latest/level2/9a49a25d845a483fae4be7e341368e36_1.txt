This paper presents a novel probabilistic framework for pre-processing data to reduce algorithmic discrimination while balancing utility and individual fairness. The authors propose a convex optimization approach that explicitly controls discrimination, limits individual distortion, and preserves data utility. The framework is applied to two datasets, including a real-world criminal recidivism dataset, demonstrating that discrimination can be significantly reduced at a small cost to classification accuracy. This work builds on and extends prior research by introducing a principled optimization formulation and addressing limitations in existing methods, such as the lack of explicit individual fairness constraints.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a probabilistic optimization framework that unifies and extends existing pre-processing approaches for fairness. The explicit inclusion of individual distortion constraints is a notable improvement over prior work.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, including conditions for convexity, robustness to limited sample sizes, and generalizability of discrimination control. These analyses enhance the credibility and reproducibility of the proposed method.
3. Practical Relevance: The framework is flexible and can accommodate multivariate, non-binary protected variables, which is a significant advancement over existing methods like Learning Fair Representations (LFR).
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on the COMPAS and UCI Adult datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in reducing discrimination while maintaining reasonable classification accuracy. The comparison with baselines and LFR highlights the trade-offs between fairness and utility.
Weaknesses:
1. Accuracy Trade-off: The method incurs a noticeable accuracy penalty compared to baselines and LFR, particularly on the COMPAS dataset. While this is partially attributed to the distortion constraints, the paper could explore strategies to mitigate this trade-off.
2. Complexity of Implementation: The optimization framework requires careful selection of metrics and parameters (e.g., distortion functions, discrimination thresholds), which may pose challenges for practitioners without domain expertise.
3. Limited Scope of Evaluation: The experiments focus on two datasets and binary protected variables in most cases. While the authors claim flexibility for more complex scenarios, additional experiments on datasets with multivariate or continuous protected attributes would strengthen the paper's claims.
4. Interpretability of Results: The relationship between the chosen distortion metrics and real-world fairness implications is not deeply explored. For example, the penalties for specific transformations (e.g., changes in recidivism or income) could benefit from further justification or alignment with societal norms.
Suggestions for Improvement:
- Investigate methods to reduce the accuracy penalty, such as adaptive distortion constraints or hybrid approaches combining pre-processing with in-processing techniques.
- Include experiments on datasets with more complex protected attributes to demonstrate the framework's scalability and flexibility.
- Provide more guidance on selecting distortion metrics and thresholds, potentially offering default configurations for common use cases.
- Discuss the societal implications of the proposed fairness metrics and constraints to enhance the interpretability and applicability of the method.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of algorithmic fairness by proposing a theoretically grounded and flexible pre-processing framework. Despite some limitations in accuracy and scope, the work is well-motivated, rigorously analyzed, and experimentally validated. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the interpretability and practical usability of the proposed method.
