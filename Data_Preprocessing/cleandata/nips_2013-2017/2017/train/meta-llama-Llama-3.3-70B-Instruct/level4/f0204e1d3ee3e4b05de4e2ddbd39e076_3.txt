This paper examines sequential hypothesis testing scenarios where hypotheses are evaluated individually rather than collectively, with the goal of regulating the false discovery rate (FDR) or modified false discovery rate (mFDR) while maintaining a high best arm discovery rate (BDR). 
The authors propose an algorithm that integrates pure-exploration multi-armed bandit (MAB) techniques with online FDR control methods, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to achieve a balance between FDR control and BDR maximization. The key innovation lies in the effective combination of these components to ensure simultaneous control of FDR and optimization of BDR.
The paper is well-structured and clearly conveys its ideas, making it easily accessible to readers. The technical contributions are noteworthy and align with the interests of the NIPS community, rendering the work a valuable addition to the field.
