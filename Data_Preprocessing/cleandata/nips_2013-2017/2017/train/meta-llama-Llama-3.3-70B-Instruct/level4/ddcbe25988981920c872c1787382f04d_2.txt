Paper summary:
The authors present a novel algorithm for efficiently estimating the mismatch string kernel, demonstrating its empirical accuracy and providing theoretical guarantees. The results show that utilizing this kernel estimate does not compromise the accuracy of the SVM, and the authors establish an upper bound on the algorithm's runtime. Empirical evaluations support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Strengths and weaknesses:
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with proofs and technical sections being relatively easy to follow due to consistent notation. The use of diverse datasets from different domains is commendable, and the authors' decision to make their source code available is appreciated. However, the work relies heavily on the assumption that increasing the number of mismatches in the kernel will enhance classification accuracy, which could be more thoroughly justified. 
In Figure 1, it is observed that the running time benefits of the proposed approach decrease as sequence lengths increase. The authors should provide insight into this phenomenon. 
Clarity & Quality:
The values of epsilon, delta, and B used in the Evaluation section are not specified, and additional experiments investigating the impact of these parameters would be beneficial. It is unclear why all five datasets are not included in Tables 2, 3, and 4; considering the potential space constraints, the complete results could be provided as supplementary material.
Significance & Originality:
Although the paper addresses a specific question that may appeal to a niche audience within NIPS, it is of high quality and successfully improves the computational efficiency of the mismatch kernel. Given that the authors plan to make their source code available post-publication, this work has the potential to significantly impact its field.
