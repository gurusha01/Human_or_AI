This manuscript presents a novel greedy coordinate descent algorithm, which employs a unique Gauss-Southwell coordinate selection rule. This rule utilizes a convex minimization problem involving the squared l_1-norm to determine the coordinates to be updated, making it a practically-minded and intriguing approach. The authors have also introduced an acceleration strategy, resulting in the development of the ASGCD algorithm (Accelerated Stochastic Greedy Coordinate Descent). 
The proposed greedy coordinate selection scheme is timely, given its current popularity, and is likely to garner significant interest from the research community. Nevertheless, the manuscript requires thorough proofreading to rectify numerous typos and improve the overall standard of English. Furthermore, while the numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, the tested problems are relatively small in scale. It would be beneficial for the authors to evaluate the algorithm's performance on larger-scale problems to provide a more comprehensive assessment of its capabilities.
