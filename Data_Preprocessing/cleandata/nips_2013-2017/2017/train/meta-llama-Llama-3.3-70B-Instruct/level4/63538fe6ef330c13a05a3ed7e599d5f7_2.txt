This manuscript explores optimization problems defined over a convex cone, represented as the conic hull of a potentially infinite set of atoms. The authors derive convergence results for their proposed algorithms, which are applicable to a broad range of atom sets and objective functions. Overall, the manuscript is well-structured and effectively communicates its contributions, as well as its relationship to existing research.
1. The topic addressed in this paper - parameterizing optimization problems over the conic hull of a possibly infinite atom set - is noteworthy, as it occupies a unique position between matching pursuit over the linear span of a finite atom set and Frank-Wolfe optimization over the convex hull of a set of atoms. This enables the development of algorithms with supporting optimization theory for general objective functions and atom sets.
2. This research fills a significant gap by providing optimization convergence rates for greedy algorithms in matching pursuit and Frank-Wolfe methods. Previously, a major challenge was that the atom set might not contain an atom aligned with a descent direction for all possible suboptimal iterates, and this work sheds new light on understanding these optimization problems.
3. The authors also propose away-step, pairwise, and fully corrective Matching Pursuit variants, accompanied by theoretical guarantees that enhance the completeness of their approach.
