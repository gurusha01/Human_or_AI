This paper aims to develop an iterative method for updating a solution that converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimum. The authors commence with the KKT solution (line 141) and derive an iterative recurrence relation by decomposing the quadratic term into a product of consecutive terms, x(t) and x(t+1).
They then introduce an auxiliary lower-bound function, dependent on two variables - the current and previous solutions, to approximate the Lagrangian. The solution to this auxiliary function yields the update rule, with the lower bound being a concave function that incorporates an additional variable, representing the previous solution, to facilitate the recurrence relation between successive solutions.
Notably, the authors design this construction to converge to a sparse solution, although this aspect is only empirically validated. Further analysis is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the sparsity of the solution. Specifically, it would be beneficial to investigate whether alternative update rules yield non-sparse results and to identify the distinct features of the proposed update rule that lead to sparsity.
