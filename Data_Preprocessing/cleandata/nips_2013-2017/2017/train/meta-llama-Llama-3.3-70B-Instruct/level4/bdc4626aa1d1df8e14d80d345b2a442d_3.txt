This manuscript introduces a modified linear UCB approach tailored to the contextual linear bandit problem, characterized by its "conservative" nature, wherein it ensures performance surpasses a predetermined percentage of a specified baseline method. The authors demonstrate the validity of their conservative approach by deriving fundamental regret bounds. Although the underlying concept is intuitive and the proofs lack surprise, with techniques that do not significantly deviate from existing innovations, the problem's formulation and the proposed methodology exhibit practicality. Consequently, the findings of this paper are likely to have a positive impact on real-world applications.
