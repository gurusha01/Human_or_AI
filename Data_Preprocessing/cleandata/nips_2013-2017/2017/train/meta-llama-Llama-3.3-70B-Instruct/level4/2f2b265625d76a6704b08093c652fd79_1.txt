This manuscript explores the extension of the f-GAN principle to f-divergences, establishing a generalized connection between KL divergence and regular exponential families through the chi-logarithm. The authors derive the variational information geometric f-GAN (vig-f-GAN) identity, offering a novel interpretation of the f-GAN objective function. Additionally, they provide a sufficient condition for activation functions that yield factored generative distributions.
The primary theoretical contribution, the vig-f-GAN identity, is noteworthy and exhibits promising applicability. However, the presentation of the main theorems in highly general forms renders their interpretation challenging.
In Section 6, the experimental observations lack clear connections to the theoretical findings, making it difficult to comprehend their relevance.
