I appreciated the opportunity to review this submission, which presents a novel hierarchical probabilistic model leveraging implicit distributions. The authors also introduce a variational method based on GAN-related density ratio estimation techniques for posterior inference, and demonstrate its application across various tasks, including ABC, supervised learning, and generative modeling.
While I find the concept intriguing, there are several aspects that require further clarification to enhance the manuscript's clarity and impact.
1. The relationship between the proposed method and existing approaches, such as AVB [36] and ALI [13], should be explicitly discussed, as the connections may not be immediately apparent to all readers.
2. Building on the AVB paper, which highlights the importance of adaptive contrast for improving density ratio estimations in high-dimensional settings, it would be beneficial to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed method's stability in such scenarios. The current evaluation, limited to a 2D linear regression toy case, mirrors the findings in the AVB paper, where naive density ratio estimation performs well in low-dimensional cases. An examination of the high-dimensional case, such as the BNN example, would strengthen the manuscript.
3. The choice of hinge loss and the derivation of the optimal r as the log ratio warrant a more detailed explanation to facilitate understanding.
4. Regarding the generation of discrete data, using r(x, w) instead of r(x) enables gradient computation but necessitates inputting w into the discriminator network, potentially leading to high-dimensional inputs. The scalability of this approach, particularly when using deep and wide neural networks to generate realistic data, should be addressed.
5. I am concerned about the lack of quantitative results for the sequence generation component, relying solely on generative samples for evaluation. This approach may not provide a comprehensive assessment of the method's performance, and I believe it would be beneficial to include more rigorous quantitative evaluations.
In conclusion, I consider this paper to be borderline, and I would welcome clarifications from the authors regarding the points I have raised, as they may have addressed these concerns in ways that are not immediately apparent to me.
