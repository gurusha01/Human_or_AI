This paper presents a novel covariance structure for multi-output Gaussian processes, extending the spectral approach (Bochner Theorem) to construct kernels, as inspired by the work of A. G. Adams and R. P. Adams. A key advantage of the proposed methodology is the interpretability of its parameters, including delay between outputs and phase difference.
Defining covariance structures for multi-output Gaussian processes is a complex task, with limited existing methods. The authors' approach is theoretically well-founded, and its efficacy is successfully demonstrated across multiple datasets.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with relevant illustration choices. Assuming parameter learning is not overly problematic (as the paper provides limited information on this aspect), this method has the potential to become a standard for multi-output Gaussian processes.
Several questions arise:
* How does the method perform with limited training data?
* (Out of curiosity) Given that a channel with a large length-scale cannot be highly correlated with one having a small length-scale, how is this reflected in the proposed model?
Some comments are worth noting:
* In the synthetic example (Section 4.1), it would be beneficial to specify the number of training points used.
Minor observations include potential missing words in lines 74 and 140.
