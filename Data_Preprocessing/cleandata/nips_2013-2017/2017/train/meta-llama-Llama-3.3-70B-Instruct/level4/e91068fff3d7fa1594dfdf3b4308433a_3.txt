The authors examine the reparameterization trick's functional form for computing the ELBO's gradient, identifying two terms: the path derivative, which depends on the gradient with respect to the sample z, and the score function, which does not. Although the score function has zero expectation, its value may not be zero for specific samples of z. The authors suggest removing the score function term from the gradient, demonstrating that this can be achieved through a simple modification in popular automatic differentiation software. They argue that this approach can reduce variance, particularly as the variational posterior approaches the true posterior, causing the stochastic gradient's variance to approach zero. This concept is also extended to more complex models.
However, this trick, although useful and easily implemented in automatic differentiation software, may not constitute a sufficiently novel contribution. The properties of the score function are well-established, and modifying or eliminating it seems like a straightforward experiment. 
The explanation of control variates in lines 124-146 is unclear and appears to be contradictory. It seems that setting the control variate scale c = 1 is equivalent to including the score function term, corresponding to the standard ELBO gradient. In contrast, the proposed method involves not using a control variate, effectively setting c = 0. Nevertheless, lines 140-146 suggest that better experimental results were obtained with c = 1, which corresponds to the ordinary ELBO gradient, compared to c = 0, which excludes the score function term. This finding contradicts the reported experimental results, and despite multiple readings, the section remains difficult to interpret.
The experimental results demonstrate only minor improvements, although they come at essentially no cost.
