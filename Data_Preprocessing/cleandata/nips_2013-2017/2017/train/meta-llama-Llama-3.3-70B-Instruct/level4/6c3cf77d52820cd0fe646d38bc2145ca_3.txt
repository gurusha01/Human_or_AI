This paper proposes a notable method for deanonymizing the Bitcoin network, presented in a clear and organized fashion, accompanied by a sufficient number of figures that effectively illustrate the approach and experimental results. The probabilistic analysis, in particular, is a highlight, offering intriguing insights and ideas. Upon review, no major issues were identified, leading to a recommendation for acceptance. However, despite the paper's overall quality, there is some uncertainty regarding its alignment with the focus and potential impact on the NIPS community, given the conference's specific scope and audience.
