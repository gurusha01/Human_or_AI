This manuscript concentrates on the subject of safe adaptive importance sampling, a currently prominent area of research within the field. Notable aspects of this contribution include its generality, facilitating integration with a wide range of existing algorithms, as well as the provision of both theoretical foundations and empirical evidence to substantiate the proposed approach.
However, an aspect that warrants improvement is the visual presentation in Section 5, where the figures are presently too small to be discerned clearly. Enhancing the size of these figures and enlarging their corresponding labels would significantly improve readability, thereby facilitating a more effective comprehension of the results for the reader.
