This manuscript presents an extension of the work by Fruit & Lazaric (2017) on the exploration-exploitation dilemma with temporal abstraction in the context of options. Notably, it relaxes the prior assumptions regarding the structure of the given option set, eliminating the need for primitive options or bounds on sojourn time and cumulative return distributions.
The proposed analysis introduces a novel perspective by leveraging the Markov Decision Process (MDP) structure within options, rather than solely relying on the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) level. This approach aligns with the original options framework, which advocated for a structure that can interleave various time scales, including both MDP and SMDP.
The authors' method is based on the observation that each option's internal structure can be represented as an MDP with a random horizon defined by the termination function. They demonstrate how an optimistic policy can be expressed in terms of the internal stationary distributions induced by each option. Consequently, confidence bounds are established over these stationary distributions, differing from the approach in Fruit & Lazaric (2017), which focused on cumulative returns and sojourn times.
The theoretical guarantees provided in this setting capture interesting empirical observations, such as the challenges in learning long options and the facilitation of learning in options with sparse transition model support. Despite the technical complexity, the paper remains accessible, with the main results on regret being comprehensible to readers from diverse backgrounds.
However, several questions and suggestions arise:
- The paper exclusively adopts the average reward criterion. It would be beneficial to explore whether the analysis could be extended to accommodate the discounted setting, which is more commonly used in practice.
- The appendix provides motivation for the assumption on initiation sets (one state per option) but does not address the compositionality assumption. Clarification on how compositionality can be satisfied in general would be appreciated.
- The statement on Line 251 regarding a "somewhat worst-case w.r.t. to the correlation" is unclear. The issue of correlation between options is intriguing and warrants further development in the text to enhance understanding and implications.
