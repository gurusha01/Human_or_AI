This paper presents a novel approach to point process intensity or hazard estimation using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN). It highlights the benefits of exploring objective functions beyond maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and introduces a computationally efficient distance measure. The methodology employs a regularized dual formulation for optimization and utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for both generator and discriminator functions. However, the description of methods and data used in the real-world analyses is somewhat lacking and could be elaborated upon to enhance reproducibility.
The experimental results show that the proposed WGANTPP method performs satisfactorily across various tasks, using both simulated and real data. Nevertheless, the baseline models used for comparison seem overly simplistic. For instance, the kernel mixture process is limited to 3 components, resulting in visibly inadequate representations, and the self-exciting and self-correcting processes rely on fixed baselines, disregarding the extensive literature on semi-parametric hazard functions. Incorporating more flexible and comparable models, such as those presented in Goulding (ICDM 2016), Weiss (ECML 2013), and Jing (WSDM 2017), would strengthen the comparative analysis.
The defined distance measure may not effectively handle noise stemming from extraneous events, particularly due to the alignment of the ith element with the ith element of each sequence. A distance metric based on local alignment might offer greater robustness than the proposed one. It would be beneficial to clarify the specific applications where this distance measure is expected to outperform log likelihood.
In Equation 3, it appears that the second summation should be revised to \sum{j=i+1}^m yj. Additionally, in Section 3.1, which discusses inhomogeneous processes, it seems that the settings for \alpha and c might be inadvertently switched. Lastly, there are minor spelling errors, such as "demosntrate", that should be corrected to ensure the manuscript's overall quality.
