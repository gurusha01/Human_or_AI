The paper presents two algorithms for identifying and correcting errors in electron microscopy image segments used for neural circuit reconstruction, combining them heuristically to update an initial segmentation greedily.
* Contribution
The approach utilizes two deep networks: the detector, which assesses whether a segment overlapping a region of interest (ROI) central pixel requires correction, and the corrector, which estimates the correct segment shape overlapping the central pixel. 
However, considering only the corrector's output and a segmentation metric like the VI for every pixel, a consensus problem for the entire volume emerges, which is not explored in this paper. Instead, a greedy algorithm, described informally in Section 5 and based on superpixel segmentation, is employed to incrementally update the initial segmentation.
While the empirical results may be relevant to the connectomics community, the applicability of this greedy algorithm beyond connectomics is questionable. 
Therefore, I conclude that this paper lacks sufficient broader interest for the NIPS audience.
* Presentation
The paper is well-structured and written, except for technical sections 3, 4, and particularly 5, which are informal and lack detailed explanations of the algorithms. 
The introduction and related work discussion should downplay the relation between hard-to-solve problems and easily verifiable solutions, as this concept is familiar to computer scientists through the NP complexity class. The claim that the error detection task is better posed than the supervoxel agglomeration task is also disputed.
* Related work
The proposed method's connection to GANs and visual attention is speculative and unsupported by technical arguments, making the references to [8,9] and [10] unfounded. Such connections, if intended to be explored, should be mentioned only in a concluding outlook section.
