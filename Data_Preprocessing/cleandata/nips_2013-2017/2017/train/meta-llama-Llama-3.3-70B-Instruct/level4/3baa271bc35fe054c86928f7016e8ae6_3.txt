This manuscript investigates the problem of maximizing submodular functions in a robust and streaming context, where the objective is to identify a subset of k high-value elements from a limited set retained during the stream, with up to m elements potentially being removed thereafter. The study of streaming submodular maximization has garnered significant attention due to its relevance to large-scale applications, where only a few passes over the data are feasible. Moreover, the concept of robustness has recently gained traction, driven by scenarios in which certain elements may be removed, and the goal is to derive solutions that can withstand such removals. This work is the first to concurrently address the challenges of streaming and robust submodular maximization.
The authors propose the STAR-T algorithm, which retains O((m log k + k) log^2 k) elements after the stream and achieves a constant approximation guarantee of 0.149, while demonstrating robustness to the removal of m elements. This algorithm leverages a combination of partitioning and thresholding techniques, utilizing buckets to optimize submodular functions. Although similar bucket-based approaches have been employed in prior work on robust submodular optimization, the bucket-filling process is distinct in this context. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in influence maximization and movie recommendation applications, even when compared to streaming algorithms with prior knowledge of element removals.
The integration of both streaming and robustness aspects renders the problem setting particularly challenging, and the attainment of a constant-factor approximation is a notable achievement. Nevertheless, several aspects of the paper could be enhanced. The inclusion of non-trivial lower bounds to complement the upper bound would be beneficial. Furthermore, the analysis could be presented more clearly, as the authors mention an "innovative analysis" without elaborating on its innovative aspects, making it difficult to discern the primary ideas and steps from the proof sketch. Additionally, the application to influence maximization could be more convincing, as the experiments employ a simplified objective that only considers the size of the neighborhood of seed nodes, without clarifying how traditional influence maximization objectives, which depend on the entire network for any set of seed nodes, could be accommodated in a streaming setting.
