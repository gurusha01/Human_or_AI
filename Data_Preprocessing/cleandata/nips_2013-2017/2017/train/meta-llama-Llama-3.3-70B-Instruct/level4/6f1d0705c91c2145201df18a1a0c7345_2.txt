This paper introduces a novel class of probability models, referred to as hierarchical implicit models, which comprise observations accompanied by 'local' latent variables that are conditionally independent given a set of 'global' latent variables. Notably, the observation likelihood is not assumed to be tractable in these models. The authors propose an approach for KL-based variational inference in such 'likelihood-free' models, leveraging a GAN-style discriminator to estimate the log ratio between a 'variational joint' distribution, constructed using the empirical distribution on observations, and the true model joint density. This approach also supports implicit variational models, or 'variational programs'. The paper demonstrates proof-of-concept applications in ecological simulation, Bayesian GANs, and sequence modeling using a stochastic RNN.
The presentation of the paper is exceptionally clear, well-cited, and provides a meticulous explanation of the technical machinery. Although the concept of applying density ratio estimation to variational inference appears to be a prevalent idea, this synthesis is more coherent, easier to follow, and more general than similar papers, particularly in its support for implicit models.
The definition of hierarchical implicit models serves as a valuable theoretical framework, laying the groundwork for the inference setup in section 3. However, the factorization assumption, which posits iid observations, is somewhat restrictive and may not encompass models like the Lotka-Volterra or stochastic RNN, as they exhibit temporal dependence. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the potential for the inference approach to be adapted to more complex models and observations, such as those with temporal, textual, or graphical structures.
The experimental section is arguably the weakest aspect of the paper. The 'Bayesian GAN' example is somewhat simplistic, and the classification setup is artificial, as supervised learning is not the primary application of GANs. The symbol generation RNN is not compared to other methods, and its effectiveness is unclear. In contrast, the Lotka-Volterra simulation is more compelling, as it motivates the concept of implicit models and demonstrates a clear improvement over the state-of-the-art ABC method.
While the paper does not present groundbreaking results, and the approach may be challenging to implement in practice, its potential to enable effective Bayesian inference for new classes of models is significant. The formulation presented in this paper is likely to be useful for many researchers as they further develop this area. For this reason, the paper is considered a valuable contribution.
Additional comments and questions include:
* In the Lotka-Volterra model, the equations provided seem to be incorrect, as the Beta3 term should be added, not subtracted, to model the predator birth rate. Furthermore, the use of Beta2 as both the predator and prey death rate appears inconsistent with most sources.
* The paper mentions two classes of implicit models, but only one, HIMs, is described.
* The term "log empirical log q(x_n)" is redundant and could be simplified.
* When using an implicit model with an explicit variational approximation, it would be beneficial to explore ways to leverage the explicit variational density for faster inference.
* The subtraction of the constant log q(x) from the ELBO means that the ratio objective no longer provides a lower bound on the true model evidence. This should be noted, and the quantity (4) could be interpreted as a estimate of the negative KL divergence between the model and empirical distribution, potentially useful for model criticism.
