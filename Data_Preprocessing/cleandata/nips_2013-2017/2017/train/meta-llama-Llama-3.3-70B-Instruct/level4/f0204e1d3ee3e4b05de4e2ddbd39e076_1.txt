This paper explores the concept of continuous improvement through a series of A/B tests and proposes an alternative approach using adaptive testing, such as the multi-armed bandit problem, while maintaining control over the false discovery rate. This problem, although extensively discussed in statistical literature, remains unresolved. 
The proposed approach in this paper appears to address the existing issues effectively. Despite some minor concerns outlined below, this paper is highly interesting and has the potential to pave the way for new research avenues.
In lines 24-37, well-documented issues are presented, and the addition of citations would be beneficial. While the authors primarily focus on the CS/ML literature, a notable body of work in biometrics, including the survey by Villar, Bowden, and Wason (Statistical Science 2015) and subsequent papers that cite this survey, is also relevant.
On line 37, the phrase "testing multiple literature" should be corrected to "multiple testing literature." 
Lines 38-47 introduce a concept similar to "platform trials" in biometrics; the authors should elaborate on how their concept differs from this existing idea.
Minor corrections are needed: on line 112, "and and" should be replaced with "and"; on line 115, a reference and description for LUCB should be provided; on line 153, "samplesas" should be corrected to "samples as"; and on line 260, the phrase "are ran" requires clarification.
The introduction of "truncation time" on line 273 is unclear, and its significant impact on the results in Figure 2 warrants further explanation.
The motivation discussed in lines 288-291, although interesting, seems out of place in the paper. It would be more appropriate to include this motivation in the introduction, alongside the discussions on website management and clinical trials.
