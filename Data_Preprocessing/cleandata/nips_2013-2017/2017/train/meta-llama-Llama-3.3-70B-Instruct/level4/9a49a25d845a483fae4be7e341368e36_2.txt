This manuscript proposes a constrained optimization framework to mitigate discrimination in classification settings, which can arise from biased training data, algorithmic biases, or discriminatory output usage. The approach falls under the preprocessing category, aiming to reduce discriminatory aspects in the data by transforming it. The framework utilizes notation where D represents sensitive variables (e.g., race or sex), X represents other predictors, and Y represents the binary classification outcome. Two fairness definitions are employed: (I) minimizing the dependence of predicted outcomes on D, and (II) ensuring similar individuals receive similar predicted outcomes. These criteria form the constraints of the optimization problem, which seeks to minimize the probability distance between the transformed and original data distributions.
The paper provides conditions for the optimization problem to be quasi-convex and proves a result bounding errors due to prior distribution misspecification. Empirical demonstrations on two datasets show the method's competitiveness with the existing approach by Zemel et al. (2013). However, a significant limitation is the assumption of a known joint data distribution. While Proposition 2 attempts to address this, it does not fully account for the impact of prior distribution misspecification on individual fairness (IF). Furthermore, the definition of fairness and similarity between individuals with different D values raises subtle questions, such as the potential presence of confounding variables.
Another limitation is the extensive calibration required, with multiple tolerances for each constraint, which may lead to infeasible optimization problems. The choice of distortion metric is also a subtle issue, relying on implicit fairness goals and potentially high-dimensional calibration. Customization using domain expertise is both a strength and a limitation, raising questions about sensible default choices or guidelines.
The paper's quality is supported by theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, although the need for case-by-case tuning and implementation specifics is both a strength and a weakness. Clarity is generally good, but acknowledging the existence of competing fairness definitions and potential contradictions would improve the exposition. Originality is demonstrated through comparisons with related work, although more systematic tuning comparisons would strengthen the paper. The significance of the work lies in its addressing of a crucial problem, with the potential for impact due to the popularity of IF and the modularity of the preprocessing approach.
