This paper presents a novel hyperspherical convolution framework, leveraging angular representations to distinguish itself from traditional CNNs, with SphereConv serving as its fundamental convolution operator. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, yet several issues warrant further consideration. 
Firstly, regarding the Sigmoid SphereConv, the selection of the value of k is unclear - are there any guidelines or recommendations for this parameter? Secondly, the choice of SphereConv operator is not well-defined; must each operator be empirically evaluated to optimize performance? Additionally, a comparison of the computational complexity between the proposed convolution and the original convolution is needed. Notably, the reported improvements achieved by the proposed convolution appear modest, suggesting room for further enhancement.
