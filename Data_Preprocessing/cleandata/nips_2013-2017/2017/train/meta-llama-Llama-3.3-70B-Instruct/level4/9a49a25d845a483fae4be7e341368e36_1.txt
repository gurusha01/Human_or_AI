This paper proposes a novel framework for converting datasets to satisfy both group and individual fairness, formulated as a convex optimization problem under specific conditions. The authors establish generalization error bounds in terms of utility and group fairness and demonstrate the framework's performance through experiments.
However, the introduction fails to clearly articulate the paper's contributions, which should be explicitly stated for better understanding.
From a theoretical perspective, the convexity established in Proposition 1 is somewhat intuitive. A more in-depth discussion on the implications of convexity on the tradeoff between utility, group fairness, and individual fairness would be beneficial.
Proposition 2 is misleading, as it overlooks the crucial term $m$ by employing the big-O notation. The correct bounds should be $O(\sqrt{m \log(1 + n/m)/n + \log(1/\beta)/n})$. The first term within the square root represents the complexity term, given that $m$ denotes the parameter size of the learning transformation. For instance, if the non-discrimination variable forms a $d$-dimensional binary vector, then $m \ge 2^d$, resulting in an exponential requirement for samples with respect to $d$ to achieve a constant order bound. In terms of sample complexity, the current framework lacks learnability.
The empirical comparison between the proposed method and LFR is unfair, as LFR has tunable parameters for adjusting the tradeoff between utility, group fairness, and individual fairness. These parameters should be appropriately tuned, and experiments should be conducted with finer variations of $\epsilon$. The presented experiments do not support the claim that the proposed framework can control the tradeoff between utility and fairness. Furthermore, the authors should compare their method with LFR in terms of individual fairness, as there is currently no evidence that the proposed method ensures individual fairness.
Therefore, the significance of the contribution appears weak in both theoretical and experimental aspects in its current form.
Following the rebuttal discussion, my assessment of the paper has become more positive, leading to an increased score.
