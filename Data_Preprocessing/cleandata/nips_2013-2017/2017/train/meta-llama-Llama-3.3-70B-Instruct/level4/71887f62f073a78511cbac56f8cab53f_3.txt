This paper presents a notable extension of the coordinate descent method, broadening its applicability to a wider range of problems by integrating multiple existing techniques. While the work is sound and well-executed, it lacks significant novelty, as the proofs can be adapted from preceding papers and the convergence rate is as anticipated. However, several issues were identified that require the authors' attention:
1. (Major) Assumption 1(c) stipulates that $h^$ should have a bounded domain, but this condition is not met in equation (9). Specifically, when $h$ is an indicator function of a singleton set $\{c\}$, $h^(u) = u^Tc$, whose domain is $\mathbb{R}^n$. Consequently, all results in Section 3.4, including Theorem 3.5, are unjustifiable. It is questionable whether there is an error in the proof of Theorem 3.5, particularly regarding the finiteness of $Dh^$ when the domain is unbounded, and how the right-hand side of equation (12) can depend on $Dh^$ if it is unbounded.
2. (Minor) The notation in Theorem 3.5 is inconsistent, using both $y^*$ and $y^\star$. Furthermore, their definitions are not provided, although they can be inferred to represent dual optimal solutions. It would be beneficial to standardize the notation and include explicit definitions for clarity.
3. (Minor) A reference is missing, denoted as [?], in line 165, which should be properly cited to maintain the integrity of the paper.
