This paper proposes a cognitive model designed to predict the timing of specific questions within certain contexts, namely belief states. The model calculates the unnormalized log probability of a question as a weighted sum of several factors, including informativeness, complexity, answer type, and relevance to the belief state. An application of this model to the Battleship domain, where the goal is to locate ships within a grid, demonstrates that the full model outperforms its lesioned versions in predicting human data, based on log-likelihood. However, when considering correlation with human judgments, the model that excludes expected information gain (EIG) performs similarly to the full model.
From a technical standpoint, the paper appears to be sound. Nonetheless, its contribution seems more significant in the realm of AI than cognitive science. While the paper claims to provide insights into how individuals balance informativeness and complexity, the results are not conclusive. The influence of EIG on human question-asking behavior in the Battleship domain is inconsistent, suggesting either a minor or negligible impact, which does not substantially advance our understanding of human decision-making in this context.
The paper's clarity and writing style are commendable, and the results seem reproducible. However, it lacks reference to pertinent prior work, such as Hawkins' 2015 concept of modeling questions as programs and the notion of a question-under-discussion introduced by Roberts in 1996. These predecessors also explored the trade-off between expected information gain and question complexity, albeit in simpler domains.
The approach outlined in this paper, which involves a compositional prior over questions and selection based on expected information gain and other factors, holds promise for future applications in both cognitive and AI models. The primary contribution of this work lies in its successful generation of compositional questions for a non-trivial domain, demonstrating the potential of this methodology.
