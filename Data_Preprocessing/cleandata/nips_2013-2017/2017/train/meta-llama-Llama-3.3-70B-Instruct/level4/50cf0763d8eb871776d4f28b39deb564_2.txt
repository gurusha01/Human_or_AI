This paper introduces a concept of local "separability" for a loss function, which is utilized to derive L-infinity convergence rates in terms of separability parameters for both low and high dimensional settings. The authors then apply these rates to a probabilistic classification problem using both generative and discriminative approaches. By computing the separability parameters for each approach, they establish L-infinity convergence rates for logistic regression, as well as for two generative approaches - isotropic Gaussian and Gaussian graphical models. The paper also explores L2 convergence rates, demonstrating that while the naive generative algorithm exhibits poor scaling with dimensionality, the incorporation of a soft-thresholding operator yields support consistency and improved rates. Furthermore, the authors investigate the impact of sparsity on sample complexity for both discriminative and thresholded generative approaches, with results indicating that the logistic rate is outperformed by the generative approach, particularly in cases of low sparsity.
The work presented appears to be impressive, but several clarifications and notes are warranted:
- The terminology used in the paper temporarily shifts from "empirical loss function" to "empirical risk function" on line 127 of page 4.
- The comment on lines 181-182 of page 5, regarding Theorems 1 and 2 providing an estimate of the required sample size for convergence, is unclear. Specifically, it is stated that small values of gamma or beta would necessitate a large number of samples. However, are beta and gamma not dependent on the sample size, L_n? Is the discussion intended to focus on the behavior of beta and gamma as a function of the sample size, n?
- A similar confusion arises in several instances, such as lines 194 and 195 on page 6, and Corollary 3, where inequalities are presented with dependence on n on both sides. While the goal is to establish convergence rates in terms of n, it is unclear how the behavior of the separability parameters with respect to n is accounted for.
- The paper claims that Theorems 1 and 2 yield L-infinity convergence rates, but the derivation of these rates is not immediately apparent. Does the determination of these rates require knowledge of how the separability parameters change with n?
- The comparison between the discriminative and generative approaches in Corollaries 3 and 4 is noteworthy. Specifically, it is stated that for the isotropic Gaussian case, both approaches achieve the same convergence rate, but the generative approach exhibits only a logarithmic dependence on the dimension. How does the logistic approach differ in this regard? Additionally, Corollary 4 includes the condition n >> log p - is this correct? Furthermore, Corollary 3 employs the notation \succsim, which is unfamiliar and may require a footnote definition for clarity.
