This manuscript presents a significant theoretical advancement by extending Nesterov's method to address geodesically convex problems on Riemannian manifolds, demonstrating the feasibility of such an extension. Notably, the derivation of key quantities for the Karcher mean problem is a particularly intriguing aspect of the work, underscoring the importance of this contribution to the field.
