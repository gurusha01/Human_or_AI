This paper introduces two variants of the SMDP-UCRL algorithm, namely FSUCRLv1 and FSUCRLv2, and examines their regret behavior. A key distinction between these variants and the original SUCRL is that the latter relies on prior knowledge of specific parameters related to option behavior, whereas the proposed methods estimate these parameters directly from the data. The primary difference between FSUCRLv1 and FSUCRLv2 lies in their approach to parameter estimation, with one variant explicitly estimating parameters and their confidence intervals, and the other employing a nested procedure to implicitly derive these parameters. The resulting regret bounds closely resemble those of SUCRL, albeit with an additional cost incurred by parameter estimation. Empirical validation of the methods is also provided.
The paper is generally well-written, although its density in certain sections is understandable given the technical nature of the contribution. A pivotal insight underlying the work is the utilization of irreducible Markov chain representations for options. While Theorem 1 constitutes the primary contribution, it would be beneficial to include an intuitive explanation of its proof within the main body of the paper, rather than relegating it to the appendix, to enhance the reader's understanding of the core results.
