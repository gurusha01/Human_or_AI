This manuscript introduces a novel multi-output Gaussian process covariance function defined in the spectral domain, a crucial contribution to the field of Gaussian processes that has been overlooked. The authors build upon existing work, specifically [1], and extend it to the multi-output scenario, addressing the challenge of describing cross-covariance without requiring positive-definiteness. The proposed approach leads to the development of a spectral mixture covariance for multi-output Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-structured, providing a concise and clear introduction to the problem and Gaussian process fundamentals. The explanation of the spectral mixture kernel is thorough, and the proposed extensions are, to the best of my knowledge, original. The authors effectively contextualize their work within the existing literature, demonstrating sufficient novelty to warrant publication.
The experimental evaluation, while not providing extensive intuitive insights, particularly with the Jura dataset, is deemed sufficient for a paper of this nature. The inclusion of empirical results supports the validity of the proposed approach, and I believe the experimental assessment is adequate for a manuscript focused on theoretical contributions. Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in Gaussian process research, and its publication is justified.
