Overview: This paper proposes a novel approach to render nonparametric methods robust to noise from positive definite distributions by leveraging estimated characteristic functions, focusing solely on the phase while disregarding magnitude. The authors apply this technique to two-sample testing and nonparametric regression on measures, where each "sample" comprises a collection of samples. Through experiments on synthetic, real, and semi-synthetic datasets, the authors demonstrate the expected behavior of their technique and achieve reasonable performance in the new two-sample tests and feature introduction.
Theory: Although the core concept of disregarding the magnitude of a characteristic function is not groundbreaking, it is elegant, interesting, and likely to be useful, making it worthy of publication. The authors maintain a clear exposition despite the technical underlying concept. They explain the concept using population versions of estimators and provide reasonable finite sample estimators. However, including a consistency-type result would enhance the paper's completeness.
Experiments: The synthetic experiment clearly demonstrates the expected behavior of the new features in a two-sample test. However, it is disappointing to note that the technique significantly reduces test power compared to current nonparametric techniques, particularly in the regime of 2000 samples or more. While the technique is ineffective for the Higgs Boson two-sample test, its ineffectiveness is intriguing, suggesting the difference between the two classes may be attributed to some sort of PSD noise phenomenon. In the last two experiments, the proposed technique performs well on the semi-synthetic dataset but not notably better on the final real-world data experiment. Ultimately, the proposed technique does not demonstrate decidedly superior testing or regression performance on any real-world dataset, although it slightly outperforms in certain sample regimes.
Exposition: The paper is well-written, but there are some errors and issues that need to be addressed, which will be listed at the end of this review.
Final Evaluation: Overall, the idea presented is interesting enough to warrant publication. 
--Corrections By Line--
3: "rarely" should be corrected to "rare".
14: "recently" should be rephrased to "which have recently been" for better clarity.
53: For mathematical precision, it would be beneficial to restate that E is a PSD random variable.
115: The addition of "the" after "However" is necessary.
116: It is assumed that "characteristic function" was intended to be included after "supported everywhere".
119: Further justification or explanation is needed for why these "cases appear contrived".
123: Although the notation PX and PY has not been introduced, it might be obvious enough. However, it is crucial to note that K is a function on a pair of probability measures, whereas on line 88, K is a function of two collections of data.
134: Justification is required to confirm that this is indeed an unbiased estimator, as many obvious estimators in the MMD and related techniques literature are not unbiased.
208: The expression \chi^2(4)/4 is not technically correct; it is the sample that is divided by 4, not the measure.
268: As the dataset is unfamiliar, it would be helpful to mention the space in which the labels lie, assumed to be R.
Update: After reviewing the other assessments and the rebuttal, the evaluation has been revised upward by a point, suggesting that the initial assessment may have been overly critical.
