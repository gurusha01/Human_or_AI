This manuscript proposes an innovative approach by introducing a novel operator as a substitute for the conventional convolutional filter operation, which typically involves matrix inner product computations. The authors' method involves calculating the angular similarity between filter weights and pixel values (or activation values in intermediate layers) within a hypersphere space, rather than assessing their similarity through inner product. Furthermore, they define three distinct operator functions based on this angle: linear, cosine, and sigmoid. To accommodate this new operation, the authors also reformulate the regularization term and loss function. The ablation study demonstrates the efficacy of each introduced component, yielding improved performance on image classification tasks using CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets, as well as image feature embedding tasks. Notably, the results exhibit enhanced accuracy, facilitated convergence, and accelerated training.
The paper exhibits theoretical rigor, a clear organizational structure, well-designed experiments, and refined writing and presentation. 
However, a limitation of the study is the lack of experimentation on more extensive and realistic image classification tasks, such as ImageNet, without providing any justification or indication of potential future research in this direction. Additionally, exploring the application of this approach to more diverse tasks, including small-scale reinforcement learning problems, could be a valuable avenue for further investigation.
