Review - General Impression:
In my opinion, the proposed methodology presents an intriguing approach, yielding notable results, with attention maps that suggest the improvements may be attributed to enhanced attention mechanisms rather than merely increased model capacity. However, the writing could be improved, as it sometimes appears weak and confusing, although I believe the authors could refine the submission with additional time.
Strengths:
- The model is innovative, achieving impressive results.
- The experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, are thorough and well-executed.
- I am particularly impressed by the transition between unary, pairwise, and final attention mechanisms. Although, I would have appreciated the inclusion of marginalized trinary attention maps, which I may have overlooked in the text or supplementary materials.
Weaknesses:
- As mentioned earlier, the writing and presentation occasionally appear disorganized.
- The novelty of the approach seems somewhat limited, as the added complexity, although outperforming the MCB for VQA model [7], largely builds upon the intuition of [7] at higher and lower orders. While not a significant issue, I recommend that the authors clarify their contributions to avoid potential oversight.
- The probabilistic connection is not formally established, and its current presentation seems more motivational than concrete. I suggest the authors either provide a more rigorous formulation or adjust the language to reflect its informal nature.
- Figure 2 is represented at an awkward level of abstraction, making it difficult to comprehend the network's functionality or grasp the overall approach. I propose simplifying this figure to emphasize the generation of unary, pairwise, and trinary potentials more clearly.
- Figure 3 is not referenced in the text, which I found puzzling.
Areas of Interest:
- I am curious about the learned values for the linear coefficients in equations (1) for combining marginalized potentials. It would be fascinating to explore whether different modalities leverage distinct potential orders.
- The underperformance of the 2-Modalities Unary+Pairwise model compared to MCB [7], despite their architectural similarities, raises interesting questions. Unfortunately, this result is not thoroughly discussed in the text, and I would appreciate any intuition the authors can provide regarding this observation, particularly its relation to the switch between MCB and MCT decision computation modules.
- The discussion on using sequential MCB versus a single MCT layer for the decision head is engaging, but lacks supporting results. I would appreciate it if the authors could share their findings or insights regarding this aspect.
