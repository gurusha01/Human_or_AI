This manuscript provides an in-depth examination of Monte Carlo Tree Search in depth-k game trees, significantly expanding upon previous work that was limited to depth-two trees, as seen in 'Optimal best arm identification with fixed confidence' (COLT 2016). The authors introduce a novel algorithmic approach that can be integrated with various Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms, with a detailed analysis provided for LUCB and UGapE.
The core concept hinges on two primary components: initially, a BAI algorithm guides the learner's first decision from the root of the tree, followed by the sampling of a 'representative leaf' via a greedy path that maximizes or minimizes expected value at each step. This innovative approach sheds new light on MCTS problems by leveraging tools from the Best Arm Identification framework.
The proposed method exhibits several notable strengths:
1. It offers an intuitive and accessible understanding for readers familiar with the BAI literature;
2. It demonstrates computational efficiency, facilitating convincing experimental evaluations;
3. It outperforms the existing FindTopWinner algorithm.
Furthermore, the authors establish a problem-dependent lower bound using established techniques from (Garivier and Kaufmann, 2016) and (Kaufmann et al., 2015). Although the final result of Lemma 7 is not fully explicit, numerical solutions to the optimization problem are possible, providing a basis for comparison in the experimental section and paving the way for potentially asymptotically optimal algorithms using the Track-And-Stop technique.
Minor suggestions for improvement include:
- Clarifying the role of Lemmas 13 and 14 in controlling the algorithm's behavior regarding the 'representative leaf' choice, potentially by elaborating on the proof of Theorem 3;
- Enhancing the clarity of the algorithm's action and information update process, as depicted in Figure 2;
- Correcting minor typographical errors, such as 'uniformLY at random' on line 255;
- Standardizing index notation in Lemma 11 of the Appendix.
In conclusion, this paper merits strong consideration for acceptance, as it pioneers a new direction in understanding MCTS problems and has the potential to drive significant future advancements.
