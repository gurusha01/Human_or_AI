This manuscript presents a fascinating and well-motivated study that is a delight to read.
1. The writing is of exceptionally high quality, and the overall clarity of the paper is commendable.
2. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with existing methodologies to contextualize the proposed approach. The omission of such comparisons warrants explanation.
3. A detailed examination of the model's robustness to misspecification is necessary, including both its strengths and weaknesses, to provide a comprehensive understanding.
4. The authors should elaborate on the sensitivity of the model's fixed tuning parameters, discussing both the advantages and disadvantages of their chosen values.
5. An assessment of the proposed model's scalability and computational complexity is essential. Additionally, the authors should consider making the code and data publicly available to ensure reproducibility of the results.
6. The conclusions and key takeaways for the reader could be more clearly articulated. The applications section, despite the strong motivation provided earlier in the paper, was somewhat underwhelming. A more in-depth discussion is crucial to enhancing the paper's impact and success, and the authors are encouraged to expand on this aspect.
