The authors present a method for parallelizing learners that rely on specific assumptions, leveraging Radon points as a key component. A notable distinction of this work from similar studies is the employment of Radon points as an alternative to the traditional averaging approach, which is used as a baseline for comparison. The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed approach against several benchmarks, including no parallelization, an averaging scheme, and Spark-based algorithms, demonstrating a reduction in learning time while achieving comparable or superior accuracy. 
However, it appears that the theoretical foundation of this work has been previously explored in another study, "Parallelizing Randomized Convex Optimization," potentially by the same authors. Since this preceding work is not cited in the current paper, it is essential to clarify the novel contributions of this manuscript in relation to the theoretical aspects, highlighting what distinguishes it from prior research.
