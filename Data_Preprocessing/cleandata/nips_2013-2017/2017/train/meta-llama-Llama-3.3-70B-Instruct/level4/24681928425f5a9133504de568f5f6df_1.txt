This manuscript endeavors to recreate user inquiries in a game of battleship, wherein queries about individual squares are substituted with questions posed in an artificial language, governed by compositional logical (Montagovian) semantics. The authors employ a log-linear model, operating on four straightforward features of the questions: anticipated information gain (informativeness), response type (Boolean or numerical), and the question's relevance to the board's characteristics.
From a broad perspective, the motivation rooted in active learning is plausible; however, the concepts presented in this paper are somewhat straightforward and the task is exceedingly simplistic, heavily constrained, and devoid of logical ambiguity. In my opinion, this work is unlikely to resonate with the NIPS community, as it may not offer substantial novelty or insight.
