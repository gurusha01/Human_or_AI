UPDATE: I appreciate your response, which I have thoroughly reviewed. 
I must admit that I initially overlooked the fact that the experiments do not directly implement the method for which theoretical results are provided, which led me to reduce my overall score by one level.
This paper is truly exceptional - meticulous, well-written, impressive, and engaging. It presents robust theoretical findings for deterministic quadrature alternatives to random Fourier features. Although I have a few suggestions, I firmly believe that this would be an outstanding contribution to NIPS.
- On page 2, lines 72-74, I question whether the evaluation of QMC is overly pessimistic. Was a higher-order QMC method employed in the referenced study? Is there a fundamental reason to assume that no QMC method would surpass the proposed approach? I am curious about the potential use of higher-order digital nets within QMC, which are related to weighted RKHS and share similarities with the ANOVA construction, as discussed in Dick and Pillichshammer's 2010 book.
- Consider using \top for transpose in LaTeX.
- It would be helpful to define the Cartesian basis e_i before its first use.
- On page 4, lines 151-155, the comparison to RFF could be further nuanced by acknowledging that additional assumptions are made to achieve the novel result, compared to the rate presented for RFF. In other words, is it clear that RFF would not outperform the proposed method under the extra assumption made in the paper?
- Please provide a definition for \tilde{\Omega} in section 4.
