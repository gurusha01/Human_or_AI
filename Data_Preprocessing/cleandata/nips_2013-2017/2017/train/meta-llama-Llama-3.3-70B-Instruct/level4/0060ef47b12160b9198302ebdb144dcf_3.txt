This paper proposes an image saliency mask generation approach capable of processing 100 images of size 224x224 per second on a standard GPU. The approach involves training a masking model to identify the tightest rectangular crop containing the entire salient region of a specific class, as determined by a black box classifier such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, or ResNet. The model architecture utilizes image feature maps, such as those generated by ResNet-50, across various scales. The final scale feature is then passed through a feature filter for initial localization, followed by upsampling blocks that refine the generated masks. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms other weakly supervised techniques in the ImageNet localization task.
The paper appears to provide sufficient references and related works, although a thorough check has not been performed. Similarly, the paper seems to be technically correct, but a comprehensive verification has not been conducted. The authors present a clear discussion on the design intuition behind their approach. The overall presentation of the paper is also well-done.
However, the paper presents some intriguing technical results, and there are concerns regarding the claimed real-time speed and its applicability to real-world images.
Comments:
- Is the reported processing time of 100 images per second inclusive of image resizing operations? If so, what is the processing time for larger images, such as 640x480 images captured by an iPhone 6s?
- The salient objects in this paper are relatively large; how would the approach perform if the requested class object is small in the image? Would a 224x224 image be sufficient in such cases?
- In Table 3, are there corresponding metrics for other works listed in Table 2, such as Feed [2]?
