This paper aims to determine the optimal patient screening policy based on relevant information, which involves modeling a disease as a finite-state stochastic process to minimize screening costs and delays. The authors propose a computationally efficient approximate solution. Simulated breast cancer data experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm can reduce delays without increasing costs compared to a basic baseline.
Strengths:
+ The topic of personalized screening is a significant research area
+ The proposed algorithm is logical and well-developed
+ The results show promise
+ The paper is well-written
Weaknesses:
- The proposed algorithm is largely theoretical, assuming prior knowledge of a patient's disease model, which is unlikely in practice. The main challenge in personalized screening lies in inferring the disease model from data, rather than developing a policy based on a known model.
- The methodological innovation is limited
- The experiments only compare the proposed algorithm to an annual screening baseline. Given the assumption of a known disease model, it is crucial to investigate the proposed method's robustness to inaccuracies in the disease model experimentally, including its sensitivity to uncertainties in the model.
In summary, while the topic is intriguing and the proposed algorithm is reasonable, the methodological novelty is modest, and the paper needs to better demonstrate its practical relevance to convince readers of its value.
