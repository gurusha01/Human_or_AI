The authors present a novel smooth primal-dual randomized coordinate descent method for minimizing the three composite problem F(x) = f(x) + g(x) + h(Ax), where f is smooth, g is non-smooth and separable with a block-wise proximal operator, and h is a general nonsmooth function. This method can be viewed as an extension of the accelerated, parallel, and proximal coordinate descent method of Fercoq and Richtarik, as well as the coordinate descent method with arbitrary sampling of Qu and Richtarik, to the three composite case. A key challenge in this extension is addressing the non-smoothness of the function h composed with a linear operator A. The authors address this by implementing an efficient update scheme that breaks up full vector updates, allowing the algorithm to achieve the best known O(n/k) convergence rate. Additionally, restart schemes are employed to enhance practical performance. The authors also examine special cases of the three composite problem and provide corresponding analyses.
The paper's contributions are well-articulated, and overall, it is a well-structured and informative manuscript. Its applicability to various objective functions, combined with the incorporation of several optimization "tricks," makes it a fast and efficient method.
Several aspects of the paper warrant further clarification:
- The description of Algorithm 1 in Section 2 could be improved, particularly with regards to the smoothing and non-uniform sampling techniques. While these are clearly explained, the homotopy and acceleration techniques used in the algorithm are not described in detail, making the algorithm somewhat opaque to readers unfamiliar with these methods. A more detailed explanation of each step in Algorithm 1, potentially including references to the methods or approaches used, would be beneficial.
- The formula for \tau in line 9 of Algorithm 1, as well as the adapted \tau formula for the strongly convex case in line 153, lack clear derivations or explanations. Providing the origins or mathematical justifications for these formulas would enhance the paper's clarity.
- The initialization values for \hat{x}, \tilde{x}, and \bar{x} in Algorithm 1 are not specified, which could lead to confusion. Including these initial values or explaining how they are determined would be helpful.
- The "given" value of \dot{y} mentioned in line 73 and equation (6) is unclear. Further explanation or context regarding this value would be appreciated.
- Lastly, there is an unknown reference in line 165 that should be identified or removed to maintain the paper's accuracy and completeness.
Upon reviewing the author rebuttal and other reviews, I appreciate the authors' efforts to address the comments and questions raised. My assessment of the paper remains positive, and I believe it should be accepted for publication.
