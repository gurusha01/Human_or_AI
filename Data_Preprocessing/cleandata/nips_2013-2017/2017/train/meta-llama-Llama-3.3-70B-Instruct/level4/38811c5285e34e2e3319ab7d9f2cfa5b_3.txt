The authors propose a parallelization algorithm for combining weak learners using Radon partitioning, accompanied by a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence to substantiate their approach. The theoretical analysis is engaging, and the empirical results show improvements in training time and/or AUC over several baseline algorithms across multiple datasets. The authors also proactively address potential concerns and questions in the Evaluation and Discussion sections, presenting a convincing case. Based on the strengths of the submission, I recommend acceptance.
Specific Notes
--------------
- Line 51: A minor typo exists, where "the the" should be corrected to "the".
- Line 79: The math font size appears inconsistent, as it seems smaller and less legible compared to other instances.
- Figures 1-3: To enhance readability, the text within the figure images should be enlarged.
- Figure 3: The distinguishability of this figure may be compromised if printed in black and white.
- Lines 318-320: For clarity, it would be beneficial to specify whether the statement regarding the Radon machine outperforming the averaging baseline is based on an average of paired comparisons.
- Line 324: The term "significant" is used in a context that does not imply statistical significance, which may be misleading.
- Lines 340-341: There are missing spaces in the text, notably in "machineachieved" and "machineis".
- Lines 341-349: The performance difference between the proposed method and the AverageAtTheEnd method seems marginal. It would be helpful to include this result in Figure 1 for a more comprehensive comparison and to provide a stronger argument in favor of the proposed approach.
- Line 377: The citation of "Long and servedio [22]" appears inconsistent with the citation style used elsewhere in the paper, even in immediately adjacent references.
