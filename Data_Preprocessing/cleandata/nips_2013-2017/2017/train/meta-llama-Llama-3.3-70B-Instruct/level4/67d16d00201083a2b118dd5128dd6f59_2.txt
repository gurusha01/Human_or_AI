The authors have introduced a phase discrepancy between distributions and phase features for embedding distributions, leveraging a phase function that remains invariant to additive SPD noise components. This approach is designed for two-sample testing and learning on distributions, with the phase discrepancy bearing a similar mathematical form to MMD, albeit tailored for invariance to additive SPD noise. The phase discrepancy gives rise to a shift-invariant kernel, as evidenced by Propositions 1 and 2, which in turn enables the direct application of random Fourier features to yield phase features. The experimental results provided convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.
However, several aspects warrant further clarification. Firstly, the justification provided for introducing the subset of indecomposable probability measures, for which phase functions are uniquely determined, appears insufficient. It is crucial to elaborate on how the lack of identifiability in this context might limit the utility of the phase discrepancy, or conversely, whether this subset encompasses a sufficiently broad range of distributions to be of practical interest in applications.
Furthermore, given the extensive study and deep understanding of MMD within the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), which has significantly contributed to guaranteeing the utility of MMD, it would be beneficial for the authors to establish a relationship between the proposed phase discrepancy and properties of the RKHS. Such a connection could potentially enhance the understanding and applicability of the phase discrepancy, leveraging the well-established framework of RKHS to further validate its usefulness.
