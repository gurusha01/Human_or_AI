The authors propose a methodology that utilizes a Fourier feature-based distance between the phase functions of probability distributions, which aligns with the concept of Maximum Mean Discrepancy and its associated kernel function. This phase function-based approach enables the introduction of a statistical test for comparing distributions affected by additive noise, where the noise distribution is unknown except for certain properties, such as the positivity of its characteristic function. Furthermore, phase features can be leveraged in learning from samples grouped into labeled bags. The authors apply their framework to various datasets to assess non-parametric two-sample tests.
The paper's approach is well-founded, as it addresses statistical problems with specific structures that are challenging to tackle using basic methods. The technique appears to function as an error-correcting mechanism for measurements distorted by a particular type of noise. To further demonstrate its effectiveness, it would be beneficial to apply this method to data sources more closely related to signal decoding problems, such as mobile or satellite communication, which could provide a more practical and robust testing environment.
However, the conditions exploited in the approach may require additional examination or relaxation, such as the case of indecomposable random variables, as verifying these conditions can be even more challenging than the problem presented by the authors.
