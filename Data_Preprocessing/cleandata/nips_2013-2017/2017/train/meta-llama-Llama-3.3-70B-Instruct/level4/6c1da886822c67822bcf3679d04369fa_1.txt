This paper is exceptionally well-crafted, providing a cohesive overview of cutting-edge density modeling techniques. Notably, the authors demonstrate that autoregressive models, normalizing flows, inverse autoregressive flows, and RealNVP/NICE can be comprehensively understood through a shared lens. Although certain elements of this perspective have been previously explored, such as in Kingma et al.'s work on IAF, this manuscript offers a more in-depth and accessible examination of the relationships between these models and techniques. Building upon this foundation, the authors propose a novel variant, which yields highly promising results that are competitive with, or even surpass, existing state-of-the-art approaches.
