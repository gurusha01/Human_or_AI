If left uncorrected, the repeated application of individually reliable high-confidence tests can inevitably result in absurd "statistically validated" findings. 
An alternative to traditional family-wise test corrections, such as Bonferroni's, which are often overly conservative, is the control of the false discovery rate (FDR).
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for repeated A/B/n tests, incorporating several key concepts, including:
- the introduction of a "best-arm identification with control" variant, also referred to as "better-arm identification," which builds upon the (epsilon,delta)-PAC best-arm identification problem;
- the replacement of inefficient static A/B/n testing procedures with adaptive PAC "better-arm" algorithms;
- a proposed variant of the LUCB algorithm tailored to this purpose;
- the integration of anytime p-values calculation for continuous FDR control.
A detailed analysis of the proposed "better-arm identification" algorithm is provided in section 3.2, while the meta-procedures are thoroughly examined and proven to ensure FDR control. The paper concludes with experimental results.
Initially, I was struck by the strongly application-oriented and interdisciplinary nature of this paper, but I found the innovative ideas and the practical perspectives they offer for multi-armed bandits (MABs) to be particularly compelling, with implications for both theoretical and applied research.
