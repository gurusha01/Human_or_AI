This paper explores the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which have garnered significant attention due to their ability to produce high-quality samples, albeit at the cost of challenging optimization processes. As an alternative, Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs) have emerged, leveraging two-sample hypothesis testing, but they are plagued by issues of sample quality and necessitate large batch sizes during training. The proposed methodology aims to enhance the efficiency and architecture of GMMNs, achieving this through the incorporation of feature matching within the kernel definition and a joint learning approach for the feature map and generator parameters in a minimax framework. The paper is well-received, with several key observations noted:
1. A more in-depth examination of the relationship between adversarial kernel learning and increased test power is warranted, as this aspect was not thoroughly explored.
2. The experimental section, including the complexity analysis, is comprehensive and well-executed.
3. To improve clarity and overall impact, the paper would benefit from rigorous editing to address the numerous typos that detract from its core message.
