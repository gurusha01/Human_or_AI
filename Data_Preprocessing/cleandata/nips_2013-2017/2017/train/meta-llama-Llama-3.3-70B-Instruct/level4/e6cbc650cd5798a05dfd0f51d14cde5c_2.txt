The authors investigated the link between Bayesian sparsity and LSTM networks, subsequently expanding their research to incorporate gated feedback networks. Initially, they examined the correlation between sparse Bayesian learning and iterative reweighted l1 regularization, followed by an analysis of its connection to LSTM networks, and ultimately broadened their scope to gated feedback networks. The study presented experimental findings based on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
