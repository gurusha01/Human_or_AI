This manuscript presents a statistical estimation technique for analyzing calcium imaging data, aiming to extract timecourses and spatial filters of cells, a crucial application in neuroscience where enhanced algorithms for mitigating cross-talk would be highly beneficial. The proposed framework bears a close resemblance to the CNMF method, differentiated by its incorporation of a robust loss function. However, I lack the expertise to fully evaluate the novelty and statistical validity of the framework, so my comments will focus on its practical application.
A significant concern arises from Fig. 2d, which suggests a decline in estimation accuracy over iterations. This seems to stem from the initialization of the algorithm with ground truth cell locations, an approach that does not reflect real-world scenarios and lacks justification within the paper. This methodology complicates the assessment of the EXTRACT algorithm's performance relative to CNMF or ICA, making it challenging to substantiate the claim of improved performance.
Several additional considerations are noteworthy:
- The non-negativity of signals in calcium imaging data, mentioned in Line 47, is more accurately attributed to the stringent regulation of calcium within neurons, characterized by a near-zero baseline concentration of free calcium that significantly increases upon the activation of voltage-gated ion channels, rather than the photon origin of the signals.
- The simulation of data using a Poisson distribution to account for photon shot noise, a prevalent noise model in fluorescence imaging, would offer a more realistic representation of the data. This approach could potentially enhance the validity and applicability of the proposed method.
