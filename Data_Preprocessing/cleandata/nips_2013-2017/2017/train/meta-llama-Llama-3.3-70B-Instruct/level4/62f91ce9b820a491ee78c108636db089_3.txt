I have reviewed the other assessments and the authors' response.
This paper focuses on the deterministic construction of a feature map z for subgaussian kernels, which can replace random Fourier transforms. According to Bochner's theorem, expressing a kernel through its Fourier transform involves calculating an intractable integral, typically computed using Monte Carlo integration. However, the authors propose utilizing Gaussian quadrature to compute this Fourier transform. Specifically, for the ANOVA kernel, the Gaussian quadrature-based Fourier transform yields good estimates with a complexity of O(D) instead of O(D^3). The effectiveness of this method is supported by experiments on classification tasks using the MNIST and TIMIT datasets.
The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction to kernels and quadrature that serves as a solid foundation. I appreciate that the proofs are included in the appendix, but I suggest mentioning this in the main text to avoid confusion. Initially, I thought the proofs were omitted.
This research has significant implications, as replacing high-dimensional Monte Carlo integration with deterministic methods can result in substantial speed-ups, provided the integration rule is tailored to the integrand. The use of the ANOVA kernel is a compelling example, as it encodes sparse dependencies, mitigating the "curse of dimensionality." I believe this would be of great interest to the community.
As an additional point, I would like to bring to the authors' attention a relevant line of research on probabilistic Gaussian quadrature rules, which they may not be aware of. Sarkka et al. [1] have demonstrated that Gaussian quadrature rules can be obtained as a posterior mean for Bayesian quadrature with suitable kernels. Perhaps this could be combined with the authors' methods if numerical uncertainty over the integration for the Fourier map is crucial.
One criticism I have is that a fundamental reference in the paper, [18] "How to scale up kernel methods to be as good as neural nets," is an arXiv submission from 2014 that appears to be non-peer-reviewed. I question whether this is the case or if an incorrect reference was chosen. For a reference cited as a primary motivation for this work, I would expect a peer-reviewed publication.
Overall, I think this is a strong paper with interesting theoretical and practical implications, and I vote to accept it.
