This manuscript introduces DPSCREEN, a novel approach for optimizing screening protocols for a broad range of diseases. Notably, DPSCREEN distinguishes itself from existing methods by incorporating both a patient's prior screening history and disease-specific characteristics, thereby enabling personalized screening strategies. This personalized approach leads to enhanced efficiency in screening processes without compromising the prompt detection of diseases.
In my assessment, the paper is well-structured and technically rigorous. The methodology is well-justified, engaging with relevant prior research and presenting a clear, in-depth examination of the algorithm's mathematical underpinnings, including its computational efficiency. The validation of DPSCREEN is conducted on an extensive dataset comprising 45,000 patients from the Athena Health Network, effectively demonstrating the benefits of personalized screening. Furthermore, the model's applicability is verified across various disease models, resulting in a technically sound contribution with significant potential for practical applications.
