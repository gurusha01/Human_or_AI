This paper proposes a methodology for learning predictive one-dimensional point process models by modeling the count density using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (W-GAN).
Detailed comments:
* The abstract could be strengthened by acknowledging existing approaches for full or approximate Bayesian inference on point processes, such as those outlined in arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0254.pdf and www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~vrao/nips2011_raoteh.pdf.
* It appears that the methodology is limited to one-dimensional point processes, as higher-dimensional processes may be difficult to represent using count density; explicitly stating this limitation would be beneficial.
* For most inhomogeneous point processes, estimating a low-variance distance between the generated count measure and the data is challenging, especially with a single realization of the point process. This challenge may be mitigated by the heavy regularization applied to the generator/intensity-proxy in the W-GAN, similar to GP-based intensity-explicit models.
* The origin of the 'real' label in the real-world evaluation metrics, such as Figure 3, is unclear; clarification on how this ground truth is obtained would be helpful.
* A discussion on the training complexity of these models would be a valuable addition.
 
Ultimately, a comparison with simpler models, such as KDE with truncation or parametric Hawkes processes, would be insightful. A primary concern with this work is that the models may be overly complex for the available signal-to-noise ratio, and thus, while the W-GAN outperforms other NN/RNN-based approaches, a more heavily regularized (and simpler) intensity-based approach might empirically outperform in most cases.
