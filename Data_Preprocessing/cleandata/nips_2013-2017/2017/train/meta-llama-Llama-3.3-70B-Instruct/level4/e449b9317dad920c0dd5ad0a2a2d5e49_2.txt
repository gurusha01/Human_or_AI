The authors present a novel matrix factorization approach grounded in a one-sided Huber loss function, situated within the robust estimation framework. They provide asymptotic proofs demonstrating the method's optimality. This technique is then applied to the specific problem of extracting cells and time courses from optogenetic neural measurements, yielding improvements over existing methods such as CNMF and ICA.
Although my familiarity with robust regression is limited, preventing me from thoroughly assessing the proofs, I accept the authors' assertion of novelty and the correctness of their mathematical demonstrations. The contribution represents a significant advancement, particularly in enabling the matrix factorization required for calcium imaging applications.
By design, this method is more resilient to disruptive noise types, which could potentially give it an advantage over existing methods. 
In the synthetic data evaluation, a more comprehensive exploration of variations in overlap and temporal similarity, along with comparative analyses against other methods, could have provided deeper insights into the proposed method's limitations and comparative performance, allowing for a more systematic understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
