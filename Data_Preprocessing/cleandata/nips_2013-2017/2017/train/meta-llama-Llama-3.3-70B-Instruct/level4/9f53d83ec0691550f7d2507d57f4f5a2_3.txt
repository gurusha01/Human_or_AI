This paper presents TranSync, a robust and efficient algorithm for addressing the 1D translation synchronization problem. The algorithm's simplicity, which involves solving a truncated least squares problem at each iteration, contributes to its superior computational efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on linear programming formulations. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of TranSync under both deterministic and randomized noise models, showcasing its robustness and stability. Notably, even when pairwise measurements are biased, TranSync achieves a sub-constant recovery rate, outperforming the linear programming approach, which can only tolerate up to 50% biased measurements. The paper is well-written and the proofs of the main theorems are clear and appear to be correct. However, additional insight into the intuition behind the theorems would be beneficial. The numerical experiments are thorough and well-presented, effectively supporting the algorithm's efficacy.
