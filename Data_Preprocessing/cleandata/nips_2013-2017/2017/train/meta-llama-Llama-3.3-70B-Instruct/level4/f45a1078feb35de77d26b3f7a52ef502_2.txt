This paper presents a novel approach to estimating point processes using the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) framework. Given data generated by a point process on the real line, the authors aim to construct a model of this process, deviating from traditional maximum likelihood methods in favor of WGAN. To achieve this, they must: 
- establish a distance metric between two point process realizations, 
- define a family of Lipschitz functions relative to this distance, and 
- specify a generative model that transforms noise into a point process.
The paper's primary contribution lies in its innovative approach to addressing these challenges, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of applying WGAN to point process estimation. The proposed method is evaluated against maximum likelihood approaches on various synthetic and real point processes, showcasing favorable performance, particularly when the underlying intensity model is unknown.
Although my familiarity with point process estimation and its applications is limited, preventing a full assessment of the method's potential impact and relevance, I recognize the non-trivial adaptation of WGAN to this domain as a significant contribution. The originality of the paper stems from its reasonable adaptation strategy and insightful implementation of the Lipschitz constraint, which I find noteworthy.
However, one aspect requiring further clarification is the generator function's modeling, specifically the sequence $t_i$ generated as per equation (7). It is unclear whether the generated sequence is guaranteed to be increasing, for instance, through constraints on the weights being positive, or if the algorithm functions even when the sequence is not increasing, with the discriminator encouraging the generator to produce increasing sequences through discrimination against non-increasing ones.
