This paper presents a novel framework for parallel machine learning algorithms, focusing on a more effective combination of base learners beyond simple averaging. The approach involves replacing subsets of hypotheses with their Radon point, and the authors provide complexity bounds for their method, as well as empirical comparisons with parallel algorithms in Spark and base linear models in Weka.
The proposal of a black-box method to combine weak learners is intriguing, offering an alternative to traditional bagging techniques. The theoretical analysis of the Radon machine's complexity is a significant contribution, demonstrating that breaking down original samples into multiple parts results in a more efficient parallel machine compared to a base learner operating on the entire sample set. Additionally, the authors establish a PAC bound on the Radon machine, which strengthens the theoretical foundation of the paper.
However, a major concern lies in the practical applicability of the proposed approach, particularly for high-dimensional data. The experiments, which appear to be limited to low-dimensional datasets (featuring only 18 attributes), may not accurately represent the complexities of modern machine learning problems. To enhance the paper's validity, the authors should address how their method can effectively handle high-dimensional data, as this would significantly bolster the overall strength of the paper.
