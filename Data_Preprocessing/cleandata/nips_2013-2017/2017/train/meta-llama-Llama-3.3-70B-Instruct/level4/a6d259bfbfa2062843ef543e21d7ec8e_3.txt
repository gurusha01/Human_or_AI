This paper examines the game tree of a two-person zero-sum game, where the payoff at each leaf node is stochastic and the tree length is arbitrary. The objective is to determine the optimal move at the root node that yields the highest payoff. The paper adopts a PAC setting, allowing for a sub-optimal move within a parameter $\epsilon$. Notably, the Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem can be viewed as a tree with depth 1. Two algorithms are proposed, based on UGapE and LUCB, which are similar to those used in the BAI problem. However, these algorithms must account for the tree's structure, including its depth and branches. They maintain confidence intervals at each leaf node and propagate them upwards to the root, while also designating a "representative" leaf for each internal node. The algorithm then proceeds similarly to the BAI problem, identifying the two marginal children of the root and sampling the representative leaf of one or both of them in each round. The stopping rule is identical to that used in BAI. Theoretical upper and lower bounds are derived, with upper bounds similar to those of LUCB in BAI and lower bounds similar to those in BAI.
Overall, the paper is well-motivated, and the results presented improve upon earlier work both theoretically and experimentally, with significant experimental improvements (reducing sample requirements to approximately 1/7 of the state-of-the-art algorithm). The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. However, the algorithms and analysis are overly similar to those in BAI, and the problem considered is a generalization of BAI. Additionally, while the paper by Jamieson et al. (2014) on LIL is referenced, it is not discussed whether this technique could enhance the results experimentally and theoretically. Given that LIL can improve the CB-like bound in the BAI setting, exploring this aspect would be beneficial.
In summary, the paper is generally well-written and presents significant experimental improvements, making it a good contribution, especially considering the notable experimental advancements.
