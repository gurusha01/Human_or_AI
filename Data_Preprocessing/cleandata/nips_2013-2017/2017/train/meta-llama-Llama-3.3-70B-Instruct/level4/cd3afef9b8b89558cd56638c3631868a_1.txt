This paper explores the concept of isotonic regression on linear orders within online settings. The authors note that previous research has demonstrated the impossibility of learning online isotonic regression in a fully adversarial model, which motivates their proposal of a more pragmatic random permutation model.
Although the paper is generally well-written and clearly conveys an intriguing topic, with some minor exceptions of typos and grammatical inconsistencies, its claims lack substantiation due to the omission of experimental results. To bolster the validity of the assertions made, it would be beneficial to conduct simulations of specific examples, thereby illustrating the effectiveness of isotonic regression on linear orders in online environments.
