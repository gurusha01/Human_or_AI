Review- Summary:
The authors have introduced a novel approach to cursor control in intracortical brain-computer interfaces, enhancing the standard Kalman filter-based decoder with a dynamic Bayesian network that incorporates the goal position as a latent variable and a flexible likelihood model for neural decoding. By utilizing a semi-Markov model to analyze dynamics and integrating information over an extended history with latent counter variables for both goal position and cursor angle, their method demonstrates improved performance. The junction tree algorithm is employed for inference, and both offline and online simulations showcase the method's capability to predict motion directions from neural activity, outperforming Kalman filter baselines.
Qualitative assessment:
The proposed method yields a modest improvement in performance compared to traditional Kalman filter decoders in brain-computer interface systems. The offline experiment results, as seen in Figure 5, indicate that both the flexible tuning likelihood and the semi-Markov method contribute to enhanced outcomes. Although the topic is not entirely novel, the work represents a reasonable advancement over previous research. The paper is well-organized and generally clearly written.
Comments:
1) The incorporation of the goal position as a latent state in the dynamic Bayesian network lacks clear motivation. It appears that the system aims to infer not only the movement intent but also the user's final goal, which poses a significantly more challenging problem. This aspect requires more thorough discussion.
2) While the offline experiment reveals the proposed method's advantage over the Kalman filter decoder with various configurations, the online experiment does not clearly demonstrate this improvement. Specifically, the left subfigure of Figure 7 does not convincingly show which method performs better.
3) The supplementary materials contain typos in the derivation of the inference algorithm, which should be corrected to ensure accuracy and clarity.
