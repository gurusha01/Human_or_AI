SUMMARY 
* This paper introduces a novel density estimation technique utilizing a stacked autoregressive model framework, leveraging the interpretation of autoregressive models as normalizing flows to enhance the flexibility of conditionals in masked autoregressive density estimation, offering an alternative to approaches like mixture models.
CLARITY 
* The manuscript is exceptionally well-structured and clearly explains the connections between existing methodologies, facilitating a comprehensive understanding.
* The experimental results are convincingly presented, and the provision of code enhances the paper's reproducibility and transparency.
RELEVANCE 
* The proposed methodology seems logical and yields significant improvements over other approaches, particularly in conditional density estimation scenarios.
* The experimental outcomes demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed method, positioning it as a competitive, general-purpose density estimation alternative, even when compared to domain-knowledge-intensive methods.
* The discussion prompts intriguing avenues for future investigation, underscoring the paper's potential to inspire further research in the field.
