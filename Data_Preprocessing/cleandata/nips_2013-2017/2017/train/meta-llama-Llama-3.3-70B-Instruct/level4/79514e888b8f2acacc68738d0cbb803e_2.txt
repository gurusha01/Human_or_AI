This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning approach utilizing GANs, which reveals that effective semi-supervised learning necessitates a suboptimal generator when considering the discriminator's objective. The authors introduce a new formulation that significantly enhances feature matching GANs. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, making the paper an engaging and well-crafted contribution to the GANs algorithm family. However, several concerns warrant further attention:
1. Given the challenges of converging GANs when minimizing the KL divergence between the generator and target distributions, as observed in W-GAN, it would be beneficial for the authors to explore the applicability of their algorithm to more advanced GAN variants.
2. Since generating general samples, such as high-resolution images, is a known difficulty with GANs, the authors should demonstrate how their proposed model can be utilized in scenarios where sample generation is challenging.
3. Providing insight into the optimal level of "badness" for a generator in the context of semi-supervised classification would be a valuable addition, as this could help clarify the trade-offs involved.
4. It would be intriguing to investigate whether incorporating human-specified labels could enhance the generator's performance, potentially leading to the generation of satisfactory images, and thus exploring the interplay between human input and generator quality.
