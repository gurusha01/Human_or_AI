This paper presents an intriguing analysis, offering valuable perspectives on the RCD and SGD algorithms. Notably, Conclusion 2 in Theorem 3.2 is particularly insightful, as it indicates the superiority of the proposed sampling method over the commonly employed L-based sampling strategy. To further enhance the manuscript, I propose the following considerations:
1. In the expression for $p^*i$ on Line 85, the denominator should feature $xk$ instead of $x$ to ensure accuracy.
2. For consistency, it might be beneficial to remove the subscript $k$ from $\hat p$ and $\hat c$ in Line 135.
3. The figures provided are too small, rendering ticks, labels, numbers, and text illegible. Consider relocating some figures to the appendix to create space, allowing for the display of larger, more readable figures.
4. If feasible, it would be enlightening to include a comparison similar to Conclusion 2 in Theorem 3.2, but with uniform sampling (where $p=1/n$) instead of the L-based method, to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
5. The authors should discuss the impact of this new sampling method on the total complexity of RCD or SGD. Specifically, they could analyze the total complexity (including the $O(n)$ time required for updating $lk$ and $uk$) for RCD to achieve an epsilon-optimal solution, offering a clearer picture of the method's efficiency.
