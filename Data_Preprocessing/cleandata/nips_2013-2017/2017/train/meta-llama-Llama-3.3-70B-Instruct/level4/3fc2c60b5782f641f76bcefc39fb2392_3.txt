To be honest, I found the problem formulation unclear. Specifically, the nature of \mathcal{X, Y, Z} is ambiguous - are they compact sets in R^n, unbounded sets, or perhaps finite sets? 
Although the authors appear to propose an end-to-end optimization approach similar to [29], the stochastic programming context (e.g., inventory management) is outside my area of expertise. While the load forecasting results seem promising, my lack of familiarity with these problems makes it difficult to fully appreciate their significance. 
I would have liked to see the methodology applied to more conventional problems, such as continuous control tasks, which are more relatable to my own expertise and likely that of the broader NIPS audience.
