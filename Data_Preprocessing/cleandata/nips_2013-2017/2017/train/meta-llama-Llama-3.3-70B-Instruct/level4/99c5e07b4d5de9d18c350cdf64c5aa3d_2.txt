The paper presents a novel brain-computer interface algorithm designed to control cursor movement to random screen locations using neuronal activity, specifically power in the spike spectrum of intra-cortically implanted selected electrodes. 
This algorithm employs a dynamic Bayesian network model that encodes potential target locations from a set of possible positions on a 40x40 grid displayed on the screen. The target location can change only when a countdown timer, which is set at random time intervals, reaches zero, at which point the target has a chance to switch locations, thereby enforcing slow target location dynamics.
The observations, or power in the spike spectrum, are assumed to be drawn from a multi-modal distribution, specifically a mixture of von Mises functions, as multiple neurons can influence the power recorded on a single electrode and are dependent on the current movement direction. The position is determined by integrating the movement direction variable over time, with some decay incorporated.
The novel method is compared to several variations of the Kalman filter, which use the same movement state space but lack the latent target location, as well as to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Experiments were conducted both offline, utilizing data from closed-loop BCI sessions that employed either a Kalman filter or an HMM, and online in two closed-loop sessions, where the Kalman filter and the new method were alternated. These experiments were performed on a tetraplegic human subject.
Overall, the paper, excluding the supplementary material which is crucial for understanding the experiment, is well-written. The new model significantly outperforms the standard Kalman Filter, as evident from the multiple figures and supplementary movies.
Several points require clarification or consideration:
- The use of the von Mises distribution for both modeling observations given the intended movement direction and the next goal position needs further explanation. Specifically, is there a distribution over possible goal positions, or is a single goal position selected at each time point during inference?
- The constraint that the goal cannot be changed before the timer expires, regardless of new observations, seems unusual. Alternative methods to induce slow switch rates, such as forced transition rates or state cascades, might be more straightforward and not force the estimate of the target position to remain fixed as new evidence accumulates.
- The model's lack of momentum, allowing the cursor to change direction abruptly, contrasts with the physical properties of most objects we control, which have inertia. Incorporating models that preserve velocity and control acceleration might be more natural, especially considering the direction and force sensitivity of some neurons in the motor cortex.
- The model's performance over time, after an initial learning period, is not addressed. Questions about whether the performance level is maintained, degrades due to network or recording drift, or improves as the subject masters the system control, and whether an adaptive system would perform better, remain unanswered.
- The paper focuses on an engineering solution to the BCI problem without exploring what the brain encodes naturally or how the subject and neural system adapt and learn to optimize the use of the provided BCI.
- The citation format is incorrect and should be numerical, such as [1], [1-4], rather than Author et al. (2015).
