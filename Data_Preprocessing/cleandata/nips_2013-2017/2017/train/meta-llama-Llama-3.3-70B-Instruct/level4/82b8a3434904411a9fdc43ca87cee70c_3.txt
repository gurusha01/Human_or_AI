This manuscript proposes a stochastic optimization algorithm that incorporates variance reduction, specifically designed to address data perturbations where the variance between datapoints significantly exceeds the variance of perturbations within a single datapoint. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's improvement through both theoretical analysis and simulation results.
The approach to separately account for perturbation variance is well-motivated and leads to enhanced convergence properties, which I find particularly appealing. Although I found the convergence results intriguing, I was unable to thoroughly verify their accuracy due to the complexity of the material.
Upon reviewing the derivation, I noticed a potential typo at line 428, where "(1-\alphat)" might be the correct expression instead of "\alphat". However, this does not appear to be a critical error.
After considering the rebuttal, my overall assessment remains unchanged, and I am maintaining my original score.
