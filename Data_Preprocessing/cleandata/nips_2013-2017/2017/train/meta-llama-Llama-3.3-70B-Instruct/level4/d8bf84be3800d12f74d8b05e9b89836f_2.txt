This manuscript builds upon the recently published PointNet paper, with its primary contribution being the incorporation of spatial relationships between points, achieved through grouping, thereby introducing locality and shift invariance for low-level descriptors, making PointNet more analogous to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Although the contribution is relatively straightforward to comprehend and does not significantly deviate from the original PointNet, the paper is well-structured, thoroughly evaluated, and demonstrates satisfactory results. The efficient implementation of the proposed method likely required considerable effort, and including numerical data on processing speed in the paper would be beneficial, as optimizations such as sampling and centering could substantially improve performance. The results, while not extraordinary, are nonetheless compelling, particularly when considering the comparison between PointNet and PointNet++ without normal information, yielding 89.2% and 90.7% accuracy for classification, respectively. Additionally, including a comparison without normals for segmentation tasks would be a valuable enhancement.
Notably, the evaluation on the SHREC non-rigid shape classification benchmark is a welcome addition, as few papers have assessed performance on both this dataset and ModelNet, making this contribution a useful reference point in the field.
