Summary of the paper
====================
This paper explores the finite-sum problem setting where individual functions are subject to random perturbations. The authors propose an adaptation of the MISO/Finito algorithm, called S-MISO, tailored to this setting, and provide a convergence analysis based on the model's noise and analytic parameters, accompanied by experimental results on diverse datasets from various domains.
Evaluation
==========
The proposed S-MISO algorithm effectively leverages the additional structure present in this setting, outperforming SGD and N-SAGA both theoretically and empirically. The setting is relevant to important applications, such as image and text classification, where data augmentation and perturbation have been successful. However, the convergence analysis is somewhat loosely stated, and the algorithm requires careful tuning of non-trivial user-specified parameters. Furthermore, the paper fails to adequately address the expected performance on multi-layer networks in the experimental section, which is disappointing given its prominence in the paper. The paper is generally easy to follow.
Comments
========
L8 - The use of 'smaller constant factor' to describe convergence rates is unclear; consider using O-notation for clarity.
L17 - The term 'simple' is ambiguous; please specify whether it refers to proximal-friendly or another concept.
L21 - The sentence containing 'fundamental' requires rephrasing and supporting pointers or cross-references.
L47 - The sentence could be rephrased for improved clarity.
L65 - Table 2 references an undefined 'data radius'; please provide a definition.
L66 - The focus on a quantity dependent on the minimizer may impact the asymptotic properties of the convergence analysis; please elaborate.
L69 - A space is missing after 'note that\nabla'.
L77 - The term 'unimprovable' requires clarification; in what sense is this rate unimprovable?
L78 - This paragraph seems out of place; consider relocating it to the 'related work' section.
L90 - This paragraph also appears to be misplaced; it may be more suitable in section 4.
L116+L121 - The phrase 'when f_i is an expectation' is confusing; consider rephrasing for clarity.
L183+L185 - The use of epsilon bar is unconventional and obscures the statement; please restate the convergence analysis in terms of the predefined accuracy level or provide additional explanation.
L192 - Please provide more information on concrete choices for gamma.
L198 - The phrase 'as large as allowed' requires clarification in the context of EQ 9.
L200 - Figure 1's caption could be expanded to explain what 'satisfies the theory' entails.
L208 - Some experiments appear to be 400 epochs long; please confirm.
L226 - Numbers in this section and subsequent sections lack thousands separators; please add for readability.
L261 - Comparisons could be more fair if a non-uniform version of SGD were used.
L271 - This line seems out of place; consider relocating it for improved coherence.
