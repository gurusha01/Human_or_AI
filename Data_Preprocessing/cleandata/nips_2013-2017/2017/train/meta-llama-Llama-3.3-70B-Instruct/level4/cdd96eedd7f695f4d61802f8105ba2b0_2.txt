This manuscript proposes a novel neural network (NN) model for learning graph embeddings, which effectively preserves both local graph structure and a global node ranking, akin to PageRank. The approach leverages a Siamese network architecture, taking two node embeddings as input and generating new output representations for each node. Notably, the learning process is unsupervised, relying solely on the graph structure. The loss function is designed to optimize a weighted inner product of the output representations (local loss) and a node ranking criterion (global loss), with additional connections to community detection criteria. The model's performance is evaluated across multiple tasks, including node ranking, classification, regression, link prediction, and compared against other unsupervised embedding learning methods.
The paper contributes new loss criteria and an innovative method for learning graph embeddings, with the introduction of a node ranking term based on graph structure being a particularly original aspect. The authors demonstrate that this term yields significant benefits to the learned embeddings, enabling their method to outperform other unsupervised baselines across various tasks. The links to community criteria are also noteworthy. However, the paper's organization and presentation can be improved, as some sections are challenging to follow. For instance, the motivation behind using a Siamese architecture is not clearly explained. Additionally, the paper learns two representations for each node (denoted as u and z), but it is unclear why both are necessary, given that the z representation is a deterministic function of the u representation.
The explanation for the specific proximity-preserving loss term is also unclear, with the concept of "second-order" proximity being introduced without a proper definition. Furthermore, Lemma 3.4, which establishes connections to community detection criteria, is confusing. In the experimental section, a more detailed description of the baseline methods is needed to understand their differences from the proposed approach. While the proposed method outperforms all baselines in the tests, there is no analysis provided to explain the reasons behind this superior performance.
Overall, the paper presents intriguing and interesting findings, with several original aspects to the proposed method. However, to fully appreciate the ideas presented, the paper would benefit from improved organization and presentation.
