This paper presents a novel hierarchical Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD) and investigates its efficacy in route prediction, demonstrating how the incorporation of hierarchical concepts preserves the inherent properties of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD) while enhancing predictive capabilities. The authors also highlight the computational efficiency of hierarchical PSDD compared to probabilistic graphical models, attributing this advantage to its effective representation of feasible combinatorial structures.
Although the paper is well-structured and contributes meaningfully to the field, its scope is somewhat limited by the presentation of results from only a single example dataset and task. It would be beneficial to see a more comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets to confirm the persistence of the observed advantages.
Furthermore, a comparison of the computational costs between the hierarchical PSDD and the original PSDD would provide valuable insights. Intuitively, the increased flexibility of the hierarchical model might come at the cost of higher computational expense, and quantifying this difference would be informative.
