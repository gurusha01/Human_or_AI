This manuscript investigates the query complexity of clustering algorithms when supplemented with auxiliary data, referred to as 'side information', which takes the form of a similarity matrix W. The entries of this matrix, Wij, are drawn from distributions f+ or f-, contingent upon whether the indices i and j belong to the same or different clusters, respectively. A key finding of the paper is the establishment of a threshold: in the absence of side information, the query complexity is Theta(nk), whereas the incorporation of side information reduces this complexity to O(k log n/H^2(f+||f-)), where H denotes the Hellinger distance between the distributions. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that this bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor in n.
The result presented in this paper is theoretically intriguing for several reasons. Its connection to the stochastic block model (SBM), a topic of significant recent interest, is noteworthy, as it poses novel questions regarding the impact of querying on threshold behavior. A key insight is that the introduction of side information can substantially alter the query complexity, a finding that, while perhaps intuitively expected given that side information could potentially encapsulate complete cluster information, is rigorously quantified here. Specifically, the manuscript contributes by elucidating how the quality of the similarity matrix influences the query complexity, thereby offering a nuanced understanding of the interplay between side information and clustering efficiency.
