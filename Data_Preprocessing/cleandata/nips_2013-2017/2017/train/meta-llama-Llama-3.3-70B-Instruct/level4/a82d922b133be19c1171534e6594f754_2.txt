This manuscript presents a novel, computationally efficient approximation of leave-one-out cross-validation for parametric learning problems, along with an algorithm for simultaneous learning of regularization and model parameters. The proposed techniques appear to be innovative and broadly applicable.
The manuscript is well-structured, although the introductory section could be condensed to allocate more space to the subsequent sections, where the notation becomes increasingly dense.
Regarding the comparison between ALOOCV and LOOCV evaluated on a subset of data points (mentioned in lines 137-140), could you provide further insights into both the computational cost and the accuracy of the approximation?
Additional comments:
- Line 75: Is the reference to PRESS? If so, please explicitly mention it.
- Line 90: The statement "no assumptions on the distribution" implies the absence of a prior distribution; please clarify.
- Definition 7: The equation appears to be part of the preceding sentence and should be integrated accordingly. Furthermore, it seems unusual that an analytic function does not meet this definition due to the uniqueness constraint. Consider a two-dimensional function with non-differentiable regions in the upper-right quadrant, which remains analytic along certain cross-sections.
- Lines 186-187: The remark concerning Definition 7 seems somewhat unusual; rephrasing to "We note that the theory could be extended to..." might be more suitable.
- Line 250: It appears that joint learning of the regularization parameter is not performed in the second example. If the material in Section 4 does not apply here, please provide clarification within that section.
Typographical corrections:
- Line 200: Replace "few" with "a few".
