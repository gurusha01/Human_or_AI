This paper presents a novel two-stage approach for robust submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint of k. The methodology consists of two stages: firstly, a robust streaming algorithm, STAR-T, is developed, leveraging a partitioning structure and a decreasing thresholding rule; secondly, the simple greedy method is applied. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that STAR-T achieves a constant approximation guarantee as k approaches infinity (Theorem 4.1), while Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 establish that the combination of STAR-T with the simple greedy method can effectively handle element loss.
Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well in addressing influence maximization and personalized movie recommendation problems. The work is noteworthy as it pioneers the development of a streaming algorithm for robust submodular maximization, potentially opening up a broad range of applications and offering valuable insights. The STAR-T algorithm involves two hyperparameters, τ and w, with Theorem 4.5 providing a method for approximating τ, and experimental results showing that setting w=1 yields satisfactory performance, thereby simplifying the use of STAR-T without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.
However, a significant concern is that the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, as the STAR-T-Greedy algorithm does not consistently outperform the Sieve-St algorithm. Furthermore, the definition of the objective function for Influence Maximization as f(Z) = |N(Z) ∪ Z| (line 219) appears to deviate from the function presented in the referenced article by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), which raises questions about the performance of STAR-T under the conventional spread model.
