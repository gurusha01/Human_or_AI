This paper examines the impact of modifying the bitcoin network's transaction-flooding protocol to counter deanonymisation attacks present in the original pre-2015 protocol. The authors develop models for both the original protocol (trickle) and its revised variant (diffusion), concluding that deanonymisation is equally feasible with both protocols. This claim is substantiated through simulation-based analyses of both models.
Quality of Presentation:
The paper is well-structured and effectively conveys the necessary background information, despite minor issues such as incomplete sentences and an unresolved reference. The explanation of the transaction-flooding protocols is thorough, with clearly stated assumptions.
Content-related questions:
- The authors cite a 30% probability of detecting participants, a relatively low but significant figure. However, a crucial assumption underlying deanonymisation is that a listening supernode must connect to all active bitcoin nodes. Given the potential future growth of the network, it is questionable whether a supernode could realistically achieve this. The authors' argument regarding the use of botnets serves as a plausible counterpoint.
- Although the paper presents a comprehensive analysis, it does not conclusively address the claim that trickle and diffusion protocols perform equally in maintaining anonymity. Figure 6 reveals a notable difference in probability (around 0.1) between the simulated trickle and diffusion protocols, with diffusion performing worse. In contrast, Figure 7, which operates on a real network snapshot, shows diffusion outperforming trickle. While they converge with an increasing number of eavesdropper connections, the discrepancy and conflicting observations warrant further discussion. The assertion that both protocols exhibit 'similar probabilities of detection' requires clarification, particularly in terms of how similarity is established.
