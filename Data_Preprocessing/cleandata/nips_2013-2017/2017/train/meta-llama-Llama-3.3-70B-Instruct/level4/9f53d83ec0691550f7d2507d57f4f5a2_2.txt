This study focuses on translation synchronization, which involves extracting latent coordinates from noisy pairwise observations. The authors propose an iterative algorithm that solves a truncated least squares problem at each step, accompanied by a convergence analysis and conditions for exact recovery. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods, making this paper a comprehensive and engaging contribution.
