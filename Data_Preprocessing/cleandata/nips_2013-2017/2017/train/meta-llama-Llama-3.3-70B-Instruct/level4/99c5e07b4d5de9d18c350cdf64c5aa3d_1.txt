This manuscript proposes a dynamic Bayesian network approach to mitigate errors in iBCI decoders, enabling the system to leverage extended signal histories and minimize errors. 
The current state-of-the-art methodology appears to rely on Kalman filters for decoding neural signals to determine the angle of motion. The authors demonstrate an improvement over this approach by utilizing an enhanced tuning curve and a modified Kalman filter framework.
To further clarify the methodology, it would be beneficial to determine the minimum required recording time for initializing both the tuning curve and the decoder.
The authors note that their decoder's state encompasses not only the vector of desired cursor movement, as in the traditional Kalman filter, but also the two-dimensional final location on the screen where the participant intends to move the cursor. This raises questions regarding whether prior knowledge of the goal is necessary, implying a potentially supervised approach. If this is the case, the authors should explicitly acknowledge this limitation to provide a comprehensive understanding of their method's applicability and constraints.
