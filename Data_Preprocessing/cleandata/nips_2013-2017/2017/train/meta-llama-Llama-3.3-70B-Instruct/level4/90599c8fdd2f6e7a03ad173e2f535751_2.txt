Review- Overview:
The authors propose an enhancement to existing regret estimation methods for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) using options, addressing the limitation of requiring a distribution of cumulative rewards and option durations, a necessity for previous methods like UCRL and SUCRL.
Assuming well-defined options, the authors transform the inner MDP of options, represented by a transition matrix Po, into an equivalent irreducible Markov chain with matrix P'o, achieved by merging terminal states into the initial state.
This transformation, coupled with the assumption that any state with a termination probability less than one can be reached, enables the derivation of the stationary distribution mu_o of the chain, which is then used to estimate the optimistic reward gain. This formulation, termed FSUCRL, offers improved robustness to ill-defined parameter estimates and better accounts for the correlation between cumulative rewards and durations compared to previous methods.
The FSUCRL algorithm is supplemented by estimating confidence intervals for the reward r, SMDP transition probabilities, and the inner Markov Chain P'o. Two variants of the algorithm, FUSCRL Lvl1 and Lvl2, are introduced, with the first requiring direct computation of an approximated distribution mu_o from the estimate of P'o, and the second utilizing nested empirical value iterations to obtain the optimal bias.
The paper concludes with a theoretical analysis and numerical application of FSUCRL, comparing FSUCRL Lvl2 to SUCRL on a theoretical level and arguing that the goodness of the regret bound predicted by FSUCRL Lvl2, relative to SUCRL, depends on factors such as option length and state accessibility within the option.
Empirical testing of four algorithms (UCRL, SUCRL, FSUCRL Lvl1, and FSUCRL Lvl2) on a gridworld from ref. 9, assuming a known maximum option duration, confirms theoretical expectations, with FSUCRL Lvl2 outperforming both SUCRL and FSUCRL Lvl1, partly due to overlapping options' actions.
Evaluation:
- Quality: The paper is theoretically sound, with a comprehensive problem discussion, including in-depth analysis of the approach's strengths and weaknesses relative to SUCRL. The numerical simulation, while not conclusive, supports the theoretical considerations.
- Clarity: Although the paper could be clearer, it is sufficiently clear, with the authors providing an example and theoretical discussion that facilitate understanding of the mathematical framework.
- Originality: The work appears to be sufficiently original in relation to its predecessor (SUCRL) and other published works in NIPS.
- Significance: The paper's motivation is clear and relevant, addressing a significant limitation of previous methods.
Other comments:
- Line 140: The replacement of the first column of Qo with vo to form P'o should be clarified in relation to Assumptions 1 or 2, as this modification affects the reachability of the first state.
- Line 283: A minor typo, "four" should be replaced with "for".
- Line 284: Another minor typo, "where" should be replaced with "were".
