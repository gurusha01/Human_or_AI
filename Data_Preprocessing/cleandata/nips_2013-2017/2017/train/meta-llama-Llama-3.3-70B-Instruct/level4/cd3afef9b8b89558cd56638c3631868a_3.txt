Although I lack expertise in online learning and did not thoroughly examine the appendix proofs, my overall assessment of the paper is favorable. However, I am unable to evaluate the significance of the results or the novelty of the analytical techniques, which is reflected in my moderately neutral score, rather than the paper's quality.
In essence, the authors investigate isotonic regression within an online context, where an adversary selects the dataset, but the examples are presented in a random order, with regret measured against the optimal isotonic function for the dataset.
The primary contribution appears to be in Section 4, introducing a class of "forward algorithms" that encompass several established methods, achieving sqrt(T) regret. The authors also provide complementary results, including lower bounds and findings for different settings and loss functions.
To strengthen the paper, the authors could provide additional justification for studying the random permutation model, as the current practical motivation seems unconvincing. Elaborating on the challenges and interesting aspects of this setting for the learner, and distinguishing it from existing work, such as [14], would be beneficial.
Regarding Section 3, it is unclear how Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 relate to the overall narrative and the results in Section 4. Are they essential or supplementary findings? Furthermore, the estimator in equation (3) appears computationally infeasible. Although Footnote 2 mentions that the result holds in expectation when sampling a single data point and permutation, this approach is likely to have high variance. The authors should comment on how the variance decreases when sampling multiple data points and permutations.
While the paper is generally clear, the presentation is often mathematically driven and could be simplified in certain sections, such as lines 149-157 and 242-250. Although there seem to be some gaps in the results, the authors have thoroughly explored various avenues, including sections 4.3-4.6, making several interesting contributions that could be useful for this line of research.
After reviewing the authors' rebuttal, I am persuaded by their argument for the setting and have accordingly upgraded my score.
