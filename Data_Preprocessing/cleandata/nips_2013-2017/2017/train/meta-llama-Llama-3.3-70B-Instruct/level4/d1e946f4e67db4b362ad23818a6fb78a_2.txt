This paper introduces a novel approach, referred to as MPMG, for solving the quadratic programming (QP) graph matching problem. The problem is formulated as an argmax optimization of \(x^T W x\), where \(W\) encodes both pair-to-pair and node-to-node affinities, and \(x\) represents the desired permutation matrix in vector form. The solution seeks a permutation that encodes the optimal matching, characterized by being doubly stochastic (with entries greater than or equal to 0 and rows/columns summing to 1) and discrete (entries being either 0 or 1). Traditional methods for solving this NP-hard QP problem involve relaxation, either of the doubly-stochastic constraint or the discrete constraint. In contrast, the proposed MPMG method employs the Lagrange multiplier technique, incorporating the doubly-stochastic constraint into the error term. This approach, accompanied by proofs of convergence and KKT-optimality, constitutes a novel contribution to the graph matching formulation. Experimentally, the method demonstrates convergence towards a sparse/discrete solution, even without explicit modeling of the constraint, which is a promising feature. However, concerns arise regarding the experimental details, potentially undermining the empirical claims.
The paper's reliance on iterative solutions, similar to other state-of-the-art techniques, necessitates a clear convergence criterion, particularly for experiments like Figure 1, where MPMG is initialized with RRWM. Ensuring the appropriate selection of the convergence criterion for RRWM in these problems would be beneficial. Furthermore, the initialization method appears to vary between experiments, with RRWM used for Figure 1 and SM for subsequent experiments. Clarification on how performance time is computed, including whether it encompasses the initialization procedure or only the subsequent MPMG iterations, would be helpful.
Additionally, since RRWM also requires initialization, and typically uses a uniform initialization as outlined in [3], the comparison between MPMG (which uses an established algorithm for initialization) and RRWM may not be entirely fair. More detailed explanation in the text could alleviate these concerns. Without proper handling and clarification of these points, it is challenging to derive meaningful conclusions from the experiments.
The determination of node-to-node affinities, represented by the diagonals of \(W\), is not described in the paper and should be addressed. Moreover, solving image feature point matching as a graph matching problem is not practical in real-world scenarios due to several factors, including the number of features, pair-to-pair affinities, and robustness to a large number of outliers. As the paper suggests, other practical labeling problems often utilize this QP formulation, and focusing on these could enhance the paper's value and impact.
