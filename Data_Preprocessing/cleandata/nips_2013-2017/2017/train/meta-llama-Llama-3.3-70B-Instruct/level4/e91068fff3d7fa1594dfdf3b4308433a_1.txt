This manuscript presents a novel gradient estimator for Variational Bayes, exhibiting zero variance when the variational distribution precisely matches the true distribution of latent variables. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it acceptable with some minor revisions.
To further enhance the analysis, it would be beneficial to investigate the scenario where the variational distribution diverges from the true distribution p(z|x). In such cases, the expectation of the score function becomes non-zero, introducing bias into the proposed estimator. A deeper examination of the potential adverse effects of this bias would be valuable.
Additionally, regarding the mixture ELBO on line 188, it appears that a variational distribution over Ï€c is missing. The definition of zc is not explicitly provided in the manuscript, raising questions about its selection in the variational mixture and the subsequent impact on reparameterization. Clarification on these aspects would be necessary to fully understand the proposed methodology.
