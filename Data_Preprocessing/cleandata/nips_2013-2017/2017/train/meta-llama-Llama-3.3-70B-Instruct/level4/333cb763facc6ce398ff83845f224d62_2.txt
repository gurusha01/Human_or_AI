This paper introduces a novel covariance function for multi-output Gaussian processes by specifying cross-power spectral densities and leveraging the inverse Fourier transform to derive the corresponding cross-covariances. Building upon the concept presented in [6] for single-output Gaussian processes, where a mixture of Gaussians represented the power spectral density to produce a kernel function with extrapolation capabilities, the authors extend this idea to multi-output scenarios. The proposed covariance function is applied to a synthetic data example and two real-world datasets: the weather dataset and the Swiss Jura dataset for metal concentrations.
The extension of the concept from [6] to develop new covariance functions for multiple outputs appears to be a promising approach. Given that one of the primary motivations in [6] was to create a kernel function capable of extrapolation, it would be intriguing to see if the proposed multi-output covariance function retains this ability. However, the experimental section is limited to commonly used datasets, yielding results comparable to those obtained with other multi-output covariance functions. To enhance the paper's impact, it would be beneficial to include experiments on datasets where existing models are insufficient.
Regarding the results presented in Tables 1 and 2, was statistical significance tested? Upon inspection, it appears that, within the standard deviation, the performance of almost all models is similar, suggesting that further analysis may be necessary to differentiate their effectiveness.
