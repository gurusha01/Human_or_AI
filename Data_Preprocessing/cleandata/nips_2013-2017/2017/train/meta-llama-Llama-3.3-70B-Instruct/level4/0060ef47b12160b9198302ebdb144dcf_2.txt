This manuscript proposes a neural network (NN) designed to identify the key regions of an image that are crucial for another NN's object categorization task. The paper is well-written and presents compelling experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness, outperforming prior works, particularly on challenging datasets using state-of-the-art NNs.
One potential improvement could be to provide a more detailed motivation for the need for real-time efficiency in specific applications. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include an in-depth analysis of the learned salient regions, offering insights into how certain object categories might leverage background biases to facilitate object recognition, such as which categories exhibit this behavior.
