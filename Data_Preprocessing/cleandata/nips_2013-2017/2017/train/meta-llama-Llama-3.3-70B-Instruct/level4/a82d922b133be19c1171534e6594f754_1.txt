As it is widely recognized, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) error can be computed efficiently for ridge regression, owing to the existence of efficient formulas that adjust the loss function value when a single sample point is removed. The authors introduce an approximate formula for LOOCV applicable to other models, building upon this concept.
This proposition appears to be novel, and its potential seems substantial.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, polished, and technically sound.
Upon review, no typos or minor errors were found, with the exception of:
- References: capitalizing the initial letters in "Bayesian" and ensuring all words in book and journal titles are capitalized is recommended.
