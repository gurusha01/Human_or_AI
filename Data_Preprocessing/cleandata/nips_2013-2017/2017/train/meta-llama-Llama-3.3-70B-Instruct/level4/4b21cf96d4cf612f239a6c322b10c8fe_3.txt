This manuscript introduces and evaluates two variants of a prior distribution on the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image captioning. Both variants utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the prior on the latent space, with one variant outperforming the other by encouraging clusters to represent objects within a given image, effectively generating images through a linear combination of samples from object-corresponding clusters.
Detailed comments:
* The manuscript is well-structured and appears to be thoroughly tested against existing benchmarks. Although the concept may be relatively straightforward and not entirely novel, the experimental results seem conclusive and yield state-of-the-art performance when compared to the online MSCOCO baseline dataset. However, it is notable that the Conditional GAN (CGAN) was not included in the benchmarking process, particularly given recent advancements in sentence generation using GAN models, such as the Gumbel-Softmax trick.
* Combining the GMM latent space model with a Determinantal Point Process (DPP) prior over cluster centers could be an interesting direction to explore, as it may further promote diversity in representation. Additionally, a hierarchical latent space could also be a worthwhile avenue to investigate. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that the performance of these models, especially on smaller datasets, is heavily reliant on how closely the implicit prior encoded by the choice of mapping and latent structure aligns with the true data-generating distribution. In this context, the AG-CVAE may be approaching optimality.
