The authors propose a hierarchical extension of probabilistic sequential decision diagrams (PSDDs) for modeling distributions over routes in discrete graphs, where binary random variables represent graph edges. A straightforward graphical model representation would result in high treewidth due to the functional dependence of valid loop-free paths on all edges. Although PSDDs efficiently represent distributions on structured binary spaces, they struggle to scale to realistic scenarios. To address this, the authors introduce a hierarchical approach, segmenting the problem into sub-problems and representing both the overall structure and sub-problems using separate PSDDs, thereby enabling scalability to real-world problems, such as routing in the financial district of San Francisco.
The authors' method relies on the special structure of simple path-finding to ensure tractability, leveraging properties like the simple-route limitation to reduce complexity from 2^|Bi| to |Bi|^2. Theoretical results, including Theorem 4 and Proposition 1, provide validation for the underlying assumptions, although their practical evaluation may be challenging for particularly difficult problems. The comparison to the Markov model may not be entirely fair, as it neglects destination information, and a more relevant comparison would be to established route-planning heuristics; however, the author's expertise in this area may be required to suggest suitable alternatives.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the paper is well-written, and the concept is sufficiently interesting to warrant general attention. Therefore, I recommend accepting the paper.
