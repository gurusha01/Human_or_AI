The authors present an approximation algorithm for k-mer based string kernels that accommodates mismatches, focusing on a closed-form expression for the intersection size of mismatching neighborhoods, which is then evaluated in the context of sequence classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Overall, this paper is commendable for its clear motivation, well-structured introduction, concise contribution, robust theoretical backing, and noteworthy experimental results.
However, there are several concerns regarding the presentation and structuring of the paper, as well as some doubts about the relevance and depth of the presented theory.
In terms of presentation, Section 3 is overly technical, cluttered with notation, and lacks intuitive explanations for key concepts. To improve clarity, it is suggested that some details be relocated to the appendix, allowing for a more elaborate discussion of high-level ideas.
Specifically, a table outlining relevant quantities and their explanations would facilitate understanding of Theorem 3.3 for readers unfamiliar with string kernels. An intuitive description of the theorem and its proof idea would also be beneficial.
Algorithm 1 is introduced without clear reference from the main text and appears sparse in annotation and explanation. For instance, parameter meanings and subroutine annotations are lacking. It is recommended that Algorithm 1 be central to Section 3, with the text providing a clear description of its high-level ideas.
Furthermore, it should be explicitly stated that Theorem 3.3 addresses the open combinatorial problem mentioned in the abstract. To enhance readability, the authors should provide more commentary on what their algorithm approximates, the parameters controlling approximation quality, and potential failure cases.
Theorem 3.13, a concentration inequality, should remain in the main text as it conveys the primary theoretical message. However, results related to the Chebyshev inequality (Theorem 3.11, Lemma 3.12, Lemma 3.14) could be moved to the appendix, with more elaboration on the implications of Theorem 3.13.
Regarding the theory, while Theorem 3.13 is a valuable initial step in understanding the algorithm's approximation quality and consistency, it is noted that the focus should be on the generalization error in downstream algorithms rather than kernel approximation itself. The substantial body of work in kernel method theory, such as that for Nystrom and Fourier Feature regression/classification, should be acknowledged or preferably established. A straightforward approach could involve perturbation analysis using the established kernel approximation error or directly controlling the error of the estimated decision boundary of the SVM.
In the experiments section, runtime checks for various 'm' values are suggested, along with an instructive synthetic example to illustrate when the algorithm fails. The claim that the algorithm enables previously impossible settings of (k,m) needs to be substantiated with examples demonstrating improved performance over the exact algorithm, or this statement should be removed.
Minor issues include the absence of axis units in Figure 1 and typos in lines 95 ("theset") and 204 ("Generating these kernels days;").
