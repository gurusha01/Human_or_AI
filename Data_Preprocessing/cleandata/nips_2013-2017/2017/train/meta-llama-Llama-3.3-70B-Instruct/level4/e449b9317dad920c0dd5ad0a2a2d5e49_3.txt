This paper presents a significant and timely contribution to the field of automated signal detection in calcium imaging of neurons, introducing a novel methodology that leverages a well-defined noise model and robust statistical techniques. Given the growing interest in calcium imaging experiments, there is a pressing need for powerful analytical methods to elucidate the correlation between neuronal firing patterns, and this work represents a substantial advancement in this area.
The employment of a robust location estimator is a prudent approach, particularly in light of the considerable signal and noise variability, as well as the pronounced presence of outliers in the neuropil. It is noteworthy that previous methods have overlooked this aspect, making the authors' decision to utilize this estimator a welcome development.
The proposed noise model, which posits a superposition of positive sources and a lower-amplitude normal component, is an intriguing concept that enhances the statistical power of the analysis. However, to improve readability, it would be beneficial to explicitly label these components in Equation (2).
The authors provide a rigorous argument for the convergence rate of their algorithm, demonstrating a rapid rate of convergence. Furthermore, they present a compelling comparison of their EXTRACT algorithm with two alternative approaches using manually labeled microendoscopic single-photon imaging data, showcasing superior performance. While this section is well-executed, with Figure 4 being a notable highlight, it could be further strengthened by providing more explicit performance statistics.
In conclusion, this is an outstanding paper that addresses a timely and important topic. The availability of the code and guidance on its potential deployment would be a valuable addition, further enhancing the paper's impact.
