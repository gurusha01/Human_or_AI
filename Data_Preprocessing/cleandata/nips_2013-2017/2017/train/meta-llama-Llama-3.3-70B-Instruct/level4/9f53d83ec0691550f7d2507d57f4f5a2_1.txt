Review- Summary:
This paper introduces the TranSync algorithm as a solution to the 1D translation synchronization problem, distinguishing itself by utilizing truncated least squares to mitigate the impact of noisy measurements. A theoretical framework is provided to analyze the algorithm's performance, and its effectiveness is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real data.
Qualitative:
The paper is clearly and concisely written, making it easy to follow. The theoretical foundations are introduced in a straightforward manner, with detailed proofs relegated to supplementary materials. The methodology is extensively tested through a variety of experiments, demonstrating its robustness. However, including a brief overview of the key proof concepts within the main text would enhance the exposition. Overall, the work presented is commendable and shows promise.
