This paper explores an "intermediate case" between two domain parameterizations, specifically the conic hull of a potentially infinite atom set, differing from greedy optimization methods like matching pursuit and Frank-Wolfe algorithms over the linear span and convex hull. The authors provide explicit convergence rates for non-negative matching pursuit (MP) algorithms and address the limitation of existing MP methods when the optimization domain is a cone, proposing modified non-negative MP variants and corresponding convergence guarantees. Three algorithms are presented, and it would be beneficial to investigate which algorithm is preferred under specific conditions, allowing participants to apply the most suitable method to their problems.
The authors note that selecting a suitable value for tau is crucial, as a small value may fail to recover an optimal solution, while a large value can lead to slow convergence. However, it is unclear whether a large tau is preferred for convergence guarantees, regardless of time complexity. The experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms, conducted on three problems, lacks detailed discussion and analysis of the results. A more thorough examination of the experimental settings and outcomes would be valuable, and considering computational time as an evaluation criterion could provide additional insights into comparing different methods and their variants.
