This paper examines an efficient approximation method for the "mismatch string kernel" introduced by Leslie et al. [17], which calculates the kernel distance between two strings based on the number of matches between k-mers with up to m mismatches. Due to the high computational complexity of the original algorithm, the authors propose an approximation technique.
The approach is divided into two key components: (1) calculating the size of the m-mismatch neighbourhoods of two k-mers, and (2) determining the number of k-mer pairs within a Hamming distance of d. To address the first problem, the authors suggest precomputing all m-mismatch neighbours using an algorithm with a time complexity of O(m^3). For the second problem, they employ locality sensitive hashing. The proposed algorithm includes probabilistic guarantees on the solution quality and analytical bounds on its execution time.
Through computational experiments utilizing both simulated and real-world data, the proposed algorithm demonstrates a close approximation to exact computations and significantly improved performance, particularly for large values of m. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the proposed algorithm presented in a step-by-step manner accompanied by essential proofs.
MINOR COMMENTS
As acknowledged by the authors, the proposed bound (Theorem 3.13) is relatively loose. Is it challenging to tighten this bound?
Some sentences in Section 4 appear to be incomplete, which may require revision for clarity.
