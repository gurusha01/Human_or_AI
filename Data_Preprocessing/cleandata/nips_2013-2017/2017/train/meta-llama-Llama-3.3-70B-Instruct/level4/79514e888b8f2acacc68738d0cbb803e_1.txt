This study builds upon and enhances the effectiveness of GAN-based methods for semi-supervised learning, as previously investigated in "Improved techniques for training gans" (Salimans 2016) and "Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning with categorical generative adversarial networks" (Springenberg 2015). 
The authors propose the concept of a complement generator, which aims to sample from low-density regions of the data distribution in feature space, and explore various objective terms inspired by this analysis. However, due to the challenges of estimating quantities such as density and entropy, the paper relies on approximations to achieve the desired objective.
The paper presents an informative case study on synthetic data, as well as a comprehensive set of experiments on standardized semi-supervised benchmarks, including ablation studies on the proposed terms. The empirical results demonstrate a substantial improvement over the Feature Matching criteria introduced in "Improved techniques for training gans".
The inclusion of ablation studies is a valuable contribution, and it is commendable that the authors have provided some insights into the effectiveness of each term. Nevertheless, the studies could be more exhaustive. For example, it is unclear why SVHN is evaluated with five experiments, while MNIST and CIFAR-10 are evaluated with only two and three experiments, respectively. Additionally, the Approximate Entropy Maximization terms are only tested on SVHN, leaving questions about their performance on CIFAR-10. The authors could provide further clarification on why a more comprehensive comparison was not conducted.
The benefits of the proposed terms are not consistently observed across datasets, and while the text touches on this issue, a more in-depth examination through completed ablation studies would be beneficial for researchers seeking to build upon or improve the ideas presented in this paper.
