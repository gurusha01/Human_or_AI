This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, PointNet++, for processing point sets sampled in a metric space. The key idea is to apply PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set, allowing the network to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. The authors also introduce two novel set abstraction layers, multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), to adaptively combine features from multiple scales and handle non-uniform point sampling.
The paper is well-written, and the math is easy to follow. The experiments demonstrate that PointNet++ achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds, including object classification and semantic scene labeling. The results show that PointNet++ is robust to sampling density variation and can handle non-uniformly sampled point sets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a hierarchical neural network architecture that can learn local features with increasing contextual scales.
* The proposal of two novel set abstraction layers that can adaptively combine features from multiple scales and handle non-uniform point sampling.
* The demonstration of state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The motivation for the local detail recovery ability of PointNet++ is not strongly supported by the results.
* The paper could benefit from more analysis on the computational efficiency of the proposed architecture, especially for MSG and MRG layers.
Overall, I recommend this paper for acceptance due to its clear experiments and state-of-the-art results on benchmarks. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning on point sets and has the potential to impact various applications, including 3D object recognition, scene understanding, and robotics.
