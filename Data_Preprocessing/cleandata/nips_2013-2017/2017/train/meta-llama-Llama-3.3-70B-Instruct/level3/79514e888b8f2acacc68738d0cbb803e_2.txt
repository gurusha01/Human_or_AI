This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, specifically a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). The authors introduce a new distance metric, the Wasserstein distance, to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes. The WGAN framework is used to learn a generative model that can produce synthetic point processes that are similar to the real ones.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough introduction to point processes and their applications, as well as a detailed explanation of the WGAN framework and its advantages over traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling various types of point processes, including inhomogeneous Poisson processes, self-exciting processes, and self-correcting processes. The results show that the WGAN approach outperforms traditional MLE methods, especially when the underlying generative process is unknown or misspecified.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to modeling point processes using a WGAN framework
* The introduction of a new distance metric, the Wasserstein distance, to measure the difference between real and generated point processes
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling various types of point processes
* The comparison with traditional MLE methods and the demonstration of the advantages of the WGAN approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear explanation of how the WGAN framework is implemented in practice, including the choice of hyperparameters and the training procedure
* The limited evaluation of the proposed approach, including the use of only two evaluation metrics (QQ plot and intensity deviation)
* The lack of a detailed analysis of the results, including the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but further evaluation and analysis are needed to fully understand its strengths and weaknesses.
