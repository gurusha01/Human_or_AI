This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling multiple-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by designing a positive-definite matrix of complex-valued spectral densities and transforming them via the inverse Fourier transform according to Cram√©r's Theorem. The resulting Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel provides a clear interpretation from a spectral viewpoint, where each of its parameters can be identified with frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay for a pair of channels.
The paper is well-written, with clear methodology and summaries of theoretical results, making it accessible to practitioners despite complex proofs. The theoretical results are impressive, providing guarantees for the proposed method, which is an extension of the "Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests" method. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data showcase the potential of the MOSM kernel for causal inference applications.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to model rich relationships across multiple outputs, its clear interpretation from a spectral viewpoint, and its competitive performance on real-world datasets. However, there are some weaknesses, such as the lack of a discrete analog and sensitivity to classification methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from improvements to its structure and clarity, such as removing redundant sections and typos.
