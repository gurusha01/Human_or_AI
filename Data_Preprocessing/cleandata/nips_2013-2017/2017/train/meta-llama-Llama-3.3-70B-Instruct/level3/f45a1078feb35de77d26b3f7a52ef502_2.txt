This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating point processes using the Wasserstein-GAN (WGAN) framework. The authors' contribution is significant, as they provide a specific method for addressing the challenges of defining a distance between point process realizations, a family of Lipschitz functions, and a generative model. The adaptation of WGAN to point process estimation is a novel contribution, offering interesting insights into implementing the Lipschitz constraint.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach. The use of WGAN for point process estimation is a promising direction, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through favorable comparisons to maximum likelihood approaches. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the potential benefits of the proposed approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a new perspective on point process estimation. The authors' use of WGAN offers a fresh approach to this problem, and their results demonstrate the potential of this method. The paper is also well-written, making it easy to follow and understand the authors' arguments.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the modeling of the generator function, specifically how it ensures that the generated sequence is increasing. Additionally, the authors could clarify whether the algorithm relies on the discriminator to encourage this property. Providing more experimental results and comparisons to other methods would also strengthen the paper.
