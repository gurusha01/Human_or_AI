This paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE), which aims to preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity in a network. The authors introduce a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings, and provide a theoretical analysis of the approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.
* The introduction of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings.
* The provision of a theoretical analysis of the approach, including the connection between the proposed proximity objective function and community detection.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The paper builds on existing work, and the novelty of the approach is relatively thin, with only two main improvements: a double sampling strategy and new generalization bounds.
* The prediction time of PRUNE is long compared to other approaches, which may be a limitation in practice.
* The generalization bound presented in the paper is unclear and lacks comparison with other approaches.
* The experimental comparison involves both batch and online learning algorithms, which have different memory usage requirements.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks.
* The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approach, including the connection between the proposed proximity objective function and community detection.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The novelty of the approach is relatively thin, with only two main improvements: a double sampling strategy and new generalization bounds.
* The prediction time of PRUNE is long compared to other approaches.
* The generalization bound presented in the paper is unclear and lacks comparison with other approaches.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel approach to network embedding and demonstrates its effectiveness in various tasks. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the clarity of the generalization bound and the comparison with other approaches.
