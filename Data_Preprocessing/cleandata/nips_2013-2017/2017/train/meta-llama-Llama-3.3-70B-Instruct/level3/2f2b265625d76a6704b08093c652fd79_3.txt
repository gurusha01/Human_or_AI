This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN architecture consists of a lower hierarchical layer with multiple RNN cells that update their hidden states multiple times per time step, and a higher hierarchical layer with a single RNN cell that updates its hidden state only once per time step. The authors evaluate the FS-RNN on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, and achieve state-of-the-art results.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and architecture of the FS-RNN. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics and show that the FS-RNN is able to learn long-term dependencies and adapt quickly to unexpected inputs. The experimental results are impressive, with the FS-RNN outperforming other RNN architectures and even surpassing the performance of the best known text compression algorithm on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem of processing sequential data and motivate the need for a new RNN architecture. The related work section is thorough and provides a good overview of existing RNN architectures. The experimental results are well-presented and easy to follow.
However, there are some potential weaknesses to the paper. One concern is that the FS-RNN architecture may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of RNN cells in the lower hierarchical layer and the frequency of updates. The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the sensitivity of the FS-RNN to these hyperparameters, which could be an important consideration for practitioners.
Another potential weakness is that the FS-RNN architecture may not be suitable for all types of sequential data. The authors evaluate the FS-RNN on character-level language modeling datasets, but it is not clear how well the architecture would perform on other types of data, such as speech or image sequences.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and thorough introduction to the FS-RNN architecture. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a good analysis of the network dynamics. However, there are some potential weaknesses to the paper, including the sensitivity of the FS-RNN to hyperparameters and the limited evaluation on a single type of sequential data.
