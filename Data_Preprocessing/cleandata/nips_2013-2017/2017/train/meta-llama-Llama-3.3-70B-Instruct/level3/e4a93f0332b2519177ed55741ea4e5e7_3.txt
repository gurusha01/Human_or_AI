This paper introduces a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture called the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The authors propose a hierarchical architecture consisting of a lower layer with multiple RNN cells (Fast cells) and a higher layer with a single RNN cell (Slow cell). The Fast cells update their hidden states multiple times per time step, while the Slow cell updates its hidden state only once per time step. This architecture allows the model to learn complex transition functions from one time step to the next and capture long-term dependencies efficiently.
The paper presents extensive experiments on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, where the FS-RNN achieves state-of-the-art results. The authors also provide an empirical analysis of the network dynamics, which shows that the FS-RNN combines the benefits of deep transition RNNs and multiscale RNNs. The Slow cell enables the network to learn long-term dependencies, while the Fast cells enable the network to quickly adapt to unexpected inputs and learn complex transition functions.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a novel RNN architecture that combines the strengths of multiscale and deep transition RNNs
* Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture
* A thorough analysis of the network dynamics, which provides insights into the behavior of the FS-RNN
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The paper does not compare the FS-RNN with other recent state-of-the-art systems, such as Tree-LSTM, which captures hierarchical long-term dependencies
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the FS-RNN architecture
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the FS-RNN architecture beyond language modeling
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of RNNs and language modeling. The proposed FS-RNN architecture is a promising approach that combines the strengths of multiscale and deep transition RNNs, and the extensive experiments and analysis provide strong evidence for its effectiveness.
