This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that learns binary codes for image retrieval by leveraging both pairwise label information and classification information within a single stream framework. The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a loss function that incorporates both pairwise similarity and label information, allowing for the direct optimization of binary hash codes. The authors also propose an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, which is essential for handling the discrete nature of the hash codes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of hashing for image retrieval. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a good overview of existing hashing methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed description of the loss function and the optimization procedure.
The experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including traditional hashing methods and deep learning-based approaches. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other methods and an evaluation of the impact of different parameters on the performance of the proposed method.
One potential limitation of the paper is the lack of comparison with other recent works, such as the method proposed by K. Lin et al. A comparison with this work would be interesting and beneficial, as it would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method. Additionally, the authors could explore the use of alternative approaches, such as using a softmax classifier instead of a linear one, to further improve the performance of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and effective. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval and hashing.
