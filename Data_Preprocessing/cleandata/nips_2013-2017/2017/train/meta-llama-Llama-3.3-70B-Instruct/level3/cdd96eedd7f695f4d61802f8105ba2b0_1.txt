This paper proposes an unsupervised network embedding learning framework, called PRUNE, which preserves both global node ranking and local proximity of nodes. The framework is based on a multi-task Siamese neural network structure and a carefully designed objective function that connects node embedding with link prediction and community detection. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function, including its connection to PageRank and community detection.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed framework and its components. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the related work, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of existing network embedding methods. The experimental evaluation is thorough, with results on three real-world datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of PRUNE in learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated objective function that connects node embedding with link prediction and community detection
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function, including its connection to PageRank and community detection
* Strong experimental results on three real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks
* A clear and well-organized presentation, with easy-to-follow explanations of the proposed framework and its components
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Some sections, such as the part on maximizing modularity, seem irrelevant to the main framework and could be removed or condensed
* The paper prioritizes theoretical derivations over experiments, with some trivial lemmas that could be omitted or concisely written
* The incorporation of node ranking information into the framework is considered straightforward and could be improved with additional baselines, such as GCN
* The writing could be improved, particularly in the experiment section, where results under different evaluation metrics should be listed separately
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of network embedding. The proposed framework, PRUNE, is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in various tasks. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
