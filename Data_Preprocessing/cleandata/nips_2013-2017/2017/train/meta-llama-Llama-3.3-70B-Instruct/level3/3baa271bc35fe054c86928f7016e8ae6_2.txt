This paper proposes a two-stage procedure for robust submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint k. The first stage uses a robust streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which makes one pass over the data and retains a small set S of elements in memory. The second stage uses a simple greedy algorithm, STAR-T-GREEDY, which runs on the remaining elements after any set E of size at most m is removed from S. The authors prove that STAR-T-GREEDY achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee for robust submodular function maximization.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear motivation for the problem, a detailed description of the algorithm, and a thorough analysis of its performance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two different data summarization tasks: influence maximization and personalized movie recommendation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel robust submodular streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee for robust submodular function maximization.
* The use of a simple greedy algorithm, STAR-T-GREEDY, in the second stage, which makes the approach efficient and scalable.
* The provision of theoretical bounds on the performance of the algorithm, which provides a guarantee on its effectiveness.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the algorithm in two different data summarization tasks, which shows its practical applicability.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The experimental results are not very expressive, as the STAR-T-GREEDY algorithm does not always outperform the Sieve-Streaming algorithm.
* The paper's objective function for influence maximization differs from the function in a referred article, which raises questions about the performance of STAR-T on the spread model.
* The algorithm has two hyperparameters, τ and w, which need to be tuned, and the authors provide a method to approximate τ, but the choice of w is not well-motivated.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization and provides a novel approach to robust submodular maximization. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the theoretical bounds provide a guarantee on its performance. However, the paper could be improved by providing more expressive experimental results and a clearer motivation for the choice of hyperparameters.
