This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN consists of multiple fast RNN cells and one slow RNN cell that interact to update the state of the faster cells, allowing it to store long-term dependencies and adapt to input changes. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, with the lowest character-based perplexity compared to similar-sized architectures.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed architecture and its components. The analysis of the model's performance and the comparison with other RNN architectures are thorough and insightful, providing a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the FS-RNN. The empirical investigation of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN is also well-done, providing evidence that the Slow cell enables the network to learn long-term dependencies, while the Fast cells enable the network to quickly adapt to unexpected inputs and learn complex transition functions.
The paper's contributions are significant, as it improves state-of-the-art results on character-level language modeling and provides a general framework for connecting RNN cells, allowing for flexibility in applying the architecture to different tasks. The use of LSTM cells as building blocks for the FS-RNN architecture is well-justified, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in learning long-term dependencies and adapting to input changes.
However, there is a minor error in Figure 1, where the notation should possibly be corrected to h{t-1}^{Fk}. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the FS-RNN architecture and potential avenues for future research.
Overall, the paper is of high quality, and the proposed FS-RNN architecture is a significant contribution to the field of RNNs. The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise writing, thorough analysis, and significant contributions to the field. The weaknesses are minor and do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
