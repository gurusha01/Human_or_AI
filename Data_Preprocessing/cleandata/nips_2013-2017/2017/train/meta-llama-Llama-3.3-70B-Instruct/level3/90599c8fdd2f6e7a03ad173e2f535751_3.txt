This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which leverages the Wasserstein distance to learn the underlying distribution of the point process. The authors extend the traditional GAN framework to accommodate point processes and introduce a new distance metric, which is based on the optimal transport problem. The proposed method, called WGANTPP, does not require prior knowledge of the underlying generative process and can estimate it accurately across a wide range of theoretical and real-world processes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, the loss function, and the training procedure.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling various types of point processes, including inhomogeneous Poisson processes, self-exciting processes, and self-correcting processes. The authors also evaluate the performance of WGANTPP on several real-world datasets, including healthcare, public media, scientific activities, and stock exchange data. The results show that WGANTPP outperforms other methods, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and neural network-based approaches, in terms of recovering the underlying intensity function and capturing the dependency between events.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a GAN framework, which leverages the Wasserstein distance to learn the underlying distribution of the point process.
* The introduction of a new distance metric, which is based on the optimal transport problem, to measure the difference between the generated and real point processes.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling various types of point processes and its superiority over other methods in terms of recovering the underlying intensity function and capturing the dependency between events.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear explanation of the limitations of the proposed method and the potential challenges in applying it to more complex point processes.
* The need for further exploration of the connection between the WGAN and the optimal transport problem, as well as the investigation of other possible distance metrics over the realizations of point processes.
* The limited evaluation of the proposed method on a small number of real-world datasets, which may not be representative of the broader range of applications.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of point process modeling and has the potential to impact various applications, including healthcare, finance, and social network analysis. However, further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations of the proposed method.
