This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that learns model parameters using a loss based on pairwise similarities and class separability under a linear model. The key novelty of this approach is that it handles binary embedding directly during learning, which is rarely investigated in deep hashing algorithms. The proposed method achieves better results than multiple baselines across two datasets, including CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE, and includes a comprehensive analysis of different options.
The strengths of this paper include its clear writing, well-organized structure, and thorough experimental evaluation. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method and its variants, which helps to understand the effectiveness of the approach. The use of both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework is a significant contribution. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods, including traditional hashing methods and deep hashing methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations of the proposed approach. The optimization method used in this paper may not be entirely novel, as similar methods have been proposed before. The addition of a linear classification component to the loss function is a key difference, but it may not be sufficient to justify the claim of novelty. Furthermore, the overall approach appears complex and potentially slow to train, which may limit its applicability in practice. The exact training time is not reported, which makes it difficult to assess the computational efficiency of the method.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is moderate, as the proposed approach builds upon existing deep hashing methods and optimization techniques. However, the combination of pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework is a novel contribution. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the differences between their approach and existing methods.
The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in image retrieval and provides a novel solution that outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results are important, and other researchers and practitioners are likely to use these ideas or build upon them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way and provides unique insights into the use of deep hashing methods for image retrieval.
