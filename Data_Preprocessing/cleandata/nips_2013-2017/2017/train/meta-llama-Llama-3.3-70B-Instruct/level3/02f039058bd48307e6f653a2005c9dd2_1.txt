This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) using a spectral mixture kernel, which provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between different channels from a spectral viewpoint. The authors develop a family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities and use Cram√©r's theorem to construct a positive-definite matrix of covariance functions. The resulting kernel, called the Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel, can model delays and phase differences between channels, making it more expressive than previous methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOSM kernel in modeling complex relationships between multiple outputs, and the comparison with existing MOGP models shows that the proposed model performs competitively in terms of mean absolute error.
One of the strengths of the paper is the clear interpretation of the kernel parameters, which can be identified with frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay for a pair of channels. This provides a useful tool for understanding and analyzing the relationships between different channels. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of existing MOGP models and their limitations, which helps to motivate the need for a new approach.
However, there are some potential limitations and areas for future research. For example, the paper assumes that the spectral densities are complex-valued, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the authors note that the MOSM kernel can be computationally expensive to evaluate, which may limit its applicability to large datasets. Further research is needed to develop sparse implementations of the MOSM kernel and to explore its application to other domains.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
