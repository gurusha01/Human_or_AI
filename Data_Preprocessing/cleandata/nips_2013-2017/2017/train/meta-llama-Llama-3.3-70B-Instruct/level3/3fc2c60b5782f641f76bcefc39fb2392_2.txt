This paper proposes a novel two-stage procedure for robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting. The authors introduce a streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which makes one pass over the data and retains a small set of elements in memory. The algorithm is designed to be robust against the removal of a prespecified number of elements, and the authors provide a theoretical guarantee on the performance of the algorithm.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the algorithm and its analysis. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments on two different data summarization tasks.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the robust submodular function maximization problem. The authors achieve this by introducing a novel partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule, which allows them to balance the trade-off between the size of the summary and its robustness.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the submodular function is monotone and normalized, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the algorithm requires knowledge of the optimal solution value, which may not be available in advance. The authors address this issue by proposing a parallel variant of the algorithm that can approximate the optimal solution value, but this increases the space complexity of the algorithm.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization by introducing a novel algorithm for robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a robust and efficient solution to the submodular function maximization problem in a streaming setting. The algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including data summarization, influence maximization, and personalized recommendation.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization, and the authors provide a thorough analysis and demonstration of the effectiveness of their approach.
