This paper proposes a novel robust submodular streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which addresses the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint in a streaming setting with potential removals of elements. The algorithm is based on a partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule, allowing it to make one pass over the data and retain a small but robust summary.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through two numerical studies, showing that it compares favorably against the SIEVE-STREAMING algorithm, even when the latter is allowed to know in advance which elements will be removed.
The strengths of the paper include its novel algorithmic approach, its ability to handle robustness in a streaming setting, and its strong theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The definition section could be improved to make it more accessible to readers unfamiliar with differential geometrical notions. Additionally, some equations and definitions could be more clearly explained, and the notation could be more consistent throughout the paper.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques from submodular optimization and streaming algorithms, and its approach to robustness in a streaming setting is unique. The paper also provides a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses a challenging problem in a large-scale machine learning setting.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a robust and efficient solution to a complex problem, which has many potential applications in machine learning and data science. The paper's results are likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners working in these fields, and its approach could be applied to a wide range of problems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization and streaming algorithms. However, I would suggest that the authors address some of the minor issues mentioned above, such as improving the definition section and providing more clear explanations of some equations and definitions.
