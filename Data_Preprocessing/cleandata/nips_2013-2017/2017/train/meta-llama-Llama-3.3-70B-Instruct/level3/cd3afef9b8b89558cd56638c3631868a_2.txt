This paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of the limitations of gradient descent-based optimization methods when used in conjunction with smooth kernels. The authors demonstrate that the computational reach of gradient descent is limited to very smooth functions, and that a large number of iterations are required to approximate functions with less smoothness. This limitation is purely algorithmic and persists even in the limit of infinite data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EigenPro iteration method in improving the convergence of gradient descent.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise explanation of the limitations of gradient descent-based optimization methods
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the computational reach of gradient descent
* The proposal of a novel EigenPro iteration method that improves the convergence of gradient descent
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in machine learning and optimization, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* The experimental results are limited to a few datasets, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments on a wider range of datasets
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other optimization methods, such as second-order methods and hybrid approaches
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on the following criteria:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the explanation of the results is clear and concise.
* Originality: The paper presents a novel contribution to the understanding of the limitations of gradient descent-based optimization methods and proposes a new EigenPro iteration method.

Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field, and the results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
