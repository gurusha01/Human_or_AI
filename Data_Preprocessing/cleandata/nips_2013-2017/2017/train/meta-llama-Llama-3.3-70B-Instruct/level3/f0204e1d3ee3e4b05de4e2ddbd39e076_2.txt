This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The authors introduce a novel notion of separability for loss functions, which allows them to derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They apply this framework to both generative and discriminative models, providing insights into their nuanced behaviors in high dimensions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed analysis of the separability of loss functions. The theoretical results are supported by experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel notion of separability for loss functions, which provides a new perspective on the convergence rates of M-estimators.
* The application of this framework to both generative and discriminative models, providing a comprehensive analysis of their convergence rates in high dimensions.
* The provision of experiments to support the theoretical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a high level of technical expertise in statistical machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions of the paper.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of statistical machine learning, providing new insights into the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high dimensions. The introduction of the separability notion for loss functions is a particularly noteworthy contribution, as it provides a new perspective on the convergence rates of M-estimators.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of statistical machine learning.
