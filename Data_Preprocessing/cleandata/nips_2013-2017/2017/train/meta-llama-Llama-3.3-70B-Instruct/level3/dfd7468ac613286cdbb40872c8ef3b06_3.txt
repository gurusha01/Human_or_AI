This paper presents a thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, specifically focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used before and after 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under two protocols: trickle (pre-2015) and diffusion (post-2015). The paper's main contributions are threefold: modeling the Bitcoin P2P network and an eavesdropper adversary, analyzing the probability of deanonymization under trickle and diffusion propagation, and evaluating the performance of various source estimators.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical analysis is sound, and the authors provide rigorous proofs for their results. The paper also includes simulations to validate the theoretical results, which adds to the paper's credibility.
One of the strengths of the paper is its thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's transaction-flooding protocols. The authors provide a detailed comparison of the performance of various source estimators under different protocols, which sheds light on the limitations of these protocols in terms of anonymity. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the graph structure of the network when designing anonymity protocols.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the paper assumes a regular tree-structured network, which may not accurately represent the real Bitcoin network topology. While the authors validate their results on a 2015 snapshot of the Bitcoin network, it would be interesting to see how their results generalize to more realistic network topologies. Secondly, the paper focuses primarily on the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator, and it would be useful to explore other estimators and their performance under different protocols.
