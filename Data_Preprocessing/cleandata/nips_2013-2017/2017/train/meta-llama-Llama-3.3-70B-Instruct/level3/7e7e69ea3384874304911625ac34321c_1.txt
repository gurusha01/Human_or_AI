This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The authors introduce a notion of separability of loss functions, which allows them to derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They then instantiate their results for both generative and discriminative models, providing insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the authors provide a unified framework for analyzing both generative and discriminative models, which is a significant contribution to the field. Secondly, their results provide new insights into the convergence rates of these models in high-dimensional settings, which is an important area of research. Finally, the authors provide experimental results that validate their theoretical findings, demonstrating the practical relevance of their work.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. Firstly, the writing is sometimes unclear, and the notation can be confusing. For example, the definition of separability is not immediately clear, and the reader has to carefully follow the notation to understand the concept. Secondly, the paper could benefit from more detailed discussions of the relation to existing approaches, as the authors' framework is not entirely new. Finally, the experimental results are limited to a specific setting, and it would be interesting to see how the authors' framework performs in other settings.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, although the writing could be improved. The originality of the paper is somewhat limited, as the authors build on existing work, but their framework is novel and provides new insights. The significance of the paper is high, as it provides a unified framework for analyzing generative and discriminative models, which is an important area of research.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper as a poster, as it provides a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to stimulate interesting discussions. However, the authors should be encouraged to polish their writing and provide more detailed discussions of the relation to existing approaches.
