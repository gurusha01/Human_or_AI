This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval. The main idea is to learn binary codes that preserve the similarity relationship and keep the label consistent simultaneously. The algorithm uses both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework. The authors constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly and derive an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear introduction to the background and motivation of the work, and the related work is well-discussed. The proposed algorithm is well-explained, and the experiments are extensive and convincing. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark image retrieval datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and effective, and the results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and the experiments.
* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the learned binary codes should be ideal for classification, which may not always be the case.
* The algorithm requires a large amount of training data to learn the hash function, which may not be feasible in some cases.
* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm.
Overall, the paper is well-written and the proposed algorithm is effective. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark image retrieval datasets. However, the paper could be improved by providing a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and discussing the limitations of the algorithm.
