This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, PointNet++, for processing point sets sampled in a metric space. The key idea is to recursively apply PointNet on a nested partitioning of the input point set, allowing the network to learn hierarchical features with respect to the distance metric. The authors also introduce two novel set abstraction layers, multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), to handle non-uniform point sampling issues.
The paper is well-written and clearly presented, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of the PointNet++ architecture and its components, including the set abstraction layers and the feature propagation strategy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PointNet++ on various benchmarks, including 3D point cloud classification and semantic scene labeling.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel neural network architecture that can effectively process point sets sampled in a metric space.
* The proposal of two novel set abstraction layers that can handle non-uniform point sampling issues.
* The thorough experimental evaluation of PointNet++ on various benchmarks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational cost of the MSG and MRG layers, which may limit the scalability of PointNet++ to large-scale point clouds.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods on some benchmarks.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning on point sets and has the potential to impact various applications, including 3D computer vision and robotics.
