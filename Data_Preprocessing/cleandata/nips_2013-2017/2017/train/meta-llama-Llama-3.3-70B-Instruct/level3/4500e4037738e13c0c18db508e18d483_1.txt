This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of kernel methods on large datasets by introducing a preconditioning scheme called EigenPro. The authors identify a fundamental limitation in using gradient descent-based methods with smooth kernels, which leads to slow convergence and over-regularization. They demonstrate that the proposed EigenPro iteration can alleviate this issue by modifying the spectrum of the kernel matrix, allowing for faster convergence and improved accuracy.
The paper is well-structured and well-written, with a clear introduction to the problem and a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels and demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro through extensive experiments on various datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution
* A thorough analysis of the limitations of gradient descent with smooth kernels
* A well-designed and effective preconditioning scheme (EigenPro) that can be used with various kernel methods
* Extensive experiments on various datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of EigenPro
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in kernel methods and optimization techniques, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* The authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between EigenPro and other related work in the field
* Some of the experimental results could be improved with more detailed analysis and discussion
