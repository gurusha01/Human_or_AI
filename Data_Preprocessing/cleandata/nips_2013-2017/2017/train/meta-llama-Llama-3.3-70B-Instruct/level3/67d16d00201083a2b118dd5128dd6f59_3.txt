This paper presents a method for constructing deterministic feature maps for kernel machines, which can be used to approximate kernel functions. The authors propose several techniques for constructing these feature maps, including polynomially-exact quadrature, dense grid construction, sparse grid construction, and reweighted grid construction. The paper demonstrates that these deterministic feature maps can achieve better scaling in the desired accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art method, random Fourier features.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the ideas and techniques presented. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the methods and demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on real-world datasets, including MNIST and TIMIT. The results show that the deterministic feature maps can produce comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art methods based on random Fourier features.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed methods, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The experiments are also well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is that the paper does not provide a clear comparison to other related work in the field. While the authors mention some related work, they do not provide a thorough analysis of how their methods compare to others. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed methods.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the ideas and techniques presented.
