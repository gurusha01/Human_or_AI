This paper proposes a novel methodology for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The approach is based on a finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporates external information that may trigger early arrival at the clinician. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their policy using a large breast cancer dataset and show that it reduces the number of screenings while maintaining the same delay in detection.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem formulation, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work in the field and highlight the limitations of existing approaches. The use of a real-world dataset to evaluate the policy is a significant strength of the paper.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to handle arbitrary finite state stochastic processes, which makes it more general and applicable to a wider range of diseases. The incorporation of external information, such as self-examination or discovery of co-morbidities, is also a significant contribution.
The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed policy reducing the number of screenings by 28-68% while maintaining the same delay in detection. The comparison with existing clinical policies is also useful in demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the model parameters are known, which may not always be the case in practice. The estimation of model parameters using observational data is an important aspect of the approach, and the authors provide some discussion on this topic. However, more work is needed to fully address the issue of model parameter estimation.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed approach. While the authors provide some analysis of the computational complexity, more details would be helpful in understanding the scalability of the approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a real-world dataset. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the limitations of existing approaches. With some additional work on model parameter estimation and computational complexity, the approach has the potential to be widely adopted in practice.
