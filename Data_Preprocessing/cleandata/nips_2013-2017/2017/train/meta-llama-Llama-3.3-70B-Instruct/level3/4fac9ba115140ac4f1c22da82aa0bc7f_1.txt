This paper proposes a novel technique for learning a gradient boosted regression tree ensemble that is sensitive to feature costs and evaluation costs. The key differences from existing work include input-specific costs and a unique optimization approach. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of their methodology and experiments.
The contribution of the paper seems small compared to existing work, and the experiments, although sufficient, may require additional clarification on cost measurement. The technical aspects of the paper are mostly sound, but there are concerns about the fairness of cost comparisons between methods and the need for more detailed visualizations of the trees generated by the proposed method.
To improve the paper, the authors could emphasize the improvements over existing methods, such as GreedyMiser, and provide more insight into why the proposed method outperforms others. Additionally, there are several low-level technical issues, including questions about equation notation, figure labeling, and variable definitions, that need to be addressed for clarity and accuracy.
The paper has potential for practitioners interested in classification in time-constrained settings, but it falls slightly below the acceptance threshold due to unresolved confusions about cost measurement and definition. The authors should address these concerns and provide more detailed explanations and visualizations to support their claims.
