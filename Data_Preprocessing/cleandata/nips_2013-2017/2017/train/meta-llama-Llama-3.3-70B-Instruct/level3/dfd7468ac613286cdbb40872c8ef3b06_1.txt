This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, focusing on the transition from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading in 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and consider an eavesdropper adversary that observes the timestamps of messages relayed by each node. They analyze the probability of deanonymization under both trickle and diffusion protocols, using a combination of theoretical and simulation-based approaches.
The paper's strengths include its clear writing, well-executed analysis, and intuitive appeal. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the results, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of regular trees as a model for the Bitcoin network is a reasonable simplification, and the authors validate this choice by simulating the protocols on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin network topology.
However, the paper lacks analysis on the source of improvement, including how the proposed approach eliminates the need for large mini-batches and outperforms existing methods. The experiments demonstrate significant improvement over baselines, but require more quantitative testing, such as estimating log-likelihoods to verify the claim of preventing mode dropping. Additionally, the paper could benefit from clarification on the relationship between the proposed approach and existing methods, including the use of regularization techniques and the measurement of stability in experiments.
The paper's contributions are threefold: (1) modeling the Bitcoin P2P network and an eavesdropper adversary, (2) analyzing the probability of deanonymization under trickle and diffusion protocols, and (3) simulating the protocols on a real Bitcoin graph topology. The results suggest that both trickle and diffusion have poor anonymity properties, and the transition from trickle to diffusion did not significantly improve the situation.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
Regarding originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, combining concepts from graph theory, probability theory, and machine learning. The use of regular trees as a model for the Bitcoin network is a new contribution, and the analysis of the probability of deanonymization under both trickle and diffusion protocols is a significant addition to the existing literature.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, which is a critical aspect of the cryptocurrency's security and privacy. The results have implications for the design of more secure and private peer-to-peer networks, and the approach proposed in the paper can be applied to other domains where anonymity is a concern.
