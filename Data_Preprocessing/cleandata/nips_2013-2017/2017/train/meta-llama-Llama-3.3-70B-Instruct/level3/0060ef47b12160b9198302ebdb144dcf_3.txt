This paper proposes a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors introduce the concept of hierarchical route distributions, which allows for a more tractable and scalable representation of route distributions. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thoroughness of the technical presentation, and the empirical evaluation of the proposed method. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a route prediction task, showing that it outperforms other methods, such as Markov models and naive baselines. The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the limitations of the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns that need to be addressed. One concern is the scalability of the approach, as the authors mention that the compilation of propositional logic descriptions to circuits with specific properties can be a computational bottleneck. Additionally, the authors assume that the regions in the hierarchical representation are small enough, which may not always be the case in practice. Furthermore, the authors do not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as graphical models, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a good discussion of the related work and the limitations of the proposed approach. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
