This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, PointNet++, for processing point sets sampled in a metric space. The key idea is to apply a hierarchical feature learning framework that recursively partitions the input point set and captures local features at multiple scales. The authors also introduce two novel set abstraction layers, multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), to adaptively aggregate features from different scales according to local point densities.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, ModelNet40, SHREC15, and ScanNet.
The technical soundness of the paper is reasonable, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology. However, the experiments do not clearly demonstrate a significant advantage over existing methods, such as PointNet, in all cases. For example, in Table 1, the error rate of PointNet++ is only slightly better than PointNet. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as CNNs, which makes it difficult to assess the significance of their results.
One potential issue with the proposed method is the sensitivity of the results to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of scales and the radius of the neighborhood balls. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the effect of these hyperparameters on the performance of the network.
Another potential concern is the computational efficiency of the proposed method. The authors mention that the MSG layer is computationally expensive, and the MRG layer is more efficient. However, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their method, which makes it difficult to assess its practicality for large-scale applications.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to processing point sets in a metric space. However, the experimental results do not clearly demonstrate a significant advantage over existing methods, and the authors could provide more detailed analysis and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
