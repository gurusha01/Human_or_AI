This paper proposes a novel unsupervised generative approach for network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE). The approach uses a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed objective function and its connection to link prediction and community detection.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction. The results show that PRUNE outperforms several state-of-the-art network embedding methods, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, SDNE, and NRCL.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel objective function that connects node embedding with link prediction and community detection, providing a theoretical foundation for the approach.
* The use of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure, which allows for joint learning of multiple objectives and improves the performance of the model.
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks and datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
* The experiments are limited to small-scale problems, and it would be interesting to see how the proposed method performs on larger-scale networks.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameter settings and their impact on the performance of the model.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of network embedding, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted in various applications. However, further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations of the approach.
