This paper presents a novel neural network architecture, PointNet++, designed to process point sets sampled in a metric space. The key idea is to recursively apply PointNet on a nested partitioning of the input point set, allowing the network to learn hierarchical features with respect to the distance metric. The authors address the issue of non-uniform point sampling by introducing two novel set abstraction layers that intelligently aggregate multi-scale information according to local point densities.
The paper builds upon the PointNet paper by introducing spatial relations between points, adding locality and shift invariance for low-level descriptors, making PointNet more similar to CNNs. The contribution is straightforward, well-presented, and efficiently implemented, with satisfying results, although not significantly better than the original PointNet. The results on SHREC non-rigid shape classification are notable, as few papers evaluate both SHREC and ModelNet datasets.
The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The problems and approaches are new, and the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques.
However, the paper lacks specific numbers on speed and efficiency, and additional comparisons, such as segmentation without normals, would be beneficial for a more comprehensive evaluation. The paper could also benefit from more detailed analysis of the results and more visualizations to help understand the learned features.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-designed architecture for processing point sets in a metric space.
* The authors address the issue of non-uniform point sampling, which is a common problem in real-world applications.
* The results on SHREC non-rigid shape classification are notable and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The paper is well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper lacks specific numbers on speed and efficiency, which is an important aspect of any neural network architecture.
* The results are not significantly better than the original PointNet, which may raise questions about the novelty and impact of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the results and more visualizations to help understand the learned features.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-designed architecture for processing point sets in a metric space, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, the authors should address the minor issues mentioned above to improve the paper.
