This paper proposes a novel approach to efficiently estimate the pairwise similarity score between sequences, enabling the use of larger values of k and m in sequence classification. The authors introduce a unified framework that satisfies desired properties under additive feature importance and tackle an important problem with a clearly written paper. The method's local accuracy criterion is considered too restrictive, and there is a discrepancy in Corollary 1 regarding the handling of interpretable models that needs clarification.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers, which can be computed in O(m3) time. The authors also devise an efficient approximation scheme inspired by the theory of locality-sensitive hashing to accurately estimate the number of k-mer pairs between two sequences that are at distance d. The algorithm achieves excellent approximation performance with theoretical guarantees, making it applicable for large values of k and m.
However, the reviewers seek more information on the computational cost and time of the algorithm to set clear expectations for practical applications. The paper's evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrates that it achieves excellent predictive performance, but more analysis on the computational efficiency and scalability of the algorithm is needed.
