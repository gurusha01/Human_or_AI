This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, specifically focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used before and after 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under two protocols: trickle (pre-2015) and diffusion (post-2015). The paper's main contributions are threefold: modeling the Bitcoin P2P network and an eavesdropper adversary, analyzing the probability of deanonymization under trickle and diffusion propagation, and comparing the anonymity properties of both protocols.
The paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the problem, the development of new models and estimators, and the simulation results that validate the theoretical findings. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the models and methods used, making it easy to follow their reasoning. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the graph structure in estimating the source of a transaction, which is a key aspect of deanonymization attacks.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The writing quality is poor, with excessive use of passive voice, typos, and incomplete sentences. The paper could benefit from a thorough editing to improve its clarity and readability. Additionally, some of the sentences are unclear or require elaboration, such as the sentence in lines 30-31 regarding the method's limitations in analyzing certain data patterns. The subsection on the loss function in Eq. 15 is also unclear and needs further explanation.
The use of MSE/PMSE as a metric for PF-like models is insufficient and should be supplemented with predictive log-likelihood. The value of K in the experiments seems too small and should be increased to at least K=100. The discussion in lines 224-232 and its connection to Fig. 3 is unclear and requires clarification. The update equations for variational inference can be moved to the supplement to improve the paper's readability. The caption in Fig. 4 is unclear and should be revised for better readability.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques and provides a unique perspective on the problem of deanonymization in Bitcoin's P2P network.
Overall, the paper requires significant improvements in execution, writing quality, and clarity before it can be considered for acceptance in a conference like NIPS. However, the paper's strengths and contributions make it a valuable addition to the field, and with revisions, it has the potential to be a high-quality paper.
