This paper presents a cognitive model that predicts when certain questions are asked in certain contexts, considering factors such as informativeness, complexity, answer type, and relevance. The model is applied to the Battleship domain and performs well in predicting held-out human data. However, its success as a cognitive science project is limited due to inconsistent results.
The paper is technically sound, well-written, and clear, but lacks prior work, including similar concepts introduced by Hawkins (2015) and Roberts (1996). The model's ability to generate compositional questions for a non-trivial domain is seen as a significant contribution, with potential for future use in cognitive and AI models.
The reviewer is skeptical about the paper's conclusions on how people balance informativeness and complexity, citing inconsistent and noisy results. The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and potential for future applications. However, its weaknesses include the lack of prior work and inconsistent results.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The model's ability to generate compositional questions for a non-trivial domain is a significant contribution
* The paper is technically sound and well-written
* The model has potential for future use in cognitive and AI models
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper lacks prior work, including similar concepts introduced by Hawkins (2015) and Roberts (1996)
* The results are inconsistent and noisy
* The paper's conclusions on how people balance informativeness and complexity are not well-supported.
Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, but its limitations and weaknesses need to be addressed. With further development and refinement, the model has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of cognitive science and AI. 
Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the paper is not a complete piece of work, and the authors are not careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
Clarity: The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The paper provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce its results.
Originality: The problems or approaches are not new, and the paper does not introduce a novel combination of familiar techniques. The related work is not adequately referenced, and the paper does not clearly differ from previous contributions.
Significance: The results are not important, and other people are unlikely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper does not address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and it does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way. However, the paper provides unique data and unique conclusions on existing data, which is a significant contribution.
