This paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE), which leverages a multi-task Siamese neural network to preserve both global node ranking and local proximity information. The model is designed to learn node embeddings that capture the structural properties of the network, including community-aware proximity and global node ranking.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed model, including the objective function and the optimization process. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with results on three real-world networks and comparisons to several state-of-the-art baselines.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel objective function that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking, which is shown to be effective in improving the performance of supervised learning tasks.
* The use of a Siamese neural network architecture, which allows for the joint optimization of multiple tasks and improves the robustness of the model to missing edges.
* The provision of theoretical interpretations for the proposed objective function, including the connection to community detection and link prediction.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including a discussion of the limitations of the proposed model and potential avenues for future work.
* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the model to different settings.
* The paper assumes that the network is undirected and unweighted, which may not be the case in many real-world applications. The authors could discuss potential extensions to directed and weighted networks.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of network embedding, with a novel approach that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking. The results are promising, and the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this area.
