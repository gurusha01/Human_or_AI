This paper proposes a novel robust submodular streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which addresses the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint in a streaming setting with potential removals of elements. The algorithm uses a partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule to construct a robust summary of the data. The authors also propose a simple greedy algorithm, STAR-T-GREEDY, which runs on the remaining elements after removals and achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed algorithm, and its theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide an extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm on two different data summarization tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel robust submodular streaming algorithm that addresses a practically important problem.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the algorithm, including a constant-factor approximation guarantee.
* The extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm on real-world datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm's dependence on the parameter τ, which is a function of the unknown value f(OPT(k, V \ E)).
* The lack of comparison with other robust submodular optimization algorithms in the experimental evaluation.
* The limited analysis of the algorithm's computational complexity and memory requirements.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization and streaming algorithms. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, including data summarization, influence maximization, and personalized recommendation.
