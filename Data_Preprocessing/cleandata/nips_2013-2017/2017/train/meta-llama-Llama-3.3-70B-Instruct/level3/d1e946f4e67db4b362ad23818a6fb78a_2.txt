This paper proposes a novel method called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM) to solve the Quadratic Programming (QP) graph matching problem. The MPMG approach formulates the problem as an argmax problem and uses the Lagrange multiplier technique to move the doubly-stochastic constraint into the error term. The method converges near a sparse/discrete solution even without explicitly modeling the constraint, which is a promising feature.
The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem formulation, related works, and the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence and KKT optimality is also well-presented. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPGM algorithm in solving graph matching problems, particularly in terms of objective score and matching accuracy.
However, there are some concerns regarding the experimental details. The convergence criterion and initialization procedures are not clearly explained, which may jeopardize the strength of the empirical claims. Additionally, the comparison between MPGM and other state-of-the-art techniques, such as RRWM, may not be fair due to differences in initialization procedures and lack of explanation in the text. The paper also lacks clarity on the performance time computation, initialization procedures, and node-to-node affinities determination, making it hard to draw meaningful conclusions from the experiments.
The practical applications and value of the paper may be limited, particularly for image feature point matching, but could be stronger for other practical labeling problems. The authors claim that the proposed algorithm can be used in other optimization problems with doubly stochastic constraints in machine learning and computer vision, which is an interesting direction for future work.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the experimental setup and procedures. The clarity of the paper is good, but some sections, such as the experimental results, could be improved with more detailed descriptions and explanations.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel algorithm for solving the QP graph matching problem. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in computer vision and provides a promising solution. However, the paper could benefit from more discussions on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed algorithm.
Overall, I would recommend this paper for acceptance, but with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors should provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup and procedures, clarify the comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques, and discuss the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed algorithm.
