This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that learns binary codes directly from the last layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN). The algorithm utilizes both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes within a single stream framework. The authors introduce an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, which takes into account the discrete nature of the hash codes.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed algorithm, including the problem definition, similarity measure, loss function, and optimization method. The authors also provide a thorough review of existing hashing methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark image retrieval datasets, including CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a higher mean average precision (MAP) than other deep hashing methods, including DTSH, DPSH, and VDSH.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and effective, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
* The paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the algorithm, including the optimization method.
