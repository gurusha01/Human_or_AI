This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The paper provides a thorough overview of the proposed framework, including the definition of point processes, the Wasserstein distance metric, and the GAN architecture.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and innovative approach for modeling temporal point processes, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based models.
* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based metric, which provides a more robust and efficient way to measure the difference between point processes compared to traditional metrics.
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.
However, there are also some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the point process is defined on a compact space, which may not be the case in many real-world applications. It would be interesting to explore how the proposed approach can be extended to more general spaces.
* The use of a RNN to model the generator may not be the most efficient or effective choice, especially for large-scale datasets. Other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers, may be more suitable for this task.
* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which is an important consideration for large-scale applications.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of point process modeling, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely adopted in various applications. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and areas for improvement mentioned above.
