This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN architecture consists of a lower hierarchical layer with multiple sequentially connected RNN cells (Fast cells) and a higher hierarchical layer with a single RNN cell (Slow cell). The authors evaluate the FS-RNN on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, and achieve state-of-the-art results.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed architecture and its advantages. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FS-RNN in learning long-term dependencies and adapting to unexpected inputs. The authors also provide an empirical analysis of the network dynamics, which shows that the FS-RNN combines the benefits of both deep transition RNNs and multiscale RNNs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed FS-RNN architecture is novel and combines the strengths of multiple existing architectures.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FS-RNN in achieving state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets.
* The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed architecture and its advantages.
* The empirical analysis of the network dynamics provides valuable insights into the behavior of the FS-RNN.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing RNN architectures.
* The authors could provide more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameters.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the FS-RNN architecture.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed FS-RNN architecture is novel and effective. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the FS-RNN in achieving state-of-the-art results on language modeling tasks. The paper is a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing and recurrent neural networks.
