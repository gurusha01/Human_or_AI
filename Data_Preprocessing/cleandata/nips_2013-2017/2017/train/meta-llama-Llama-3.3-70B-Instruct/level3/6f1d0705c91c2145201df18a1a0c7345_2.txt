This paper introduces hierarchical implicit models (HIMs) and a novel approach for likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI) in such models. HIMs combine implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, allowing for rich latent structure in models defined by a simulation process. The LFVI algorithm uses a GAN-style discriminator to estimate the log ratio between the variational joint and the true model joint density, enabling scalable and accurate inference in HIMs.
The paper is well-written, and the exposition is clear and well-cited, making it easy to follow. The definition of HIMs is useful, and the approach has the potential to open up new classes of models to effective Bayesian inference. The experiments demonstrate the applicability of LFVI to various domains, including ecological simulation, Bayesian GANs, and sequence modeling with stochastic RNNs.
However, the experiments are the weakest point of the paper, with some being toy examples or not evaluated against other methods. The Lotka-Volterra simulation is a compelling example, but the results could be more comprehensive. Additionally, the factorization assumption of iid observations in HIMs may be restrictive and not include models with temporal dependence.
The approach seems general and powerful, but it may be tricky to implement in practice. The paper has some technical errors and areas for improvement, including the formulation of the Lotka-Volterra model and the use of explicit variational approximations for faster inference. The interpretation of the ratio objective and its potential use for model criticism are also questionable, as it no longer yields a lower bound to the true model evidence.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and implicit models. While it has some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper, including its clarity, originality, and significance, make it a valuable addition to the literature.
