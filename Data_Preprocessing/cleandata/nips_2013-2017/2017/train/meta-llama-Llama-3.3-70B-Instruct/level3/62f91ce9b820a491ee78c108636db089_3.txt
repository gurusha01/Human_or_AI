This paper proposes a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The disease is modeled as an arbitrary finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state, and the method incorporates the possibility of external information that may trigger arrival of the patient to the clinician in advance of a scheduled screening appointment.
The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction to the problem and a detailed description of the proposed methodology. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of the challenges and limitations of existing approaches. The proposed framework is based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation, and the authors provide a detailed description of the model and the solution approach.
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening, as it provides a flexible and general framework that can be applied to a wide range of diseases and screening settings. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using a large breast cancer dataset, and show that the personalized screening policies constructed using the framework can reduce the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem
* A thorough analysis of the challenges and limitations of existing approaches
* A detailed description of the proposed methodology and the solution approach
* A demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed framework using a large breast cancer dataset
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The use of a non-peer-reviewed reference ([18]) as a fundamental reason for the paper
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for personalized screening
* The limited evaluation of the proposed framework, which is only demonstrated using a single dataset and a single disease (breast cancer)
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening, and the proposed framework has the potential to be applied to a wide range of diseases and screening settings. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, and by providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of personalized screening
* The proposed framework is flexible and general, and can be applied to a wide range of diseases and screening settings
* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework using a large breast cancer dataset
Arguments against acceptance:
* The use of a non-peer-reviewed reference ([18]) as a fundamental reason for the paper
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for personalized screening
* The limited evaluation of the proposed framework, which is only demonstrated using a single dataset and a single disease (breast cancer)
Recommendation:
* Accept the paper, but require the authors to address the weaknesses mentioned above, and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework.
* Suggest that the authors compare the proposed framework with other state-of-the-art methods for personalized screening, and evaluate the framework using multiple datasets and diseases.
* Suggest that the authors replace the non-peer-reviewed reference ([18]) with a peer-reviewed reference, and provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed framework.
