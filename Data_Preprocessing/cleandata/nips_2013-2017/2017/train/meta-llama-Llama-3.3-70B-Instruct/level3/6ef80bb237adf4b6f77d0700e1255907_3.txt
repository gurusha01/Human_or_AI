This paper proposes a novel approach to robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, where elements arrive in a streaming fashion and a subset of elements is removed after the stream is finished. The authors introduce a two-stage procedure, consisting of a streaming algorithm (STAR-T) that constructs a robust summary of the data, and a query stage algorithm (STAR-T-GREEDY) that runs on the remaining elements after removal.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, the proposed approach, and the theoretical guarantees. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments on two different data summarization tasks, showing that their method compares favorably to existing greedy and streaming methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and efficient algorithm for robust submodular maximization in a streaming setting, which is a challenging problem with many practical applications.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithm, including a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the robust submodular function maximization problem.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical experiments on real-world datasets.
However, there are also some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the submodular function is normalized and monotone, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to see how the proposed approach can be extended to handle more general submodular functions.
* The experimental evaluation is limited to two datasets and two specific applications. It would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments on a wider range of datasets and applications to further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing methods for robust submodular maximization, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach compared to other methods.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization and streaming algorithms, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in many practical settings.
