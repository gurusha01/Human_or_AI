This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, called WGANTPP, in estimating the underlying point process and outperforming traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical details of the proposed approach are well-explained, and the experimental results are thorough and convincing. The use of Wasserstein distance as a metric for evaluating the performance of the generator is a key contribution of the paper, and the authors provide a clear explanation of its advantages over traditional metrics.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex and diverse point process data, including synthetic and real-world datasets. The authors demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach by evaluating its performance on various types of point processes, including inhomogeneous Poisson processes, self-exciting processes, and self-correcting processes. The results show that WGANTPP outperforms traditional MLE methods in estimating the underlying point process, especially when the generating model is misspecified.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other GAN-based approaches for point process modeling, as well as a more thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the results to these choices.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of point process modeling and provides a novel and effective approach for estimating complex point processes. The use of Wasserstein distance as a metric for evaluating the performance of the generator is a key innovation, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
