This paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The authors provide a simple and general implementation of this trick in terms of a single change to the computation graph operated on by standard automatic differentiation packages. They also generalize their gradient estimator to mixture and importance-weighted lower bounds.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on variational inference and the motivation for the proposed method. The technical sections are detailed and provide a thorough analysis of the proposed estimator.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed estimator is unbiased and has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact, making it a significant improvement over existing estimators.
* The method is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing software packages.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the estimator, including its behavior in different scenarios and its relationship to existing methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons to existing methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in variational inference.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed method.
