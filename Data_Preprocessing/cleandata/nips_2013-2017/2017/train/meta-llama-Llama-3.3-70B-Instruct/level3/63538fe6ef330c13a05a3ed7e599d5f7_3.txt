This paper proposes a novel approach to efficiently estimate the pairwise similarity score between sequences, which enables the use of larger values of k and m, leading to higher predictive accuracy. The authors develop a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers and devise an efficient approximation scheme to estimate the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm is thorough, and the authors provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the estimates.
The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing significant speedups over existing solutions for large values of k and m. The authors also report excellent approximation performance, with empirical errors being significantly more precise than the theoretical bounds.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposal of a novel parameterization of the optimization domain as the conic hull of an atom set, which differs from existing greedy optimization methods.
* The provision of explicit convergence rates for non-negative matching pursuit algorithms and the modification of existing methods to address alignment issues with conic optimization domains.
* The development of three algorithms with different variants, which allows for flexibility in choosing the best approach for specific conditions.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The choice of tau value affects the convergence and recovery of optimal solutions, and a large tau is preferred for convergence guarantees but may lead to slow convergence.
* The experimental evaluation is limited by rough descriptions and analysis, and additional criteria such as computational time could be used to compare methods.
* Further analysis is needed to determine the best approach among the three proposed algorithms and to investigate the trade-offs between convergence rates, computational complexity, and recovery guarantees.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequence classification, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely applicable. However, some areas require further investigation and refinement to fully realize the potential of the proposed approach.
