This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN architecture consists of a lower hierarchical layer with multiple sequentially connected RNN cells (Fast cells) and a higher hierarchical layer with a single RNN cell (Slow cell). The Fast cells update their hidden states multiple times per time step, while the Slow cell updates its hidden state only once per time step. This architecture allows the network to learn complex transition functions from one time step to the next and to capture long-term dependencies efficiently.
The paper presents a thorough evaluation of the FS-RNN architecture on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia. The results show that the FS-RNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, outperforming other RNN architectures and even surpassing the best known text compression algorithm on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset. The authors also provide an empirical analysis of the network dynamics, which reveals that the FS-RNN architecture favors the learning of long-term dependencies, enforces hidden cell states to change at different rates, and facilitates quick adaptation to unexpected inputs.
The strengths of this paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, thorough evaluation, and empirical analysis of the network dynamics. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of related work and clearly explain how their approach differs from previous contributions. The FS-RNN architecture is also general and flexible, allowing any type of RNN cell to be used as a building block, which makes it applicable to different tasks.
However, there are some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement. One potential limitation is that the FS-RNN architecture may require careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of Fast cells and the learning rate. Additionally, the authors could further investigate the use of other optimization techniques, such as Hessian Free optimization, to improve the training of the FS-RNN architecture.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of RNNs and language modeling, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The FS-RNN architecture is a novel and effective approach to modeling sequential data, and its flexibility and generality make it a promising direction for future research.
