This paper explores the application of Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) to represent and learn distributions over routes on a map, with a focus on scalability. The authors introduce a hierarchical approximation of simple-route distributions, which allows for tractable representation and learning of PSDDs over larger maps. The key insight is to decompose the route distribution into smaller distributions over regions, which can be represented using PSDDs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a route prediction task using a dataset of taxicab routes in San Francisco.
The paper is well-written, with clear and succinct definitions of PSDDs and their application to route distributions. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the hierarchical approximation and its properties, including the conditions under which it is exact. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the PSDD approach in predicting the next road segment, outperforming naive and Markov model baselines.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel hierarchical approximation for simple-route distributions, which allows for tractable representation and learning of PSDDs over larger maps.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the PSDD approach in a route prediction task, with significant improvements in accuracy over baseline models.
* The provision of a thorough explanation of the hierarchical approximation and its properties, including the conditions under which it is exact.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The results seem incremental, applying existing representation methods to graphs with some approximations, rather than introducing a fundamentally new approach.
* The experiment's baselines are somewhat limited, and it would be interesting to see comparisons with more advanced models, such as deep learning approaches or other probabilistic graphical models.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of the hierarchical approximation, beyond the specific route prediction task considered.
Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field, demonstrating the effectiveness of PSDDs in representing and learning distributions over routes on a map. The hierarchical approximation introduced in the paper has the potential to be applied to other domains, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the approach and its properties.
