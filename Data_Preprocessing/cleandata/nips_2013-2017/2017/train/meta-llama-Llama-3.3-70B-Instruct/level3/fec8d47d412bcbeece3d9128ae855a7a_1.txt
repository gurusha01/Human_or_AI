This paper proposes a novel approach to analyze the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The authors introduce a notion of separability of loss functions, which allows them to derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They then instantiate their results for both generative and discriminative models, providing insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology and results. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, making it easier to follow. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the contributions of their paper.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified analysis of both generative and discriminative models. The authors show that the separability of the loss function plays a crucial role in determining the convergence rates of these models. They also provide a detailed analysis of the sample complexities of both approaches, which is essential for understanding their performance in high-dimensional settings.
The experimental results presented in the paper are also convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in high-dimensional classification tasks. The authors show that their two-staged thresholded generative estimator outperforms the discriminative estimator, especially when the true parameter is not highly sparse.
However, there are some minor errors and suggestions for improvement. For example, on Line 136, the authors use the phrase "this" instead of "these", which is a minor grammatical error. Additionally, some of the equations and notation could be better explained, especially for readers who are not familiar with the topic.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria. The authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and relate them to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere. They also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, addressing the criteria described in the Qualitative Evaluation section.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication at NIPS. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and its results have important implications for high-dimensional classification tasks.
