This paper presents an interesting idea of using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for modeling temporal point processes. The authors propose a novel approach that bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation of point processes. Instead, they use a generative adversarial learning scheme to learn the underlying distribution of the point process.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the idea of using WGAN for point processes is novel and has the potential to address some of the limitations of traditional methods. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their approach, including a detailed description of the WGAN architecture and the training procedure. The experimental results are also impressive, showing that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of estimating the underlying intensity of the point process.
However, there are also some weaknesses in the paper. One of the main concerns is that the theoretical contributions are not convincing, and the empirical findings are more appealing. The authors claim that their method is intensity-free, but it is not clear how this is achieved in practice. The analysis is done in the feature space, but the proposed method is in the input space, creating a mismatch between the two. Additionally, the convexity used in the proofs is not valid in the input space.
Another issue is that the KL expression in the paper is incorrect, and a new objective needs to be developed. The authors propose using a cross-entropy term and adding a cross-entropy regularization, but it is not clear why this is necessary or how it relates to the original objective.
The generator should provide a balance of samples on and off the manifold to reinforce both positive and negative classes, rather than just providing negative samples or very realistic samples. However, the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how this is achieved in their implementation.
The paper also lacks an ablation study to illustrate the performance of the method for different epsilon values and a justification for the 10 quantile used. The use of density estimation and entropic regularizers seems ad-hoc, and the authors should consider alternative methods to encourage low-density sampling without using explicit estimators.
Finally, the paper has some minor errors, such as typos and unexplained comments, and the proof of Corollary 1 is not provided, making it difficult to understand the claims made.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets some of the criteria, such as being well-organized and providing enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the theoretical contributions and a clearer explanation of the empirical findings.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors should provide a clearer explanation of their approach, including the theoretical contributions and the empirical findings. They should also address the issues with the KL expression, the generator, and the ablation study.
