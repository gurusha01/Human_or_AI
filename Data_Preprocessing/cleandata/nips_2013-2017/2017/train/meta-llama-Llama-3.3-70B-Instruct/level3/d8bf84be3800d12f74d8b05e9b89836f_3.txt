This paper presents a novel extension of the PointNet architecture, called PointNet++, which is designed to classify and segment 3D point clouds with varying sampling densities. The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set, allowing for the exploitation of local spatial information. The authors also propose two novel set abstraction layers, multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), which adaptively combine features from multiple scales to handle non-uniform sampling densities.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of processing point sets and the limitations of existing methods, including PointNet. The authors then present their hierarchical network architecture and the two set abstraction layers, which are the main contributions of the paper.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PointNet++ on several challenging benchmarks, including MNIST, ModelNet40, and ScanNet. The authors show that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including PointNet, and achieves significant improvements in accuracy and robustness to sampling density variation.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach, and the technical details are well-explained. The experimental results are also well-presented and easy to understand.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. One of the main limitations is that the impact of the hierarchical network architecture on overall performance is limited to 1-2 percent, which may not be significant enough to justify the added complexity of the architecture. Additionally, the authors claim that MSG is more robust than MRG but worse in terms of computational efficiency, but they do not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more experimental results to validate their claims, particularly with regards to the comparison between MSG and MRG. They could also provide more analysis on the computational efficiency of their approach and how it compares to other methods.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of 3D point cloud processing and provides a novel approach to handling non-uniform sampling densities. While there are some limitations to the paper, the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
