This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, PointNet++, for processing point sets sampled in a metric space. The authors introduce a hierarchical structure that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set, allowing the network to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. The paper also addresses the issue of non-uniform point sampling density by proposing two novel set abstraction layers, multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), which intelligently aggregate multi-scale information according to local point densities.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' ideas. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of processing point sets and the limitations of existing methods. The methodology section is detailed and well-explained, with a clear description of the PointNet++ architecture and the MSG and MRG layers.
The experimental results are impressive, with PointNet++ achieving state-of-the-art performance on several challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including an evaluation of the network's robustness to sampling density variation.
The paper's strengths include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors propose a novel architecture that addresses a significant problem in the field, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to understand the authors' ideas.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential limitation is the computational cost of the MSG and MRG layers, which could be a bottleneck for large-scale point clouds. The authors mention this issue in the conclusion and suggest that accelerating inference speed is an area for future work.
Another potential weakness is the lack of comparison to other methods that address non-uniform point sampling density. While the authors compare PointNet++ to other state-of-the-art methods, they do not provide a detailed analysis of how their approach compares to other methods that specifically address this issue.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors propose a novel and effective architecture for processing point sets, and the results demonstrate the significance of the approach. While there are some potential limitations, the paper is well-written and clearly organized, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
