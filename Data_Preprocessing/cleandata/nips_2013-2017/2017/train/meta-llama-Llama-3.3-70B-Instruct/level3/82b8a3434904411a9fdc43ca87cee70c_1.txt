This paper proposes a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The authors model the disease as an arbitrary finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate the possibility of external information, such as self-examination or discovery of co-morbidities, that may trigger arrival of the patient to the clinician in advance of a scheduled screening appointment.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using a real-world dataset of breast cancer patients and show that their personalized screening policies can reduce the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed framework is general and can be applied to a wide range of diseases, making it a valuable contribution to the field of personalized medicine.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the disease model, the screening policy, and the optimization algorithm.
* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the number of screenings while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the disease model is known, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation and discuss the potential impact of estimation error on the performance of the proposed approach.
* The paper focuses on breast cancer, and it is not clear how well the proposed approach will generalize to other diseases.
* The optimization algorithm used to compute the screening policy is computationally expensive, which may limit its applicability to large-scale problems.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field of personalized medicine. The proposed framework has the potential to improve the effectiveness of screening policies and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
