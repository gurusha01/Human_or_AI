This paper introduces hierarchical implicit models (HIMs), a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that define a process for generating samples, and likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several applications, including a large-scale physical simulator for predator-prey populations, a Bayesian generative adversarial network for supervised classification, and a deep implicit model for symbol generation.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good motivation for the work, and the related work section provides a thorough overview of the relevant literature. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, with a clear explanation of the key concepts and algorithms.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to merge the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling and approximate posterior inference. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of how their approach expands Bayesian analysis to apply neural samplers, physical simulators, and their combination with rich, interpretable latent structure.
The experiments section is also well-done, with a clear presentation of the results and a thorough comparison to existing methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several applications, including a large-scale physical simulator and a Bayesian generative adversarial network.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is the lack of empirical experiments to validate the theoretical findings. While the authors provide some experimental results, they are limited to a few applications, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experimentation to fully validate the approach.
Another potential area for improvement is the discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the approach. While the authors mention some potential challenges, such as the stability of the ratio estimator, they could provide a more detailed discussion of these limitations and how they might be addressed in future work.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise explanation of the authors' approach. The experiments section is well-done, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several applications. However, the paper could benefit from more extensive experimentation and a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the approach.
