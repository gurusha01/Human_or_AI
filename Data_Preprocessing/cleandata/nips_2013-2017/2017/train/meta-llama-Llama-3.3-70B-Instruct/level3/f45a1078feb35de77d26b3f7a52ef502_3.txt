This paper presents a novel approach to learning predictive point process models using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (W-GAN) to model the count density. However, the authors fail to compare their approach to other existing methods, such as Bayesian inference, which is a significant limitation. The method seems to be restricted to 1D point processes due to representation issues with count density, and this limitation should be explicitly stated.
The approach to estimating the distance from the generated count measure to the data is challenging with a single realization of the point process, and the W-GAN's performance may be due to heavy regularization. Furthermore, the origin of 'real' in the real-world evaluation metrics is unclear, and the ground truth is not well-explained, particularly in figures like Figure 3.
The paper lacks discussion on the ease or difficulty of training these models, which would be an interesting aspect to explore. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear comparison to other approaches, making it difficult to assess the significance of their contributions. The reviewer is concerned that the models may be over-complex for the available signal-to-noise, and simpler intensity-based approaches, such as KDE or Hawkes processes, might empirically outperform the W-GAN in most cases.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is well-organized, but the writing could be improved for better clarity. The originality of the approach is questionable, as it builds upon existing techniques without providing significant novel contributions. The significance of the results is also unclear, as the authors do not provide a clear comparison to other approaches or demonstrate the practical impact of their method.
Overall, the paper has some interesting ideas, but it requires significant improvements in terms of comparison to other approaches, clarity, and significance of the results. The authors should address the limitations and concerns raised by the reviewer to strengthen their contributions.
