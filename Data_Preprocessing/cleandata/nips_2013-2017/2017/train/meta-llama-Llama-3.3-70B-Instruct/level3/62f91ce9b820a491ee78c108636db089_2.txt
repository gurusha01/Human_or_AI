This paper explores the use of deterministic quadrature rules for kernel approximation, which is an interesting direction that differs from the commonly used random Fourier features method. The authors propose several methods for constructing deterministic feature maps, including polynomially-exact quadrature, dense grid construction, sparse grid construction, and reweighted grid construction. The theoretical results show that these methods can achieve better scaling in the desired accuracy compared to random Fourier features, particularly for sparse ANOVA kernels.
However, there are some limitations and weaknesses in the paper. Firstly, the results are limited by the assumption of a sub-gaussian kernel spectrum, which excludes popular kernels like Matern kernels with polynomially decaying spectra. Secondly, the theoretical results have an exponential dependence on the domain diameter, which affects the required feature size and potentially weakens the proposed approach. Additionally, the subsampled dense grid approach used in experiments lacks theoretical guarantees, and the reweighted grid quadrature method also lacks theoretical guarantees and requires further comparison to Bayesian quadrature and time complexity analysis.
The experiments in Section 5 are insufficient, and more detailed reports of computation time, comparisons with QMC-based methods, and explanations of the settings and hyper-parameters used in the classification tasks are needed. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison of the proposed methods with existing kernel approximation techniques, including random Fourier features and Nystr√∂m methods.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting idea, but the results are not yet comprehensive and robust enough to fully support the claims made. With further development and experimentation, this approach has the potential to provide a useful alternative to random Fourier features for kernel approximation.
