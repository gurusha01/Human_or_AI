This paper proposes a fast approximation algorithm for the "mismatch string kernel" to reduce the high computational complexity of the original algorithm. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: determining the size of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers and determining the number of k-mer pairs within Hamming distance d. The algorithm uses precomputation and locality sensitive hashing to solve the two problems, with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the solution and analytical bounds on its running time.
The paper is well-written, with a clear presentation of the proposed algorithm and essential proofs. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's runtime and quality, and demonstrate its effectiveness through computational experiments on simulated and synthetic data. The results show that the proposed algorithm approximates the exact computation well and runs much faster, especially when m is large.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to solving the combinatorial problem of computing the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods, and its efficient approximation scheme for estimating the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the algorithm's performance on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art classification performance and significant speedup over existing solutions.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper, such as a loose bound and incomplete sentences in Section 4. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing algorithms and a discussion of the potential applications of the proposed algorithm beyond sequence classification.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of string kernel-based sequence classification, and its proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted in practice. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a good candidate for acceptance.
