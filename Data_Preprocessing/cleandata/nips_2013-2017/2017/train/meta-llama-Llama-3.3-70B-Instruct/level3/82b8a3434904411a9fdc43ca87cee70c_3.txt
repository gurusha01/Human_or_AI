This paper presents a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The authors model the disease as an arbitrary finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate the possibility of external information that may trigger arrival of the patient to the clinician in advance of a scheduled screening appointment.
The paper's main strengths lie in its ability to handle complex disease models and external information processes, as well as its computational tractability. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the problem and propose a point-based value iteration algorithm to compute an approximately optimal policy. They also provide bounds on the approximation error and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulations on a large breast cancer dataset.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The use of a real-world dataset to illustrate the effectiveness of their approach is also a significant strength. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their own methodology.
One potential weakness of the paper is the assumption that the model parameters are known. In practice, these parameters may need to be estimated from data, and the authors acknowledge this limitation. However, they also provide some discussion of how to handle estimation error and demonstrate that their approach is robust to small errors in estimation.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies and has the potential to impact clinical practice. The authors' approach is novel, well-motivated, and thoroughly evaluated, and their results demonstrate the potential for significant reductions in screening costs while maintaining effective disease detection.
