This paper proposes a novel robust submodular streaming algorithm, STAR-T, which addresses the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint in a streaming setting with potential removals of elements. The algorithm makes one pass over the data and retains a small set of elements in memory, ensuring robustness against the removal of up to m elements. 
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem setup, the proposed algorithm, and its theoretical guarantees. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through experiments on two different data summarization tasks, where it matches or outperforms existing greedy and streaming methods. 
However, I have some concerns regarding the clarity of the problem setup. Specifically, the nature of the sets \mathcal{X, Y, Z} is not clearly defined, and it is unclear whether they are compact, unbounded, or finite sets. Additionally, the problem domain of stochastic programming is not familiar to me, and I would like to see results on more familiar problems, such as continuous control problems.
The results of the load forecasting task are potentially impressive, but I lack context to fully appreciate them due to my unfamiliarity with the problem domain. The authors could provide more background information or compare their results to existing benchmarks to help readers understand the significance of their achievements.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The main ideas are clearly summarized, and the paper is well-organized. However, I would like to see more discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as well as a more detailed comparison to existing work in the field.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper proposes a novel algorithm for robust submodular streaming, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through experiments on two different data summarization tasks.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
Cons:
- The problem setup is not clearly defined, and the nature of the sets \mathcal{X, Y, Z} is unclear.
- The paper assumes familiarity with the problem domain of stochastic programming, which may not be familiar to all readers.
- The results of the load forecasting task lack context, making it difficult to appreciate their significance.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors should provide more clarity on the problem setup, compare their results to existing benchmarks, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their approach in more detail.
