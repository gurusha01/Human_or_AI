This paper presents a novel approach to Bayesian inference for implicit models, which are defined by a simulation process for data rather than an explicit likelihood function. The authors introduce hierarchical implicit models (HIMs), a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling. They also develop likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good motivation for the work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods for implicit models and the potential benefits of the proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, with a clear description of the HIMs and LFVI.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new class of models (HIMs) that can capture complex latent structure in implicit models.
* The development of a scalable variational inference algorithm (LFVI) that can handle large datasets.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several applications, including a large-scale physical simulator, a Bayesian GAN, and a deep implicit model for text generation.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The idea of using implicit models and variational inference is not new, and the paper builds on existing work in this area.
* The technical innovations in the paper, such as the use of ratio estimation for the KL objective, are not particularly novel.
* The experiments, while impressive in terms of scale, are not particularly comprehensive, and it would be useful to see more comparisons to existing methods.
Overall, I would argue that the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, as it:
* Presents a clear and well-motivated proposal for a new class of models and a scalable inference algorithm.
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several applications.
* Provides a good starting point for further research in this area.
However, I would also suggest that the paper could be improved by:
* Providing more comprehensive experiments and comparisons to existing methods.
* Discussing the limitations and potential drawbacks of the proposed approach.
* Exploring the potential applications of the proposed approach in more detail.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I would rate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is well-written and clearly organized, but the technical innovations are not particularly novel).
* Clarity: 9/10 (the paper is easy to follow, but some of the technical sections could be improved).
* Originality: 7/10 (the paper builds on existing work in this area, but proposes a new class of models and a scalable inference algorithm).
* Significance: 8/10 (the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several applications, but the potential impact on the field is not yet clear).
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
