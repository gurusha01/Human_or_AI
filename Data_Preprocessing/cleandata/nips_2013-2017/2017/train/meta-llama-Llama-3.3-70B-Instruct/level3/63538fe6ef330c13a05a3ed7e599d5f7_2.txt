This paper proposes a novel algorithm for efficiently estimating the pairwise similarity score between sequences, which is a crucial component in sequence classification tasks. The authors address a significant gap in existing literature by providing optimization convergence rates of greedy algorithms in matching pursuit and Frank-Wolfe, shedding light on understanding these problems. The paper introduces away-step, pairwise, and fully corrective Matching Pursuit (MP) variants with theoretical guarantees, contributing to the completeness of the proposed algorithms.
