This paper introduces a novel approach to reducing the variance of the reparameterized gradient estimator in variational inference. The authors propose a simple yet effective method to eliminate the high-variance score function term from the gradient estimate, resulting in a new estimator with zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new and effective variance reduction technique for reparameterized gradient estimators.
* A thorough analysis of the proposed approach, including its theoretical foundations and empirical validation.
* The provision of a simple and general implementation of the technique using automatic differentiation packages.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and Omniglot.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations to the paper:
* The paper focuses primarily on the reparameterized gradient estimator, and it is not clear how the proposed approach would apply to other types of gradient estimators.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other variance reduction techniques, such as control variates or Rao-Blackwellization.
* The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed approach, such as increased computational cost or potential biases in certain scenarios.
* The experimental evaluation is limited to a few benchmark datasets, and it would be beneficial to see a more extensive evaluation on a wider range of datasets and tasks.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of variational inference, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of stochastic optimization algorithms. However, further research is needed to fully explore the limitations and potential applications of the proposed technique.
