This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval. The key idea is to constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly, and use both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework. The authors derive an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, which keeps the discrete nature of the hash codes during the optimization process.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, and the proposed method is well-explained. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark image retrieval datasets.
One of the strengths of the paper is that it addresses a significant problem in image retrieval, which is the limitation of previous deep hashing methods in fully exploiting semantic information. The proposed method provides a novel solution to this problem by using both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. For example, the authors do not provide a clear comparison with other approaches, such as assigning a small cost for abstaining, which could be tuned for desired coverage or error rate. Additionally, the evaluation methodology could be improved by using a portion of the training set for validation and evaluating on the full test set.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The clarity of the paper is good, and the organization is well-structured. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that addresses a significant problem in image retrieval. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is high, as it provides a novel solution to a significant problem in image retrieval. The results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way and provides unique conclusions on existing data.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper. The strengths of the paper, including its novelty, technical soundness, and significance, outweigh its weaknesses. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval.
