This paper proposes a novel approach to constructing feature maps for kernel machines, leveraging deterministic quadrature rules to approximate the Fourier transform integral of a kernel. The authors demonstrate that their method can achieve better scaling in the desired accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art random Fourier features method. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, the proposed approach, and the experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed approach, including theoretical bounds on the sample complexity and experimental evaluations on real datasets.
* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling statistical problems with special structures, such as sparse ANOVA kernels.
* The authors provide a detailed comparison with the random Fourier features method, highlighting the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed approach requires a subgaussian spectrum, which may not be satisfied by all kernel functions.
* The construction of the quadrature rules can be computationally expensive, particularly for high-dimensional datasets.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach, beyond the specific examples presented in the paper.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of kernel machines, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of kernel-based methods. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results.
