This paper proposes a novel unsupervised generative approach for network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE). The approach utilizes a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that preserve both global node ranking and local proximity information. The model is designed to satisfy four key properties: scalability, asymmetry, unity, and simplicity.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear figure and well-designed experimental section. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the proposed proximity objective and its connection to link prediction and community detection. They also provide theoretical proofs for the preservation of proximity and ranking information.
The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PRUNE on various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction. The results show that PRUNE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, SDNE, and NRCL. Additionally, the authors conduct a robustness analysis and show that PRUNE is more robust to noisy data compared to other methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-designed model that preserves both global node ranking and local proximity information
* A clear and detailed analysis of the proposed objective function and its connection to link prediction and community detection
* Strong experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of PRUNE on various tasks
* A robustness analysis that shows PRUNE is more robust to noisy data compared to other methods
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model requires a careful selection of hyperparameters, including the number of hidden layers and the activation functions
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison with other methods that preserve global node ranking information
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the model
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a novel and effective approach for network embedding. The experimental results are strong, and the authors provide a clear and detailed analysis of the proposed model. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of network embedding and node ranking.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including providing a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the model and comparing PRUNE with other methods that preserve global node ranking information. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more insights into the selection of hyperparameters and the robustness of the model to different network structures.
