This paper presents a novel approach to likelihood-free inference, building on previous work such as Hierarchical Variational Inference and Implicit Variational Bayes. The key contribution is the development of likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for hierarchical implicit models (HIMs). HIMs combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, allowing for rich latent structure in implicit models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions are sound, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the LFVI algorithm and its components, including the use of ratio estimation for likelihood-free variational inference.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, significance, and clarity. The authors tackle a challenging problem in likelihood-free inference and provide a novel solution that expands the applicability of Bayesian analysis to implicit models. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient background and motivation for the work.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns. The method requires log density ratio estimation in high-dimensional spaces, which can be challenging and may lead to instability in the early iterations of optimization. The authors' decision to apply their method to a Bayesian GAN for classification rather than a standard GAN for generating high-dimensional data raises concerns about the algorithm's stability and reliability.
The quality of the paper is high, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method on several applications, including a large-scale physical simulator for predator-prey populations in ecology, a Bayesian GAN for supervised classification, and a deep implicit model for symbol generation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the LFVI algorithm in these applications.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, including variational inference, ratio estimation, and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions and adequately reference related work.
The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in likelihood-free inference and provides a scalable solution that can be applied to a wide range of applications. The paper has the potential to impact the field of machine learning and statistics, particularly in areas where implicit models are commonly used.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of likelihood-free inference and provides a novel solution to a challenging problem. However, I would suggest that the authors address the concerns about stability and reliability in future work.
