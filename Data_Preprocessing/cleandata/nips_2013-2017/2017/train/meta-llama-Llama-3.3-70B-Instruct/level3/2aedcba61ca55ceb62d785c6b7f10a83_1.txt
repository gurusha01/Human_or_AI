This paper explores kernel regression in high-dimensional settings by introducing a "group additive model" to account for correlations between dimensions. The authors provide a formal treatment of the setting and algorithms for finding optimal groupings. However, the related work description is lacking, making it difficult to determine the novelty of the paper. 
The theoretical treatment is novel, defining a complexity measure on groupings, but the measure is not easily optimizable, leading to disappointing optimization methods. The experimental results are limited, lacking baselines and comparisons to other methods, making it hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. 
The authors' rebuttal clarifies some concerns, but the experiments and related work discussion are still inadequate. To improve, the authors should provide a more comprehensive related work section, including discussions on structured sparsity and feature selection. Additionally, more extensive experiments with baselines and comparisons to other methods are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The paper's quality is compromised by the lack of a thorough related work discussion and limited experimental results. The clarity of the paper is good, with well-organized sections and clear explanations of the proposed methods. However, the originality of the paper is difficult to assess due to the poor related work discussion. The significance of the paper is also limited by the lack of comprehensive experiments and comparisons to other methods.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel theoretical treatment of kernel regression in high-dimensional settings.
* The authors provide a formal treatment of the setting and algorithms for finding optimal groupings.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The related work discussion is lacking, making it difficult to determine the novelty of the paper.
* The experimental results are limited, lacking baselines and comparisons to other methods.
* The optimization methods are disappointing due to the complexity measure not being easily optimizable.
Overall, while the paper has some positive aspects, the limitations in related work discussion, experimental results, and optimization methods outweigh the benefits, making it a borderline paper. With improvements in these areas, the paper could be more competitive.
