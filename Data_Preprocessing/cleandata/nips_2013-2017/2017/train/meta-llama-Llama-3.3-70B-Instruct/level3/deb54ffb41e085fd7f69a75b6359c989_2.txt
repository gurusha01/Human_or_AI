This paper proposes a hierarchical version of Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) to efficiently represent distributions over routes in a discrete graph. The authors introduce the notion of hierarchical simple-route distributions, which allows for scaling to real-world sized problems by segmenting the problem into a hierarchy of sub-problems. The approach is based on a hierarchical map representation that forces routes to be simple at different levels of the hierarchy.
The paper is well-written, and the idea is interesting and novel. The authors provide a clear explanation of the background and motivation, and the technical details are well-presented. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a route prediction task, showing significant improvement in accuracy compared to Markov models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a hierarchical PSDD approach, which allows for scaling to larger maps and provides a tractable representation of distributions over routes.
* The introduction of the notion of hierarchical simple-route distributions, which is a subclass of simple-route distributions and provides a more efficient representation.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees, such as Theorem 1, which shows that the hierarchical distribution is a simple-route distribution, and Theorem 4, which bounds the error of the hierarchical distribution.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The comparison to Markov models may be considered unfair, as Markov models are not designed to handle the same level of complexity as PSDDs. A comparison to route-planning heuristics used in practice would be more appropriate.
* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset, and it would be beneficial to see results on other datasets to demonstrate the generality of the approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and route planning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other domains. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are novel and interesting, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and efficient approach to representing distributions over routes in a discrete graph.
* The approach has the potential to be applied to other domains, such as traffic prediction and route planning.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a route prediction task.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The comparison to Markov models may be considered unfair.
* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset.
However, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance.
