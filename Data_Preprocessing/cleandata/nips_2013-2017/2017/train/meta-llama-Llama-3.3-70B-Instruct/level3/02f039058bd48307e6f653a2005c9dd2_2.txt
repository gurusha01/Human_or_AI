This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by designing a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities and constructing a multivariate covariance function using Cramér's Theorem. The resulting Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between channels in terms of frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay.
The paper is well-structured and provides a thorough introduction to the background and related work on MOGPs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOSM kernel through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including climate signals and heavy metal concentrations. The results show that the MOSM kernel performs competitively with existing MOGP models, particularly in cases where the relationships between channels are complex and non-linear.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and expressive kernel that can capture complex relationships between channels
* The use of Cramér's Theorem to construct a multivariate covariance function, which provides a principled approach to designing MOGP kernels
* The experimental evaluation of the MOSM kernel on a range of datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness in practice
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper is dense and difficult to read, with a large amount of technical notation and mathematical derivations. This may make it challenging for non-experts to follow and understand the contributions of the paper.
* The interpretation of the results could be improved, particularly in terms of understanding the implications of the MOSM kernel for real-world applications.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing MOGP models, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of MOGPs and provides a novel and effective approach to modeling complex relationships between channels. With some revisions to improve clarity and interpretation, the paper has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in this area.
