This paper presents an analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, specifically focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used before and after 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under two different protocols: trickle (pre-2015) and diffusion (post-2015). The paper provides a thorough qualitative and quantitative analysis of the problem, including simulations on regular trees and a snapshot of the real Bitcoin network topology.
The proposed method is interesting, and the results show that both trickle and diffusion protocols have poor anonymity properties, with similar probabilities of detection. The attention maps provided in the paper illustrate the improved attention mechanisms, which is a strength of the paper. The model has thorough qualitative and quantitative experiments, with an impressive shift between unary/pairwise attentions and the final attention.
However, the writing and presentation of the paper are weak and sometimes confusing, which can be improved with more time. The novelty of the architecture feels limited, with added complexity mainly repeating the intuition of previous models. The probabilistic connection is not drawn well and needs to be formalized or clarified. Figure 2 is at an odd level of abstraction and needs to be simplified to emphasize the unary/pairwise/trinary potential generation. Figure 3 is not referenced in the text, and its relevance is unclear.
The reviewer is curious about the learned values for linear coefficients and the under-performance of the 2-Modalities Unary+Pairwise model. The discussion on using sequential MCB vs a single MCT layer for the decision head is interesting but lacks results.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is well-organized, but the writing can be improved for better clarity. The originality of the paper is limited, as it builds upon previous work on epidemic source detection. The significance of the paper is important, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides unique conclusions on existing data.
Overall, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses. The strengths include the interesting proposed method, thorough experiments, and important significance. The weaknesses include the limited novelty, weak writing and presentation, and lack of clarity in some figures and discussions.
