This paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE), which aims to preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity in a network. The authors introduce a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that capture these two properties. The model is trained using a carefully designed objective function that combines the goals of preserving proximity and global node ranking.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow, with a good balance between mathematical derivations and intuitive explanations. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to network embedding that combines proximity preservation and global node ranking.
* The introduction of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure that can jointly learn multiple objectives.
* The provision of a clear and concise theoretical interpretation of the proposed objective function.
* The thorough experimentation and evaluation of the proposed approach on various tasks and datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.
* The limited discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings.
* The absence of a comparison with other state-of-the-art network embedding methods that preserve global node ranking.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods in various tasks. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and hyperparameter tuning process.
