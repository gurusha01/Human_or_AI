This paper presents a well-written and clear investigation into deterministic feature maps for kernel machines, making it a pleasure to read. The authors' work is extremely interesting and well-motivated, as they aim to understand the extent to which randomness is necessary to approximate a kernel. The paper's technical soundness is evident, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem, including a thorough review of related work and a clear explanation of the proposed methods. The authors' use of Gaussian quadrature, polynomially-exact rules, dense grid quadrature, sparse grid quadrature, and reweighted grid quadrature is well-explained and easy to follow.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could benefit from adding comparisons with existing methods to strengthen their paper. The absence of such comparisons is notable, and it would be helpful to see how the proposed methods perform relative to other state-of-the-art approaches.
Additionally, the authors should discuss the robustness of their model to misspecification, including both its strengths and weaknesses. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed methods and their potential limitations.
The sensitivity of the model's fixed tuning parameters should also be explored, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. This would ensure the model's reliability and provide insight into its potential applications.
The scalability and computational complexity of the proposed model need to be addressed, along with the availability of the code and data for reproducibility. This would make it easier for other researchers to build upon the authors' work and verify their results.
Finally, the applications section is somewhat disappointing and requires a longer discussion to fully explore the paper's impact and success. The authors should provide clear conclusions for the user, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of their proposed methods.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria, including quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and their work has the potential to advance the state of the art in kernel machines.
