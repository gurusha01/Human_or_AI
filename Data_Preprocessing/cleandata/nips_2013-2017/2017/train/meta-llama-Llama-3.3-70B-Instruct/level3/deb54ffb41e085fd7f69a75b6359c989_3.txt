This paper introduces a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map, leveraging the concept of Hierarchical Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors demonstrate the improved performance of this approach in a route prediction task, showcasing its ability to scale to larger maps while maintaining tractability. The key contribution lies in the introduction of hierarchical simple-route distributions, which enable the construction of polynomial-sized representations while controlling the loss of exactness on certain queries.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical concepts, including the compilation of Boolean formulas into SDDs and the parameterization of these circuits to obtain PSDDs. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over Markov models and naive baselines in a route prediction task.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical contributions with practical applications. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of hierarchical simple-route distributions, including their representation size and inference complexity. The experimental evaluation is also well-designed, using a real-world dataset of GPS trajectories and a publicly available map of San Francisco.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors only present results on a single dataset and task, which may not be representative of the broader applicability of their approach. Additionally, the computation cost of the hierarchical PSDD compared to the original PSDD is not clearly discussed, which could be an important consideration for practitioners.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, providing a balanced discussion of the trade-offs involved.
The clarity of the paper is also commendable, with clear explanations of the technical concepts and a well-organized structure. The writing is concise and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers with a background in probabilistic graphical models and decision diagrams.
The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of hierarchical simple-route distributions and their application to route prediction tasks. The authors demonstrate a novel combination of familiar techniques, including PSDDs and hierarchical representations, to tackle a challenging problem in a new and innovative way.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to impact the field of probabilistic graphical models and decision diagrams. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems involving structured probability spaces, including rankings, permutations, and paths on graphs.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field and demonstrates a high level of technical quality, clarity, and originality.
