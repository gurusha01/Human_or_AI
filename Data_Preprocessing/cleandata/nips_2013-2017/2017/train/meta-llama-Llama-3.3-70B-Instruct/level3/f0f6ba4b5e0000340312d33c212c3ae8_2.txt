This paper proposes a novel approach to word embeddings, called hash embeddings, which reduces the memory footprint by learning importance parameters and component vectors. The method involves hashing token IDs and importance parameters to obtain word embeddings, resulting in smaller trainable matrices. The authors demonstrate that hash embeddings can handle huge vocabularies and outperform previous bag-of-words models on classification tasks.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to reduce the number of parameters required for word embeddings, making it a promising approach for large-scale natural language processing tasks. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including its relationship to previous work on word embeddings and feature hashing. The experimental results are impressive, showing that hash embeddings can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several classification tasks.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could provide more insight into the computational cost of hashing versus embedding gather on the GPU, as this could be an important consideration for practitioners. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the importance parameters and how they contribute to the overall performance of the model.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field. The experimental results are well-presented and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of hash embeddings.
The clarity of the paper is good, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its components. The organization of the paper is logical, with a clear introduction, related work, and experimental results.
