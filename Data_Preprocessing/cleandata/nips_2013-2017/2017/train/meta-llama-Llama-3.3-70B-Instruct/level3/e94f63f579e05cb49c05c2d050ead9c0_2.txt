This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that learns binary codes directly from a neural network, leveraging both pairwise label information and classification information within a single stream framework. The authors' approach is well-motivated, and their optimization strategy using an alternating minimization method is sound. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read.
The proposed method demonstrates good performance on two benchmark datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art hashing approaches. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their method, including comparisons with various traditional and deep hashing methods. The results show that their approach can effectively learn hash codes that preserve semantic similarity and achieve better retrieval performance.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The paper lacks references to similar work, such as Zhang et al.'s Efficient Training of Very Deep Neural Networks for Supervised Hashing. Additionally, some details on training the network, like hyper-parameters, are missing, which may make it challenging to reproduce the results accurately. The alternating optimization approach would benefit from visualizing the convergence curve of losses to demonstrate its effectiveness.
Furthermore, there are some inconsistencies in the results and explanations presented in Figure 1, which require further experiments to validate the findings. The comparison between DSDH-B and DSDH in Figure 1(a) raises questions about why DSDH-B performs better with more bits.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. However, the lack of references and missing details on training the network may impact the completeness of the work. The authors are careful in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, which is commendable.
The clarity of the paper is excellent, with a well-organized structure and clear explanations. The writing is concise and easy to understand, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of hashing and deep learning.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to learning binary codes directly from a neural network, leveraging both pairwise label information and classification information. The authors' use of an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function is also a unique contribution.
The significance of the paper is evident in its ability to outperform state-of-the-art hashing approaches on benchmark datasets. The proposed method has the potential to advance the state of the art in image retrieval and hashing, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
