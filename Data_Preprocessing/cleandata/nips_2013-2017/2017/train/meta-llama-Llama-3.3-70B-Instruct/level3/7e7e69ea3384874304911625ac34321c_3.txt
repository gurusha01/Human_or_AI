This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The authors introduce a notion of separability for loss functions, which allows them to derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They then instantiate their results for both generative and discriminative models, providing insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the work, and the background and setup sections provide a thorough overview of the problem and the technical machinery used. The separability notion is well-defined and intuitively explained, and the theorems and lemmas are clearly stated and proved.
The experiments in Section 6 provide a nice validation of the theoretical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed thresholded generative estimator in high-dimensional classification tasks. The results show that the generative estimator outperforms the discriminative estimator, especially when the true parameter is not highly sparse.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The introduction of a novel notion of separability for loss functions, which allows for a more nuanced analysis of convergence rates.
* The provision of a general framework for analyzing `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators.
* The instantiation of the results for both generative and discriminative models, providing insights into their behaviors in high-dimensions.
* The experimental validation of the theoretical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.
However, there are some minor concerns:
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could make the paper harder to follow.
* The paper assumes a high level of technical background in statistical machine learning, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it harder for readers to follow the arguments.
Overall, the paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a significant contribution to the field of statistical machine learning. The results are convincing, and the experiments provide a nice validation of the theoretical findings. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.
