This paper proposes a novel approach to contextual linear bandits, introducing a "safe" algorithm that guarantees selecting an action with a larger expected reward than the baseline policy with high probability. The paper is well-written and easy to read, with a clear and concise presentation of the problem setting and approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and demonstrate its effectiveness through empirical studies.
However, I have some questions and concerns regarding the definition of safety and its guarantees. Specifically, I would like clarification on the desirable performance constraint and whether it holds with high probability. The statement of how this constraint is achieved is not entirely clear, and I would appreciate further explanation. Additionally, I am unsure whether the algorithm's guarantee ensures a high probability guarantee at each time step or simultaneously for all time steps. If the algorithm only satisfies a per-time step guarantee, I worry that the motivation for the paper may be undermined, and the introduction should be upfront about the limitations of this approach.
Furthermore, I am critical of the empirical study's guarantee, which bounds the probability of an undesirable event to be at most 1, rendering it meaningless. I believe that a more meaningful guarantee would provide a tighter bound on the probability of undesirable events, and I would like to see a discussion on the importance of per-step high probability guarantees in systems with large numbers of time steps.
In terms of the paper's overall quality, I believe that it is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The approach is novel and significant, addressing a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. However, I do have some concerns about the originality of the work, as some of the ideas and techniques may have been explored in previous research.
Overall, I would argue both for and against acceptance of this paper. On the one hand, the paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of contextual linear bandits, with a well-written and clear presentation. On the other hand, I have concerns about the definition of safety and its guarantees, as well as the empirical study's guarantee, which may undermine the motivation for the paper. With some revisions to address these concerns, I believe that this paper has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field.
