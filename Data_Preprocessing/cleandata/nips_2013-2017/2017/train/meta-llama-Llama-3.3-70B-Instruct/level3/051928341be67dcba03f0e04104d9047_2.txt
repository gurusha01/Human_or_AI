This paper proposes a novel approach to analyze the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used to ensure network consistency. The authors model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties, both pre- and post-2015, when the community changed its flooding mechanism from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading.
The paper's strengths include a generic formulation of attention, a useful ablation study, and clear writing. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of the related work and a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The paper also includes a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method, including simulations on regular trees and a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The analysis of the attention over answers is not clear, and the limited improvement without ternary potentials is not satisfactory. Additionally, there is no discussion on failure cases, which is an important aspect of any proposed method.
Despite these concerns, I recommend acceptance of the paper due to its generic attention framework and quantitative results. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and has the potential to impact the development of more accurate and efficient VQA models.
The post-rebuttal comments highlight some inconsistencies in the authors' response, including potentially swapped numbers and unclear references to existing models' performance. However, these issues do not significantly impact the overall quality of the paper, and I believe that the authors can address these concerns in the final version of the paper.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a novel approach to analyzing the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. The results are important and have the potential to impact the development of more secure and private cryptocurrency systems.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, a clear explanation of the proposed approach, and a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. While there are some weaknesses and concerns, I believe that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance.
