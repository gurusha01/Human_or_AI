This paper proposes a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map, leveraging the concept of hierarchical route distributions and Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors introduce the notion of hierarchical simple-route distributions, which allows for a tractable representation of route distributions by decomposing them into smaller, more manageable components. This approach enables the construction of PSDDs that can scale to larger maps, making it a significant contribution to the field.
The paper is well-written, clearly explaining the existing methods and presenting convincing experiments with provided code. The proposed approach offers substantial benefits, particularly in conditional density estimation, and demonstrates competitive performance in general-purpose density estimation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical foundations of their approach, including theorems and corollaries that establish the correctness and tractability of their method.
The experimental results are impressive, showing that the proposed approach can significantly increase accuracy in a route prediction task compared to Markov models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a real-world dataset of GPS data collected from taxicab routes in San Francisco, which is a challenging and relevant problem.
The paper opens promising avenues for further research, showing potential for improvement and expansion of the proposed methods. The authors discuss the limitations of their approach and provide suggestions for future work, including exploring more efficient algorithms for compiling PSDDs and investigating the application of their method to other domains.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the methodology. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the field.
The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of hierarchical simple-route distributions and the application of PSDDs to this problem domain. The authors provide a novel combination of familiar techniques, which is a significant contribution to the field. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their approach differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in representing and learning distributions over structured objects, particularly in the context of route planning and traffic prediction. The authors demonstrate the practical importance of their approach, showing how it can be used to estimate traffic jams, predict specific routes, and project the impact of interventions.
