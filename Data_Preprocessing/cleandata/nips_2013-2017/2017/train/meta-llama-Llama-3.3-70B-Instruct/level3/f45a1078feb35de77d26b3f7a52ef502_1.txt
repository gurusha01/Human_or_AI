This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling point processes using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs), which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, called WGANTPP, on various synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that it outperforms conventional methods, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches.
The paper's main strengths include its innovative use of WGANs for point process modeling, its ability to handle complex and heterogeneous data, and its robust performance across different datasets. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, such as QQ plots and empirical intensity estimates.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The lack of detailed documentation on the methods and data used in the real analyses may hinder reproducibility. Additionally, the comparison baselines appear weak and unrepresentative, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach's strengths and limitations. The defined distance measure may not effectively handle noise in the form of extraneous events, and a local alignment-based approach may be more suitable. Furthermore, there are potential errors in the paper, including a possible typo in Equation 3 and switched settings for α and c in Section 3.1. The paper also contains spelling errors, such as "demosntrate", which need to be corrected for clarity and professionalism.
