This paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE), which aims to preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity in a network. The authors design a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that satisfy these two objectives. The model is trained using a carefully designed objective function that combines the proximity preservation and global node ranking preservation.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed approach and its connection to existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.
* The design of a multi-task Siamese neural network structure that can learn node embeddings that satisfy these two objectives.
* The provision of a thorough analysis of the proposed approach and its connection to existing methods.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of PRUNE in various tasks through extensive experiments.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations of the paper:
* The paper assumes that the global node ranking is available, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The model requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, which can be time-consuming and may not always lead to optimal results.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network embedding and provides a novel approach to preserving global node ranking and community-aware proximity. However, further work is needed to address the limitations and weaknesses of the paper.
