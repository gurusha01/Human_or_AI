This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that learns binary codes for image retrieval by leveraging both pairwise label information and classification information within a single stream framework. The algorithm constrains the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly and uses an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, taking into account the discrete nature of the hash codes.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the main ideas, providing a useful perspective on understanding neural networks. The proposed method, called Deep Supervised Discrete Hashing (DSDH), is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmark image retrieval datasets, including CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and effective, achieving superior performance on image retrieval tasks.
* The use of both pairwise label information and classification information within a single stream framework is a key contribution, allowing for more efficient and effective learning of hash codes.
* The alternating minimization method used to optimize the loss function is well-suited to the discrete nature of the hash codes.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from more comprehensive evaluations, both theoretical and practical, to further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
* Some minor errors, such as typos and incomplete plots, were noted in the paper.
* The comparison with traditional hashing methods using deep learned features could be more extensive and detailed.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval and hashing, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
