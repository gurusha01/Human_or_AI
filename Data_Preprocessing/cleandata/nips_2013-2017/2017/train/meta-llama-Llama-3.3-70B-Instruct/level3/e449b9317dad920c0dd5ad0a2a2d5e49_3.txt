This paper presents a novel approach to constructing feature maps for kernel machines, leveraging deterministic quadrature rules to approximate the Fourier transform integral. The authors propose several methods, including polynomially-exact quadrature, dense grid construction, sparse grid construction, and reweighted grid construction, which demonstrate improved scaling in the desired accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art random Fourier features method.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the benefits of their approach. The technical contributions are sound, and the theoretical analysis is thorough, providing bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed methods.
The experimental evaluation is convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods on real-world datasets, including MNIST and TIMIT. The results show that the deterministic feature maps can achieve comparable accuracy to random Fourier features, while requiring fewer samples and being faster to compute.
The paper is strong and timely, addressing a significant problem in the field of kernel machines. The availability of code and deployment information would be a helpful addition, allowing other researchers to build upon and apply the proposed methods.
