This paper presents a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies that balance the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection of disease. The authors model the disease as an arbitrary finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate the possibility of external information, such as self-examination or discovery of co-morbidities, that may trigger arrival of the patient to the clinician in advance of a scheduled screening appointment.
The paper is well-structured and well-written, with thorough references to previous work and correct theoretical results. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of their methodology and experimental results. The use of a large breast cancer data set to illustrate the proposed personalized screening policy is a significant strength of the paper.
The authors' approach is based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which is a suitable choice for this problem. They derive a recursive expression for the value function and propose an approximate solution using point-based value iteration (PBVI). The authors also provide bounds on the approximation error and discuss the robustness of their approach to estimation errors.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease. The comparison with current clinical policies and other screening frameworks is thorough and well-presented.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and methodology
* A thorough description of the experimental results and comparison with other approaches
* A robust and well-justified approach to handling estimation errors
* A significant reduction in the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the disease model is known, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors discuss the robustness of their approach to estimation errors, but it would be useful to explore this further.
* The paper focuses on breast cancer, but it would be useful to explore the applicability of the approach to other diseases.
* The computational complexity of the approach could be a limitation in practice, particularly for large datasets.
Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a novel and effective approach to personalized screening policy construction. The authors demonstrate the potential of their approach to reduce the number of screenings performed while maintaining the same delay in detection of disease, which could have significant implications for public health.
