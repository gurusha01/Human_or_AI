This paper presents a novel approach to modeling multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by designing a positive-definite matrix of complex-valued spectral densities and transforming them via the inverse Fourier transform according to Cram√©r's Theorem. The resulting Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel provides a clear interpretation from a spectral viewpoint, allowing for the joint modeling of delays and phase differences between channels.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work in MOGPs. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the MOSM kernel and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the MOSM kernel performs competitively with existing MOGP models, particularly in cases where the signals have complex relationships.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and expressive kernel for MOGPs, which allows for the modeling of rich relationships between channels.
* The provision of a clear and detailed derivation of the MOSM kernel, making it easy to understand and implement.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the MOSM kernel through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the MOSM kernel.
* The experiments could be more comprehensive, including a wider range of datasets and comparison with other state-of-the-art MOGP models.
* The implementation of the MOSM kernel could be made more efficient, particularly for large datasets.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of MOGPs and has the potential to be a valuable tool for modeling complex relationships between channels. With some further development and refinement, the MOSM kernel could become a widely used and influential method in the field.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and expressive kernel for MOGPs, which addresses a significant gap in the current literature.
