This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the stability of Convolutional Kernel Networks (CKNs) with respect to C^1 diffeomorphisms, such as translation. The authors demonstrate that stability holds for appropriately chosen patch sizes, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and technically sound, combining ideas from deep networks and kernels to provide a stability result that can be of interest to the machine learning community.
The submission has several strengths, including its ability to provide a novel combination of familiar techniques and its potential to advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The authors' use of variational inference and density ratio estimation is particularly noteworthy, as it enables accurate variational approximations with implicit variational families. The paper also provides a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach, which is a significant contribution to the field.
However, the submission lacks motivation on the stability analysis, with only a brief mention of its importance in robustness to adversarial examples. Additionally, the notation in the paper can be confusing, such as the overloading of the κ notation, and some equations have superfluous parts or missing definitions. There are also some errors and suggestions for improvement in the paper, including a missing definition of φ, a superfluous part in a displayed equation, and a potential equality in an inequality.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas, and the paper is technically sound. The submission also demonstrates a novel combination of familiar techniques and has the potential to advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in the area of CKNs and stability analysis.
* The authors demonstrate a novel combination of familiar techniques, which has the potential to advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
* The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and technically sound, making it a valuable addition to the conference proceedings.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The submission lacks motivation on the stability analysis, which may make it difficult for readers to understand the significance of the results.
* The notation in the paper can be confusing, which may make it difficult for readers to follow the authors' arguments.
* There are some errors and suggestions for improvement in the paper, which may affect the overall quality of the submission.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and demonstrates a novel combination of familiar techniques. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the issues mentioned above, particularly with regards to motivation and notation, to improve the overall quality of the submission.
