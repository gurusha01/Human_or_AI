This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings, providing novel insights into their performance and sample complexities. The authors develop a notion of separability for loss functions, which enables them to derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They apply this framework to both generative and discriminative models, obtaining results that highlight the importance of separability in determining sample complexity.
The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem, clearly explaining the context and motivations behind their work. The technical developments are rigorous and well-presented, with careful attention to detail and notation. The results are novel and significant, shedding new light on the relative performance of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings.
One potential weakness of the paper is its reliance on certain assumptions, such as the sparsity of the true model parameter. While these assumptions are common in high-dimensional analysis, they may not always hold in practice. Additionally, the paper's focus on exponential family distributions may limit its applicability to other types of models.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider providing more discussion on the implications of their results for practice, as well as exploring extensions to other types of models and distributions. They could also provide more detailed comparisons with existing work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of their approach.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. Its technical quality, clarity, and originality make it a strong candidate for publication.
