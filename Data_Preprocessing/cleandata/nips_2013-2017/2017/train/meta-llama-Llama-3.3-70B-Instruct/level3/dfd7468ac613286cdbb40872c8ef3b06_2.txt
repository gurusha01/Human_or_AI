This paper presents a thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, specifically focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used before and after 2015. The authors model the Bitcoin network as a graph and analyze the probability of deanonymization by an eavesdropper adversary under two protocols: trickle (pre-2015) and diffusion (post-2015). The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of each protocol, discussing the trade-offs between anonymity and efficiency.
The paper's main contributions are threefold: (1) modeling the Bitcoin P2P network and an eavesdropper adversary, (2) analyzing the probability of deanonymization under trickle and diffusion protocols, and (3) evaluating the performance of various estimators, including the first-timestamp estimator and maximum-likelihood estimators. The authors demonstrate that both trickle and diffusion protocols have poor anonymity properties, and the transition from trickle to diffusion did not significantly improve anonymity.
The paper's strengths include its rigorous mathematical analysis, comprehensive simulation results, and clear presentation of the results. The authors provide a detailed comparison of the two protocols, highlighting their similarities and differences. The paper also discusses the limitations of the analysis, including the assumption of a regular tree topology and the omission of certain details of the spreading protocols.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The analysis is limited to a specific class of graphs (d-regular trees), and it is unclear how the results generalize to more complex network topologies. Additionally, the paper assumes a relatively simple adversarial model, which may not capture the full range of potential attacks on the Bitcoin network.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's transaction-flooding protocols. The authors combine techniques from graph theory, probability theory, and machine learning to evaluate the performance of various estimators. The paper's results have significant implications for the design of more secure and anonymous transaction-flooding protocols.
The paper's significance lies in its contribution to the understanding of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. The results have important implications for the security and privacy of Bitcoin users, and the paper's analysis provides a foundation for the development of more secure and anonymous transaction-flooding protocols.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their results. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it makes a significant contribution to the field of cryptocurrency security and anonymity.
