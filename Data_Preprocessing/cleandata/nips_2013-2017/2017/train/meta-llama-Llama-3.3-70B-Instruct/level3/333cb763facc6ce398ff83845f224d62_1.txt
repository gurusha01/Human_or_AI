This paper presents a novel approach to multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by extending the spectral mixture concept to the multi-output scenario. The authors propose a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities, which are then used to construct a multivariate covariance function via Cram√©r's Theorem. The resulting kernel, called the Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel, provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between different channels in terms of frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay.
The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction to the problem and GP fundamentals, and a thorough explanation of the spectral mixture kernel. The experiments are sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, although they may not provide a lot of intuition, particularly with the Jura dataset being difficult to reason about.
The paper builds upon previous work, specifically [1], and provides sufficient novelty to justify publication. The relationship to previous work is well-explained, and the authors demonstrate how their approach extends and improves upon existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and novel approach to modeling cross-covariance in the multi-output case
* A well-explained relationship to previous work
* Competitive performance on real-world datasets
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The experiments may not provide a lot of intuition, particularly with the Jura dataset
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the proposed approach and its potential applications
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to MOGPs
* The proposed kernel provides a clear interpretation of the relationships between different channels
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experiments may not be comprehensive enough to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the proposed approach and its potential applications
Overall, I believe that the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the weaknesses mentioned above to further improve the paper.
