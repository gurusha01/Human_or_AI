This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed framework, including the mathematical formulation of the point process and the Wasserstein distance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes, which does not require prior knowledge of the underlying generative process.
* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based metric, which provides a more robust and stable way to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling various types of point processes, including synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the point process is defined on a compact space, which may not be the case in many real-world applications.
* The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and units in the RNN, and the regularization coefficient.
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling point processes, such as the neural point process model.
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of point process modeling, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. However, further work is needed to address the limitations and weaknesses of the paper.
