This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), to solve the Quadratic Programming (QP) matching problem with doubly stochastic and discrete constraints. The algorithm develops a multiplicative update technique to solve the QP problem directly and naturally. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including its convergence and KKT optimality guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MPGM in various matching tasks, including synthetic data, image sequence data, and real-world image data.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to solving the QP matching problem, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its impressive experimental results. The paper also provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the algorithm and its analysis.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. Firstly, the baselines used in the paper are not representative of the state of the art, making it hard to determine how the results will transfer to stronger models. Secondly, the paper lacks quantitative analysis to show why the proposed method is performing better. For example, analyzing the improvements in generating sentence beginnings could provide more insights into the strengths of the algorithm. Thirdly, the paper does not provide sufficient context of prior work, including similar methodological approaches or attempts to solve similar problems, such as automatic post-editing or globally consistent decoding.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider adding more representative baselines, providing quantitative analysis to support their claims, and including more context of prior work. Additionally, the authors could consider addressing the concerns about the validity and analysis of the results, as well as the lack of comparison with automatic post-editing.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and effective algorithm for solving the QP matching problem, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and machine learning.
