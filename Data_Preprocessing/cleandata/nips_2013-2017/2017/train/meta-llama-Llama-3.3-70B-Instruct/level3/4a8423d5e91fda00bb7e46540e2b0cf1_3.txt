This paper proposes a deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm that learns binary codes for image retrieval by leveraging both pairwise label information and classification information within a single stream framework. The authors constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly, which is a unique aspect of this approach. The algorithm uses an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function, taking into account the discrete nature of the hash codes.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.
One of the strengths of this paper is its ability to fully exploit the semantic information in the data, which is a limitation of previous deep hashing methods. The authors' use of both pairwise label information and classification information allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the data, leading to improved retrieval performance.
However, there are some potential weaknesses to consider. The algorithm's reliance on a single stream framework may limit its ability to handle complex datasets with multiple labels or categories. Additionally, the use of an alternating minimization method may lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions in certain cases.
In terms of originality, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep hashing by proposing a novel approach that combines pairwise label information and classification information within a single stream framework. The authors' use of an alternating minimization method to optimize the loss function is also a unique aspect of this approach.
The significance of this paper lies in its potential to improve image retrieval performance in a variety of applications, such as image search, object detection, and image classification. The authors' approach has the potential to be extended to other domains, such as video retrieval or natural language processing, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of deep hashing and demonstrates strong experimental results. However, I would suggest that the authors consider addressing some of the potential weaknesses mentioned above, such as the limitations of the single stream framework and the use of an alternating minimization method.
