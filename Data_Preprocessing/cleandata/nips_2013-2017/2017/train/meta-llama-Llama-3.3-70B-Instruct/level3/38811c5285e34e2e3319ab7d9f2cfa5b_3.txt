This paper presents a novel approach to reducing the variance of gradient estimates in variational inference, specifically in the context of reparameterized gradient estimators. The authors propose a simple yet effective technique, which they term the "path derivative" estimator, that eliminates the high-variance score function term from the gradient estimate. This technique is applicable to a wide range of variational distributions, including mixture distributions and importance-weighted autoencoders.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the underlying theory and methodology. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, showing significant improvements in performance on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and Omniglot.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a general framework for reducing variance in gradient estimates, which can be applied to a variety of stochastic optimization settings. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator, including its unbiasedness and variance reduction properties.
However, there are some minor errors and suggestions for improvement. For example, there are some formatting issues, such as inconsistent citation styles and missing spaces in some equations. Additionally, some of the figures could be improved for better visibility, particularly when printed in black and white.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, well-organized, and clearly written. The authors provide sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results, and the paper adequately informs the reader about the underlying theory and methodology.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, with some minor revisions to address the formatting issues and suggestions for improvement. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of variational inference, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
