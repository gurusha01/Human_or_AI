This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, PointNet++, designed to process point sets sampled in a metric space. The key idea is to apply a hierarchical structure to learn local features with increasing contextual scales, leveraging the distance metric of the underlying space. The authors propose two novel set abstraction layers, multi-scale grouping (MSG) and multi-resolution grouping (MRG), which adaptively combine features from multiple scales to handle non-uniform point sampling densities.
The paper is well-organized, and the introduction provides a clear motivation for the work. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PointNet++ on various benchmarks, including 2D and 3D point cloud classification and semantic scene labeling tasks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling non-uniform sampling densities.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The contributions of the paper could be more clearly explained in the introduction, and the authors could provide more detailed discussions on the tradeoff between utility, group fairness, and individual fairness. Additionally, the empirical comparisons between PointNet++ and other methods could be more comprehensive, including varying values of hyperparameters and individual fairness comparisons.
The paper's significance lies in its ability to handle non-uniform point sampling densities, which is a common issue in real-world applications. The proposed architecture and set abstraction layers provide a robust and efficient way to learn hierarchical features from point sets, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
