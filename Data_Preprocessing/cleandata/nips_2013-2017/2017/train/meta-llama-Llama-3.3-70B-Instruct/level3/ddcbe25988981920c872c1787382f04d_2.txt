This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), for solving the Quadratic Programming (QP) matching problem with doubly stochastic and discrete constraints. The authors provide a clear and well-written paper, with easy-to-follow proofs and consistent notation. The use of diverse datasets, including synthetic, image sequence, and real-world image data, is a significant strength of the paper.
The MPGM algorithm is shown to have several benefits, including theoretically guaranteed convergence and KKT optimality, empirical generation of sparse solutions, and efficient implementation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MPGM in various matching tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective score and matching accuracy.
However, there are some areas that require further improvement. The paper relies heavily on the hypothesis that increasing mismatch in the kernel improves classification accuracy, which could be more strongly supported. Additionally, the running time benefit of the proposed approach diminishes as sequence lengths increase, warranting further comment from the authors. The paper also lacks clarity on parameters used in the evaluation section, such as epsilon, delta, and B, and additional experiments exploring their impact would be beneficial.
Some datasets are missing from tables 2, 3, and 4, and the authors should consider providing complete results as supplementary material. Furthermore, the paper contains several errors and typos, including formatting issues, incorrect evaluations, and grammatical mistakes, which should be addressed.
Despite these limitations, the paper addresses a specific question with high-quality work, improving computational time of the mismatch kernel, and has potential for significant impact in its field due to the availability of source code. The proposed algorithm is not limited to solving QP matching problems only and can be used in other optimization problems with doubly stochastic constraints in machine learning and computer vision.
In conclusion, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is effective in solving the QP matching problem. However, some areas require further improvement, including providing stronger support for the hypothesis, clarifying parameters, and addressing errors and typos. With these improvements, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
