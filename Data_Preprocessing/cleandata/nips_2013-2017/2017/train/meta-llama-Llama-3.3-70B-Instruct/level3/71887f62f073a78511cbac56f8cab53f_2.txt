This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by designing a positive-definite matrix of complex-valued spectral densities and transforming them via the inverse Fourier transform according to Cram√©r's Theorem. The resulting kernel, called the Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel, provides a clear interpretation from a spectral viewpoint, where each of its parameters can be identified with frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay for a pair of channels.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough background on MOGPs and the challenges associated with designing their covariance kernels. The authors then propose their MOSM kernel, which is a generalization of the spectral mixture approach to MOGPs. The kernel is designed to model rich relationships across multiple outputs, including delays and phase differences, which is a unique feature of the proposed kernel.
The paper also presents an experimental evaluation of the MOSM kernel on two real-world datasets, including climate signals and heavy metal concentrations. The results show that the MOSM kernel performs competitively with existing MOGP models in terms of mean absolute error. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the results and the implications of their work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and readability. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the background and methodology, making it easy for readers to understand the context and significance of their work. The paper also includes a detailed discussion of the results and the implications of the work, which provides valuable insights for readers.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the computational complexity of the MOSM kernel and its scalability to large datasets. Additionally, the authors could explore more applications of the MOSM kernel, such as in signal processing or time series analysis.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper. The MOSM kernel is a novel and significant contribution to the field of MOGPs, and the paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the methodology and results. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for readers interested in MOGPs and spectral mixture models.
