This paper presents a novel approach to multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by designing a positive-definite matrix of complex-valued spectral densities and transforming them via the inverse Fourier transform according to Cram√©r's Theorem. The resulting Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel provides a clear interpretation from a spectral viewpoint, where each of its parameters can be identified with frequency, magnitude, phase, and delay for a pair of channels.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work on MOGPs. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the MOSM kernel and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the MOSM kernel outperforms existing MOGP models in terms of mean absolute error, particularly in cases where the relationships between outputs are complex and non-linear.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to model delays and phase differences between channels, which is a unique feature of the proposed kernel. The authors also provide a clear interpretation of the kernel's parameters, which is essential for understanding the relationships between the outputs.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the computational complexity of the MOSM kernel and its scalability to large datasets. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors have done a good job of referencing related work and providing a comprehensive overview of the field.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to designing MOGP kernels using complex-valued spectral densities. The paper also provides a unique contribution to the field by demonstrating the effectiveness of the MOSM kernel in modeling complex relationships between outputs.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to improve the performance of MOGP models in a wide range of applications, including climate modeling, signal processing, and geostatistics. The paper's results have important implications for practitioners and researchers working with MOGPs, and the proposed MOSM kernel has the potential to become a widely used tool in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of MOGPs. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the proposed methodology and its applications.
