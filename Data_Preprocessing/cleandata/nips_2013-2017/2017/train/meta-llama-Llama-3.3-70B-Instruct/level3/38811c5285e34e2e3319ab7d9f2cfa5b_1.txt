This paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The approach is based on removing the score function term from the standard reparameterized gradient estimator, which reduces the variance of the estimator. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on MNIST and Omniglot datasets.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and derivation of the proposed estimator. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the estimator's properties and compare it to existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed estimator outperforms the standard reparameterized gradient estimator in most cases, especially when the approximate posterior is complex.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise presentation, thorough analysis, and impressive experimental results. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the related work and highlight the differences between their approach and existing methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations of the paper. One limitation is that the proposed estimator is specific to variational inference and may not be applicable to other stochastic optimization settings. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed estimator, which could be an important consideration in practice.
Another potential limitation is that the proposed estimator may not be robust to certain types of noise or outliers in the data. The authors assume that the variational approximation is exact, which may not always be the case in practice. Further research is needed to investigate the robustness of the proposed estimator to different types of noise and outliers.
