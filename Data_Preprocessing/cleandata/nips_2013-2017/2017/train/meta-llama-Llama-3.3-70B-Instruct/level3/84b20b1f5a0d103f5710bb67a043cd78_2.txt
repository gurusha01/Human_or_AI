This paper proposes a novel approach to network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE), which aims to preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity in a network. The authors design a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that satisfy these two objectives. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed approach, including its connection to link prediction and community detection, and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive experiments on various real-world networks.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and well-motivated approach to network embedding that combines global node ranking and community-aware proximity preservation.
* A thorough analysis of the approach, including its connection to link prediction and community detection.
* Extensive experiments on various real-world networks that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing network embedding methods, particularly those that also aim to preserve global node ranking and community-aware proximity.
* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers and the activation functions used.
* The paper could be improved by providing more visualizations and illustrations of the learned embeddings, to help intuition and understanding of the results.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of network embedding, and its proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable and useful in various domains. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments, and have provided a thorough analysis of the underlying methodology.
