This paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The authors provide a simple and general implementation of this trick in terms of a single change to the computation graph operated on by standard automatic differentiation packages. They also generalize their gradient estimator to mixture and importance-weighted lower bounds and discuss extensions to flow-based approximate posteriors.
The paper is well-written and clear, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the behavior of the proposed gradient estimator, both theoretically and empirically. They also demonstrate the efficacy of their method through experimental results on MNIST and Omniglot datasets using variational and importance-weighted autoencoders.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator, which is a common problem in variational inference. The proposed method is also easy to implement and can be used with existing software packages that provide automatic differentiation.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that it does not analyze the case where the variational distribution differs from the true distribution, which could introduce bias in the proposed estimator and have adversarial effects. The authors also question the mixture ELBO formulation, specifically the lack of a variational distribution over πc and the definition of zc, and how these choices affect reparameterization.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to reducing the variance of the gradient estimator, which is a significant contribution to the field of variational inference. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the behavior of the proposed gradient estimator and demonstrates its efficacy through experimental results.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to improve the performance of variational inference methods, which are widely used in many applications. The proposed method has the potential to be used in a variety of settings, including reinforcement learning and gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
Overall, the paper is well-written, clear, and provides a significant contribution to the field of variational inference. The proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of variational inference methods and is easy to implement using existing software packages.
