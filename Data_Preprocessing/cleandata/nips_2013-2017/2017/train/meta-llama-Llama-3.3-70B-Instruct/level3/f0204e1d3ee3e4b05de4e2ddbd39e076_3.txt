This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The authors develop a novel framework to study the `1 and `2 convergence rates of these models, leveraging a notion of separability of loss functions. The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
The key strengths of the paper are:
1. Technical contributions: The authors introduce a new notion of separability, which allows them to derive `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators. This contribution is significant, as it provides a unified framework for analyzing the convergence rates of various models.
2. Comparative analysis: The paper provides a thorough comparison of the generative and discriminative approaches, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios. This analysis is valuable, as it helps readers understand the trade-offs between these models.
3. Theoretical guarantees: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for their results, including bounds on the `1 and `2 errors of the estimates. These guarantees are essential, as they ensure the reliability of the proposed methods.
Some potential weaknesses of the paper are:
1. Assumptions: The authors make several assumptions about the data distribution and the model parameters, which might not always hold in practice. It would be interesting to see how the results generalize to more realistic settings.
2. Computational complexity: The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the models, but does not provide a detailed analysis of their computational complexity. This could be an important consideration in practice, especially for large-scale datasets.
3. Empirical evaluation: While the paper includes some experimental results, they are limited to a specific setting (isotropic Gaussian models). It would be beneficial to see a more extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed methods, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art approaches.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant technical contribution, introducing a new notion of separability that can be applied to various models.
* The comparative analysis of generative and discriminative models is thorough and well-motivated, providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers.
* The theoretical guarantees provided by the authors are rigorous and reliable, ensuring the accuracy of the proposed methods.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumptions made by the authors might be too restrictive, limiting the applicability of the results to real-world scenarios.
* The paper could benefit from a more extensive empirical evaluation, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art approaches.
* The computational complexity of the proposed methods is not thoroughly analyzed, which could be an important consideration in practice.
Overall, I believe that the paper presents a significant contribution to the field, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the potential weaknesses in a future revision.
