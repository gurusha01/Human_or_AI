This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based objective function to train the GAN, which is shown to be more effective in capturing the underlying distribution of the point process data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The proposed framework, WGANTPP, is thoroughly explained, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in modeling various types of point processes, including synthetic and real-world data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using a GAN framework, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional intensity-based modeling.
* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based objective function, which is shown to be more effective in capturing the underlying distribution of the point process data.
* The thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, which demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling various types of point processes.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes.
* The limited analysis of the proposed approach, which could be further explored to provide a deeper understanding of its strengths and limitations.
* The potential for mode dropping, which is a common issue in GAN-based approaches, and the need for further investigation to mitigate this issue.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of temporal point process modeling, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework.
