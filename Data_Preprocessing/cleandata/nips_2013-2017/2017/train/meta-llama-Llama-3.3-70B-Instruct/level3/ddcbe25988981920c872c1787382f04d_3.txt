This paper presents a novel algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), for solving the Quadratic Programming (QP) matching problem with doubly stochastic and discrete constraints. The algorithm is well-motivated and clearly introduced, with a good overview of the problem and related works. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including its convergence and KKT optimality.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to solve the general QP problem with doubly stochastic constraint directly and naturally, its empirical ability to generate sparse solutions, and its efficiency and simplicity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPGM algorithm on various matching tasks, including synthetic data, image sequence data, and real-world image data.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The presentation and structuring of the algorithm in Section 3 could be improved, with too much technical notation and clutter hindering understanding of the main ideas. Some details could be moved to the appendix to improve readability. Additionally, the theory behind the algorithm could be connected to the generalization error in the downstream algorithm, such as through perturbation analysis or controlling the error of the estimated decision boundary.
The experimental results could also be improved, including checking runtime for various parameters, providing instructive synthetic examples, and demonstrating the algorithm's ability to solve previously unsolved problems or achieve better accuracy. Minor issues include missing axis units in Figure 1, typos, and unclear notation and parameter explanations in Algorithm 1.
Overall, the paper presents a good first step towards developing an effective algorithm for graph matching problems. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
