This paper presents a novel approach to sequence classification by introducing an efficient algorithm for evaluating string kernels based on inexact matching of subsequences (k-mers). The authors derive a closed-form expression for the size of intersection of m-mismatch neighborhoods of two k-mers and propose a statistical estimate of the number of k-mer pairs at a fixed distance between two sequences. The algorithm is shown to be polynomial-time and provides probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the approximation.
The paper is technically sound, with detailed proofs and supportive experiments. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification performance with an order of magnitude speedup over existing solutions. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear, making it easy to follow.
One of the significant strengths of the paper is its ability to handle large values of k and m, which are known to yield better classification results but are not feasible with existing algorithms. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the runtime and quality of their algorithm, including theoretical bounds on the error and empirical evaluations on real-world datasets.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the trade-off between the accuracy of the Shapley value estimation and computational efficiency. Additionally, some of the notation and definitions, such as the variable \bar{S}, could be clarified with more explanations or an algorithm flow for model-specific approximations.
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of interpretable methods by linking the Shapley value to existing methods and providing a theoretical framework for feature importance methods. The authors are encouraged to explore linking the Shapley value to gradient-based approaches, such as those used in saliency maps and all convolutional networks, to further broaden the impact of the work.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and the related work. The algorithm proposed in the paper has the potential to guide future research in interpretable methods and sequence classification.
