This paper proposes a novel approach to constructing feature maps for kernel machines, leveraging deterministic quadrature rules to approximate the kernel's Fourier transform integral. The authors demonstrate that their method can achieve better scaling in the desired accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art random Fourier features method. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical bounds on the behavior of their method, including the sample complexity and error bounds.
* The paper includes a range of experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in practice.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the construction of the feature maps, making it easy to follow and implement.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other related work, such as quasi-Monte Carlo estimation and Nystr√∂m method.
* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of parameters, such as the degree of polynomial exactness and the number of samples.
* The paper could be improved by including more visualizations and plots to help illustrate the results and comparisons.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of kernel machines and provides a promising alternative to random Fourier features. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in practice and provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical bounds.
