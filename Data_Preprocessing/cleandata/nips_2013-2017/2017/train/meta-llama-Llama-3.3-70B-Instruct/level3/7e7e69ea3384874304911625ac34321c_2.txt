This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The authors introduce a notion of separability for loss functions, which allows them to derive `1 and `2 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They then instantiate their results for both generative and discriminative models, providing insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical machinery developed in the paper is impressive, and the authors do a good job of explaining the intuition behind their definitions and theorems. The experiments section provides a nice validation of the theoretical results, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in high-dimensional classification tasks.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified analysis of both generative and discriminative models. The authors show that their framework can be used to derive convergence rates for a wide range of models, including isotropic Gaussians and Gaussian graphical models. The paper also provides a nice comparison between the generative and discriminative approaches, highlighting the trade-offs between the two.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is that the authors assume a high level of technical expertise from the reader. While the paper is well-written, some of the technical details may be difficult for non-experts to follow. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion of the practical implications of the results. While the authors provide some nice experimental results, it would be helpful to see more discussion of how the results could be used in practice.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all of the criteria. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The paper is also original, and the authors provide a novel contribution to the field. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a clear discussion of how their work differs from previous contributions.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper to the conference. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the technical material. While there are a few areas where the paper could be improved, the strengths of the paper far outweigh the weaknesses.
