This paper presents a novel approach to the best action identification problem in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a key component of many successful game-playing AI systems. The authors introduce a generic architecture, called BAI-MCTS, that combines a Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithm with an exploration of the tree based on confidence intervals on the node values. They propose two specific instances, UGapE-MCTS and LUCB-MCTS, which rely on confidence-based BAI algorithms.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms, including a proof of their (ε, δ)-correctness and a high-probability upper bound on their sample complexity. The authors also provide an experimental validation of their algorithms, demonstrating their superiority over the state-of-the-art FindTopWinner algorithm in various settings.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the necessary background and related work. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms.
