This paper introduces the PixelGAN autoencoder, a generative autoencoder that combines a PixelCNN with a GAN inference network to impose arbitrary priors on the latent code. The authors demonstrate that different priors can be used to learn different decompositions of information between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder. For example, a Gaussian prior can be used to achieve a global vs. local decomposition, while a categorical prior can be used to disentangle style and content information in an unsupervised fashion.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the architecture and training procedure of the PixelGAN autoencoder. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's capabilities and limitations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning tasks on several datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, and NORB.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance the trade-off between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder. By modifying the ELBO to remove the mutual information term, the authors encourage the model to learn more useful representations. The use of a categorical prior to disentangle style and content information is also a significant contribution.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is the lack of a clear evaluation metric for the generative capabilities of the model. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in semi-supervised learning tasks, they do not provide a thorough evaluation of the model's ability to generate high-quality samples.
Overall, the paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's capabilities and limitations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in several tasks.
