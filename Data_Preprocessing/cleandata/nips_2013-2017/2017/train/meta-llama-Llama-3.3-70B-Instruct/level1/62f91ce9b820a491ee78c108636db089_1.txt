This paper proposes a deterministic approach to constructing feature maps for kernel machines, as an alternative to the widely used random Fourier features method. The authors investigate several deterministic quadrature rules, including polynomially-exact quadrature, dense grid construction, sparse grid construction, and reweighted grid construction. They provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity of these methods and demonstrate their effectiveness on real-world datasets, including MNIST and TIMIT.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work. The technical contributions are significant, and the experimental results are impressive. The use of deterministic feature maps can lead to better scaling in the desired accuracy compared to random Fourier features, and the authors demonstrate this on several datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed methods.
* The experimental results are well-presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with kernel methods and quadrature rules, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work, such as quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The technical contributions are significant, and the experimental results are impressive. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work.
