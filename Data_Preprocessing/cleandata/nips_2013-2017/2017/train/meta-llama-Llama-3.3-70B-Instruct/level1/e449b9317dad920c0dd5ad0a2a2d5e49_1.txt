This paper proposes a novel approach to automated cell extraction in calcium imaging datasets using robust statistical estimation. The authors introduce a mathematical abstraction of imaging datasets and derive a minimax optimal robust loss function using the theory of M-estimation. They also propose a fast fixed-point optimization routine for solving the robust estimation problem, which has provably fast convergence. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their robust estimation approach over existing methods on both simulated and real datasets.
