This paper presents a thorough analysis of the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, specifically focusing on the transaction-flooding protocols used to ensure network consistency. The authors model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties, both pre- and post-2015, when the community changed its flooding mechanism from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading.
The paper's main contribution is to show that Bitcoin's flooding protocols have poor anonymity properties, and the community's shift from trickle spreading to diffusion did not improve the situation. The authors identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators, including the first-timestamp estimator and the maximum-likelihood estimator, and demonstrate that both trickle and diffusion exhibit roughly the same, poor anonymity properties.
The paper's strengths include its rigorous modeling and analysis of the Bitcoin network, its consideration of different adversarial models, and its simulation results on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology. The authors also provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methods and results, making the paper easy to follow.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The analysis is limited to regular tree-structured networks, which may not accurately represent the real Bitcoin network topology. Additionally, the authors assume that the adversary has a fixed number of connections to each server, which may not be realistic in practice.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides new insights into the anonymity properties of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network. The authors also provide a clear motivation for their work and demonstrate its relevance to the field of cryptocurrency and anonymity.
