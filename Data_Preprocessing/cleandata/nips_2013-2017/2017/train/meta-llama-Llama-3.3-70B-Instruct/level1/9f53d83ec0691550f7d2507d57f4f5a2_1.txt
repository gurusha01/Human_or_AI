This paper introduces a robust algorithm, TranSync, for the 1D translation synchronization problem, which aims to recover global coordinates of nodes from noisy measurements of relative coordinates. The algorithm applies truncated least squares, where the solution at each step is used to gradually prune out noisy measurements. The authors analyze TranSync under both deterministic and randomized noisy models, demonstrating its robustness and stability. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that TranSync is superior to state-of-the-art convex formulations in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
The paper relates to previous work on map synchronization, which includes applying greedy algorithms, combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, and non-convex optimization techniques. The authors highlight the limitations of existing methods, such as the inability to handle biased noisy measurements and the high computational cost of convex optimizations. TranSync addresses these limitations by providing a scalable and accurate solution that can handle biased noisy measurements.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel algorithm, TranSync, which is shown to be robust and scalable.
* The provision of theoretical analysis under both deterministic and randomized noisy models, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and stability.
* The presentation of experimental results on synthetic and real datasets, which demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over state-of-the-art convex formulations.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a specific noise model, which may not be applicable in all scenarios.
* The lack of comparison with other non-convex optimization techniques, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of TranSync's performance.
* The need for further analysis to close the gap between the current recovery rate and the lower bound, which exhibits a poly-log factor.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel algorithm that addresses the limitations of existing methods.
* The theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the algorithm's robustness and stability.
* The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over state-of-the-art convex formulations.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption of a specific noise model may limit the algorithm's applicability.
* The lack of comparison with other non-convex optimization techniques may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of TranSync's performance.
* The need for further analysis to close the gap between the current recovery rate and the lower bound may be a significant limitation.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of translation synchronization, and the introduction of TranSync has the potential to impact various applications, including joint alignment of point clouds and ranking from relative comparisons. However, further analysis and comparison with other techniques are necessary to fully evaluate the algorithm's performance and limitations.
