This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN), which combines the strengths of both multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs. The FS-RNN processes sequential data on different timescales and learns complex transition functions from one time step to the next. The authors evaluate the FS-RNN on two character-level language modeling datasets, Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, and achieve state-of-the-art results. The paper also presents an empirical investigation of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN, which explains the improved performance compared to other RNN architectures.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed architecture and its advantages. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a good overview of the existing RNN architectures and their limitations. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the performance of the FS-RNN on the two datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel RNN architecture that combines the strengths of multiscale and deep transition RNNs
* The achievement of state-of-the-art results on two character-level language modeling datasets
* A thorough analysis of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN
* A clear and concise explanation of the proposed architecture and its advantages
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art RNN architectures, such as the Recurrent Highway Network (RHN) and the Clockwork RNN
* The limited evaluation of the FS-RNN on only two datasets, which may not be representative of its performance on other tasks and datasets
* The need for a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and memory requirements of the FS-RNN
Arguments for acceptance:
* The proposal of a novel RNN architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results on two character-level language modeling datasets
* The thorough analysis of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN
* The potential of the FS-RNN to improve performance on other tasks and datasets
Arguments against acceptance:
* The limited evaluation of the FS-RNN on only two datasets
* The lack of a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art RNN architectures
* The need for a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and memory requirements of the FS-RNN
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel RNN architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results on two character-level language modeling datasets and provides a thorough analysis of its learning and network dynamics. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses of the paper, such as providing a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art RNN architectures and evaluating the FS-RNN on more datasets.
