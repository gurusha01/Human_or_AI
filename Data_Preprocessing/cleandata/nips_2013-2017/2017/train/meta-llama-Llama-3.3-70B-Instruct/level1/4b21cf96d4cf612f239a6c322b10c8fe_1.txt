This paper proposes two novel models, Gaussian Mixture Model Conditional Variational Autoencoder (GMM-CVAE) and Additive Gaussian Conditional Variational Autoencoder (AG-CVAE), for image caption generation. The authors argue that standard Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) with a fixed Gaussian prior yield descriptions with too little variability. To address this issue, they introduce a structured latent space with multiple modes, each corresponding to different types of image content.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the mathematical formulations and the experimental setup. The proposed models are evaluated on the MSCOCO dataset, and the results show that both GMM-CVAE and AG-CVAE outperform the baseline models, including a strong LSTM baseline and a "vanilla" CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior. The AG-CVAE model, in particular, shows promising results, with improved diversity and controllability.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel approach to image caption generation, which addresses the issue of limited variability in standard CVAEs.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed models, including the mathematical formulations and the experimental setup.
* The results show that the proposed models outperform the baseline models, including a strong LSTM baseline and a "vanilla" CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the object categories are known and can be detected reliably, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the failure cases, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of the proposed models.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art models, including those that use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or other approaches.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to image caption generation, which addresses a significant limitation of standard CVAEs.
* The results show that the proposed models outperform the baseline models, including a strong LSTM baseline and a "vanilla" CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed models, including the mathematical formulations and the experimental setup.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the object categories are known and can be detected reliably, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the failure cases, which could provide valuable insights into the limitations of the proposed models.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art models, including those that use GANs or other approaches.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image caption generation and provides a novel approach to addressing the issue of limited variability in standard CVAEs. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the failure cases and a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models.
