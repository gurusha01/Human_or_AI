This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization, by introducing a deliberation process into the encoder-decoder framework. The authors argue that the traditional one-pass decoding process lacks the ability to refine and polish the generated sequence, which is a common behavior in human cognition. To address this, they propose a deliberation network that consists of two decoders: a first-pass decoder that generates a raw sequence, and a second-pass decoder that refines and polishes the raw sequence.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and architecture of the deliberation network. The authors provide a detailed description of the model, including the encoder, first-pass decoder, and second-pass decoder, as well as the optimization algorithm used to train the model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network on two sequence generation tasks: neural machine translation and text summarization.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel approach to sequence generation tasks that addresses the limitation of traditional one-pass decoding processes.
* The clear and detailed explanation of the deliberation network architecture and optimization algorithm.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network on two sequence generation tasks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the encoder-decoder framework and sequence generation tasks, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the deliberation network.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other related work, such as post-editing and review networks, which could help to better understand the contributions of the deliberation network.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks that addresses a significant limitation of traditional one-pass decoding processes.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network on two sequence generation tasks.
* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and architecture of the deliberation network.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the encoder-decoder framework and sequence generation tasks, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the deliberation network.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other related work, such as post-editing and review networks, which could help to better understand the contributions of the deliberation network.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and proposes a novel approach to sequence generation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deliberation network, and the paper is a good contribution to the field. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results and a clear comparison with other related work. I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address these issues.
