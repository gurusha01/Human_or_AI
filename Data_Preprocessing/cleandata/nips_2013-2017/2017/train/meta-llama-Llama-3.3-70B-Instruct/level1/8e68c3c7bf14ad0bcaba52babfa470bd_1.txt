This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating human feedback into reinforcement learning (RL) for image captioning tasks. The authors argue that natural language feedback can provide a stronger learning signal than numeric rewards, as it can point to specific mistakes and suggest corrections. The paper presents a hierarchical phrase-based RNN captioning model that can be integrated with human feedback, and a feedback network that provides rewards to the learner based on the feedback.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that it outperforms baseline RL models and achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO dataset.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to incorporating human feedback into RL, which has the potential to improve the performance of RL agents in a variety of tasks.
* The design of a hierarchical phrase-based RNN captioning model that can be integrated with human feedback, which is a significant contribution to the field of image captioning.
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed method, which demonstrates its effectiveness and provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The reliance on a large amount of human-annotated data, which may be time-consuming and expensive to collect.
* The potential for annotator noise and bias in the feedback data, which may affect the performance of the proposed method.
* The limited scope of the paper, which focuses on image captioning tasks and may not be directly applicable to other RL tasks.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of RL and image captioning. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of RL agents and provide a more natural and intuitive way of interacting with humans.
