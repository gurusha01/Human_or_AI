This paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The authors analyze the behavior of this gradient estimator theoretically and empirically, and generalize it to more complex variational distributions such as mixtures and importance-weighted posteriors.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and derivation of the proposed estimator. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the estimator's properties and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results on MNIST and Omniglot datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed estimator is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing variational inference frameworks.
* The authors provide a clear and concise derivation of the estimator, making it easy to understand and follow.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator in reducing variance and improving performance.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the variational approximation is exact, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other existing variance reduction techniques, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed estimator.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties, such as its convergence rate and robustness to hyperparameter choices.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective variance reduction technique for variational inference.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator in improving performance.
* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and derivation of the proposed estimator.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the variational approximation is exact, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other existing variance reduction techniques.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of variational inference and deserves to be accepted. However, I would like to see more detailed analysis of the estimator's properties and a thorough comparison with other existing variance reduction techniques.
