This paper proposes a novel learning framework called hyperspherical convolution (SphereConv) that projects parameter learning onto unit hyperspheres, where layer activations only depend on the geodesic distance between kernels and input signals. The authors introduce SphereNet, a deep hyperspherical convolution network that adopts SphereConv as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by a generalized angular softmax loss. The paper provides theoretical insights into the advantages of learning on hyperspheres, including improved conditioning and alleviation of training difficulties.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the development of the SphereConv operator and the SphereNet architecture. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various image classification tasks.
