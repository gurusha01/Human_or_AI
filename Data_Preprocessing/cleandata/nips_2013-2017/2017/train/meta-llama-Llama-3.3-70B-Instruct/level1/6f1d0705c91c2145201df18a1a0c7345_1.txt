This paper introduces hierarchical implicit models (HIMs), a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that define models via simulators of data with rich hidden structure, and likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several applications, including a large-scale physical simulator for predator-prey populations, a Bayesian generative adversarial network for discrete data, and a deep implicit model for text generation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the methodology and algorithms used. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and provide a comparison with existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new class of models, HIMs, which combines the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling.
* The development of a scalable variational inference algorithm, LFVI, which can handle large datasets and complex models.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach on several applications, including a large-scale physical simulator and a Bayesian generative adversarial network.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in Bayesian inference, variational inference, and generative models, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The experiments, while demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach, are limited to a few applications and may not be representative of the broader range of potential use cases.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential challenges of the approach, such as the stability of the ratio estimator and the choice of hyperparameters.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new class of models and a scalable variational inference algorithm, which is a significant technical contribution.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on several applications, which is a strong indication of the practical impact of the work.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts.
* The experiments are limited to a few applications, which may not be representative of the broader range of potential use cases.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential challenges of the approach.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field and should be accepted. The technical contributions are significant, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. While there are some limitations and potential challenges, these can be addressed in future work, and the paper provides a solid foundation for further research in this area.
