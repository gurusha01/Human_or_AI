This paper proposes a method for constructing a selective classifier given a trained neural network, allowing for a desired risk level to be set and guaranteed with high probability. The authors introduce a selection function that rejects instances as needed to achieve the desired risk, and demonstrate the viability of their method on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem setting, the proposed algorithm, and the empirical results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors address a significant problem in deep learning, which is the need for selective classification in mission-critical applications.
* The proposed algorithm is simple and efficient, and can be easily implemented using existing deep learning frameworks.
* The empirical results are impressive, demonstrating that the method can achieve high accuracy with guaranteed risk control.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The authors assume that the neural network classifier is already trained, and do not consider the problem of simultaneously training the classifier and the selection function.
* The paper only considers the 0/1 loss function, and does not explore other loss functions or regression tasks.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of deep learning, addressing a critical problem in selective classification.
* The proposed algorithm is efficient and easy to implement, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
* The empirical results are strong, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method on challenging datasets.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper has some limitations, including the assumption that the neural network classifier is already trained, and the lack of exploration of other loss functions or regression tasks.
* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is not thoroughly analyzed, which could be a concern for large-scale applications.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing methods for selective classification, to better understand the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance.
