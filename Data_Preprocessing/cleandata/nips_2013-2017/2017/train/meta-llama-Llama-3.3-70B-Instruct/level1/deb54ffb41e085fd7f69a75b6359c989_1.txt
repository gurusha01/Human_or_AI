This paper proposes a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors introduce the concept of hierarchical route distributions, which allows for the construction of tractable PSDDs over route distributions, enabling them to scale to larger maps. The paper provides a thorough review of PSDDs and their application to structured probability spaces, including routes on a map.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new concept, hierarchical route distributions, which advances the state-of-the-art in learning distributions over routes.
* The provision of a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, including complexity and correctness guarantees.
* The presentation of empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a route prediction task.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the hierarchical decomposition of the route distribution is exact, which may not always be the case.
* The potential loss of exactness on some queries due to the hierarchical representation.
* The reliance on a specific encoding and compilation technique for constructing the PSDDs, which may not be optimal for all cases.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a clear understanding of the proposed approach.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real-world application.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption of exactness in the hierarchical decomposition may not always hold, which could limit the applicability of the approach.
* The potential loss of exactness on some queries may be a significant drawback in certain applications.
* The reliance on a specific encoding and compilation technique may limit the flexibility of the approach.
Overall, the paper presents a well-written and well-structured contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and structured probability spaces. The introduction of hierarchical route distributions is a significant advancement, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, the potential limitations and assumptions of the approach should be carefully considered.
