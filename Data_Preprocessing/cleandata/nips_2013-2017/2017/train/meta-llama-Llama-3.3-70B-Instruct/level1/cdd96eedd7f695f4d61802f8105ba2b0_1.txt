This paper proposes a novel unsupervised generative approach for network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE). The authors formulate a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to connect embedding vectors and preserve the global node ranking and local proximity of nodes. The paper provides a deeper analysis to connect the proposed proximity objective to link prediction and community detection in the network.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The authors propose a novel objective function that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that only preserve one of these properties.
* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function, including its connection to link prediction and community detection.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various supervised learning tasks, including learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction.
* The authors also provide a robustness analysis to show that their method is robust to missing edges in the network.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The paper assumes that the network is directed and homogeneous, which may not be the case in many real-world networks.
* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers and the activation functions.
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in network embedding, such as GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Network.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for network embedding that preserves both global node ranking and community-aware proximity.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various supervised learning tasks.
* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed objective function.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a directed and homogeneous network, which may not be the case in many real-world networks.
* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters.
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in network embedding.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network embedding and should be accepted. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a clear explanation of how to choose the hyperparameters and comparing their method with other state-of-the-art methods.
