This paper proposes a novel deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval. The main idea is to learn binary codes that preserve the similarity relationship and keep the label consistent simultaneously. The authors use a CNN to learn the image representation and hash function simultaneously, with the last layer of the CNN outputting binary codes directly based on pairwise label information and classification information.
The paper relates to previous work on hashing methods, including data-independent and data-dependent methods, as well as deep learning-based hashing methods. The authors highlight the limitations of previous deep hashing methods, such as not fully exploiting semantic information, and propose a new approach that uses both pairwise label information and classification information to learn the hash codes under one stream framework.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark image retrieval datasets, including CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including comparisons with traditional hashing methods and other deep hashing methods.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its advantages.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed method requires a large amount of training data to learn the hash function, which may not be feasible for some applications.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which may be important for large-scale image retrieval applications.
* Some of the experimental results are reported from previous works, which may not be directly comparable to the proposed method.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark image retrieval datasets.
* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results and comparisons with other methods.
* The proposed method has the potential to be applied to other applications, such as video retrieval and recommendation systems.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The proposed method requires a large amount of training data, which may not be feasible for some applications.
* The computational complexity of the proposed method is not clearly analyzed.
* Some of the experimental results are reported from previous works, which may not be directly comparable to the proposed method.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and effective deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm for image retrieval, and provides a detailed analysis of the results and comparisons with other methods. However, the authors should be encouraged to provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its potential applications.
