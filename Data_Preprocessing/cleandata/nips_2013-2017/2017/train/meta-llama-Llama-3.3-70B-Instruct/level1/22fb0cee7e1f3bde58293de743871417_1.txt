This paper presents a novel framework for constructing personalized screening policies for disease diagnosis, which balances the cost of screening against the cost of delay in detection. The authors model the disease as a finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state and incorporate external information that may trigger early arrival at the clinician. The paper develops a computationally tractable algorithm, DPSCREEN, to construct approximately optimal screening policies.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the development of the algorithm. The use of a breast cancer dataset to illustrate the methodology is helpful in demonstrating the practical applicability of the approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The development of a novel framework for personalized screening policies that can handle arbitrary finite state stochastic processes and external information.
* The provision of a computationally tractable algorithm, DPSCREEN, which can be used to construct approximately optimal screening policies.
* The use of a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
* The comparison with existing clinical policies, which shows that the proposed approach can reduce the number of screenings while maintaining the same delay in detection.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the disease model is known, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors do discuss the impact of estimation error on the policy, but more work could be done to address this issue.
* The computational complexity of the algorithm, which may be a limitation for very large datasets or complex disease models.
* The lack of comparison with other personalized screening approaches, which would help to establish the superiority of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of personalized screening policies and has the potential to impact clinical practice. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach using a real-world dataset, and the results are promising.
