This paper proposes a novel approach to decoding neural activity in intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) using a dynamic Bayesian network with multiscale semi-Markov dynamics. The authors introduce a flexible likelihood model that extends the traditional cosine tuning model to allow for multimodal tuning curves and narrower peaks. The proposed model, called the multiscale semi-Markov model (MSSM), explicitly represents the relationship between the goal position, the cursor position, and the angle of intended movement.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the background, methodology, and results. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the current state-of-the-art in iBCIs and motivates the need for a new approach. The methodology section is detailed and well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the MSSM model and its components.
The results section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the MSSM model, including offline experiments with recorded neural data and online clinical trial tests. The authors demonstrate a significant improvement over the Kalman filter in offline experiments and promising preliminary results in clinical trial tests. The figures and tables are well-organized and provide a clear visualization of the results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed MSSM model is novel and addresses the limitations of current iBCI decoding approaches.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the model, including offline and online experiments.
* The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the Kalman filter, which is the current state-of-the-art in iBCI decoding.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model is complex, and the authors could provide more intuition about how the different components of the model interact.
* The online clinical trial tests are preliminary, and more extensive testing is needed to fully evaluate the model's performance.
* The authors could provide more discussion about the potential limitations and challenges of implementing the MSSM model in clinical practice.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach. The results are promising, and the paper contributes to the advancement of the field of iBCIs.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to iBCI decoding that addresses the limitations of current methods.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the model, including offline and online experiments.
* The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the Kalman filter.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The model is complex, and more intuition is needed about how the different components interact.
* The online clinical trial tests are preliminary, and more extensive testing is needed.
* The authors could provide more discussion about the potential limitations and challenges of implementing the MSSM model in clinical practice.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide more intuition about the model's components and their interaction, and discuss the potential limitations and challenges of implementing the MSSM model in clinical practice. Additionally, more extensive online clinical trial tests are needed to fully evaluate the model's performance.
