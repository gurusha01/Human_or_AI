This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The paper provides a thorough review of the background and related work, and presents a clear and well-structured methodology.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new and innovative approach for modeling temporal point processes, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.
* The use of a Wasserstein distance-based metric, which provides a more robust and stable way to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it difficult to implement and interpret for practitioners without a strong background in GANs and point processes.
* The lack of a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for modeling temporal point processes, which makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.
* The limited discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach, which may limit its impact and relevance to a broader audience.
Arguments for acceptance:

Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and innovative approach for modeling temporal point processes, and demonstrates its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets. However, I would suggest that the authors provide a clearer comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, and discuss the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach in more detail.
