This paper revisits the classical analysis of generative vs discriminative models for general exponential families in high-dimensional settings. The authors develop novel technical machinery, including a notion of separability of general loss functions, which allows them to provide a general framework to obtain `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They use this machinery to analyze `1 and `2 convergence rates of generative and discriminative models and provide insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical developments are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the separability of different loss functions. The results are interesting and provide new insights into the behavior of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings.
The paper has several strengths. First, the authors develop a novel notion of separability of loss functions, which allows them to analyze the convergence rates of M-estimators in a more general setting. Second, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the separability of different loss functions, including logistic regression and generative exponential families. Third, the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach, making the paper accessible to a wide range of readers.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. First, the paper is quite technical, and some readers may find it challenging to follow the mathematical developments. Second, the authors could provide more intuition and motivation for their approach, particularly for readers who are not familiar with the technical details of M-estimation. Third, the paper could benefit from more numerical experiments and simulations to illustrate the practical implications of the authors' results.
In terms of the review criteria, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The results are original and provide new insights into the behavior of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. However, the paper could score better on significance, as the authors could provide more discussion on the practical implications of their results and how they relate to existing work in the field.
