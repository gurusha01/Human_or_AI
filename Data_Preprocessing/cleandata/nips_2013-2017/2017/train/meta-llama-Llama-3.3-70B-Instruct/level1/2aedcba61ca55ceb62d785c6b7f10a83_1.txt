This paper proposes a novel approach to identify the intrinsic group additive structure for nonparametric regression. The authors rigorously define the intrinsic group additive structure and develop a structure-penalized kernel method to simultaneously identify the intrinsic group additive structure and estimate the nonparametric functions. The method utilizes a novel complexity measure derived for group additive structures, which is based on the capacity measure of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method. The theoretical results, including the consistency of the estimated group additive structure, are well-established. The simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to identify the intrinsic group additive structure, which can mitigate the curse of dimensionality and improve the efficiency and interpretability of high-dimensional nonparametric regression.
* The development of a structure-penalized kernel method, which can simultaneously identify the intrinsic group additive structure and estimate the nonparametric functions.
* The derivation of a novel complexity measure for group additive structures, which is based on the capacity measure of RKHSs.
* The establishment of theoretical results, including the consistency of the estimated group additive structure.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed method may not be computationally efficient for large datasets, as it requires an exhaustive search over all possible group additive structures.
* The choice of tuning parameters, such as λ and µ, may require careful selection, and the authors do not provide a clear guideline for selecting these parameters.
* The method may not be robust to outliers or noisy data, and the authors do not provide any discussion on the robustness of the method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and effective. However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement, such as computational efficiency and robustness.
