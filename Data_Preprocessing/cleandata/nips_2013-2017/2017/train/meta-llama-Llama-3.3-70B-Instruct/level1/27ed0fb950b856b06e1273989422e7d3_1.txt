This paper proposes a novel model, Deep Dynamic Poisson Factorization (DDPFA), for analyzing sequential count vectors. The model combines Poisson Factor Analysis with recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods such as Poisson-Gamma Dynamical System (PGDS), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA).
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of analyzing sequential count data and the limitations of existing methods. The model is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the DDPFA model, including the inference algorithm and the variational inference method used.
The experimental results are impressive, with the DDPFA model showing better performance than the baseline methods on most datasets. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of their model. The use of visualizations, such as Figure 2 and Figure 3, helps to illustrate the interpretability of the model.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposal of a novel model that combines the strengths of Poisson Factor Analysis and recurrent neural networks.
* The use of variational inference, which allows for efficient and scalable inference.
* The demonstration of the model's effectiveness on a range of datasets, including synthetic and real-world data.
* The provision of detailed visualizations and analysis of the results, which helps to illustrate the model's interpretability.
However, there are also some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The model's performance on the ICEWS dataset is not as strong as expected, and the authors acknowledge that this may be due to the complexity of the data.
* The authors note that the model suffers from "pruning" and "uselessness of adding network layers", which may be due to the mean-field variational inference method used.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods, such as temporal Dirichlet process and deep exponential families.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and effective model for analyzing sequential count data. The paper is well-written, and the experimental results are impressive. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to further strengthen their work.
