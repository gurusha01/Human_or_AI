This paper introduces a robust algorithm, TranSync, for the 1D translation synchronization problem. The main claim of the paper is that TranSync can recover the global coordinates of a set of nodes from noisy measurements of relative coordinates along an observation graph, and it is superior to state-of-the-art convex formulations in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
The support for this claim comes from both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors analyze TranSync under both deterministic and randomized noisy models, demonstrating its robustness and stability. They also provide experimental results on synthetic and real datasets, showing that TranSync outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers for the linear programming formulation.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, and they clearly explain the limitations of existing approaches. The experimental results are convincing, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of TranSync in various scenarios.
The usefulness of the paper is high, as it provides a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the translation synchronization problem. The algorithm has potential applications in various fields, such as joint alignment of point clouds and ranking from relative comparisons.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature. The novelty of the paper is high, as it introduces a new algorithm that improves upon existing approaches.
The completeness of the paper is good, as it provides sufficient details for reproducibility. The authors provide a clear description of the algorithm, and they provide experimental results to demonstrate its effectiveness.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged, and the authors provide suggestions for future work. One potential limitation is that the algorithm may not work well for very large-scale datasets, and the authors suggest that future work could focus on improving the scalability of the algorithm.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper. The paper is well-written, and it provides a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the translation synchronization problem. The experimental results are convincing, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in various scenarios.
