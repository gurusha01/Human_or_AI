This paper proposes a novel approach to encoding invariances to additive symmetric noise in distances between distributions. The main claim of the paper is that by using phase functions and phase features, it is possible to construct distances and learning algorithms that are robust to measurement noise and target the underlying signal distributions. The authors support this claim through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The authors provide a thorough review of the background and related work, which helps to contextualize their contributions. The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various scenarios.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to address a common problem in data analysis, namely the presence of measurement noise and its impact on distributional comparisons. The authors' approach is non-parametric and flexible, making it applicable to a wide range of problems. The use of phase functions and phase features is a novel and interesting idea, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how these concepts can be used to construct invariant distances and learning algorithms.
The paper also has some limitations. For example, the authors assume that the noise is symmetric and additive, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed approach may be high, particularly for large datasets. However, the authors provide some discussion of these limitations and suggest potential ways to address them.
In terms of novelty, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributional comparisons and learning. The use of phase functions and phase features is a new idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios.
