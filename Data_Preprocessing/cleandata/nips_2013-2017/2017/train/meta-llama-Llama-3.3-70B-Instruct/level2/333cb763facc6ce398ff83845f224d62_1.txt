This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling multiple-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) by designing a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities and leveraging Cram√©r's Theorem to construct a multivariate covariance function. The resulting Multi-Output Spectral Mixture (MOSM) kernel is able to model delays and phase differences between channels, providing a more expressive and interpretable representation of the relationships between outputs.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the MOSM kernel and demonstrate its effectiveness through a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and expressive kernel for MOGPs that can capture complex relationships between outputs
* A thorough theoretical derivation of the MOSM kernel, including a clear explanation of the underlying assumptions and mathematical framework
* A comprehensive evaluation of the MOSM kernel on multiple datasets, including a comparison to existing MOGP models
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed approach, particularly in terms of the number of parameters and the cost of optimization
* The limited analysis of the robustness and sensitivity of the MOSM kernel to hyperparameter settings and noise in the data
* The absence of a detailed comparison to other state-of-the-art MOGP models, such as those using deep learning or other kernel-based approaches
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of MOGPs and provides a promising approach for modeling complex relationships between outputs. However, further work is needed to fully explore the potential of the MOSM kernel and to address the limitations and weaknesses identified above.
