This paper proposes an accelerated first-order method for geodesically convex optimization on Riemannian manifolds, which is a generalization of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent method from Euclidean space to nonlinear Riemannian space. The authors derive two equations and obtain two nonlinear operators for geodesically strongly-convex and geodesically convex cases, respectively. They provide a global convergence analysis of their accelerated algorithms, showing that their methods attain convergence rates of O((1-√μ/L)k) and O(1/k2) for geodesically strongly-convex and geodesically convex objectives, respectively.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology and theoretical results. The experimental results on the matrix Karcher mean problem demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of their accelerated method. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work and discusses potential future directions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel accelerated method for geodesically convex optimization on Riemannian manifolds, which fills a gap in the existing literature.
* The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the geodesically convex function is also geodesically L-smooth, which may not be true for all functions.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other accelerated methods for geodesically convex optimization, such as the accelerated Riemannian gradient descent method.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of optimization on Riemannian manifolds. The proposed method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, including machine learning and signal processing.
