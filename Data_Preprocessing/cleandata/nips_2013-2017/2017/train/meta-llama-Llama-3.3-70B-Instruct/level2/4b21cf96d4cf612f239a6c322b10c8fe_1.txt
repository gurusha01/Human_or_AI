This paper proposes two novel models, Gaussian Mixture Model Conditional Variational Autoencoder (GMM-CVAE) and Additive Gaussian Conditional Variational Autoencoder (AG-CVAE), for image caption generation. The main claim of the paper is that these models can generate more diverse and accurate captions than standard LSTM baselines and "vanilla" CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of image caption generation, and the proposed models are well-motivated and technically sound. The use of a Gaussian Mixture model and an Additive Gaussian prior is a novel approach to structuring the latent space, and the paper provides a thorough explanation of the models and their training procedures.
The experimental results are impressive, with both GMM-CVAE and AG-CVAE outperforming the baselines in terms of caption quality and diversity. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison of the models' performance with and without the use of object vectors as additional conditioning information.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-structured presentation, its novel and well-motivated approach to image caption generation, and its impressive experimental results. The paper's weaknesses include its reliance on a specific dataset (MSCOCO) and its limited analysis of the models' performance on other datasets.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, well-written, and provides a clear and thorough explanation of the proposed models and their results.
