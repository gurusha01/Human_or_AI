This paper proposes a new deep generative model, called MMD GAN, which combines the key ideas of Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The main claim of the paper is that MMD GAN improves both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, including proofs of continuity and differentiability of the objective function, and demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work. The proposed approach is well-motivated, and the theoretical analysis is thorough. The experimental results are impressive, showing that MMD GAN outperforms GMMN and is competitive with other state-of-the-art GANs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, combining the strengths of GMMN and GAN.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough, providing proofs of continuity and differentiability of the objective function.
* The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of MMD GAN on multiple benchmark datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in deep learning and generative models, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The proposed approach requires a careful choice of hyperparameters, which may be challenging in practice.
* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other GAN variants, which may make it difficult to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of MMD GAN.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results are impressive. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and compare their approach with other GAN variants to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of MMD GAN.
