This paper proposes a novel approach to representing and learning distributions over routes on a map using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors introduce the concept of hierarchical route distributions, which allows for the construction of tractable PSDDs over route distributions, enabling them to scale to larger maps. The paper provides a thorough explanation of the theoretical foundations of PSDDs and their application to route distributions.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a route prediction task, showing that PSDDs can outperform Markov models and naive baselines in terms of accuracy. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the scalability and tractability of the proposed approach, including the use of hierarchical distributions and the compilation of PSDDs.
