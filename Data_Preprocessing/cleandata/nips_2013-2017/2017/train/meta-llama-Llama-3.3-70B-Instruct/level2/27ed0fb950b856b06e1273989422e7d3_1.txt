This paper proposes a novel model, Deep Dynamic Poisson Factorization (DDPFA), for analyzing sequential count vectors. The model combines Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) with recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in the data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods such as Poisson-Gamma Dynamical System (PGDS), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and PFA.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their model, including the mathematical formulation and the inference algorithm. The experimental results are thorough, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with existing methods. The paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed model, including the "pruning" problem and the potential benefits of using ladder-like architecture.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel model that combines PFA with recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in sequential count data.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the model on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
* The thorough comparison with existing methods, including PGDS, LSTM, and PFA.
* The discussion of the limitations of the proposed model and potential future directions.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the model, which may make it difficult to implement and interpret for non-experts.
* The potential for overfitting, particularly in the case of deep neural networks.
* The lack of a clear explanation of the hyperparameter tuning process, which may affect the reproducibility of the results.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequential count analysis, and the proposed model has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and exploring ways to simplify the model while maintaining its effectiveness.
