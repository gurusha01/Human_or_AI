This paper proposes a novel unsupervised generative approach for network embedding, called Proximity and Ranking-preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE). The authors introduce a multi-task Siamese neural network structure to learn node embeddings that preserve both global node ranking and community-aware proximity. The model is designed to satisfy four key properties: scalability, asymmetry, unity, and simplicity.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed approach, including a theoretical connection between the proximity objective function and community detection. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their model through extensive experiments on three real-world networks, outperforming several state-of-the-art network embedding methods in learning-to-rank, classification, regression, and link prediction tasks.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novel approach: The proposed PRUNE model is a new and innovative approach to network embedding, combining global node ranking and community-aware proximity preservation.
2. Theoretical foundations: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed approach, including a connection to community detection and a novel objective function.
3. Extensive experiments: The authors conduct thorough experiments on three real-world networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their model in various tasks.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations:
1. Complexity: The proposed model may be complex to implement and require significant computational resources, particularly for large-scale networks.
2. Hyperparameter tuning: The authors fix some hyperparameters, such as the dimensionality of the embedding and hidden layers, which may not be optimal for all datasets.
3. Limited interpretability: The paper could benefit from more insights into the learned embeddings and their relationship to the underlying network structure.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider:
1. Providing more insights into the learned embeddings: The authors could analyze the learned embeddings and provide more insights into their relationship to the underlying network structure.
2. Conducting more experiments: The authors could conduct more experiments on additional datasets and tasks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their model.
3. Investigating the scalability: The authors could investigate the scalability of their model and provide more insights into its computational complexity.
Overall, this paper presents a novel and effective approach to network embedding, with a solid theoretical foundation and extensive experimental evaluation. With some additional insights and experiments, this work has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of network analysis and machine learning.
