This paper proposes a novel unbiased estimator for the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that has zero variance when the variational approximation is exact. The authors achieve this by removing the score function term from the reparameterized gradient estimator, which they call the path derivative gradient estimator. The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed analysis of the estimator and its properties.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their estimator through experiments on MNIST and Omniglot datasets using variational and importance-weighted autoencoders. The results show that the path derivative gradient estimator improves over the original gradient estimator in most cases.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details. The use of algorithms and pseudocode helps to illustrate the implementation of the proposed method. The related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature, and the authors clearly position their contribution within the context of existing research.
