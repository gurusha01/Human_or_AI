This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling temporal point processes using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which bypasses the traditional intensity-based modeling and likelihood-based estimation. The authors introduce a Wasserstein distance-based metric to measure the difference between the real and generated point processes, and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the generator. The paper presents extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over conventional methods.
The main claims of the paper are: (i) the proposal of an intensity-free generative model for point processes, (ii) the extension of Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for point processes with RNN architecture, and (iii) the demonstration of the promising performance of the approach on various datasets.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that the proposed approach can accurately estimate the underlying point process without requiring prior knowledge of its parametric form. The experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with known parametric forms. The results on real-world datasets also show that the proposed approach can recover the intensity of the underlying point process better than other methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its theoretical background. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.
