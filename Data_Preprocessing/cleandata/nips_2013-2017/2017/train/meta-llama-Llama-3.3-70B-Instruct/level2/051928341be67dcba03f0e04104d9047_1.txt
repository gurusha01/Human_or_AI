This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism that learns high-order correlations between various data modalities, which is demonstrated to be effective in the task of visual question answering (VQA). The main claim of the paper is that the proposed high-order attention mechanism can capture complex dependencies between different data modalities, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the VQA dataset.
The paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed attention mechanism, including the use of unary, pairwise, and ternary potentials to capture correlations between different modalities. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the VQA dataset.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed approach and the experimental results. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing attention mechanisms and the advantages of the proposed approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is the use of a probabilistic framework to model the attention mechanism, which allows for the capture of complex dependencies between different modalities. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the attention weights, which provides insights into how the model is making decisions.
However, one potential limitation of the paper is the reliance on pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image embedding, which may limit the applicability of the approach to other domains. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, particularly in terms of the number of parameters and the computational requirements.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multimodal learning, and the proposed attention mechanism has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks beyond VQA. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach and the experimental results.
