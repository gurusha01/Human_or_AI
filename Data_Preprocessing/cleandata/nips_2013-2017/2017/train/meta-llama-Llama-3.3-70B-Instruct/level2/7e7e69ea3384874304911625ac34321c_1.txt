This paper proposes the PixelGAN autoencoder, a generative autoencoder that combines a generative PixelCNN with a GAN inference network. The main claim of the paper is that the PixelGAN autoencoder can learn a latent representation that captures the type of statistics that we care about, while the remaining structure of the image is captured by the PixelCNN decoder. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the PixelGAN autoencoder in various tasks, including unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised classification, and learning cross-domain relations.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the architecture and training procedure of the PixelGAN autoencoder. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's capabilities and limitations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in various experiments. The use of Gaussian and categorical priors to impose different factorizations of information between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder is a key contribution of the paper.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel architecture that combines the benefits of latent variable models and autoregressive architectures
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the PixelGAN autoencoder in various tasks, including unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised classification
* The thorough analysis of the model's capabilities and limitations
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art models in the field
* The limited evaluation of the model's performance on larger and more complex datasets
* The need for further analysis of the model's ability to learn cross-domain relations
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of generative models. The proposed architecture has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its capabilities and limitations.
