This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) by introducing a new class of algorithms, called BAI-MCTS, which combines Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms with confidence intervals on node values to solve the best action identification problem in trees of arbitrary depth. The authors propose two specific instances of BAI-MCTS, UGapE-MCTS and LUCB-MCTS, and provide theoretical guarantees for their performance, including high-probability upper bounds on the sample complexity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed algorithms, and the theoretical results. The experimental validation section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in various settings, including a depth-two benchmark tree, a depth-three tree, and a random tree ensemble.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new class of algorithms that combines BAI and MCTS, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Theoretical guarantees: The authors provide high-probability upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms, which is a strong theoretical result.
3. Experimental validation: The paper includes a thorough experimental validation of the proposed algorithms, which demonstrates their effectiveness in various settings.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Complexity: The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in MCTS, BAI, and probability theory, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.
2. Limited comparison: The paper only compares the proposed algorithms with a few existing algorithms, and it would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithms and theoretical results are significant contributions to the field. The experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the paper provides a good balance between theoretical and practical contributions.
