This paper proposes a novel learning framework called hyperspherical convolution (SphereConv) that projects parameter learning onto unit hyperspheres, where layer activations only depend on the geodesic distance between kernels and input signals. The authors introduce SphereNet, a deep hyperspherical convolution network that adopts SphereConv as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by a generalized angular softmax loss. The paper claims that SphereNet can effectively encode discriminative representation and alleviate training difficulty, leading to easier optimization, faster convergence, and comparable or better classification accuracy over convolutional counterparts.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a fundamental analysis of the cosine SphereConv operator, demonstrating that it can improve the conditioning of the problem and enhance the geometric structure, leading to improved convergence of optimization procedures. The experimental results show that SphereNets outperform CNN baselines on various image classification tasks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-2012.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method. The experimental results are thorough and well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results. The paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed method and provides suggestions for future work.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel learning framework that can effectively alleviate training difficulties and improve classification accuracy.
* The provision of theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the claims.
