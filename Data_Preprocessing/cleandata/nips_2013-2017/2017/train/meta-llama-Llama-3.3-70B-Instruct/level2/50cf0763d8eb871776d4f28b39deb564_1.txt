This paper revisits the classical analysis of generative vs discriminative models for general exponential families and high-dimensional settings. The authors develop novel technical machinery, including a notion of separability of general loss functions, which allows them to provide a general framework to obtain `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They use this machinery to analyze `1 and `2 convergence rates of generative and discriminative models and provide insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and simulations. The authors introduce a notion of separability for loss functions, which is used to derive `1 convergence rates for general M-estimators. They then instantiate their results for both generative and discriminative models, providing `1 and `2 convergence rates for differential parameter estimation. The paper also includes a discussion of the consequences of these results for high-dimensional classification for Gaussian Generative models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are well-organized, and the proofs are provided in the appendix. The paper includes several examples and simulations to illustrate the results, which helps to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
The paper's contributions are significant, as they provide a unified framework for analyzing the convergence rates of generative and discriminative models. The results have important implications for high-dimensional classification and provide new insights into the behavior of these models in high-dimensional settings.
The paper's limitations are acknowledged by the authors, who note that their results are limited to exponential family distributions and may not generalize to other distributions. Additionally, the paper assumes that the true model parameters are sparse, which may not always be the case in practice.
Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and statistics. The authors' novel technical machinery and unified framework for analyzing convergence rates provide new insights into the behavior of generative and discriminative models in high-dimensional settings. The paper's results have important implications for high-dimensional classification and provide a foundation for future research in this area.
