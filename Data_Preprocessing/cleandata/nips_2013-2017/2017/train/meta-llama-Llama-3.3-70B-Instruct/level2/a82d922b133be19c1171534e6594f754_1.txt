This paper presents a novel approach to approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for parametric learning problems, which is computationally efficient and provides a reliable estimate of the out-of-sample loss. The authors propose an approximate LOOCV (ALOOCV) method, which is based on a Taylor series expansion of the leave-one-out loss function. They also develop a gradient descent algorithm for tuning the regularization hyperparameters using the ALOOCV method.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the ALOOCV method, including its asymptotic properties and computational complexity.
The numerical experiments presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the ALOOCV method in various scenarios, including ridge regression, logistic regression, and elastic net regression. The results show that the ALOOCV method provides a reliable estimate of the out-of-sample loss, and that it can be used to tune the regularization hyperparameters effectively.
