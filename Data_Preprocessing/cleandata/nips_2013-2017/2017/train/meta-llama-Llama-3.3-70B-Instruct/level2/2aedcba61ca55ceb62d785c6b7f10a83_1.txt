This paper proposes a novel approach to identify the intrinsic group additive structure for nonparametric regression. The authors rigorously define the intrinsic group additive structure and develop a structure-penalized kernel method to simultaneously identify the intrinsic group additive structure and estimate the nonparametric functions. The method utilizes a novel complexity measure derived for group additive structures, which is based on the capacity measure of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical details are well-explained, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's consistency and performance. The simulation studies and real-data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure and estimating the nonparametric functions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a rigorous definition of the intrinsic group additive structure, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The proposed method is novel and effective in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure and estimating the nonparametric functions.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's consistency and performance, including simulation studies and real-data applications.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method's computational cost can be high, especially for large datasets. The authors propose a backward stepwise algorithm to reduce the computational cost, but further research is needed to develop more efficient algorithms.
* The choice of tuning parameters, such as µ and α, can be critical to the method's performance. The authors propose using cross-validation to select the tuning parameters, but further research is needed to develop more effective methods for selecting the tuning parameters.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and effective. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's consistency and performance, and the simulation studies and real-data applications demonstrate the method's effectiveness. However, further research is needed to develop more efficient algorithms and effective methods for selecting the tuning parameters.
