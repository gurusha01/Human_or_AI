This paper presents a novel approach to error detection and correction in 3D reconstruction of neurons from electron microscopic imagery. The authors define two tasks: error detection, which identifies split and merge errors in a candidate object, and error correction, which prunes away irrelevant parts from the candidate mask to produce the true object. They implement both tasks using 3D multiscale convolutional networks and demonstrate high accuracy in error detection and significant improvements in error correction when using the "advice" from the error detector.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the architecture of their networks and the training procedures. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with precision and recall exceeding 90% for error detection and significant improvements in error correction when using the advice from the error detector.
The paper makes several contributions to the field, including the definition of the error detection and correction tasks, the development of a novel architecture for error correction, and the demonstration of the importance of using advice from the error detector to improve error correction. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their approach and demonstrate that the cost of error detection is more than justified by the subsequent savings during the error correction phase.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise summary of their approach and results. The writing is clear, and the figures and tables are well-labeled and easy to understand.
