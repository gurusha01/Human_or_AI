This paper proposes a new algorithm, Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM), to solve the Quadratic Programming (QP) matching problem with doubly stochastic and discrete constraints. The main claims of the paper are that MPGM (1) solves the general QP problem with doubly stochastic constraint naturally, (2) empirically returns a sparse solution and thus incorporates the discrete constraint approximately, and (3) is efficient and simple to implement.
The support for these claims comes from theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the convergence and KKT optimality of the MPGM algorithm. They also conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of MPGM in terms of objective score, matching accuracy, and sparsity.
The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is evident in its ability to solve the QP matching problem with doubly stochastic constraint, which is a fundamental problem in computer vision. The algorithm's efficiency and simplicity make it a practical solution for real-world applications.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with correct use of terms and evidence of understanding of relevant literature. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related works, including constraint relaxation and projection methods, objective function approximation methods, and probabilistic methods.
The novelty of the work lies in the development of a multiplicative update technique to solve the QP matching problem with doubly stochastic constraint. The authors demonstrate that MPGM is significantly different from previous works, which either relax the doubly stochastic constraint or use approximation techniques.
The completeness of the paper is satisfactory, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The authors discuss the limitations of their work, including the lack of theoretical proof on the sparsity of MPGM solution, and propose future directions for research.
