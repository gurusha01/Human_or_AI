This paper proposes a novel framework for controlling false alarms when multiple A/B tests are run over time, leveraging advances in adaptive sampling and online false discovery rate (FDR) control. The main claims of the paper are: (i) proposing reasonable definitions of a null hypothesis for multi-armed bandit (MAB) instances, (ii) demonstrating how to derive an always-valid sequential p-value for continuous monitoring, and (iii) showing that using rejection thresholds of online-FDR algorithms as confidence levels for MAB algorithms results in sample-optimality, high power, and low FDR at any point in time.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, highlighting the limitations of traditional A/B testing frameworks and the need for a more efficient and adaptive approach. The proposed framework, MAB-FDR, combines adaptive sampling strategies with online FDR control procedures, allowing for continuous monitoring and control of FDR at any time.
The paper provides extensive simulations and experiments on both artificial and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of MAB-FDR in terms of sample complexity, power, and FDR control. The results show that MAB-FDR outperforms competing procedures, such as AB-FDR and MAB-IND, in terms of power and sample complexity, while maintaining FDR control.
The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the theoretical guarantees of the proposed framework, including the control of FDR and the power of the procedure. The authors demonstrate that MAB-FDR achieves mFDR control at level Î± and provides a lower bound on the power of the procedure.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-structured introduction to the problem and the proposed framework
* Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of MAB-FDR
