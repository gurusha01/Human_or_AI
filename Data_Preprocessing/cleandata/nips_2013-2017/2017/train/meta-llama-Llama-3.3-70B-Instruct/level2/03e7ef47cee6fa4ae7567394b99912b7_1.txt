This paper presents a rigorous theoretical study of interactive clustering with side information, where an oracle provides pair-wise queries to aid in clustering. The authors provide strong information-theoretic lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds on the query complexity of clustering with side information. The main contribution of the paper is to show that the presence of side information, in the form of a similarity matrix, can drastically reduce the query complexity of clustering from Θ(nk) to O(k^2 logn H^2(f+‖f−)), where H^2(f+‖f−) is the squared Hellinger divergence between the probability distributions f+ and f−.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, related work, and the authors' contributions. The technical sections are detailed and provide a thorough analysis of the lower and upper bounds. The authors also provide experimental results on a real-world dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise problem statement and motivation
* A thorough analysis of the lower and upper bounds on query complexity
* A novel and efficient algorithm for interactive clustering with side information
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the oracle always returns the correct answer, which may not be the case in practice
* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm
* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset and may not be representative of all possible scenarios
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of interactive clustering and provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the query complexity of clustering with side information. The authors' approach is novel and efficient, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a clear and concise problem statement and motivation
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the lower and upper bounds on query complexity
* The paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm for interactive clustering with side information
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
Arguments against acceptance:
