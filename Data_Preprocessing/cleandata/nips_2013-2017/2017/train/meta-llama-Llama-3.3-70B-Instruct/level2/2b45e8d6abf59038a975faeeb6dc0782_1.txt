This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the distance between two probability distributions based on samples, called Population Matching Discrepancy (PMD). The authors define PMD as the minimum weight matching between two random populations from the distributions and prove that it is a strongly consistent estimator of the first Wasserstein metric. The paper also presents a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to learn parameters of the distributions using PMD.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) PMD is a strongly consistent estimator of the first Wasserstein metric, and (2) PMD outperforms the popular Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method in terms of performance and convergence speed in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The authors show that PMD has several advantages over MMD, including no kernel bandwidth hyper-parameter, stronger gradient, and smaller mini-batch size for gradient-based optimization. The empirical results demonstrate that PMD outperforms MMD in domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks, and that PMD converges faster than MMD.
