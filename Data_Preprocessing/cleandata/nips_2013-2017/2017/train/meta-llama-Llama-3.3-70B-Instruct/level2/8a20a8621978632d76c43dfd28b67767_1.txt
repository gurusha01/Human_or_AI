This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. The authors identify a new class of additive feature importance measures and provide theoretical results showing that there is a unique solution in this class with desirable properties. The paper unifies six existing methods, including LIME, DeepLIFT, and layer-wise relevance propagation, and presents new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to provide a unified framework for interpreting predictions, its theoretical results, and its experimental evaluations. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methods and results. The use of game theory to derive the SHAP values is a novel and interesting approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the methods and the need for further evaluation on larger datasets. The paper assumes that the features are independent, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the paper focuses on additive feature importance methods, which may not be suitable for all types of models.
The paper is significant because it provides a unified framework for interpreting predictions, which is an important problem in machine learning. The paper's results have the potential to impact the field of machine learning by providing a more accurate and consistent way of interpreting predictions.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and unified framework for interpreting predictions.
* The paper provides theoretical results and experimental evaluations to support its claims.
* The paper has the potential to impact the field of machine learning.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's methods may be complex and difficult to implement.
* The paper assumes that the features are independent, which may not always be the case.
* The paper focuses on additive feature importance methods, which may not be suitable for all types of models.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper because of its novelty, theoretical results, and experimental evaluations. However, I suggest that the authors provide further evaluation on larger datasets and consider the limitations of their methods.
