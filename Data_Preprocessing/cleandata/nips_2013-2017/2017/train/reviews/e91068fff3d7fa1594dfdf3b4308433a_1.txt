This paper proposes a new gradient estimator for Variational Bayes with zero variance when the variational distribution is exactly equal to the true distribution of latent variables. The paper is written well and clear. I think it is acceptable after some minor revisions.
It will be nicer if the case where the variational distribution is different from the true distribution p(z|x) is analyzed in addition. In that case, the expectation of score function is not zero anymore and therefore the proposed estimator introduces some bias. How adversarial can be the effect of this bias? 
Also, for the mixture ELBO in line 188, shouldn't there be a variational distribution over \pic? I don't see any explicit definition of zc in the manuscript. How do you choose them in the variational mixture and how does that choice affects reparameterization?
