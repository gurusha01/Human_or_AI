In this paper, authors target an "intermediate case" between the two domain parameterizations given by the linear span and the convex hull of an atom set, that is the parameterization of the optimization domain as the conic hull of a possibly infinite atom set. This is different from the greedy optimization methods such as matching pursuit and Frank-Wolfe algorithms over the line span and the convex hull of a set of atoms, respectively. They give explicit convergence rates for non-negative MP algorithms.
The alignment assumption of the existing MP method does not hold if the optimization domain is a cone. Authors present modifications of existing non-negative variants of MP so as to corroborate this issue along with the resulting MP-type algorithms for conic problems and corresponding convergence guarantees. Authors proposed three algorithms with different variants. It might be interesting to see which algorithm is the preferred in what conditions. It is useful to participants to apply the best method to their problems.
In lines 202-205, authors pointed out that one has to take either the risk of choosing tau too small and failing to recover an optimal solution, or rely on too large tau, which can result in slow convergence. Does it mean that a large tau is preferred for the convergence guarantee without considering the time complexity?
To verify the proposed algorithms, authors conducted experiments on three problems. However, the descriptions of the experimental settings and analysis of the results are too rough. It is better to have detailed discussion. Moreover, the computational time might be an interesting evaluation criterion for comparing different methods as well as their variants.
