This paper considers the optimization problems over the convex cone, parameterized as the conic hull of a possibly infinite atom set. The authors established optimization convergence results for the proposed algorithms which apply to general atom sets and objective functions. Overall, the paper is well written and clearly states the contributions and the connections to existing literatures. 
1. The paper targets an interesting topic, namely the parameterization of the optimization problems over the conic hull of a possibly infinite atom set, which is between but different from what matching pursuit over the linear span of a finite atom set and frank-wolfe over the convex hull of a set of atoms. This facilitates the proposal of the algorithms with optimization theoretical results for general objective functions and atom sets. 
2. The paper fills in an empty space of showing the optimization convergence rates of greedy algorithms in matching pursuit and frank wolfe because the atom set is not guaranteed to contain an atom aligned with a descent direction for all possible suboptimal iterates. This shed light on understanding these problems. 
3. The authors also introduced away-step, pairwise and fully corrective MP variants with theoretical guarantees for completeness.
