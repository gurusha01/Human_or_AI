The paper proposes variants of SMDP-UCRL (SUCRL), FSUCRLv1 and v2, and analyzes the regret behavior of the two variants. The crucial difference is that, while SUCRL requires knowledge of certain parameters related to the option behavior, the proposed variants estimate them from the data. The two variants differ in whether the parameters and their confidence intervals are explicitly estimated, or if a "nested" procedure is used to obtain the parameters implicitly. The regret bounds given almost match that of SUCRL, with the exception of some cost for the parameter estimation. Some empirical validation is also presented. 
The paper is clearly written for most parts. Given the nature of the contribution, it is to be expected that the paper will be dense at some points. The crucial insight is the use of the irreducible Markov chain representation for an option. Having said that, since the primary contribution of the work is Theorem 1, it would be nice to seem intuition for the proof in the main body of the paper. Currently all of the proof is in the appendix.
