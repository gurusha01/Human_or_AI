This paper presents a dynamic Bayesian network to improve the error made by iBCI decoders. This method allows the system to use longer signals history and reduce errors.
It seems that the state of the art is the use of Kalman filters to decode the neural signals to find the angle of motion. If that is the case, the authors show improvement upon this method by using a better tuning curve and a modified Kalman Filter.
It would be interesting to know the minimum recording time necessary to initialize the tuning curve and the decoder.
The authors state: "While the Kalman filter state solely encodes the vector of desired cursor movement, we expand
 our decoder's state to also include the two-dimensional final location (or goal position) on the screen to which the participant wants to move the cursor" Does this mean that the goal needs to be known beforehand? Is this a supervised approach? In that case, this limitation should be clearly pointed out.
