This paper focuses on safe adaptive importance sampling, which is a popular topic in the community at the moment. Some of the key features of this work are that the proposed method is generic and can be integrated with many existing algorithms, and there are both theoretical results and practical experiments to support the proposed strategy. 
One issue with the paper that should be addressed is the figures in Section 5, which are very difficult to see properly. These figures should be made larger, and the labels also made larger, so that the reader can see them properly.
