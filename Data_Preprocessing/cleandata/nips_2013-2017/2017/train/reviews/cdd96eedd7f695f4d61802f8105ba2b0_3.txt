This paper studied the network embedding problem, with focuses on proximity and global ranking preserve. The authors proposed an unsupervised Siamese neural network structure to learn node embedding following a generative fashion. They claimed that their model satisfies four characteristics, which are scalability, asymmetry, unity and simplicity.  
The Siamese neural network is designed as a multi-task learning framework, with shared hidden layers for embedding vectors of each pair of connected nodes.
The node ranking hidden layer is designed to encode the global ranking information, and the proximity hidden layer is designed for preserving local proximity information. As a result, this generative framework updates the two input embedding vectors using gradients propagated back from the output layers on an objective function consists of two parts of rewards. one for each task. The network design looks simple and robust with only one hidden layer, that leads to much fewer hyper-parameters to tune. And the authors provide detailed proof for second-order proximity preservation, and proof for global ranking preservation with a upper bound of PageRank. 
This paper is well-written and easy to follow. Figure 1 is nice and clean, which provides a short cut for reader to understand their model.  The experimental part is well-designed, the results demonstrated that the proposed embedding model outperforms its competitors on task like rank prediction, classification/regression and link prediction. And the authors also perform extra experiments to show that the proposed method is more robust to noisy data compared to the state-of-art. 
I found no obvious flaw in this paper during review, good presentation and technical quality.
