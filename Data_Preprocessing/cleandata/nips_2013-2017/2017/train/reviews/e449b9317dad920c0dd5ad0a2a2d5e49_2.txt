The authors contribute a matrix factorization method based on a one-sided Huber loss within the framework of robust estimation. Asymptotic proofs of optimality are provided. The method is applied to the matrix factorization problem of extracting cells and time courses from optogenetic neural measurements and improvements over the matrix factorization method CNMF, as well as ICA.
As I am not familiar enough with robust regression I cannot comment much on the proofs. I believe the authors that this contribution is novel and that the proofs are correct. In this setting, the contribution is clear a step ahead in that it provides the possibility to perform the matrix factorization needed for the calcium imaging application.
It is by construction more accommodating of otherwise disruptive types of noise and it is conceivable that this gives the method an edge over existing varieties.
In the evaluation on synthetic data, possibly some more systematic variations of overlap/temporal similarity could have been explored and the outcome compared against the other methods in order to understand breaking points of the proposed method as well as the comparisons more systematically.
