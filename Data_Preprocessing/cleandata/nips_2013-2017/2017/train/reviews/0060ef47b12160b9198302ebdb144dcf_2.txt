This paper introduces a NN to predict the regions of an image that are important for another NN for object categorization. The paper reads well and it is interesting that the experiments show that it works so well compared to previous works. The results are in challenging datasets with state-of-the-art NN. 
I may suggest to motivate a bit better in which applications one may need real time efficiency. Also, I would have liked to see some insight from an analysis of the learnt salient regions (eg. which object categories exploit biases in the background to recognize the object)
