This was an excellent paper - very careful, well written, impressive and enjoyable. It establishes solid theoretical results for deterministic quadrature alternatives to random Fourier features. I have a few comments, but overall I think this would be a fantastic contribution to NIPS.
- On page 2, lines 72-74, I wonder if the assessment of QMC is a bit pessimistic. Was higher-order QMC used in that reference? Is there some fundamental reason to think that no QMC method at all would outperform the proposed approach? I am wondering about whether higher-order digital nets could be used within QMC; these correspond to weighted RKHS and have something in common with the ANOVA construction. See Dick and Pillichshammer's 2010 book.

- On page 4, lines 151-155, the comparison to RFF could be tempered again with a caveat that more assumptions are made to get the novel result, relative to the rate presented for RFF. Put another way, is it clear that RFF would not perform better under this additional assumption being made in the paper?
