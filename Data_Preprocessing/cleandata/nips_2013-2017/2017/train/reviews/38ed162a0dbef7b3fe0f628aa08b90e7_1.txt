The paper studied some nice properties about deep convolutional kernel networks, i.e.CKNs are near invariant to groups of transformation and stable to the action of diffeomorohisms, if appropriate patch extraction operator,kernel mapping operator and pooling operator are carefully designed. Authors also showed that under certain assumption, the nice properties obtained from CKNs also applies to CNNs.
In general, the paper is well written and technically sound. The only weakness is that the paper does not provide any empirical experiments to validate the theoretical analysis. I wish to see some experimental results showing the conclusion that CKNs with appropriate settings are invariant to the transformation and diffeomorphism.
Another question is whether random projection or explicit kernel mapping with finite number of Fourier series can also be a candidate solution for the kernel approximation. If so, what is the effect on the stability.
