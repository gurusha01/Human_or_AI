Summary:
The authors proposed phase discrepancy between distributions and phase features for embedding distributions, which are based on the use of phase function that is invariant to additive SPD noise components, aiming respectively at two-sample testing and learning on distributions. The phase discrepancy is similar in mathematical form to MMD but is tailored to incorporate invariance to additive SPD noise. As the phase discrepancy induces a shift-invariant kernel (Proposition 1 and 2), direct application of random Fourier features to such a kernel lead to phase features. Rich experimental results well demonstrate the strength of the proposed methods.

Line 120, I think the justification of introducing the subset of indecomposable proba measures for which phase functions are uniquely determined is quite insufficient. For example, how would this lack of identifiability limit the utility of the phase discrepancy? Or does this subset properly include interestingly many distributions for application?

Since MMD is well studied with the RKHS which contributed deeply to the understanding and well guarantees the utility of MMD, could the authors relate the proposed phase discrepancy to some properties of the RKHS?
