This paper proposes a two-stage procedure for robust submodular maximization with cardinality constraint k. In the first stage, a robust streaming algorithm STAR-T is designed, which is based on a partitioning structure and an decreasing thresholding rule. In the second stage, the simple greedy method is used. The STAR-T is proven to have constant approximation guarantee when k is up to infinity (Thm4.1). lem4.2~4.3 prove that STAR-T with simple greedy method can deal with the loss of elements. 
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can do well on the problem of influence maximization and personalized movie recommendation.
This work is interesting as it is the first streaming algorithm for robust submodular maximization. Maybe the streaming setting will have wide range of applications and this work is very enlightening. The STAR-T algorithm has two hyper parameters, \tao and w. In Thm 4.5, the authors showed how to approximate \tao. The authors showed "w=1" can do well in Experiments. It's convenient to use STAR-T without trying different hyper parameters.
The major problem I concerned is that the experiment is not very expressive. The STAR-T-Greedy algorithm can not always outperform the Sieve-St algorithm. 
In addition, it's strange that the objective function of Influence Maximization is f(Z)=|N(Z) \cup Z| (line 219 in this paper), which is not the same with the function in the referred article (D. Kempe, J. Kleinberg, and Ã‰. Tardos, "Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network," in Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD), 2003). It is not clear to me that how STAR-T performs on such a spread model.
