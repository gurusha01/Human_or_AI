Problem studied : The paper studies the following question. The goal is to find a set of elements T from some ground set E in a streaming fashion such that, if we delete any set of m elements from T then we can still find a set of k elements S such that f(S) is maximized where f is a submodular function. 
Applications: Maximizing submodular functions has multiple applications and we know streaming algorithms for this problem. The reason why a robust version is useful is if we find a solution and then we might need to remove some of the elements (say if you compute a set of movies for the user and then find that the user is not interested in some of them). 
Results: The paper gives a constant factor approximation to this problem while returning a set T of size (mlogk+k)log^2k.
Comments: The paper's results are correct to the best of my understanding. The solution is non-trivial and the algorithm and it's analysis are technically challenging. While the problem is interesting my main concern is the relevance of this paper to the conference. The applications and their motivation are quite weak and the problem is not general enough.
