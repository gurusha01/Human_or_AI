This paper proposes a robust statistical estimator for analyzing calcium imaging data to extract timecourses and spatial filters of cells. This is an important application for neuroscience and improvements that increase the ability of algorithms to deal with cross-talk would be useful for the field. The framework appears to be closely related to the CNMF method, but with a robust loss function. I'm not confident in assessing the novelty or validity of the statistical framework, but I will comment on the practical application. 
My main reservation is that in Fig. 2d it appears that the estimation accuracy declines with each iteration. I guess this is because the authors initialized the algorithm using the ground truth cell locations. This seems to be an unrealistic scenario, and is not justified in the paper. Given this, it's hard to evaluate the claim that the EXTRACT algorithm improves performance relative to CNMF (or ICA).
Additional points:
- Line 47: The reason that signals in calcium imaging data are non-negative is not because they come from photons. Rather, it is because calcium is highly regulated in neurons, with near zero baseline concentration of free calcium and several orders of magnitude increase in calcium following opening of voltage gated ion channels.
- Why not simulate the data using a Poisson distribution to model photon shot noise? This is the most realistic noise model for fluorescence imaging data.
