This paper combines several existing techniques to extend the applicability of coordinate descent method to a larger class of problem. I think this is a nice and solid work but just not has much novelty. The proof can be derived by modifying the proofs in the previous papers and the convergence rate is expected. I found the following issues which I wish the authors can fix. 
1. (Major) The Assumption 1 (c) says h^ should have a bounded domain. However, this is not satisfied in (9). In fact, when h is an indicator function of a singleton set {c}, h^(u)=u^Tc whose domain is R^n. Therefore, all results in Section 3.4, including Theorem 3.5, cannot be justified. I wonder if there is a mistake in the proof of Theorem 3.5. For example, how can Dh^ be finite when the domain is not bounded? If Dh^ is unbounded, how can the right hand side of (12) depends on D_h^*?

2. I found both y^* and y^\star in Theorem 3.5. Please make the notation consistent. Also I did not find their definitions, although I can guess they are dual optimal solution.
3. There is a missing reference [?] in line 165.
