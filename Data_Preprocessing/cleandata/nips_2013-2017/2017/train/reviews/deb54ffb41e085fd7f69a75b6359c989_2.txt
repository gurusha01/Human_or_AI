The authors develop a hierarchical version of a probabilistic sequential decision diagrams (PSDD) in the context of describing distributions over routes in a discrete graph, which are represented by binary random variables on the graph edges. Because valid paths without loops are represented as functions of all the edges in a path, a naive graphical model representation would have high treewidth. PSDDs can represent distributions on structured binary spaces more efficiently, but still have difficulty scaling to realistic situations. The authors propose segmenting the problem in a hierarchy of problems, represented both sub-problems and the overall structure by separate PSDDs, allowing the authors to scale to real-world sized problems (e.g. the financial district of San Francisco).
The authors rely on some special structure of simple path-finding to make their approach tractable (e.g. the simple-route limitation which 2^|Bi| to |Bi|^2). Thm 4 and Prop 1 provide some guidance to the validity of the underlying assumptions, but in practice they may be hard to evaluate on really difficult problems (as always, I guess). I feel like the Markov model is not a very fair comparison -- as the author say, it does not incorporate destination information. A comparison to route-planning heuristics that are used in practice would have been more appropriate, but I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough with the field to make concrete suggestions.
Despite these minor shortcomings, I think the paper is well-written and the idea interesting enough to be of general interest, and I recommend acceptance.
