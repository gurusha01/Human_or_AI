This paper considers the f-GAN principle generalized to f-divergences. Generalizing the connection between the KL divergence and regular exponential families by using the chi-logarithm, the authors prove the variational information geometric f-GAN (vig-f-GAN) identity, which provides an interpretation of the objective function of the f-GAN. The authors also prove a sufficient condition on activation functions to obtain factored generative distributions. 
The main theoretical result, vig-f-GAN identity is interesting and its applicability is promising. However, the meanings of main theorems are hard to follow since they are written in quite general forms.
Section 6: It is hard to understand how the observations in experiments are related to theoretical results.
