This is a really well written paper that presents a unified view of various state-of-the-art techniques for density modeling. More specifically: the authors show that autoregressive models, normalizing flows, inverse autoregressive flows and RealNVP/NICE can be easily understood from a common perspective. Some aspects of this perspective were already known and, for example, described in the IAF paper by Kingma et. al. But this paper describes the connections between these models and techniques in far more detail and in a plausible and easy to follow way. Furthermore, starting from this perspective, the authors derive a new variant and show that they obtain very promising results that compete with (or beat) various state of the art approaches.
