The paper introduces a new covariance structure for multioutputs GPs, which corresponds to the generalisation of the spectral approach (Bochner Theorem) to build kernels from A. G. Adams and R. P. Adams. One particular asset of the proposed method is that the parameters of the model can be interpreted (such as delay between outputs or phase difference).
The definition of covariance structures for multioutputs GPs is a challenging topic and relatively few methods are currently available to do so. The method proposed by the authors is theoretically sound and its effectiveness is demonstrated on several datasets. 
The method is clearly described in a well written paper, and the choices for the illustrations appear relevant to me. If the parameter learning isn't too troublesome (the paper does not contain much informations regarding this), I would expect this method to become a standard for multioutput GPs.
Questions 
 * How does the method behaves when few training points are available?
 * (more a curiosity) A channel with a large length-scale cannot be highly correlated with a channel with a small length-scales. How does that appear in your model?
Comments
 * In the synthetic example (Section 4.1), the number of training points should be specified
Minor remarks: I guess a word is missing in lines 74 and 140.
