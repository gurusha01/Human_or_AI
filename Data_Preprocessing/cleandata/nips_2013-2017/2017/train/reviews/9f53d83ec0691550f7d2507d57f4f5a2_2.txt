This work deals with translation synchronization that consists in recovering latent coordinate from these noisy pairwise observations. The proposed algorithmic procedure consists in solving a truncated least squares at each iteration, the convergence analysis and exact recovery condition are provided. Finally the experiments illustrate the interest of the proposed strategy compared to state-of-the-art methods. This paper is interesting and complete.
