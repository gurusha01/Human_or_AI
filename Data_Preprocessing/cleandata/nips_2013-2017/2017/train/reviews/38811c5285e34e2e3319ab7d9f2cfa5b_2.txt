The authors proposed an approach for parallelizing learners (which hold certain assumptions) based on Radon points. The contribution of the paper w.r.t. the other similar works is the usage of Radon points instead of averaging (which has been used as baseline approach in the paper). The performance is compared with `no parallelization', `averaging schema', and `Spark-based' algorithms. They have shown experimentally the reduced learning time and similar or higher accuracy to the other algorithms.
It seems the theoretical part has already been investigated in another paper:``Parallelizing Randomized Convex Optimization", which could be from the same authors. But this is not cited in the current paper and it needs to be elaborated what the paper's contribution for this part is.
