As clearly indicated in the title, this paper submission is an extension of the PointNet work of [19], to appear at CVPR 2017. The goal is to classify and segment (3D) point clouds. Novel contributions over [19] are the use of a hierarchical network, leveraging neighbourhoods at different scales, and a mechanism to deal with varying sampling densities, effectively generating receptive fields that vary in a data dependent manner. All this leads to state-of-the-art results.
PointNet++ seems an important extension over PointNet, in that it allows to properly exploit local spatial information. Yet the impact on the overall performance is just 1-2 percent.
Some more experimental or theoretical analysis would have been appreciated. For instance: 
- A number of alternative sampling options, apart from most distant point, are mentioned in the text, but not compared against in the experiments. 
- In the conclusions, it is mentioned that MSG is more robust than MRG but worse in terms of computational efficiency. I'd like to see such a claim validated by a more in-depth analysis of the computational load, or at least some indicative numbers.
