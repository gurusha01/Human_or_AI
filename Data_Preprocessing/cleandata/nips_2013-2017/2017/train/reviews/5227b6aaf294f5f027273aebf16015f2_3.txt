In this paper, a new hyperspherical convolution framework is proposed by using the angular representations. It is different from CNNs and uses SphereConv as its basic convolution operator. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, there are some concerns to be addressed.
First, about the Signoid SphereConv, how to choose the value of k? Is there any suggestion? Second, how to choose the SphereConv operator. To achieve better results, do we have to try each SphereConv operator? Compared to the original conv, how about the complexity of the proposed conv? From the results, the improvement of the proposed conv is somewhat limited.
