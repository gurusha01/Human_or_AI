The paper studies sequential hypothesis testing problems, where the decision maker processes hypotheses sequentially (as opposed to processing them jointly). The objective is to control false discovery rate (FDR) or modified FDR (mFDR), and also keep the best arm discovery rate (BDR) high. 
The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of pure-exploration multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods and results from online FDR control. Using an appropriate pure exploration method ensures that BDR is high, while the online FDR method ensure low FDR. The main contribution of the paper is an appropriate combination of these two components that guarantees simultaneous control of FDR and BDR. 
Overall, the paper is well-written and the ideas are very clear and easy to follow. The technical contribution is interesting and relevant to NIPS community.
