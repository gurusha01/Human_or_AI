The purpose of the paper is to find a way to iteratively update a solution that will converge to the KKT optimum solution. Starting with the KKT solution (line 141), the authors find a way to write it in a iterative recurrence (by splitting the square term into x(t) * x(t+1)).
Then, they construct an auxiliary lower bound function (in 2 variables: the old and the new solution) for the Lagrangian such that its solution gives the update rule. The lower bound is a concave function which, except for the variable in the Lagrangian, brings in a new variable (with the role of the old solution), having as intention the recurrence rule between new and old solution.
Moreover, the authors force it by construction to converge to a sparse solution (empirically proven only). This part should be analyzed more. Did you construct more update rules, but with non-sparse results? You should find the particularities in your update rule that make the solution sparse.
