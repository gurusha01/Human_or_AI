In this paper, the authors study isotonic regression on linear orders for online settings. The authors mention that it was shown that online isotonic regression can not be learned in a fully adversarial model, and this motivates them to tackle the problem
by proposing a more practical random permutation model. 
Some typos and grammatical inconsistencies aside, the paper is well written, clear and addresses an interesting topic. However, it is difficult to confirm the validity and the veracity of the claims formulated in the paper due to the absence of experiments.
To support the claims formulated in the paper it would be good to simulate certain examples and to demonstrate that the isotonic regression on linear orders operate in online settings.
