Frankly I didn't understand the problem setup. What are \mathcal{X, Y, Z}? compact sets in R^n? Unbounded sets? Or maybe these are finite-sets?
I understand that they describe an end-to-end optimization scheme like [29], but the problem set of stochastic programming (e.g. inventory stacking ) is unfamiliar to me. The results of the load forecasting task looks like it might be impressive, but again, I am unfamiliar with these problems. 
I'd love to see result on problems more familiar to me (and I suspect the NIPS crowd in general) e.g. continuous control problems.
