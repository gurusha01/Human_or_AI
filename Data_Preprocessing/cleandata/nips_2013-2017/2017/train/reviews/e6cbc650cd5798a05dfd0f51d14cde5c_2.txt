The authors explored a connection between Bayesian sparsity and LSTM networks and then extended the work to gated feedback networks. Specifically, the authors first discussed the relationship between sparse Bayesian learning and iterative reweighted l1 regularization, then discussed the relationship with LSTM, and finally extended to gated feedback networks. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets were reported.
