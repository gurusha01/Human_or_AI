Summary:
In this paper, the author proposes TranSync algorithm to deal with the 1D translation
synchronization problem. In contrast with many other methods, this work considers
employing the truncated least squares to alleviate noisy measurements.A theory is presented
to analyze the algorithm. Both synthetic and real data are used to demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed approach.
Qualitative:
The paper is well written and reads easily. The theory is gently exposed while the proofs are left to supplementary
materials. The proposed method is demonstrated on a wide set of experiments. The exposition would benefit from a
glimpse at the main ideas of the proof in the main text. I like this work.
