This paper attempts to reproduce user questions in a game of battleship where asking about individual squares is replaced by asking questions essentially over an artificial language with compositional logical (Montagovian) semantics. A log-linear model is used over a four simple features of the questions --- expected information gain (informativeness), answer type (Boolean or numerical), and whether the question involves features of the board at all.
At a high level the motivation in terms of active learning is reasonable but the ideas in this paper are all rather obvious and the task is very simple, highly constrained, and logically unambiguous. I do not believe that this paper will be of interest to the NIPS community.
