The paper is extremely interesting, very well motivated, and was a pleasure to read! 
1.] The paper is extremely well written and overall very clear.
2.] Can comparisons be made with existing methods? If so, why weren't these made? 
3.] Can the authors discuss robustness to model misspecification in detail (both strengths and weakness)? 
4.] Can the authors discuss the sensitivity of any fixed tuning parameters in the model (both strengths and weakness)? 
5.] What is the scalability of the model proposed and computational complexity? Will the authors be making the code publicly available with the data? Are all results reproducible using the code and data? 
6.] What conclusion should a user learn and drawn? The applications section was a bit disappointing given the motivation of the paper. A longer discussion is important to the impact and success of this paper. Please discuss.
