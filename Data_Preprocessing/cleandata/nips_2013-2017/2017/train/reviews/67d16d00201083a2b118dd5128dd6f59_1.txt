The authors present an approach relying on a Fourier feature based
distance between the phase functions of probability
distributions. This type of distance, and the corresponding kernel function 
follow the concept of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. 
The phase function based approach allows to introduce a statistical
test to compare distributions corrupted by additive noise. The
distribution of the noise is assumed to be unknown except some
properties, e.g. positivity of the characteristic function. The phase
features are also exploitable in learning from samples clustered into
labeled bags. The proposed framework then applied on different data
sets to evaluate non-parametric two-sample tests. 
The approach of the paper is a sounding one. Obviously this technique
is created for statistical problems with a special structure, but that
kind of structure is hard to handle otherwise with elementary approaches. 
The model looks like a certain error correcting mechanism on
measurements perturbed by special type of noise. I think data sources
relating more directly to signal decoding problems, specific
examples could be communication between mobiles or between satellites,
which can provide even more sounding and practical test
environment. 
The conditions exploited might require additional investigations or relaxation,
e.g. indecomposable random variable, since to test them could be
even harder than the problem presented by the authors.
