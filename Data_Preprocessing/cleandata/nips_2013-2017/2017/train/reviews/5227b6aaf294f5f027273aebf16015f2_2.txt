This paper presents a novel architecture, SphereNet, which replaces the traditional dot product with geodesic distance as the convolution operators and fully-connected layers. SphereNet also regularizes the weights for softmax to be norm 1 for angular softmax. The results show that SphereNet can achieve superior performance in terms of accuracy and convergence rate as well as mitigating the vanishing/exploding gradients in deep networks.
Novelty: Replacing dot product similarity with angular similarity has widely existed in the deep learning literature. With that being said, most works focus on using angular similarity for Softmax or loss functions. This paper introduces spherical operation for convolution, which is novel in the literature as far as I know.
Significance: The spherical operations the paper introduces achieve faster convergence rate and better accuracy performance. It also mitigates the vanishing/exploding gradients brought by dot products, which is a long standing problem. It will be interesting to lots of people in ML community.
Improvement: I have several suggestions and questions as listed below:
- For angular Softmax, the bias is removed from the equation. However, the existence of bias is very important for calibrating the output, especially for imbalanced datasets. It would be great if the authors could add that back. Otherwise, it's better to try current model on an imbalanced dataset to measure the effect.
- In the first two subfigures of Figure 4, the baseline methods such as standard CNN actually converges faster at the very beginning. But there is a big accuracy drop in the middle. What is the root cause for that? The paper seems no giving any explanation.
- Though the experimental results show faster convergence rate in terms of accuracy vs iteration, it's unknown whether this observation still hold true for accuracy vs time. Traditional dot product operators leverage fast matrix multiplication libraries for speedup, while there is much less support for angular operators.
Minor on grammar:
- Line 216, "this problem will automatically solved" -> "be solved"
- Line 319, "The task can also viewed as a ..." -> "be viewed"
