If no proper correction is applied, the repetition of individually well-grounded high-confidence tests is known to lead irremediably to absurd "statistically certified" discoveries.
False discovery rate control (FDR) is an alternative of family-wise test corrections like Bonferroni's which are known to be too conservative.
This paper propose a general framework for repeated A/B/n tests which integrates several concrete ideas:
- introduce a "best-arm identification with control" variant of the (epsilon,delta)-PAC best-arm identification problem that we could also name "better-arm identification";
- replace inefficient static A/B/n testing procedures by adaptive PAC "better-arm" algorithms;
- propose a variant of the LUCB algorithm for this purpose;
- integrate anytime p-values calculus for continuous FDR control.
The proposed "better-arm identification" algorithm is analyzed in section 3.2.
The proposed meta-procedures are analyzed and shown to guarantee this FRD control.
Some experiments are provided at the end of the paper.
At first sight I was a bit surprised by this strongly application-oriented cross-discipline paper, but I really liked the fresh ideas and the concrete perspectives they give for MABs both on the applicative and theoretic grounds.
