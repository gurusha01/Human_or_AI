The paper propose a new method for learning hash codes using label and similarity data based on deep neural networks. The main idea of the paper is eq(6) where the authors propose a loss function that takes into account both pairwise similarity information and label information. 
The experiment section seems adequate and examines several aspect of the algo, e.g. importance of adding label information and comparison with state-of-the-art.
couple of points:
 - there is a similar work in 
K. Lin, H.-F. Yang, J.-H. Hsiao, and C.-S. Chen. Deep learning of binary hash codes for fast image retrieval.
It would be interesting to see a comparison both in terms of network structure and performance.
 - in eq(4) is it possible to use a softmax classifier instead of the linear one?
