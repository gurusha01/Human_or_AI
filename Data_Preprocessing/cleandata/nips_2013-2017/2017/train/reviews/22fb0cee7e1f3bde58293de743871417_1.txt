This paper presents DPSCREEN, a method for determining optimal screening policies for large classes of diseases. Compared to other work in the area, DPSCREEN takes into account both the patient's clinical (screening) history, in addition to patient features pertinent to the specific disease model. As a result, DPSCREEN is able to achieve personalization in the screening process, which yields efficiency gains over existing screening policies without negatively impacting the timeliness of disease detection.
Overall I found this paper to be well-written and technically sound. The approach is well-motivated, considers pertinent related work, and provides a concise but thorough discussion of the mathematical basis of the algorithm, including computational complexity. DPScreen is validated on a large (45k patient) dataset from the Athena Health Network. This sufficiently demonstrates the improvements provided by personalization. The model is also validated across disease model types. The result is a paper that makes a clear technical contribution that also has the potential for practical impact as well.
