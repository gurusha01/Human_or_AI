The paper presents a variance reduction stochastic optimization algorithm for the case of perturbations of data that explicitly takes into account the fact that the variance among datapoints will be far higher than among the perturbations of a single one. Improvement is shown both theoretically and using simulations.
I really like the motivation to handle the perturbation variance separately leading to improvements in convergence. The convergence results are all interesting (I was not able to fully verify their correctness).
There seem to be (non-critical) typos in the derivation: refer line 428: is it (1-\alphat) instead of \alphat? 
I have read the rebuttal and would like to stay with the score.
