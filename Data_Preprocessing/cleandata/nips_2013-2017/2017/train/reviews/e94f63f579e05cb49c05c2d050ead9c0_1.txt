The paper proposes a deep hashing approach that assumes a setting where there is a training set with class annotations. The model parameters are learned using a loss based on pairwise similarities and class separability under a linear model. The main novelty is in handling the binary embedding directly during learning, without relaxation, using alternating minimization. Results seem better than all the many baselines presented, across two different datasets. There is also a comprehensive analysis of different options. The writing is clear.
I'm not an expert in this area, so my main concern is novelty. It seems like the proposed optimization has been proposed before ([9, 17, 21]), so i assume the difference is that in this paper is that there's also the linear classification component of the loss. The overall approach seems also quite complex and potentially very slow to train (how slow?).
