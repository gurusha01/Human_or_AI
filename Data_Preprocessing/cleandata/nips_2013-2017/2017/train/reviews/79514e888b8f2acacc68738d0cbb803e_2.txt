In this paper, the authors proposed a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm based on GANs. It demonstrated that given the discriminator objective, good semi-supervised learning indeed requires a bad generator. They derive a novel formulation that substantially improves over feature matching GANs. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets. The paper is interesting and well-written, which is important for the family of GANs algorithm. I have several concerns as follows:
1. As is demonstrate in W-GAN, the GANs is not easy to converge when we minimizing the KL divergence between the generator distribution and the target distribution. It would be nice if the authors could demonstrate whether the algorithms can be applied to more advanced GANs. 
2. As is well-known, it is not easy to generate the general samples based on GANs, such as the images with high resolutions. It is expected the author could demonstrate how to use the proposed models when sample generation is not easy. 
3. It would be nice if the authors could demonstrate how "bad" a generator should be for a semi-supervised classifier. 
4. It is interesting if the authors could demonstrate whether the human-specified labels can improve the performance of the generator, such that some satisfactory images can be generated.
