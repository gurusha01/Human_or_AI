The paper introduces a united framework for explaining model predictions on a single input. Under the class of additive feature importance, there is a only one solution that satisfies a set of desired properties. Efficient approximation methods to SHAP values are proposed.
The authors are tackling a very important problem that draws lots of attention in recent years. The paper is clearly written and it is pleasure to read. The properties proposed for desirable methods are intuitive, though the local accuracy criterion seems too restrictive. It is very novel to use the Sharpley value and give its associated theoretical properties. One sanity check is that when the original model is already interpretable, i.e. the features are 0/1, the method can return the same model. However it seems from Corollary 1 this is not the case since E[x_j] is nonzero. Can the authors provide more explanation? Also, more details about the computation cost(time) of DeepSHAP can be provided to help people have a clear expectation of the method when applying that in practice.
