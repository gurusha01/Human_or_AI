This paper gives an accelerated first-order methods for geodesically convex optimization on Riemannian manifold. It is proven tha the proposed method converge linear, i.e., O((1-\sqrt{mu/L})^k), for mu-strongly G-convex and L-smooth function and O(1/k^2) for only G-L-smooth function. This results generalize the Euclidean method: the Nesterov's accelerated method. Numerical experiments report the performance of the proposed method compared to RGD and RSGD methods.
The main concern for this paper is the applications of the proposed method. The experimental result is not convincing. For Karcher mean on SPD matrices, the cost function is smooth and the Hessian always has good condition number. Methods that explore higher order information have better performance. The authors claims that Bini's method, Riemannian GD method and limited-memory Riemanian BFGS have similar performance. However, it is not the case, especially when BB step size instead of a constant step size is used as the initial step size in line search algorthm. Usually 30 passes can reduce the objective gap by a factor more than 10^10 rather than only 10^3 in this paper.
This application seems not to be a good example for the proposed method. Since the propose method does not require the function to be C^2, an application with C^1 cost function may be more suitable to show the performance of the proposed method.
