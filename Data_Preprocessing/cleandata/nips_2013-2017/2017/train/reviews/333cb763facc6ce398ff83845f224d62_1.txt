This paper presents a multi-output Gaussian process co-variance
function that is defined in the spectral domain. The approach of
designing co-variances in the spectral domain is an important
contribution to GPs that I personally feel have not gotten the
attention that it deserves. This paper extends this to the
multi-output scenario. The paper is an extension of the work presented
in [1]. However, considering the multi-output case the challenge is
how to describe cross-covariance which is does not have to be
positive-definite. In this paper the authors describes just such an
approach in a manner that leads to the spectral mixture covariance for
multi-output GPs. 
The paper is well written with a short and clear introduction to the
problem and to GP fundamentals. The explanation of the spectral
mixture kernel is clear and the extensions proposed are to my
knowledge novel. The relationship to previous work is well explained
and I believe that there is sufficient novelty in the work to justify
publication.
The experiments are sufficient for a paper such as this, they do not
provide a lot of intuition however, especially the Jura data-set is
hard to actually reason about. But, for a paper such as this I think
the experimental evaluation is sufficient.
