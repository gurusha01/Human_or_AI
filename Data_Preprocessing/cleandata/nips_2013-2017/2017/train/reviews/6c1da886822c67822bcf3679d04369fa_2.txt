SUMMARY 
* The paper presents a method for density estimation based on a stack of autoregressive models, exploiting a normalizing flow interpretation of autoregressive models. This is an approach to increase the flexibility of the conditionals in masked autoregressive density estimation in contrast to say mixture models. 
CLARITY 
* The paper is very well written. It does a good job at explaining the relations of existing methods. 
* The experiments are presented in a convincing way and code is provided. 
RELEVANCE
* The proposed approach appears sensible and seems to provide substantial benefits over other approaches, especially in the case of conditional density estimation. 
* The experiments show a good performance of the proposed methods. While other methods have shown very good performance when incorporating knowledge about the problem domain, the proposed methods are demonstrated to provide a competitive alternative for general purpose density estimation. 
* The discussion seems to open promising avenues for further research.
