The paper proposes using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) for point process intensity or hazard estimation. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of objective functions beyond MLE and proposes a computationally efficient distance measure. It uses a regularized dual formulation for optimization and an RNN for generator and discriminator functions. Details on the methods and data used in the real analyses are light and could be documented more clearly for reproducability. 
The results demonstrate that the WGANTPP performs reasonably in a variety of tasks using both simulated and real data. The comparison baselines appear unreasonably weak, e.g. the kernel mixture process uses 3 components and visibly has 3 humps in all results, and e.g. the self-exciting and self correcting processes use fixed baselines when there is a large literature on settings for semi-parametric hazard functions. Using more flexible and analogous comparison models, e.g. Goulding ICDM 2016, Weiss ECML 2013, Jing WSDM 2017, would make for better comparison.
The distance defined would not deal with noise in the form of extraneous events due to the alignment of the ith element with the ith element of each sequence. Might a distance based on local alignment would likely be more robust than the one proposed? In what specific applications do you expect this distance to be more useful than log likelihood.
Eq 3. perhaps the second summation should read \sum{j=i+1}^m yj.
