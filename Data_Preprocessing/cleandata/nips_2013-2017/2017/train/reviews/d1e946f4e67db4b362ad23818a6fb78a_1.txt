The paper presents a new method called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM) to provides a multiplicative update technique for the general Quadratic Programming problem. Compared to existing methods, the update steps have a closed form solution, the convergence is guaranteed, and the doubly stochastic constraints are directly integrated in the optimization process. 
The paper is technically sound, and the claims seem theoretically and experimentally well supported.
The paper writing is clear and the organization is neat. 
Without knowing too much about graph matching and its related literature, the approach seems novel, and given the description and the qualitative and quantitative results, the advance over state-of-the-art seems sufficient.
Graph Matching is a commonly known problem. Having an algorithm with guaranteed convergence
