The paper introduced hierarchical Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram and studied its performance in route prediction. It shows how introducing the hierarchical idea preserves the properties of SDD and the improvement in route prediction. It also presents why this hierarchical PSDD enjoys more efficient computation compared to probabilistic graphical models -- due to its efficiency in describing feasible combinatorial structures.
The paper is overall quite nice except it only presented an illustration of hierarchical PSDD on one example dataset/task. Would be helpful to see if this advantage persists through other datasets.
Another question is how computation cost of hierarchical PSDD compares of the original PSDD. Given a more flexible model (hierarhical), the computation cost would probably be higher -- but how much higher is interesting to know.

After author rebuttal:
Many thanks for the rebuttal from the authors. They do clarify. My scores remain the same though. Thanks!
