The paper formulates a new type of covariance function for multi-output Gaussian processes. Instead of directly specifying the cross-covariance functions, the authors propose to specify the cross-power spectral densities and using the inverse Fourier transform to find the corresponding cross-covariances. The paper follows a similar idea to the one proposed by [6] for single output Gaussian processes, where the power spectral density was represented through a mixture of Gaussians and then back-transformed to obtaining a powerful kernel function with extrapolation abilities. The authors applied the newly established covariance for a synthetic data example, and for two real data examples, the weather dataset and the Swiss Jura dataset for metal concentrations. 
Extending the idea from [6] sounds like a clever way to build new types of covariance functions for multiple-outputs. One of the motivations in [6] was to build a kernel function with the ability to perform extrapolation. It would have been interesting to provide this covariance function for multiple-outputs with the same ability. The experimental section only provides results with very common datasets, and the results obtained are similar to the ones obtained with other covariance functions for multiple-outputs. The impact of the paper could be increased by including experiments in datasets for which none of the other models are suitable. 
Did you test for the statistical significance of the results in Tables 1 and 2. It seems that, within the standard deviation, almost all models provide a similar performance.
