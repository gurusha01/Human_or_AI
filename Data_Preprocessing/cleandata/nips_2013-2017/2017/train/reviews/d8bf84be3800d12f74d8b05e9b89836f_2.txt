This paper is a follow-up on the very recent PointNet paper. Its main contribution is to make PointNet more similar to CNNs by introducing the spatial relation between points (in the form of grouping), and thus a form of locality and shift invariance for the low level descriptors. 
While the contribution is straightforward to explain, and at the end not a huge step from PointNet, it is well presented, evaluated, , it was probably some work to make it work efficiently (and it would be good to add numbers about speed in the paper, I don't think I saw them and sampling, centring etc. may improve the time quite a lot) and the results are satisfying (even if they are not amazing: for classification, I would consider the most meaningful comparison pointnet vs. pointnet++ without normal, so 89.2/90.7 . For segmentation, the comparison without normals should be added )
As a sidenote, I appreciated the results on SHREC non rigid shape classification, I don't know much paper evaluating both for it and ModelNet.
