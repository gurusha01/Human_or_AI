This paper explores generalized hamming distance in the context of fuzzy neural networks. The paper shows that the neural computation at each neuron can be viewed as calculating the generalized hamming distance between the corresponding weight vector and input vector. This view point is useful as it automatically gives candidate bias parameter at the neuron and learning of additional parameters (using batch normalization) is not required during the training. Furthermore, this view also allows the authors to understand the role of rectified linear units and propose a double-thresholding scheme to make the training process fast and stable. Based on these two observations, the paper proposes generalized hamming networks (GHN) where each neuron exactly computes the generalized hamming distance. These networks also utilize non-linear activations. 
The paper then presents simulation results showcasing the performance of the proposed GHN for image classification and auto-encoder design. The simulation results demonstrate that GHN have fast learning process and achieve very good performances on the underlying tasks. Interestingly, the simulation results show that the GHN do not necessarily require max-pooling. 
The paper is well written and explains the main ideas in a clear manner. The simulation results are also convincing. However, it appears that the plots are not complete, e.g., Fig. 4.2 does not show a curve for learning rate = 0.0001. Even though I would have preferred a more comprehensive (both theoretical and practical) evaluations, I over all find the idea of GHN interesting.
Minor comments:
1) In abstract, '(GNN)' should be '(GHN)'.
2) In line 55 of page 2, 'felxaible' should be 'flexible'.
