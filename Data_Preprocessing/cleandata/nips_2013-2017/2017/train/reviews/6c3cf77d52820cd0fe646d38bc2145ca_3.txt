The paper presents an interesting approach towards deanonymizing the Bitcoin network. The paper is presented in a tidy manner and contains enough figures to explain the approach and experiments. Especially the probabilistic analysis is nice and provides stimulating ideas. I did not find any problems and I recommend acceptance. 
Though the paper is well presented, I'm not completely sure that the paper fits to NIPS or could have stimulating impact to the NIPS community
