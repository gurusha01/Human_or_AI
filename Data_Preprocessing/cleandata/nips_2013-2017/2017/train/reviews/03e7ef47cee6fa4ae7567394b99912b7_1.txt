This paper studies query complexity for clustering with 'side information'. The 'side information' is provided as a similarity matrix W, whose Wij entry is distributed as f+ or f-, depending on if i,j belong to the same cluster or different cluster. The main result of the paper is that one requires Theta(nk) queries without side information whereas they show that only O(k log n/H^2(f+||f-) ) queries are sufficient with side information, where H is the Hellinger distance. They also show that up to a log(n) factor, this is tight. 
I find this to be an interesting theoretical result for several reasons. This is closely related to SBM which has seen a lot of activity in recent years, but asks some interesting questions as to how allowing queries change the threshold. It shows that allowing side information can drastically change query complexity. This itself is probably not surprising as the side information can have the complete cluster information, but the paper identifies how to assess the quality of the similarity matrix.
