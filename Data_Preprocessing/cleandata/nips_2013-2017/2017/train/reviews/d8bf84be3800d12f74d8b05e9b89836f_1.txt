This paper is improving the PointNet [19] with a recursive approach to introduce local context learning with gradually increasing scales. 
+ The exposition is clear and the math is easy to follow. 
+ Experiments show that PointNet++ achieves the best results on pointset benchmarks. 
- Even though the motivation builds upon local detail recovery ability of PointNet++, this is not strongly supported by the results.
I am leaning towards acceptance due to the fact that clear experiments are provided on benchmarks with state of the art results.
