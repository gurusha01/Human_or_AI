I think this paper is interesting and provide some good insight for RCD and SGD algorithms. Conclusion 2 in Theorem 3.2 is very useful because it suggests that the new sampling method is better than L based sampling which is a commonly used strategy. I have the following comments which I want the authors to consider.
1. In Line 85, in the denominator of p^*i, it should be xk not x. 
2. In Line 135, you may want to remove the subscript k for \hat p and \hat c just to be consistent.
3. I cannot see any tick, label, number and word in all figures, which are too small. Please move some of them to appendix to gain space so that you can show larger figures.
4. If possible, please provide a result similar to Conclusion 2 in Theorem 3.2 but comparing with uniform sampling (p=1/n) instead of L_i based method
5. Please remark on how will this new sampling method affect the total complexity of RCD or SGD. For example, what will be the total complexity (including the O(n) time for updating lk and uk) for RCD to find an epislon-optimal solution?
