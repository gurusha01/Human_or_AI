This paper proposes a new greedy coordinate descent type algorithm. The algorithm uses a novel Gauss-Southwell coordinate selection rule, where a convex minimization problem involving the l_1-norm squared is used to select the coordinates to be updated. This coordinate selection strategy is interesting, and it has been developed with practicality in mind, which is important. The authors have also incorporated an acceleration strategy, and presented the ASGCD algorithm (Accelerated Stochastic Greedy Coordinate Descent). 
Greedy coordinate selection schemes are very popular at the moment, and I think there will be many authors interested in this strategy. However, there seem to be quite a few typos in the paper, and the standard of English should be improved. I suggest that the authors thoroughly proofread the papers to correct these errors. Also, the numerical experiments seem to support the proposed algorithm but the problems being tested are quite small, and it would have been good for the authors to have evaluated the algorithm on some large-scale problems.
