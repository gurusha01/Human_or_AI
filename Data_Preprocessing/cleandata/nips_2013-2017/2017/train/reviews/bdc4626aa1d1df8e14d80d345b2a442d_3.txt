This paper presents a variant of linear UCB method for the contextual linear bandit problem, which is "conservative" in the sense that it will not violate the constraint that its performance is to be above a fixed percentage of a given baseline method. The authors prove some basic regret bounds on their proposed conservative method to establish their soundness. The idea of the method is straightforward, and the proofs are not particularly surprising, and the techniques used therein not overly innovative. Nonetheless, the problem formulation and proposed method are practical, and the results of the paper will likely benefit real world applications.
