This paper presents a novel application of the Min-Sum message-passing protocol to solve the consensus problem in distributed optimization. The authors introduce a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to converge to the problem solution with accelerated rates. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence behavior of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, including a proof of its convergence and a characterization of its asymptotic rate of convergence.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) Min-Sum Splitting converges to the consensus solution, (2) the introduction of splitting parameters is fundamental to guarantee convergence and can be tuned to achieve accelerated convergence rates, and (3) the acceleration mechanism of Min-Sum Splitting is analogous to that of lifted Markov chain techniques and multi-step first-order methods.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The authors derive a linear message-passing update for the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and introduce an auxiliary process to track its evolution. They also provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, including lifted Markov chain techniques and multi-step first-order methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its analysis. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithms and their implementation.
