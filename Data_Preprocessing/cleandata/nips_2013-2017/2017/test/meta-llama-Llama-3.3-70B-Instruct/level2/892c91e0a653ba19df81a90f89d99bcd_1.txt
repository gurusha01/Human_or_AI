This paper proposes Adept, an adaptive stimulus selection method that optimizes population objective functions to efficiently find stimuli that drive a population of neurons. The main claim of the paper is that Adept can effectively optimize neural population responses by using a population objective function, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that focus on optimizing the firing rate of a single neuron.
The paper provides strong support for this claim through simulations and a closed-loop electrophysiological experiment on macaque V4. The results show that Adept elicits larger mean responses and a larger diversity of responses than optimizing the response of each neuron separately. The paper also demonstrates that Adept is robust to neural noise and overfitting, and can be used with different feature embeddings, including those from deep convolutional neural networks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the Adept algorithm and its underlying principles. The use of simulations and experimental data to validate the method is also a strength of the paper. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of the method and potential future directions, which demonstrates a good understanding of the field and the challenges that need to be addressed.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for adaptive stimulus selection. While the authors mention that Adept is the first adaptive method to consider a population of neurons together, it would be helpful to see a more thorough evaluation of how Adept performs compared to other methods.
Overall, the paper is well-organized, clearly written, and provides a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience. The use of Adept has the potential to facilitate experiments that involve neurons far from the sensory periphery, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the method and its underlying principles.
