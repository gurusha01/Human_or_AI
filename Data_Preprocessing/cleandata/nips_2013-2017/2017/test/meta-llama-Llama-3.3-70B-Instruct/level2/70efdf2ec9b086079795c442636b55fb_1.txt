This paper proposes a novel approach to increasing the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, called the Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM). The main claim of the paper is that tLSTM can efficiently widen and deepen the LSTM network without significantly increasing the parameter number or runtime. The authors achieve this by representing the hidden states as tensors and updating them via a cross-layer convolution, which allows for more flexible parameter sharing and efficient widening of the network.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the background and motivation of the work, as well as a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the related work, including convolutional LSTMs and deep LSTMs, and highlight the advantages of their approach.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tLSTM on a variety of sequence learning tasks, including language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and image classification. The results show that tLSTM can outperform other popular approaches, such as stacked LSTMs and convolutional LSTMs, and achieve state-of-the-art results on some tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is novel and well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the intuition behind it.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of tasks.
