This paper presents a study on the influence maximization problem in social networks with non-submodular threshold functions, which is a departure from the traditional submodular influence diffusion models. The authors introduce the concept of ε-almost submodular threshold functions, where a fraction of nodes have non-submodular threshold functions that are closely upper- and lower-bounded by submodular functions.
The paper makes several key contributions. Firstly, it shows that influence maximization is still hard to approximate even when the number of ε-almost submodular nodes is sub-linear, with a strong hardness result indicating that there is no 1/n^γ c-approximation algorithm for influence maximization unless P=NP. Secondly, it provides a greedy algorithm based on submodular lower bounds of threshold functions to handle graphs with small numbers of ε-almost submodular nodes, with a theoretical guarantee of a (1-1/e)(1-ε)^` approximation ratio.
The authors also conduct experiments on real-world datasets, including NetHEPT, Flixster, and DBLP, to evaluate the performance of their algorithms. The results show that their algorithms, TIM-U and TIM-L, outperform other baseline algorithms, including PageRank and High-degree, in terms of influence size. The experiments also demonstrate that the algorithms are scalable and can handle large networks with a significant number of ε-almost submodular nodes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The use of ε-almost submodular threshold functions is a novel approach to modeling non-submodular influence diffusion, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical and practical implications of this approach.
Strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new concept, ε-almost submodular threshold functions, which provides a more realistic model of influence diffusion in social networks.
* The provision of a greedy algorithm with a theoretical guarantee for handling graphs with small numbers of ε-almost submodular nodes.
* The conduct of experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
Weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the number of ε-almost submodular nodes is small, which may not always be the case in real-world social networks.
* The lack of comparison with other algorithms that can handle non-submodular influence diffusion models.
* The need for further research on accelerating the naive greedy process with arbitrary submodular threshold functions.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of influence maximization and social network analysis, and the authors' approach to modeling non-submodular influence diffusion is a valuable addition to the existing literature.
