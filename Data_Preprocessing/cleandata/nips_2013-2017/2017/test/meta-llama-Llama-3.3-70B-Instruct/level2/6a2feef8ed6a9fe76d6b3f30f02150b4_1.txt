This paper proposes a novel Tikhonov regularization approach for training deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation functions. The authors reformulate the network training as a block multi-convex minimization problem and develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve it. The algorithm is proven to converge globally to stationary points with R-linear convergence rate of order one.
The paper's main claims are: (1) the proposed Tikhonov regularization approach can be used to learn both dense and sparse DNNs, (2) the BCD algorithm can guarantee global convergence to stationary points with R-linear convergence rate of order one, and (3) the algorithm can produce better representations than traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based solvers.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on the MNIST dataset. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm converges and achieves better test-set error rates than SGD-based solvers. They also show that their algorithm can learn sparse networks, which can be useful in scenarios where sparse models are desired.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-organized presentation, thorough theoretical analysis, and comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including the derivation of the Tikhonov regularization matrix and the BCD algorithm. They also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the network architecture is fixed and do not consider the case where the architecture is learned during training. Additionally, the computational complexity of the algorithm is cubic in the input dimension, which may limit its scalability to large datasets.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to training DNNs. The use of Tikhonov regularization and BCD algorithm is a new and innovative approach that has not been explored before in the context of deep learning.
The paper's significance lies in its potential to improve the training of DNNs and provide better representations than traditional SGD-based solvers. The authors' approach may also be useful in scenarios where sparse models are desired, such as in embedded systems or real-time applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough presentation of their approach. The paper's strengths outweigh its limitations, and it makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning.
