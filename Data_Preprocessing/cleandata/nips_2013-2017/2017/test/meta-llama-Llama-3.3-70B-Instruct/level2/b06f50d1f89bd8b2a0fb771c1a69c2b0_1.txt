This paper proposes a multi-task learning framework for contextual bandit problems, which leverages similarities in contexts for different arms to improve the agent's ability to predict rewards. The authors introduce a kernelized multi-task learning UCB (KMTL-UCB) algorithm, establish a corresponding regret bound, and interpret this bound to quantify the advantages of learning in the presence of high task similarity. They also describe an effective scheme for estimating task similarity from data and demonstrate the algorithm's performance on several datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experiments are well-designed and informative. The results show that KMTL-UCB outperforms other methods, including Kernel-UCB in the independent and pooled settings, and that estimating task similarity on the fly is effective.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel multi-task learning framework for contextual bandit problems, which addresses the limitations of existing approaches.
* The establishment of a regret bound for KMTL-UCB, which provides a theoretical guarantee for the algorithm's performance.
* The introduction of a scheme for estimating task similarity from data, which is essential for real-world applications.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of KMTL-UCB on various datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the task similarity matrix is known or can be estimated accurately, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The lack of comparison with other multi-task learning approaches, such as CGP-UCB, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method's strengths and limitations.
* The limited discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed framework, which could be explored further.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of contextual bandits and multi-task learning, and the results are promising. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and explore the potential applications of the proposed framework.
