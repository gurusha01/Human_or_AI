This paper investigates the influence maximization problem within a non-submodular framework, deviating from the conventional submodularity assumption. The research tackles a novel and complex problem. Nevertheless, the manuscript has several limitations: Firstly, the adoption of the \varepsilon-AS assumption lacks robust justification, and supplementary data analysis is required to substantiate this assumption. Secondly, the provided proofs are opaque and would benefit from intuitive explanations accompanied by illustrative examples to enhance their comprehensibility.
