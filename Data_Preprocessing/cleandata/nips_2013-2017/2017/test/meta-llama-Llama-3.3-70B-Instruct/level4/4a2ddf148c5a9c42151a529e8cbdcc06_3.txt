This manuscript examines the support recovery performance of the PHT algorithm, as introduced by Jain et al., expanding on their original work which primarily focused on estimation error within the PHT family. The technical aspects of the paper seem robust; however, the distinction between the techniques employed here and those in reference [4] is not immediately clear, which may impact my evaluation upon further clarification by the authors.
The presentation of the manuscript requires refinement. Notably, there are multiple typos throughout the text that necessitate a thorough review. Furthermore, the title contains a grammatical error; a more appropriate version could be "Towards a Unified Analysis of Support Recovery," as the phrase "a towards unified analysis" used elsewhere in the manuscript is incorrect.
Additionally, the abstract mentions "\kappa" as "THE condition number" without clear specification, leading to initial confusion about which condition number is being referred to. It would be more accurate to describe it as "where \kappa is an appropriate condition number," avoiding the need for a formal definition in the abstract and enhancing clarity for readers.
