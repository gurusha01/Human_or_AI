This paper explores the challenge of approximating matrices in the absence of a clear metric on the data, utilizing the l_0 norm, which measures the number of non-zero elements between the original and approximated data. The authors propose a low-rank solution to this problem.
However, the paper lacks a practical scenario where this approach is beneficial. The concept of "low rank" implies linearity, which may not be meaningful without an underlying metric to interpret the data. For instance, when k=1, it is straightforward to set the first row and one element in each subsequent row of A-A' to zero, resulting in 2n-1 zero elements. Nevertheless, predicting the remaining elements linearly seems arbitrary.
Furthermore, if the elements in matrix A are continuous variables drawn from a distribution without linear properties, the probability of finding a low-rank approximation A' where more than the minimal number of elements in A-A' can be exactly zero (as required by the l_0 norm) is zero. Consequently, for data drawn randomly from a continuous distribution, the optimal solution OPT^{(k)} is likely to be approximately (n-k)(m-k) with high probability. If k is relatively low, theorems like Theorem 2, which discuss multiples of OPT^{(k)}, become trivial since O(k^2) OPT^{(k)} exceeds 2.OPT^{(k)} and mn for random data.
The problem may be more interesting when the data is already close to low rank due to external factors, resulting in many elements matching the linear low-rank relation. The authors also acknowledge this in line 272, suggesting that the work is most compelling when matrix A is nearly low rank.
From a theoretical perspective, the mathematical development and randomized algorithms presented are intriguing. To enhance the paper, the authors could relocate some details to the supplementary material and create a cohesive narrative connecting the algorithms to specific learning problems. Minor suggestions include revising "supplementary" to "supplementary material" in line 48 and removing the redundant "w.h.p." in line 244.
