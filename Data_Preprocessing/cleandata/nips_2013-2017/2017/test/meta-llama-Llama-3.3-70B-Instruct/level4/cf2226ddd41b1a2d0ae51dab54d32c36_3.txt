Influence maximization is known to be a P-hard problem in the general case. Although a greedy algorithm can provide a constant fraction approximate solution when the local influence functions (and, as shown by Mossel and Roche [8], the global influence function) exhibit submodularity, this paper explores the scenario where the local influence functions are not exactly submodular but rather approximately submodular. Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that even if only a sublinear fraction of nodes are approximately submodular, it is not possible to approximate the influence function well in polynomial time. This result is achieved through the construction of a specialized example that amplifies the non-submodularity, leading to a non-approximable influence function. Moreover, the authors show that when only a constant number of nodes are approximately submodular, a constant fraction approximation can be obtained, and they propose an algorithm to accomplish this.
The paper addresses a highly intriguing problem and presents notable theoretical findings. The efficacy of the algorithm discussed in the latter part of the paper is supported by simulation results. I recommend that this paper be accepted.
