The authors propose a screening rule for identifying block structures in the Ising model, which can be combined with exact or inexact optimization methods to enable scalable parameter estimation. I have several observations regarding this approach:
(1) Alternatively, spectral clustering or regularized spectral clustering can be employed to determine the block structure, followed by exact or inexact optimization. A comparison of the proposed screening procedure with eigenvalue decomposition on a graph Laplacian would be beneficial to assess its effectiveness and distinguish it from existing methods.
(2) The second-moment screening rule presented in this work bears similarities to previously proposed screening rules, such as those in Witten et al. (2011) and Mazumder & Hastie (2012). A detailed discussion on the similarities and differences between the current approach and existing methods in the literature would provide valuable context.
(3) The robustness of the block-wise parametrization of $\theta$ is a concern, as the initial screening rule may lead to inaccurate parameter estimation if the true $\theta$ does not exhibit a block structure. An evaluation of the proposed method's performance in such scenarios would help assess its reliability and potential limitations.
