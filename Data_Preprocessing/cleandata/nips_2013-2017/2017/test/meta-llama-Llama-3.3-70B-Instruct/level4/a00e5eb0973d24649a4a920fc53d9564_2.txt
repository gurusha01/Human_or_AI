This manuscript presents several key findings on lower bounds for finite sum optimization problems, contributing to a nearly comprehensive theory that has emerged over the past two years. As this is a crucial research area, the paper's contributions are noteworthy. 
The paper is exceptionally well-written, surpassing the quality of most NIPS submissions. My comments are limited to the following:
• The application of Fano's inequality in equation (10) is unclear; a clarification would be beneficial.
• The equation between lines 134-135 appears to be incorrect; should the last part be revised to n^2/2 for consistency?
• The definition of t^{*} in equation 13 is not readily available, and its clarification would aid understanding.
• The use of the tilde in big-Omega notation throughout the paper seems inconsistent and could be standardized.
• Definition 2 would benefit from explicit clarification that \theta typically encompasses the function index, as the preceding text only mentions the oracle's ability to query specific individual functions.
• The relationship between the result in section 3.2 and Theorem 2 in reference 4 requires further explanation. Is the improvement solely due to the additional n term? Similarly, the outcome of section 3.3 bears a close resemblance to results in the same paper. The introduction claims an improvement over the results in [4], but the exact nature of this enhancement needs to be more precisely articulated.
