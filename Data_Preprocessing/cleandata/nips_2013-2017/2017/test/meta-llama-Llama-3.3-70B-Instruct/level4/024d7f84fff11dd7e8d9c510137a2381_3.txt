This paper presents an accelerated version of the Min-Sum message-passing protocol, tailored for solving consensus problems in distributed optimization. By leveraging reparametrization techniques from [Ruozzi and Tatikonda, 2013], the authors derive convergence rates for the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm when applied to quadratic objective functions. A key analytical tool employed in this work is the construction of an auxiliary linear process that mirrors the evolution of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm.
The primary contributions of this manuscript can be encapsulated as follows: (i) it introduces a novel proof technique based on an auxiliary process to analyze the Min-Sum splitting algorithm, (ii) it designs an enhanced Min-Sum protocol for consensus problems that outperforms previously established convergence results, and (iii) it elucidates the connection between the proposed methodology, lifted Markov chains, and multi-step methods in convex optimization.
The paper's motivation and contributions are clearly articulated. The writing is lucid and accessible, although it contains several typographical and grammatical errors, which are enumerated below. The proofs provided for Propositions 1 and 2, as well as Theorem 1, appear to be sound.
Noted typographical and grammatical errors include:
- Line 34: The phrase "with theirs neighbors" should be corrected to "with their neighbors".
- Line 174: "double-stochastic" should be replaced with "doubly-stochastic".
- Line 183: The phrase "can be casted as" is incorrect and should be "can be cast as".
- Line 192: "class of graph with" should be "class of graphs with".
- Line 197: "which seems to" should be "which seem to".
- Line 206: "additional overheads" should be singular, as "additional overhead".
- Line 225: "pugging" is a typo and should be "plugging".
- Line 238: "are seen to" could be more accurately expressed as "are able to".
- Line 240: "both type of" should be "both types of".
- Line 248: "also seen to" would be better phrased as "also shown to".
- Lines 279-280: "to convergence to" should be "to converge to".
- Line 300: "which scales like" should be plural, as "which scale like".
- Line 302: "for the cycle" could be clarified as "for cycle graphs".
Additional minor comments:
- In Lines 220 and 221, the terms "Lagrangian" and "Lagrange multipliers" might be more appropriate than "Laplacian" and "Laplace multipliers".
- The paper introduces three algorithms but does not always clarify the quantities involved. For instance, the meanings of \(R{vw}\) and \(r{vw}\) in Algorithm 2 are not provided. Furthermore, \(\hat{R}^0\) and \(\hat{r}^0\) in Algorithm 2 seem uninitialized. Given the centrality of the auxiliary linear process to the analysis, it would be beneficial for the authors to explicitly identify which variables in Algorithm 3 correspond to this process.
The manuscript also appears to lack several pertinent references:
- Lines 41 and 43 discuss (sub)gradient methods for consensus optimization but could be supplemented with references such as Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1989), Sundhar Ram Srinivasan et al. (2009), and Wei Shi (2015), among others.
- Line 170 mentions "The original literature" without specification.
- Line 229 could reference the work by Polyak on the Heavy-ball method.
- Line 232 might benefit from a reference to Nesterov's work.
It would be enlightening if the authors could address the following points:
- Although the paper is theoretically oriented, commentary on the practical applicability of the method and its comparative advantages over other distributed consensus optimization methods would be valuable.
- An exploration of the limitations of the Min-Sum Splitting method would provide a more comprehensive understanding.
- Elucidating the intuition behind the use of the auxiliary process in the Min-Sum Splitting method could enhance the paper's clarity.
- The current results are confined to consensus problems with quadratic objective functions. An investigation into whether this framework can be extended to more general consensus problems, commonly encountered in Machine Learning, would be intriguing.
- A clear justification for why this approach is significant within the context of Machine Learning and to the Machine Learning community would strengthen the paper's impact.
In summary, this theoretically grounded paper establishes convergence rates using a novel proof technique and highlights connections to established methods. While the ideas are intriguing, the manuscript would benefit from discussions on practicality, intuition behind the auxiliary process, potential limitations, and the relevance of this work to the broader Machine Learning community.
