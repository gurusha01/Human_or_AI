This paper presents a GAN-based framework for generating novel-view person images, guided by a target skeleton represented as keypoints. The framework leverages established techniques, including DCGANs and U-nets, with the primary contribution lying in its application to a specific computer vision task.
Strengths:
* The proposed concept is intriguing, the writing is clear, and the empirical experiments demonstrate the ability to synthesize somewhat realistic images.
Weaknesses:
* Given the application-oriented nature of this work, achieving strong results is crucial. My primary concerns are:
	 The lack of quantitative evaluation, such as organizing user studies to assess the frequency at which generated images can deceive human observers.
	 The empirical results are not visually impressive. For instance, the generated images in Figure 1 are too small to be clearly seen, and upon comparison with the target images, numerous noticeable visual errors are apparent. This makes it challenging to conclude that the current results are of high quality or comparable to real images. This issue persists across most results, including supplementary figures. While I believe the authors are on the right track and the work shows promise, it is premature to declare success at this stage.
After Rebuttal:
Upon reviewing the authors' response, I remain unconvinced. Other reviewers have also highlighted the ongoing issues with both quantitative and qualitative results, which are essential for a practical, application-oriented work like this. Although the rebuttal attempts to address these concerns, it does not do so to a satisfactory degree. In my opinion, the work may not be ready for presentation at a prestigious venue like NIPS.
