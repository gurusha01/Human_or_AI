This paper investigates the l0-low rank approximation problem, which aims to approximate an input matrix A (of size m x n) with a rank-k matrix A' that minimizes the entry-wise l0 distance. The authors present the first bicriteria approximation algorithm for this problem, achieving a rank of O(k log(mn)) with an l0 distance of at most poly(k log(mn)) times the optimal solution, denoted as OPTk, for any k > 1 in poly(mn) time.
Additionally, the paper provides a (2+Îµ)-approximation algorithm for the case where k = 1, which runs in sublinear time, as well as an algorithm tailored for binary matrices, making it more applicable in practical scenarios. However, the approximation ratio is dependent on the value of the optimal solution, performing well only when the optimal solution is on the order of the l_0 norm of the input matrix A. This dependency raises some concerns regarding the result's robustness.
Theoretically, the problem appears natural and well-established, but its practical applications are not adequately motivated. Furthermore, the paper lacks experimental validation and a clear explanation of the problem's practical relevance. While the results are technically sound and follow standard approaches, certain assumptions lack sufficient justification, including:
* The necessity of assuming O(m+n) access time for the sum of rows and columns (lines 138-140), as this information can be computed using the adjacency list and the l_0 norm of A, potentially affecting the running time guarantees of Theorem 13 and 14.
* The conjecture regarding the inapproximability of Boolean l_0 rank-1 matrices seems unsubstantiated.
Minor suggestions for improvement include:
* Correcting notation, such as replacing "rank-k" with "rank-$k$" on line 31.
* Revising the expression "min(mn^2, mn^2)" to "min(mn^2, m^2n)" on line 33 for accuracy.
* Mentioning the incident list access model, a natural choice in sublinear time algorithm design, on lines 131-137.
* Correcting the initialization of S^(0) from "[n]" to "[m]" on line 168.
* Changing "The" to "we" on line 234 for consistency.
In summary, while the paper makes progress on an interesting theoretical problem, its practical applicability and experimental validation require further support to strengthen the results.
