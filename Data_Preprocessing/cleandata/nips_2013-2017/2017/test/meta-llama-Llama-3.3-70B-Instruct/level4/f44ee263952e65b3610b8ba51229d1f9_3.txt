This paper presents an extension of the continuous cache models introduced by Grave et al., proposing an unbounded continuous cache model that can account for events that occurred an indefinitely long time ago. Although the idea is intriguing, the paper lacks robust experimental evidence to support its claims. The main argument is that this model surpasses Grave et al.'s, yet a comparison with their work is not provided. Instead, it appears to compare with outdated cache models from the 1990s, specifically Kuhn et al., but this is only briefly mentioned in line 206, where "the static model interpolated with the unigram probability distribution observed up to time t" seems to refer to Kuhn et al.'s work, which is distinct from Grave et al.'s approach.
The authors emphasize the significance of large vocabularies but fail to specify the vocabulary size used in their experiments. Additionally, it is unclear why all datasets were lowercased, given the focus on large vocabularies. This oversight is unfortunate, as sections 1-3 show promise. To make this paper publishable, the authors should devote more attention to the experiments section.
