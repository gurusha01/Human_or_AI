This manuscript investigates the problem of influence maximization within the framework of the general threshold diffusion model, with a specific focus on scenarios where node threshold functions exhibit near-submodular behavior, characterized as epsilon-submodularity. The primary contributions of this work are twofold: 
1) it establishes the inapproximability of the influence maximization problem under the given model when the network contains a sufficient number of nodes with epsilon-submodular threshold functions; 
2) it proposes an efficient, straightforward, and well-founded approximation algorithm tailored for this problem when the network includes a fixed, albeit unspecified, number of such epsilon-submodular threshold nodes.
The strength of this paper can be attributed to several key factors:
1- It tackles the challenging and understudied problem of influence maximization under the General Threshold model, addressing a significant gap in current research.
2- The assumption of epsilon-submodularity for node threshold functions is well-justified, aligning with empirical observations from real-world diffusion processes.
3- Both the inapproximability result and the proposed approximation algorithms demonstrate intuitive reasoning and non-trivial technical insights.
Aside from minor errors such as typos (detailed below), the paper is exceptionally well-structured and clearly written. Upon examination, the technical proofs appear to be correct. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and persuasive, with outcomes that align with the theoretical predictions provided.
Minor suggestions for correction or improvement by line number:
102: Consider revising the equation on the right-hand side to incorporate 1/(1-\epsilon) instead of (1-\epsilon) for accuracy.
237: Replace "liner" with "linear" for correctness.
241: Adjust "satisfies" to "satisfying" to ensure grammatical accuracy.
262: Correct the spelling of "PageRank" from "PagrRank".
297: Modify "while 2.05" to "compared to 2.05" for clarity.
298: Change "spreads" to "spread" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
299: Rephrase to "The presence of more $\epsilon$-AS nodes in the network yields greater improvement" for enhanced readability.
