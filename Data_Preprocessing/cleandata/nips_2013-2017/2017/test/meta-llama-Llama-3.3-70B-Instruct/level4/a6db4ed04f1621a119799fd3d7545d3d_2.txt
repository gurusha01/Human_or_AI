This paper presents a novel GRU-based architecture for precipitation nowcasting, which can be viewed as a video prediction problem with a fixed camera position. The authors also introduce a new benchmarking package for precipitation nowcasting and evaluate their model on this benchmark, as well as a modified version of moving MNIST.
In terms of technical quality, the paper is a good application-oriented work, with an interesting proposed architecture. However, to provide a more comprehensive comparison, it would be beneficial to include evaluations against LSTM-based networks and fully connected RNNs, although the authors have already considered a range of baselines.
The paper is generally well-structured and coherent, making it easy to follow. The definition of the ConvGRU is clear, but the explanation of the proposed TrajGRU is more challenging to understand. Specifically, the replacement of state-to-state convolutions/multiplications with a transformation similar to the module described by Jaderberg et al. (2015) is not fully elucidated. Additionally, the process by which the structure generating network gamma produces the flow fields U and V is unclear. Providing more explicit details and emphasizing the differences with the transformation module from Jaderberg et al. (2015) would improve clarity.
The novelty of the paper lies in the idea of learning trajectories using spatial transformer-inspired modules, which is an original concept. Although the general architecture is similar to ConvLSTM and the paper is application-oriented, this innovative approach sets it apart.
The significance of the work is notable, particularly with the introduction of a new dataset as a useful benchmark. However, without more knowledge of the state-of-the-art in precipitation nowcasting, it is difficult to fully assess the performance gains. A comparison with an existing precipitation nowcasting benchmark would strengthen the work. The concept of learning sparsely connected temporal trajectories may have broader applications in domains with high-dimensional distributions exhibiting independence properties and redundancy.
The strengths of the paper include its interesting model, thorough baselines, and practical evaluation, as well as its overall clarity. However, the description and motivation of the model could be more detailed and easier to follow, and the novelty is somewhat limited compared to ConvGRU/LSTM.
Following the rebuttal, which addressed some of the initial concerns and included additional experiments, the overall quality of the paper has improved, leading to an increased score.
