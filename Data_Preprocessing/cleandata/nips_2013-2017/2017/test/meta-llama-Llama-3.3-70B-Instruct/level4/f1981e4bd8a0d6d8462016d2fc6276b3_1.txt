This paper presents a novel approach to training a sequence classifier in the absence of labeled data, leveraging sequential output statistics through a language model. The proposed algorithm's formulation poses optimization challenges in its original functional form, prompting the development of a stochastic primal-dual gradient method to efficiently address this issue. Notably, this formulation exhibits a reduced propensity to converge to trivial solutions and obviates the need for a generative model, distinguishing it from preceding works. Empirical evaluations conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method yields a lower error rate in comparison to baseline methods.
Several aspects of the paper warrant further clarification or enhancement:
1. The axes in Figure 2(a), represented by lambdad and lambdap, require explicit definition to facilitate a clearer understanding of the results.
2. While the fundamental concept and the primal-dual stochastic gradient formulation are compelling, the inclusion of additional baseline comparisons, specifically those from references [11] and [30], would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, expanding the analysis to incorporate more datasets would enhance the robustness of the findings.
3. To improve the transparency and reproducibility of the algorithm, it would be beneficial to provide explicit gradient formulas, particularly for step 5 of Algorithm 1, allowing for a more detailed understanding and potential implementation of the method by readers.
