This paper presents innovative contributions in two key areas: the introduction of a new dataset for nowcasting, although it is unclear if this dataset will be made publicly available, and the application of the Spatial Transformer Network concept within a convRNN framework to forecast subsequent frames based on recent history.
The introduction effectively motivates the problem and is well-written. The remainder of the paper is structured clearly, but there are two aspects that require improvement:
1. The utilization of \mathcal{U}t and \mathcal{V}t, along with their corresponding \gamma function, necessitates a more detailed explanation. Given that this appears to be the primary technical distinction from the Spatial Transformer Network, where a 2*3 affine transformation matrix is typically learned, it is unclear why this approach was abandoned in favor of continuous optical flow.
2. While the experiments are somewhat convincing, the reported differences often lack statistical significance, as no confidence intervals are provided. Furthermore, the baseline comparisons, where Conv3Ds consistently underperform Conv2Ds, seem unusual considering the nature of the problem.
To strengthen the paper, the authors should address these concerns and revise the manuscript accordingly. The additional feedback from the authors has helped clarify some of the initial questions, and further revisions based on these comments would be beneficial.
