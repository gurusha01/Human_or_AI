This manuscript presents an accelerated variant of the min-sum algorithm, known as min-sum splitting, and applies it to the distributed consensus problem. The paper is well-structured and effectively situates its contribution within the current state of the art in the field. Based on my understanding, although I am not a specialist in this area, the findings appear to be innovative and represent a significant advancement. Notably, the paper establishes a novel link between min-sum algorithms and lifted Markov chain techniques.
However, one aspect of the presentation requires clarification. On page 4, the authors describe an equivalent objective function minimized by the min-sum algorithm to derive the min-sum splitting scheme, stating that each term $\phi{vw}$ is split into $\Gamma{vw}$ terms, and each term $\phiv$ into $\delta$ terms. This explanation is unclear because $\delta$ and $\Gamma{vw}$ are introduced as real numbers on the preceding page, making their role in this context ambiguous.
