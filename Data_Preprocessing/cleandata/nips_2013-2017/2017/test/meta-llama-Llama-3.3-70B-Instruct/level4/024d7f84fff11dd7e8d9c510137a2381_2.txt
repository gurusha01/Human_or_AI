This paper examines the convergence rate of the min-sum splitting method for the average consensus problem. Overall, the paper is well-written, but the improvement in results appears to be limited. The following detailed comments are provided:
(1) The claim that the convergence rate is optimal for graphs with good expansion properties, such as complete graphs, is misleading. For complete graphs, the convergence time is essentially one step, and these graphs are not representative of general cases. It would be more informative to identify the category of graphs for which the complexity does not depend on the dimension (number of nodes) and to clarify what constitutes "good" expansion properties.
(2) The literature review in the relevant paragraph should include the work "Linear Time Average Consensus on Fixed Graphs and Implications for Decentralized Optimization and Multi-Agent Control" by Olshevsky, which reports a competitive or even better bound than the result presented in this submission. The convergence rate of Olshevsky's work should be properly reported, as it provides a relevant comparison.
(3) At the top of page 2, important references such as "On the Linear Convergence of the ADMM in Decentralized Consensus Optimization" by Shi et al. and "Optimal algorithms for smooth and strongly convex distributed optimization in networks" by Scaman et al. should be cited. The authors should also report the state-of-the-art algorithms for consensus optimization and their corresponding linear convergence rates to provide a comprehensive context.
(4) The discussion of lifted graphs and Markov chains overlooks a relevant paper, "Markov Chain Lifting and Distributed ADMM" by Franca and Bento, which should be acknowledged.
(5) The content of the last paragraph on page 5 is a well-known fact and should be referenced to "Generalized consensus computation in networked systems with erasure links" by Rabbat et al. Furthermore, the connection between these variants and Heavy ball/Nesterov/Polyak methods is established in the field.
(6) Several important references on consensus optimization have been ignored, including "Extra: An exact first-order algorithm for decentralized consensus optimization" by Shi et al. and "Fast distributed gradient methods" by Jakovetic et al. These should be incorporated to strengthen the literature review.
(7) Proposition 3 appears to be trivial and seems to be a supplementary contribution rather than a main result.
(8) The achieved rate of D log(D/eps) does not significantly improve upon the rate of D log(1/eps) reported in "Linear Time Average Consensus on Fixed Graphs and Implications for Decentralized Optimization and Multi-Agent Control". In the worst-case scenario, where D~n, the bound is even less competitive than that achieved in the aforementioned work.
(9) The paper "Linear Time Average Consensus..." improves the bound using Nesterov's acceleration, and it is suspected that the "Auxiliary message-passing scheme" proposed by the authors may essentially be Nesterov's acceleration applied to the min-sum algorithm. While this is a valid approach, the analysis for consensus boils down to a linear system, which is not particularly challenging. As a result, the contribution of the paper becomes less clear.
(10) Any minor improvement may stem from a careful handling of the spectral gap of graphs. However, the worst-case bound remains O(n) because O(n) = O(D) for the set of all graphs with n nodes.
(11) On line 243 of page 6, the graph is described as simple, but directed edges are used, which is confusing and should be clarified.
(12) There is a typo on line 220 of page 6, where "Laplacian" should be replaced with "Lagrangian".
After rebuttal: The reviewer is satisfied with the authors' response, but the evaluation score remains unchanged.
