This manuscript presents a novel tensor-based formulation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, enabling implicit increases in depth and width while maintaining control over computational complexity. The paper is well-organized and clearly expressed, offering an intriguing contribution that is substantiated by persuasive experimental results.
