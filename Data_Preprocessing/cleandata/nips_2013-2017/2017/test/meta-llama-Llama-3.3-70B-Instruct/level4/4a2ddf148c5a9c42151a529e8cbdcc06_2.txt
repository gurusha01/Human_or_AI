This paper presents analytical findings on partial hard thresholding for sparse signal recovery, leveraging the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and alternative conditions, including the Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) and Restricted Strong Smoothness (RSS), with applicability to arbitrary signals.
The exposition of prior results is occasionally perplexing. Firstly, reference [4] offers more comprehensive results than those indicated in the paper, particularly in line 51, where Remark 7 addresses arbitrary signals, whereas Theorems 5 and 6 pertain to sufficiently sparse signals. Secondly, reference [13] provides a guarantee for sparse signal recovery, as stated in Theorem 4, which renders the distinction of "parameter estimation only" on line 59 unclear, as accurate support estimation is implicit in exact recovery. Thirdly, the connection between the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and the condition number in Theorem 2 is not explicitly stated, which is crucial given that RIP can extend beyond specific matrix constructions.
The simulation is limited to s-sparse signals, which raises questions about whether the authors are adequately testing the novel aspects of their results that differentiate them from existing work. Furthermore, it is unclear how the results assess the dependence on the matrix's condition number.
Several minor comments are also noteworthy. The title contains a grammatical error, with "A Towards" being incorrect. On line 128, the names of the properties should be adjusted for grammatical correctness, potentially by adding "property" or using "convexity" and "smoothness." The terminology used in line 136, referring to M/m as "the condition number of the problem," might be confusing due to its overlap with established linear algebra terminology, and clarification on the relationship between these quantities would be beneficial. The algorithm described lacks a termination condition, leaving ambiguity about when the process concludes, such as when the gradient in the first step equals zero or when the support St no longer changes between iterations. On line 185, the comparison between the analysis in [4] and the manuscript's generalization to a family of algorithms is not clearly articulated. Additionally, there are minor typographical errors, such as "degrade" instead of "degradation" on line 301, and "reduces" instead of "reduce" on line 304.
Following the rebuttal, the authors have addressed several of the aforementioned points, particularly those related to the description of prior work. However, the overall impact of the contribution remains borderline for acceptance. Given that the paper's acceptability is contingent upon the implementation of the changes outlined in the rebuttal, the score has been adjusted to "marginally above threshold."
