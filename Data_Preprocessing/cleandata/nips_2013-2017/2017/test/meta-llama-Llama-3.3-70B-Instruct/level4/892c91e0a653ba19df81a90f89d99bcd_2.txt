This study presents a novel approach to accelerate experimental design for uncovering neural coding mechanisms. The proposal to utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for quantifying stimulus similarity is intriguing. However, it also poses a paradox: if a CNN can accurately predict neuronal response statistics, such as those in area V4, it may render the actual experiment unnecessary, as analysis of CNN data could provide all the required insights. Conversely, if the CNN only partially or inaccurately captures the stimulus similarity observed in the recorded brain area, this discrepancy could compromise the experimental outcome. It would be fascinating to see how the authors address this challenge. Nevertheless, this is a commendable effort and is suitable for presentation at NIPS.
