Review Summary:
This manuscript presents a novel architecture for generating images of individuals by combining the appearance of a person from an input image with a specified pose, represented using heat maps.
Strengths:
* The proposed task is innovative and unprecedented
* A unique two-stage coarse-to-fine architecture is introduced
* The paper is well-structured and clearly written
* Although the results exhibit noticeable artifacts, they demonstrate promise
* The evaluation of design decisions is thorough and extensive
Weaknesses:
* The quantitative evaluation is limited, which is somewhat expected due to the lack of established evaluation metrics for this task
Comments:
Considering the iterative refinement process employed in the proposed architecture, it would be beneficial to include recent studies on iterative refinement using cascaded networks in the related work section, such as [a] and [b]:
[a] J. Carreira, P. Agrawal, K. Fragkiadaki, and J. Malik. Human pose estimation with iterative error feedback. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.
[b] A. Newell, K. Yang, and J. Deng. Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.
* On line 110, the statement "we find that using residual blocks as basic components improves the generation performance" requires further clarification. Specifically, what aspects of the performance are enhanced?
 
Although the evaluation is comprehensive, it would be interesting to investigate the performance of the Stage 2 network using the inputs for Stage 1 and trained adversarially. Is the observed blurring with Stage 1 + GAN attributable to the intermediate fully connected layer?
Overall Rating:
Based on the novelty of the problem and approach, I strongly recommend accepting this paper.
Rebuttal:
While I appreciate the authors' attempt to conduct a user study, I find it preliminary and unconvincing. Therefore, I am discounting it in my review rating. The authors are encouraged to include a more substantive human evaluation in their revised manuscript. Nonetheless, my overall positive assessment of the work remains unchanged.
