The authors investigate a clustering framework wherein the learner can pose queries to an oracle to identify the target clustering, with the queries potentially being same-cluster queries or a fixed binary-valued function of the input instances' labels. The focus of this study is on determining the query complexity of such frameworks.
This query-based clustering approach represents a motivated and relatively new area of research, applicable to domains such as record deduplication and crowdsourcing. The authors adopt an information-theoretic perspective, deriving upper and lower bounds on the query requirements for perfect or approximate recovery of the target clustering, including scenarios with noisy oracles. The information-theoretic methodologies employed are novel and noteworthy within the machine learning community.
However, the analysis is constrained by the absence of structural assumptions regarding the problem, such as a predefined hypothesis class. Consequently, the bounds are primarily influenced by the marginal distribution of the labels, alongside the noise level. This setting diverges from conventional learning theory frameworks, which often incorporate more structured assumptions. Nonetheless, this initial exploration contributes to the understanding of query-based clustering's information-theoretic aspects, particularly in establishing related lower bounds, and serves as a foundational step in this research direction.
