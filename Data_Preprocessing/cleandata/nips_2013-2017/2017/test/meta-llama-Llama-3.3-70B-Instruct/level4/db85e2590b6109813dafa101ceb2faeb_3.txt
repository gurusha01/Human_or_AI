This paper presents an intriguing approach, wherein the authors suggest training neural networks using a cost function that prioritizes networks amenable to compression via truncated SVD. To achieve this, they introduce a regularization term based on the nuclear norm of the weight matrices, implemented through the soft thresholding of singular values as a proximal operator following each epoch. The concept is compelling, and the experimental section provides a clear analysis of the method's performance and behavior. However, the review would have benefited from additional comparative analyses, such as benchmarking the proposed network against other compression techniques with equivalent parameter counts on the datasets. Overall, the paper is well-written, with an interesting concept and satisfactory execution, although the experimental component falls short in terms of comprehensive comparison.
