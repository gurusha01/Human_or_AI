This manuscript presents a modified feed-forward neural network optimization problem utilizing the ReLU activation function. 
My primary concern lies in the convergence proof of the block coordinate descent algorithm, specifically with Theorem 1, which is flawed for the following reasons:
A. The theorem assumes the sequence generated by the algorithm converges to a limit point, but this assumption is not necessarily valid since the set U is not compact (it is closed but unbounded), meaning the sequence may not converge to a finite point.
B. The theorem also claims the sequence has a unique limit point (as stated on line 263), which may not hold true even if the algorithm has limit points, as they may not be unique; for instance, the sequence x_i = (-1)^n - 1/n has two limit points, +1 and -1.
Regarding the rest of the paper:
1. The new formulation appears interesting and can be discussed independently of the block coordinate descent aspect. The major novelty seems to lie in the new formulation rather than the algorithm. However, a significant concern with the new formulation is that it introduces many more variables, potentially leading to spatial infeasibility with a large number of data instances, which limits its applicability to large-scale problems.
2. The problem stated on line 149 does not appear to be convex with respect to W, requiring further clarification.
3. The introduction discusses the issue of saddle points, but this manuscript does not adequately address this problem. It is suggested that the authors remove the related discussion to improve the manuscript's focus.
4. The referencing format for papers and equations is non-standard; typically, [1] is used for paper references and (1) for equation references.
5. Comparing the time performance with Caffe solvers is misleading due to differences in implementation platforms. The statement about MATLAB running significantly faster than expected is also confusing, especially considering that MATLAB is generally expected to outperform Python.
6. The comparison of objective values in figure 3(a) is not meaningful as it compares different problems.
After considering the feedback:
I noted that the authors mentioned U, V, W as compact sets on line 100, but U is defined as the nonnegative half-space on line 124, which is clearly unbounded and thus non-compact. 
If U were indeed compact, the convergence analysis might hold, as there would be at least one limit point. However, for problems (4) or (5), this does not apply.
I disagree with the concept of a single limit point as t approaches infinity. By definition, all limit points are associated with t = infinity but in different ways, and there can be multiple limit points.
The authors' rebuttal suggests that because their algorithm converges, a limit point exists, but this uses the result to prove the assumption, which is not a valid proof method.
In an extreme case where U, V, W each consist of a single point (u, v, w) and the gradient at (u, v, w) is non-zero, there is exactly one limit point, (u, v, w), but it is not a stationary point due to the non-zero gradient.
Therefore, my evaluation remains unchanged.
