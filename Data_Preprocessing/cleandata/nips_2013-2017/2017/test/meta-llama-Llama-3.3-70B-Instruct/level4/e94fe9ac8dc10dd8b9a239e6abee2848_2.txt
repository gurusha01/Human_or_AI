This paper presents novel algorithms for determining a rank-k ell_0-minimizing approximation of a given matrix A, covering both real-case scenarios for p=1 and p > 1, as well as the boolean case. The authors develop approximation algorithms, including some with sublinear performance, and bi-criteria approximations for these cases.
The primary strengths of the paper include:
- The development of intriguing algorithms that utilize innovative proof techniques, incorporating unexpected approaches.
- The overall quality of the writing, which effectively communicates the research.
However, several weaknesses are notable:
- The absence of experimental evaluations limits the ability to assess the practical applicability of these algorithms.
- A more balanced approach could be achieved by condensing the comprehensive literature review and allocating space to include experimental evaluations, which would enhance the paper's overall impact.
