The authors propose a novel algorithm, Adept, designed to optimize stimulus selection in closed-loop experiments by maximizing variance in neural firing across a population of neurons. This contribution is significant, as existing approaches have primarily focused on characterizing the response properties of individual neurons. The algorithm leverages pre-computed stimulus features, derived from a neural network, to predict firing rates in response to novel stimuli. The methodology is well-presented, and the stimulus selection process is sufficiently efficient to be applicable in real-world experimental settings.
However, there are several limitations associated with the Adept method that could be addressed in future research. A key constraint is the algorithm's reliance on a robust set of features to describe the stimulus space, which may not be readily available beyond specific domains such as V4. It would be beneficial to investigate the algorithm's performance when the chosen features are inadequate for predicting spike rates, potentially leading to suboptimal learning outcomes for a subset of the neural population. Furthermore, the algorithm is restricted to a discrete set of stimuli, and its robustness to various types of noise, including correlated noise across cells or time, remains unclear, warranting further exploration of how such noise may impact stimulus selection.
