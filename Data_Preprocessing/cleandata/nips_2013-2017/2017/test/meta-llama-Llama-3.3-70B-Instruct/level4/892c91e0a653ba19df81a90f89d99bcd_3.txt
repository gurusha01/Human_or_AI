This manuscript presents a straightforward and effective approach to active learning, termed the Adept algorithm, which selects visual stimuli to optimize a population cost function. The methodology is both refined and easy to understand. The authors primarily illustrate the importance of choosing appropriate experimental conditions, particularly in experiments where the experimenter must decide which stimuli to present based on a specific neural recording area, highlighting Adept's ability to adaptively determine the next images to display. By leveraging pretrained convolutional neural networks and kernel methods, specifically Nadaraya-Watson regression, the technique estimates the response of unknown stimuli using a set of underlying features. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method through two experiments: the first utilizing synthetic data from a separate CNN, and the second, a more compelling example, involving a feedback experiment with macaques where neural activity was recorded in V4, resulting in a notable 20% increase in mean neuronal response to chosen stimuli.
However, a key limitation of the approach is its failure to account for response variability, suggesting that a comparison of its performance under various noise models would provide valuable insights.
