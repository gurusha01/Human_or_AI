This paper presents approximation algorithms for the `0-low rank approximation problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing data positions with a low rank matrix. The authors provide several algorithms with provable guarantees, including a (2+)-approximation in sublinear time for the case when k = 1, and a bicriteria algorithm that runs in poly(mn) time with an exponent independent of k.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem, the algorithms, and the analysis. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work and clearly explain how their results improve upon existing algorithms. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of correctness and running time bounds.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and the algorithms, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, and the authors provide a clear analysis of the algorithms.
However, the paper has some limitations. The algorithms presented are complex and may be difficult to implement in practice. Additionally, the paper assumes that the input matrix A has a specific structure, which may not always be the case in practice. Furthermore, the paper does not provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in practice.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents several new algorithms with provable guarantees, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of correctness and running time bounds. However, the paper builds on existing work in the field, and the authors acknowledge the influence of previous research on their results.
In terms of significance, the paper presents algorithms with provable guarantees for a natural variant of low rank approximation, which is an important problem in machine learning and data analysis.
