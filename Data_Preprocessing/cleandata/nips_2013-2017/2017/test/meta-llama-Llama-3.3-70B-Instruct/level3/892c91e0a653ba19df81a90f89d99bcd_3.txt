This paper presents a comprehensive study on the `0-low rank approximation problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing data positions with a low rank matrix. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on the problem, including its motivations, related work, and a clear statement of the contributions. The technical sections are detailed and well-structured, with each section building on the previous one to provide a cohesive narrative.
The authors' results are impressive, providing the first approximation algorithms for the `0-low rank approximation problem with provable guarantees for k > 1. The algorithms are efficient, running in poly(mn) time, and achieve a good trade-off between the rank of the output matrix and the approximation factor.
The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the limitations of the approach, including the lack of accounting for variability in the response and the comparison of performance under different noise models. The authors discuss potential future directions, including the development of more efficient algorithms and the application of the `0-low rank approximation problem to real-world problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including its motivations and related work.

Confidence: 0.8
The paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of low rank approximation. However, it has some limitations, including the assumption of a low-rank input matrix and the lack of experimental results. Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, but could benefit from some revisions to address these limitations.
