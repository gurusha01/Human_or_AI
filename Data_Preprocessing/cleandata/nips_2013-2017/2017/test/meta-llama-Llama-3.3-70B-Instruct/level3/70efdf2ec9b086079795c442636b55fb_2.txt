This paper introduces a novel architecture called the Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM), which allows for increasing the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks by widening and deepening them while controlling computational runtime. The key idea is to represent hidden states as tensors and update them via a cross-layer convolution, enabling efficient parameter sharing and reducing the number of parameters required.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed architecture, its components, and the experimental results. The introduction provides a good background on the limitations of traditional LSTMs and the need for more efficient and scalable architectures. The method section provides a detailed description of the tLSTM architecture, including the tensorization of hidden states, the cross-layer convolution, and the memory cell convolution.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM architecture on several challenging sequence learning tasks, including language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and image classification. The results show that the tLSTM outperforms traditional LSTMs and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and runtime efficiency.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and efficient architecture for sequence learning tasks
* A clear and concise explanation of the proposed architecture and its components
* Strong experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the tLSTM architecture
* A thorough analysis of the results and the internal working mechanism of the tLSTM
