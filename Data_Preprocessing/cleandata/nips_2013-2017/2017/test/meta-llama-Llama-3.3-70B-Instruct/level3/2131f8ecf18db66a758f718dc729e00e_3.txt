This paper proposes a screening rule for `1-regularized Ising model estimation, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exact blockwise structure recovery. The screening rule is simple and closed-form, making it easily checkable and applicable to large-scale problems. The authors demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the screening rule through empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical results, making it accessible to a general machine learning audience. The connection to information theory is also well-established. The experimental study is thorough, and the results show significant speedups when using the screening rule with various optimization algorithms.
One potential concern is the idea of AND queries conflicting with the original motivation for crowdsourcing, which may make similarity queries unnecessary. However, this concern is not fully explored in the paper. Additionally, the expressions for the bounds in Theorems 1-4 could be simplified while maintaining their essence.
The paper's main contribution is theoretical, with empirical simulations providing supporting evidence. The screening rule is especially valuable for large-scale exploratory data analysis, where the number of variables can be thousands, and we are only interested in the relationship among a handful of variables within moderate-size clusters for interpretability.
The paper's strengths include:
* A simple and closed-form screening rule for exact blockwise structure recovery
* Empirical results demonstrating significant speedups when using the screening rule with various optimization algorithms
* A thorough experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets
The paper's weaknesses include:
* The potential concern about AND queries conflicting with the original motivation for crowdsourcing
* The complexity of the expressions for the bounds in Theorems 1-4
* The limited exploration of the screening rule's applicability to other inexact optimization algorithms
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed screening rule has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of `1-regularized Ising model estimation. With some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, the paper could be even stronger.
