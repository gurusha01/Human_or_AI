This paper presents a novel method for solving the consensus problem in distributed optimization using the Min-Sum message-passing protocol with a splitting technique. The authors show that the introduction of splitting parameters is not only fundamental to guarantee the convergence of the Min-Sum scheme but also yields accelerated convergence rates. The paper is technically sound and well-written, providing a clear explanation of the methodology and its connection to lifted Markov chains techniques and multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it establishes a new connection between Min-Sum schemes and accelerated methods, and its significance, as it provides a new tool for solving the consensus problem with improved convergence rates. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the convergence behavior of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, including a proof of its accelerated convergence rates.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes a quadratic objective function, which might not be the case in all applications. Additionally, the choice of splitting parameters that yields subdiffusive rates depends on global properties of the graph, which might be difficult to obtain in practice. The authors also mention that the construction of the auxiliary process used to track the evolution of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm is specific to the consensus problem and might not be applicable to other problems.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more discussion on the applicability of their method to non-quadratic objective functions and explore ways to adapt the splitting parameters to local properties of the graph. They could also investigate the connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other distributed optimization methods, such as ADMM, and provide more numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
