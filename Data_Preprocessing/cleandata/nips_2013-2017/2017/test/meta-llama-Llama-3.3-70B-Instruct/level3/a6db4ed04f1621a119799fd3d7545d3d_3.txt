This paper proposes a novel approach to increasing the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, called the Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM). The tLSTM represents hidden states as higher-dimensional tensors, allowing for more flexible parameter sharing and efficient widening of the network without additional parameters. The model also merges deep computations into temporal computations, enabling the network to be deepened with little additional runtime.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the tLSTM, including its advantages over existing methods, such as Convolutional LSTMs (cLSTMs) and Deep LSTMs (dLSTMs).
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tLSTM on a variety of tasks, including Wikipedia language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and MNIST image classification. The results show that the tLSTM outperforms existing methods, such as sLSTM and cLSTM, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks.
The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the internal working mechanism of the tLSTM, including visualization of the memory cell and channel mean. The results show that the tLSTM is able to capture long-range dependencies and perform deep computations efficiently.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling. The proposed tLSTM method has the potential to improve the performance of LSTMs on a wide range of tasks, and the paper provides a thorough and well-written explanation of the method and its advantages.
