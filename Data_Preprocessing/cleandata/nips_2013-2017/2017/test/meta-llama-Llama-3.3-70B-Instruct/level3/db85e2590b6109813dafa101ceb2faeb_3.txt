This paper proposes a novel approach to the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, which is a variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of non-zero entries in the difference between the original matrix and its low rank approximation. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on the problem and its motivations, and the related work section is comprehensive and well-referenced.
The technical contributions of the paper are substantial, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of their algorithms. The results are impressive, with the authors achieving a (2+)-approximation in sublinear time for the case when k=1, and a poly(k log(n/k))-approximation in polynomial time for the case when k>1.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and readability. The authors take the time to explain the intuition behind their algorithms and provide detailed proofs of their results. The paper also includes a number of useful lemmas and theorems that can be used to analyze the performance of the algorithms.
However, the experimental section is somewhat lacking, as it does not provide comparative results with other compression techniques. This makes it difficult to assess the method's performance in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications of the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem and the implications of the authors' results.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes significant technical contributions to the field. The results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of their algorithms. With some additional experimental results and discussion on the applications of the problem, the paper would be even stronger.
