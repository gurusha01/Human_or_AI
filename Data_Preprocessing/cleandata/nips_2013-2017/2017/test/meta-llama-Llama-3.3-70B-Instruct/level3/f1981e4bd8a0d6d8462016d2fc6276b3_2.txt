This paper proposes a novel approach to solving the consensus problem in distributed optimization using the Min-Sum message-passing protocol with splitting. The authors demonstrate that by introducing splitting parameters, the Min-Sum algorithm can achieve accelerated convergence rates, outperforming traditional diffusive methods. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation, with detailed comparisons to related works and strong experimental support for the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The key strengths of this paper are:
1. Originality: The paper introduces a new connection between Min-Sum schemes and lifted Markov chains techniques, as well as multi-step methods in convex optimization.
2. Technical soundness: The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, including a proof of the asymptotic rate of convergence.
3. Significance: The paper addresses a difficult problem in distributed optimization and provides a novel solution that advances the state of the art.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
1. Limited scope: The paper focuses on the consensus problem, and it is unclear how the proposed method can be generalized to other problem instances.
2. Complexity: The analysis of the convergence rates is technically involved and may be challenging for some readers to follow.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. The paper proposes a novel and original approach to solving the consensus problem.
2. The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence rates, including a proof of the asymptotic rate of convergence.
3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments and comparisons to related works.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. The paper has a limited scope, focusing only on the consensus problem.
2. The analysis of the convergence rates is technically involved and may be challenging for some readers to follow.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper due to its originality, technical soundness, and significance. However, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the limited scope and complexity of the paper in future work.
