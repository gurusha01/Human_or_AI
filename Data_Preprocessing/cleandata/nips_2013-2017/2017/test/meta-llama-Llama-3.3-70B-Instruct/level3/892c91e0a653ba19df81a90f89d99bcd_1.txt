This paper presents a comprehensive study of the `0-low rank approximation problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of non-zero entries in the difference between the original matrix and its low-rank approximation. The authors provide approximation algorithms for this problem, which significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical contributions. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the problem and explains its relevance to various applications, such as association rule mining, biclustering structure identification, and robust PCA.
The authors present several algorithms for the `0-low rank approximation problem, including a (2+)-approximation algorithm for the case when k=1, which runs in sublinear time. They also provide a bicriteria algorithm for the case when k>1, which outputs a matrix of rank O(k log(n/k)) and achieves an approximation factor of O(k^2 log(n/k)).
The paper also includes a section on algorithms for the Boolean `0-rank-1 problem, which is a special case of the `0-low rank approximation problem where the matrix is binary. The authors provide a (1+O(φ))-approximation algorithm for this problem, which runs in time O(min{‖A‖0 + m + n, φ^(-1) (m + n) log(mn)}), where φ is a parameter that controls the quality of the approximation.
The paper concludes with a section on lower bounds for the Boolean `0-rank-1 problem, which shows that any (1+O(φ))-approximation algorithm must read at least Ω(n/φ) entries of the matrix.
Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the study of the `0-low rank approximation problem and its variants. The authors provide efficient algorithms for these problems, which can be used in a variety of applications. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
