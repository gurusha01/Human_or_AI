This paper proposes a novel architecture for generating images of a person with a specified pose, combining the appearance of a person in an input image and a heat map. The proposed task is novel and the two-stage coarse-to-fine architecture is a unique approach to solving the problem. The paper is well-written and the results, although containing artifacts, are promising and show potential.
The quantitative evaluation of the paper is weak due to the lack of suitable evaluation metrics, but this is not considered a major weakness. The reviewer suggests including recent work on iterative refinement using cascaded networks in the related work section to improve the paper. The evaluation of the paper is extensive, but the reviewer is curious about the performance of the Stage 2 network with Stage 1 inputs and trained adversarially.
The reviewer recommends accepting the paper due to its novelty and approach, but suggests including a substantive human evaluation in the revision. The paper's strengths include its unique approach, well-written text, and promising results. The weaknesses include the lack of suitable evaluation metrics and the presence of artifacts in the results.
Arguments for acceptance:
* Novelty of the proposed task and approach
* Unique two-stage coarse-to-fine architecture
* Promising results with potential for improvement
* Well-written paper with clear explanations
Arguments against acceptance:
* Weak quantitative evaluation due to lack of suitable metrics
* Presence of artifacts in the results
* Limited human evaluation
Overall, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses, it can be a strong addition to the conference program.
