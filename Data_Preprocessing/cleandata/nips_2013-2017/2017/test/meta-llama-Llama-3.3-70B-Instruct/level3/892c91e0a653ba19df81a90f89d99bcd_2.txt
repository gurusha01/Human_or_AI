This paper presents a comprehensive study on the `0-low rank approximation problem, a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing data positions with a low rank matrix. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work, including a (2+)-approximation in sublinear time for the case when k = 1, and a bicriteria algorithm that runs in poly(mn) time with an exponent independent of k.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its connections to other areas of research. The technical contributions are substantial, and the results have important implications for applications such as robust PCA, association rule mining, and document clustering.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem, including its motivation and connections to other areas of research. The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs and explanations of their results.
The paper also demonstrates a high level of technical sophistication, with the authors using a range of advanced techniques from approximation algorithms, linear algebra, and probability theory. The results are also supported by a range of experiments and simulations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
