This paper proposes a screening rule for `1-regularized Ising model estimation, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exact blockwise structural identification. The screening rule is a simple closed-form formula that can be used to identify the blockwise structure of the solution with a given regularization parameter. The authors demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the screening rule through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution. The technical results are well-presented, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed screening rule.
However, I have some concerns regarding the uniqueness of the proposed screening rule. The reviewer questions whether spectral clustering or regularized spectral clustering could also be used to find block structure in Ising models. The authors should provide more discussion on the differences and similarities between their proposed screening rule and existing methods.
Additionally, the paper compares the proposed second moment screening rule procedure to existing screening rules in literature, such as those proposed by Witten et al. and Mazumder & Hastie. The authors should provide more clarification on the differences and similarities between these methods and their proposed screening rule.
The reviewer also expresses concern about the robustness of the block-wise parametrization of θ, wondering if the screening rule could lead to inaccurate parameter estimation if the true θ does not have a block structure. The authors should provide more discussion on the potential limitations of their proposed screening rule and how it can be improved.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed screening rule is a significant contribution to the field. However, the authors should address the concerns mentioned above to improve the paper.
