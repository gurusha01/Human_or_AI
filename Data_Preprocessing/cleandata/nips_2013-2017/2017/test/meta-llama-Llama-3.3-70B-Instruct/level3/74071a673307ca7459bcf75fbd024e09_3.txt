This paper presents a novel approach to training deep neural networks (DNNs) using a Tikhonov regularization technique. The authors propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that can guarantee global convergence to stationary points with R-linear convergence rate of order one. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the theoretical guarantees provided, and the empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, which helps to contextualize their contribution.
One potential weakness of the paper is the computational complexity of the algorithm, which may be a limitation in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future work could focus on developing faster implementations.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
