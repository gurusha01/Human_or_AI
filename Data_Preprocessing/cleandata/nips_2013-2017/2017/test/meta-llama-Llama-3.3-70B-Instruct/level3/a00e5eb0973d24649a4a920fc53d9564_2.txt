This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization, specifically in the context of the consensus problem. The authors introduce a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to achieve accelerated convergence rates compared to traditional diffusive methods. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior, including a proof of convergence and a characterization of the convergence rate.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new algorithm, Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods for consensus.
* A thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior, including a proof of convergence and a characterization of the convergence rate.
* The connection established between Min-Sum Splitting and other accelerated methods, such as lifted Markov chains and multi-step gradient methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the intuition behind the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its connection to other accelerated methods.
* Some of the notation and equations could be clarified or simplified to improve readability.
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in distributed optimization and consensus, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
