This paper presents a novel application of the Min-Sum message-passing protocol to solve the distributed consensus problem. The authors introduce a modified version of the Min-Sum algorithm, called Min-Sum Splitting, which is shown to converge to the problem solution with accelerated rates. The paper establishes a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and lifted Markov chain techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization.
The paper is well-written and clearly places its contribution in the context of the state of the art. The results appear to be novel and constitute a qualitative advance in the field. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and show that it achieves a square-root improvement over diffusive methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to relate the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm to other existing methods, such as lifted Markov chains and multi-step gradient methods. This connection provides valuable insights into the acceleration mechanism exploited by Min-Sum Splitting and highlights its potential for application to other problem instances.
However, there is a detail in the presentation that is unclear, specifically the explanation of splitting terms in the equivalent objective function minimized by the Min-Sum algorithm on page 4. The meaning of splitting terms into $\Gamma_{vw}$ and $\delta$ terms is not clearly explained, which may cause confusion for readers who are not familiar with the Min-Sum algorithm.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The introduction provides a clear overview of the consensus problem and the Min-Sum algorithm, and the subsequent sections provide a detailed analysis of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and its connection to other methods.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel application of the Min-Sum algorithm to the consensus problem and its establishment of a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other existing methods. The paper provides a unique perspective on the acceleration mechanism exploited by Min-Sum Splitting and highlights its potential for application to other problem instances.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of distributed optimization and consensus. The Min-Sum Splitting algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, and its connection to other existing methods provides valuable insights into its acceleration mechanism.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a novel contribution to the field. The connection between Min-Sum Splitting and other existing methods is a significant contribution, and the paper has the potential to impact the field of distributed optimization and consensus.
