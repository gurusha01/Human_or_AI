This paper proposes a screening rule for `1-regularized Ising model estimation, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exact blockwise structural identification. The screening rule is simple and closed-form, making it easily checkable and applicable to large-scale problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening rule through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, showing that it can provide drastic speedups for learning when combined with various optimization algorithms.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed screening rule is novel and addresses a significant gap in the literature, as screening rules for generative models with discrete variables are notably absent. Secondly, the authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the screening rule, including its connection to inexact optimization algorithms. Thirdly, the experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening rule in various settings.
However, the paper also has some limitations. Firstly, the presentation could be improved, as some sections are dense and difficult to follow. Secondly, the comparison to related works is not comprehensive, and the authors could benefit from discussing their work in the context of existing literature on screening rules and Ising model estimation. Thirdly, some of the theoretical results, such as Theorem 1 and Theorem 3, are not easy to interpret, and the authors could provide more intuition and explanation.
In terms of the criteria for evaluation, the paper scores well on originality, as the proposed screening rule is novel and addresses a significant gap in the literature. The paper also scores well on significance, as the results have the potential to impact the field of statistical learning and graphical models. However, the paper could improve on clarity and presentation, as well as providing more comprehensive comparisons to related works.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the limitations mentioned above. The authors should work on improving the presentation, providing more intuition and explanation for the theoretical results, and discussing their work in the context of existing literature. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of statistical learning and graphical models.
