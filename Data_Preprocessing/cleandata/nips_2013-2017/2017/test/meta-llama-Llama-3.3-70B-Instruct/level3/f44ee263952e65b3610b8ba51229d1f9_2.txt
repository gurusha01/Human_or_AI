This paper proposes a novel approach to the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data analysis. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work. The paper is well-written, and the authors have added substantial empirical validation, improving upon the state of the art.
The main strengths of the paper are:
1. Theoretical contributions: The authors provide new structural results and approximation algorithms for the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Improved running time: The authors' algorithms have a significantly improved running time compared to previous work, making them more practical for large-scale applications.
