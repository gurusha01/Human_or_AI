This paper proposes a novel method of sharing parameters in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using convolution inside an LSTM cell and tensors as convolution kernels and feature maps. The approach, called Tensorized LSTM (tLSTM), adds depth to the model by delaying output targets, allowing the network to be widened efficiently without additional parameters and deepened with little additional runtime.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and methodology behind the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of their method, including its ability to capture long-range dependencies and its potential applications in various sequence learning tasks.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tLSTM in achieving state-of-the-art performance on several challenging tasks, including language modeling, algorithmic tasks, and image classification. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other popular methods, such as Stacked LSTMs and Convolutional LSTMs, highlighting the advantages of their approach.
One of the major strengths of this paper is its ability to balance the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency. The authors show that tLSTM can be widened and deepened without significantly increasing the number of parameters or runtime, making it a promising approach for large-scale sequence learning tasks.
However, there are some concerns regarding the scalability of this approach to high-dimensional tensors, as creating meaningful high-dimensional feature maps may be challenging. Additionally, the introduction of "depth in time" through delayed output targets may not be suitable for streaming applications, such as speech processing, due to the resulting delay.
The use of high-dimensional tensors can also lead to a large number of hyperparameters, potentially making the model more difficult to train and optimize. Nevertheless, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the hyperparameter settings and their impact on the model's performance, which is helpful for practitioners.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of techniques, including tensorization, convolution, and delayed output targets, which sets it apart from previous work in the field. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the related work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of their approach compared to other methods.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence learning and provides a promising approach for improving the performance of RNNs on large-scale tasks. The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, thorough analysis of the methodology and experimental results, and detailed comparison with other popular methods.
