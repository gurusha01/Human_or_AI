This paper proposes a novel approach to the `0-low rank approximation problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing data positions with a low rank matrix. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and its relevance to various applications.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the `0-low rank approximation problem and its significance in various fields.
* The paper presents several new results on the `0-rank-k problem, including a structural lemma that shows the existence of k columns which provide a (k + 1)-approximation to the optimal solution.
* The authors propose an impractical algorithm that runs in poly(nk,m) time and achieves an O(k2)-approximation, which is the first algorithm with provable non-trivial approximation guarantees for the `0-rank-k problem.
* The paper also presents a practical algorithm that runs in poly(n,m) time with an exponent independent of k, if we allow for a bicriteria solution.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper lacks a clear comparison with other related work, such as variational inference, which also compresses networks by reducing description length and pruning weights.
* The experimental section is limited, and more baseline results are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer in achieving a better accuracy-compression tradeoff.
* The results are hard to interpret, and a graph showing accuracy vs compression ratio would be more informative for comparing the approach to previous regularizers and compressors.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time complexity of the algorithms and a discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
