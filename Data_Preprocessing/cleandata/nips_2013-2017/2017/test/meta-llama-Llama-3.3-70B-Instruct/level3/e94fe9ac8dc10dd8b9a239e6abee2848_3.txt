This paper proposes a novel approach to solving the consensus problem in distributed optimization using the Min-Sum message-passing protocol with a splitting technique. The authors establish a connection between Min-Sum Splitting and lifted Markov chains techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm and shows that it can achieve subdiffusive rates, outperforming classical diffusive methods.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the connections between Min-Sum Splitting and other accelerated methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for understanding the acceleration mechanisms of different methods. The authors show that the introduction of splitting parameters in Min-Sum Splitting can be seen as a way to induce directionality in the message exchange, similar to lifted Markov chains techniques. This connection provides new insights into the acceleration mechanisms of these methods and opens up possibilities for further research.
The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of Min-Sum Splitting, including a proof of the asymptotic rate of convergence and an analysis of the dependence of the convergence rate on the spectral gap of the matrix associated with the graph. The authors show that the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm can achieve a square-root improvement over the convergence time of diffusive methods, making it a competitive approach for solving consensus problems.
However, there are some potential weaknesses in the paper. One of the limitations of the approach is that it requires a proper choice of the splitting parameters, which can depend on global properties of the graph. The authors provide some guidance on how to choose these parameters, but it is not clear how robust the approach is to different choices of parameters. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the consensus problem, and it is not clear how the approach can be generalized to other problem instances.
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and consensus problems. The authors' approach is novel and well-motivated, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rates and acceleration mechanisms of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
