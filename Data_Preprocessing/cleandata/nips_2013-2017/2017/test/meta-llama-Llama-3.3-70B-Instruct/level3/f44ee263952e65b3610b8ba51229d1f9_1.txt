This paper proposes a novel approach to the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, which is a natural variant of low rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing data positions with a low rank matrix. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its significance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the problem, including its motivation, related work, and a clear definition of the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem.
* The paper presents several algorithms for solving the problem, including a (2+)-approximation algorithm for the case when k=1, and a bicriteria algorithm for the case when k>1.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including their running time, approximation factor, and optimality.
* The paper includes a discussion of the implications of the results, including their potential applications and the significance of the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a high level of mathematical sophistication, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the proofs and analyses are quite technical and may require careful reading to understand.
* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in practice.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents significant contributions to the field of low rank approximation. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its significance, and provide a comprehensive analysis of the algorithms and their implications.
