This paper proposes a novel approach to precipitation nowcasting, a crucial task for predicting short-term rainfall intensity in local regions. The authors introduce the Trajectory Gated Recurrent Unit (TrajGRU) model, which learns the location-variant structure for recurrent connections, outperforming existing Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models. Additionally, they provide a comprehensive benchmark for precipitation nowcasting, including a large-scale dataset (HKO-7) and evaluation protocols.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the background, related work, and their proposed approach. The TrajGRU model is thoroughly explained, and its advantages over existing models are demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The benchmarking effort is also commendable, as it provides a standardized framework for evaluating precipitation nowcasting models.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novelty: The TrajGRU model is a new and innovative approach to precipitation nowcasting, addressing the limitations of existing ConvLSTM models.
2. Comprehensive benchmarking: The authors provide a thorough evaluation protocol, including a large-scale dataset and multiple evaluation metrics, which will facilitate future research in this area.
3. Experimental validation: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Computational complexity: The TrajGRU model may be computationally more expensive than existing models, which could be a concern for real-time applications.
2. Hyperparameter tuning: The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of hyperparameter tuning for the TrajGRU model, which could be important for optimizing its performance.
3. Comparison to other models: While the authors compare their approach to ConvLSTM and other deep learning models, a more comprehensive comparison to traditional optical flow-based methods and other state-of-the-art approaches would be beneficial.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. Significance: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical task with significant real-world implications, and this paper provides a novel and effective approach to addressing this challenge.
2. Originality: The TrajGRU model is a new and innovative contribution to the field, and the benchmarking effort will facilitate future research in precipitation nowcasting.
3. Thorough evaluation: The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their approach, including experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. Computational complexity: The TrajGRU model may be computationally expensive, which could limit its applicability in real-time applications.
2. Limited comparison: The authors could provide a more comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches, including traditional optical flow-based methods.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: A more detailed analysis of hyperparameter tuning for the TrajGRU model would be beneficial for optimizing its performance.
Overall, this paper provides a significant contribution to the field of precipitation nowcasting, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the areas for improvement, this paper has the potential to be a high-quality contribution to the conference.
