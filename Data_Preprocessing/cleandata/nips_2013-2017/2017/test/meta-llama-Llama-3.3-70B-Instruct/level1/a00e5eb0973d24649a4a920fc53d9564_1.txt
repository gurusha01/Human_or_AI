This paper presents a comprehensive study on the conditions under which variance reduction and acceleration schemes can be efficiently applied to finite sum optimization problems. The authors show that knowing the identity of the individual function being referred to by the oracle at each iteration is crucial for obtaining linear convergence rates with a linear dependence on the number of functions, n. They also demonstrate that without an explicit knowledge of the strong convexity parameter, acceleration is not possible for a broad class of first-order and coordinate-descent finite sum algorithms.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and a thorough literature review. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the importance of individual identity in finite sum problems and show that variance-reduction mechanisms cannot be applied without explicitly knowing the identity of the individual functions.
The paper's main contributions are:
1. Showing that knowing the identity of the individual function is necessary for obtaining linear convergence rates with a linear dependence on n.
2. Demonstrating that without an explicit knowledge of the strong convexity parameter, acceleration is not possible for a broad class of first-order and coordinate-descent finite sum algorithms.
3. Establishing a tight lower bound for the iteration complexity of oblivious algorithms for smooth and convex finite sum problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise writing style
* A thorough analysis of the problem and its implications
