This paper proposes Adept, an adaptive stimulus selection method that optimizes population objective functions to efficiently find stimuli that drive a population of neurons. The authors relate their work to previous studies on adaptive stimulus selection, which have primarily focused on maximizing the firing rate of a single recorded neuron. In contrast, Adept considers the responses of all recorded neurons together, making it a novel contribution to the field.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology, including the use of feature embeddings from a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict neural responses. The results of the simulations and the closed-loop electrophysiological experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of Adept in eliciting larger mean responses and a larger diversity of responses compared to randomly-chosen images.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and thoroughness. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their methodology and results, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of CNNs to predict neural responses is a significant contribution, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in their experiments.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential concern is the reliance on a pre-existing pool of candidate images, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of Adept, as well as its potential to be used in conjunction with other methods.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel adaptive stimulus selection method that optimizes population objective functions.
* The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their methodology and results.
* The use of CNNs to predict neural responses is a significant contribution to the field.
* The results of the simulations and the closed-loop electrophysiological experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of Adept.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The reliance on a pre-existing pool of candidate images may limit the generalizability of the results.
* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of Adept.
* The paper could benefit from more analysis on the potential benefits and drawbacks of using Adept in conjunction with other methods.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field. With some revisions to address the potential weaknesses, I would recommend accepting the paper for publication.
