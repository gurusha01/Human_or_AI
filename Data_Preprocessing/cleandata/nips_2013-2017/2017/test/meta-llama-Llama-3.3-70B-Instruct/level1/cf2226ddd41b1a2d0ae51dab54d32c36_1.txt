This paper explores the problem of influence maximization in social networks with non-submodular threshold functions, which is a departure from the traditional submodular influence diffusion models. The authors introduce the concept of ε-almost submodular threshold functions, where a fraction of nodes have non-submodular threshold functions that are closely upper- and lower-bounded by submodular functions. The paper presents a strong hardness result, showing that there is no 1/n^γ c-approximation algorithm for influence maximization in graphs with up to n^γ ε-almost submodular nodes, unless P=NP.
The authors then provide a greedy algorithm for graphs with a small number of non-submodular nodes, which may not be ε-almost submodular, and restrict it to the case of ε-almost submodular nodes. They propose two algorithms, Galg-U and Galg-L, which use the submodular upper and lower bounds of the threshold functions, respectively. Theoretical guarantees are provided for these algorithms, with an approximation ratio of (1-1/e)(1-ε)^` for graphs with ` ε-almost submodular nodes.
The paper also presents experimental results on real-world datasets, including NetHEPT, Flixster, and DBLP, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to baseline algorithms such as PageRank and High-degree. The results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline algorithms, especially when the graph contains a large fraction of ε-almost submodular nodes.
The strengths of this paper include:
* Introduction of a new concept, ε-almost submodular threshold functions, which allows for the study of influence maximization in non-submodular regimes.
* Strong hardness result, which provides a theoretical foundation for the difficulty of the problem.
* Provision of greedy algorithms with theoretical guarantees for graphs with a small number of ε-almost submodular nodes.
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real-world datasets.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The algorithms proposed are slow when the submodular upper bound or lower bound of the threshold function does not correspond to the Triggering model.
* The study mainly focuses on handling ε-almost submodular threshold functions, and it remains open to investigate models with arbitrary non-submodular threshold functions.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new concept and provides a strong hardness result, which contributes to the theoretical understanding of influence maximization in non-submodular regimes.
* The proposed algorithms have theoretical guarantees and perform well on real-world datasets.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the concepts and algorithms.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The algorithms proposed may not be scalable for large graphs, and it remains open to accelerate the naive greedy process with arbitrary submodular threshold functions.
* The study mainly focuses on handling ε-almost submodular threshold functions, and it may not be directly applicable to models with arbitrary non-submodular threshold functions.
Overall, this paper provides a significant contribution to the field of influence maximization and social network analysis, and it is a good candidate for acceptance.
