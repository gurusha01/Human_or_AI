The paper "0-Low Rank Approximation" presents a comprehensive study of the 0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, a variant of low-rank approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of non-zero entries in the difference between the original matrix and its low-rank approximation. The authors provide approximation algorithms that significantly improve the running time and approximation factor of previous work.
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the areas of low-rank approximation, matrix factorization, and robust PCA. The authors build upon existing results and techniques, such as the use of column adjacency arrays and row and column sums, to develop new algorithms and analyses.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Improved approximation algorithms: The authors provide new approximation algorithms for the 0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, which improve upon the running time and approximation factor of previous work.
2. Sublinear time algorithms: The authors develop sublinear time algorithms for certain cases, which is a significant improvement over previous work.
3. Bicriteria algorithm: The authors present a bicriteria algorithm that outputs a matrix of rank O(k log(n/k)) with a guaranteed approximation factor, which is a useful result for practical applications.
4. Lower bounds: The authors establish lower bounds for the Boolean 0-rank-1 problem, which provides insight into the limitations of approximation algorithms for this problem.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Technical complexity: The paper is highly technical, and the proofs and analyses are complex and require a strong background in linear algebra, probability, and algorithms.
2. Limited experimental evaluation: The paper does not include extensive experimental evaluations of the proposed algorithms, which would be useful to demonstrate their practical effectiveness.
3. Assumptions on input data: Some of the algorithms and analyses rely on assumptions about the input data, such as the availability of column adjacency arrays or row and column sums, which may not always be satisfied in practice.
Overall, the paper presents significant contributions to the field of low-rank approximation and matrix factorization, and the results have the potential to impact various applications, such as data mining, machine learning, and signal processing.
