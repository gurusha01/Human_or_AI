This paper presents a principled analysis of the support recovery performance of a family of hard thresholding algorithms, specifically the partial hard thresholding (PHT) operator. The authors provide a unified framework for analyzing the iteration complexity of PHT-based algorithms, including hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement (OMPR). The main contribution of the paper is the establishment of a theoretical guarantee for the support recovery of an arbitrary sparse signal within O(sκ log κ) iterations, where κ is a condition number that depends on the restricted strong convexity and smoothness of the objective function.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are detailed and thorough, with a clear explanation of the proof techniques and lemmas used to establish the main results. The authors also provide a discussion of the implications of their results, including the comparison with existing work and the potential for future research directions.
