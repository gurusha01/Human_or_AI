The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the Partial Hard Thresholding (PHT) algorithm, focusing on its support recovery performance and iteration complexity under specific conditions. By leveraging the PHT operator introduced by Jain et al. (2017), the authors extend existing results for hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement (OMPR). They establish iteration complexity bounds of \(O(s\kappa \log \kappa)\), where \(\kappa\) is a condition number, and provide theoretical guarantees under restricted isometry property (RIP) and relaxed sparsity conditions. The paper also includes simulations to validate the theoretical findings.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Significance: The paper makes a non-trivial contribution by generalizing support recovery results to the PHT algorithm, which encompasses HTP and OMPR as special cases. The theoretical guarantees for iteration complexity and support recovery are significant, as they advance the understanding of greedy algorithms in sparse signal recovery.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors derive clear iteration complexity bounds and provide a detailed analysis under both RIP and RIP-free conditions. The results are well-grounded in existing literature and extend prior work in meaningful ways.
3. Unified Framework: The use of the PHT operator offers a unified perspective on a family of hard thresholding algorithms, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper suffers from several clarity issues. The termination condition for the PHT(r) algorithm is not explicitly described, making Proposition 1 ambiguous. Additionally, the simulation section lacks sufficient detail, as it does not specify key parameters such as the function \(F(x)\), condition numbers, or step sizes. Theoretical guarantees for 10,000 iterations are not directly tied to the simulation results, creating a disconnect between theory and practice.
2. Practical Implications: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper only briefly and abstractly discusses practical problem examples. This limits the accessibility and applicability of the results for practitioners.
3. Scaling Challenges: The scaling of \(x_{\text{min}}\) with \(O(1/d)\) poses challenges for large-scale problems, as acknowledged in the rebuttal. This limitation could restrict the algorithm's utility in high-dimensional settings.
4. Cross-Referencing Issues: Lemma 4 and Theorem 5 in the main text correspond to Lemma 19 and Theorem 20 in the supplementary material, but there is no explicit cross-referencing, which hampers readability.
Minor Issues:
The paper contains several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., "ha(ve â†’ s)", "The(n) the support"), which should be corrected for better readability.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery and hard thresholding algorithms. However, the lack of clarity in key aspects, such as the termination condition and simulation details, detracts from its overall impact. Additionally, the practical implications of the results are not sufficiently explored. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, contingent on addressing the clarity issues, improving the connection between theory and simulations, and providing more concrete examples of practical applications.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and significant theoretical contributions.
- Advances the state of the art in hard thresholding algorithms.
- Provides a unified framework for analyzing a family of algorithms.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in key sections.
- Limited discussion of practical implications.
- Scaling challenges for large \(n\).
With revisions, this paper has the potential to make a strong contribution to the field.
