This paper tackles the challenging problem of learning sequence classifiers without labeled data by leveraging sequential output statistics, such as language models. The authors propose a novel unsupervised learning cost function, Empirical Output Distribution Match (Empirical-ODM), which seeks to align the output distribution of the classifier with the prior distribution derived from sequential statistics. Unlike prior approaches, the proposed method avoids reliance on strong generative models and mitigates the issue of trivial solutions by emphasizing a coverage-seeking property. To optimize the non-convex cost function effectively, the authors introduce a stochastic primal-dual gradient (SPDG) method, which transforms the problem into a min-max formulation to reduce optimization barriers. Experimental results on OCR and spelling correction tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves error rates comparable to supervised learning and significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The paper addresses a critical problem in unsupervised learning, particularly for applications like OCR and speech recognition, where labeled data is expensive to obtain. The proposed cost function and optimization method represent a meaningful advancement over prior work.
2. Theoretical Insights: The coverage-seeking property of the Empirical-ODM cost is well-motivated and clearly explained. The authors provide a detailed comparison with prior methods, highlighting why their approach avoids trivial solutions.
3. Optimization Innovation: The SPDG algorithm is a significant contribution, effectively addressing the challenges of optimizing the non-convex cost function. The analysis of cost function profiles provides valuable insights into the algorithm's success.
4. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are thorough, with strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the approach performs comparably to supervised learning and is robust to variations in language model quality.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, making the technical content accessible. The inclusion of comparisons with related work and detailed experimental setups enhances the paper's clarity.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Classifiers: The method is currently restricted to linear classifiers. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and propose extending to nonlinear models in future work, this restricts the immediate applicability of the approach.
2. Computational Scalability: The proposed method may face challenges when scaling to large vocabularies or high-order language models due to the computational cost of summing over all possible N-grams. While potential solutions are discussed, they are left for future work.
3. Related Work Coverage: Although the paper includes detailed comparisons with prior methods, it is unclear whether all relevant works in unsupervised sequence classification are covered. A more comprehensive review of recent advances, particularly in neural language models, would strengthen the paper.
4. Minor Typographical Errors: A typo ("rate rate" on line 283) was noted, which should be corrected.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of unsupervised learning by addressing a practical and challenging problem with a novel cost function and optimization method. The theoretical insights, experimental results, and practical relevance make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, the limitations in scalability and the scope of classifiers should be addressed in future work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to correct typographical errors and ensure comprehensive coverage of related work.
