The paper addresses the problem of low-rank matrix approximation using the `l₀` norm, a challenging and NP-hard variant of low-rank approximation that minimizes the number of non-zero entries in the difference between the original and approximated matrices. The authors propose approximation algorithms with provable guarantees, including sublinear time algorithms for specific cases and bicriteria solutions for higher ranks. These contributions improve upon prior work in terms of both runtime and approximation factors, particularly for binary matrices and the rank-1 case. While the mathematical rigor and algorithmic innovations are commendable, the paper's practical relevance and broader applicability remain unclear.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contributions: The paper provides significant theoretical advancements for the `l₀`-low rank approximation problem, including the first provable guarantees for higher ranks (`k > 1`). The bicriteria algorithm is particularly noteworthy for achieving polynomial runtime with an approximation factor that scales reasonably with `k`.
2. Sublinear Time Algorithms: The authors demonstrate sublinear time complexity for certain cases, which is a substantial improvement over previous methods. This is especially impactful for large-scale matrices.
3. Theoretical Insights: The structural lemma (Lemma 2) and the connection to matrix rigidity and robust PCA provide valuable theoretical insights into the problem. The paper also highlights the limitations of existing techniques for `l₀`-norm problems, such as the lack of scale-invariance.
4. Clarity in Mathematical Presentation: The mathematical results are well-organized, with clear definitions, proofs, and algorithmic descriptions. The inclusion of lower bounds (e.g., Theorem 18) strengthens the theoretical foundation.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Practical Use Cases: The paper does not provide concrete applications or experimental results to demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithms in real-world scenarios. While the authors mention potential applications (e.g., robust PCA, Boolean matrix factorization), these remain speculative.
2. Assumption of Low Rank: The assumption that the data is inherently low-rank or close to low-rank is restrictive and may not hold in many practical settings. Moreover, the lack of a clear metric for evaluating the data's low-rank structure limits the generalizability of the approach.
3. Improbability of Exact Zeros: For random continuous data, achieving exact zeros in the `l₀` norm is highly unlikely, which undermines the applicability of the proposed methods. This issue is acknowledged but not adequately addressed.
4. Narrative and Organization: The paper is dense with technical details, which could be moved to supplementary material to improve readability. Additionally, the narrative could better emphasize the broader implications and significance of the results.
5. Minor Issues: Line 48 should explicitly refer to "supplementary material," and the redundant use of "w.h.p." in Line 244 should be simplified.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes substantial theoretical contributions to a challenging problem.
- The proposed algorithms are novel and improve upon prior work in terms of runtime and approximation guarantees.
- The connection to broader problems like matrix rigidity and robust PCA adds depth to the work.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of practical demonstrations or real-world applications limits the paper's impact.
- The restrictive assumptions (e.g., low rank, exact zeros) reduce the general applicability of the results.
- The narrative and organization could be improved to make the paper more accessible.
Recommendation:
While the paper excels in theoretical rigor and algorithmic innovation, its practical utility and broader relevance are limited. I recommend conditional acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing the practical applicability of their methods and improving the narrative to better connect the theoretical results to real-world problems.
