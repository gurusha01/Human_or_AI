The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of precipitation nowcasting by introducing a novel dataset, HKO-7, and proposing the Trajectory Gated Recurrent Unit (TrajGRU) model. The authors address key limitations of existing ConvLSTM-based models, particularly their inability to capture location-variant motion patterns, by introducing a flexible recurrent connection structure. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive benchmark, including a large-scale dataset, balanced loss functions, and evaluation protocols, which are crucial for advancing research in this domain.
Strengths:
1. Novel Dataset and Benchmark: The introduction of the HKO-7 dataset and a well-defined evaluation protocol fills a critical gap in precipitation nowcasting research. The inclusion of balanced loss functions (B-MSE and B-MAE) to address the imbalanced nature of rainfall events is particularly commendable.
2. Innovative Model Design: The TrajGRU model is a notable advancement over ConvGRU, as it dynamically learns location-variant connection structures using optical flow-based warping. This is a significant improvement for capturing complex motion patterns like rotation and scaling.
3. Comprehensive Experiments: The paper evaluates seven models, including baseline, optical flow-based, and deep learning approaches, across multiple thresholds and metrics. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of TrajGRU, especially for heavier rainfall scenarios.
4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written, with a clear problem motivation, detailed methodology, and thorough experimental analysis. The introduction and related work sections effectively situate the research within the broader context of video prediction and spatiotemporal modeling.
Weaknesses:
1. Technical Clarity: While the TrajGRU model is innovative, the explanation of the \(\mathcal{U}t\), \(\mathcal{V}t\), and \(\gamma\) functions is insufficiently detailed. A more intuitive description or visual illustration of how these components interact would enhance understanding.
2. Experimental Concerns: The underperformance of Conv3D compared to Conv2D raises questions about the experimental setup or the suitability of 3D convolutions for this task. Further analysis is needed to explain this anomaly.
3. Statistical Significance: While the results are promising, the lack of statistical significance testing for some comparisons (e.g., between deep learning models) weakens the robustness of the claims. Reporting confidence intervals or p-values would strengthen the conclusions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel dataset and benchmark that will likely become a valuable resource for the community.
- The TrajGRU model demonstrates clear improvements over existing methods, advancing the state of the art in precipitation nowcasting.
- The work is well-motivated, methodologically sound, and addresses a problem of significant practical importance.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The technical explanation of key components (\(\mathcal{U}t\), \(\mathcal{V}t\), \(\gamma\)) is lacking, which may hinder reproducibility.
- The experimental results, while promising, lack sufficient statistical rigor in some areas.
- The underperformance of Conv3D models is not adequately explained, leaving questions about the experimental design.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a substantial contribution to precipitation nowcasting and spatiotemporal modeling, but the authors should improve the clarity of technical explanations and address the experimental concerns in the final version.
