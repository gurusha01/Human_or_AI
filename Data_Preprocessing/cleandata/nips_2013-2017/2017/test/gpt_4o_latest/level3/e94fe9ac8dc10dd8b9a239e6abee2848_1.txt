The paper addresses the challenging problem of l₀-low rank approximation, where the goal is to approximate a given matrix \( A \) with a rank-\( k \) matrix \( A' \) while minimizing the entry-wise l₀ distance. This problem is NP-hard and has significant theoretical implications. The authors present several contributions, including the first bicriteria approximation algorithm for \( k > 1 \), achieving a rank of \( O(k \log(mn)) \) and an approximation error of \( \text{poly}(k \log(mn)) \times \text{OPT}k \). Additionally, a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for the \( k=1 \) case is introduced, which operates in sublinear time. For binary matrices, the authors propose an algorithm whose performance depends on OPT and is effective when OPT is \( O(\|A\|0) \).
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper makes significant theoretical progress by introducing the first bicriteria approximation algorithm for \( k > 1 \) with provable guarantees. This is a notable advancement in the field of low-rank approximation.
2. Sublinear Time Algorithm: The (2+ε)-approximation algorithm for \( k=1 \) in sublinear time is a strong result, especially given that sublinear time is provably impossible for other error measures like the Frobenius norm.
3. Binary Matrix Case: The algorithm for binary matrices provides a novel approach to a well-studied problem, achieving a (1+o(1))-approximation for small \( \psi = \text{OPT}/\|A\|_0 \).
4. Strong Conjecture: The conjecture on the inapproximability of Boolean l₀ rank-1 approximation is thought-provoking and could inspire future research.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Practical Motivation: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper does not adequately motivate the practical relevance of the l₀-low rank approximation problem. The connection to real-world applications is weak and underexplored.
2. No Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the proposed algorithms. Experimental evaluation would strengthen the claims and demonstrate the practical utility of the methods.
3. Assumption Justification: The assumption of accessing row and column sums in \( O(m+n) \) time is not well-justified. Alternative computation methods should be discussed.
4. Conjecture Support: The conjecture on inapproximability for Boolean l₀ rank-1 lacks evidence or rigorous theoretical support.
5. Presentation Issues: Minor issues such as notation errors, unclear access models, and typos detract from the paper's clarity and polish.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Significant theoretical advancements in an NP-hard problem.
- Introduction of the first bicriteria approximation algorithm for \( k > 1 \).
- Sublinear time algorithm for \( k=1 \) is novel and impactful.
Cons:
- Weak practical motivation and lack of experimental validation.
- Assumptions and conjectures are not sufficiently supported.
- Presentation issues reduce clarity.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes strong theoretical contributions, the lack of practical motivation and experimental validation limits its overall impact. If the authors can address these weaknesses, the work would be a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance with major revisions to improve clarity, provide experimental results, and better articulate the practical relevance of the problem.
