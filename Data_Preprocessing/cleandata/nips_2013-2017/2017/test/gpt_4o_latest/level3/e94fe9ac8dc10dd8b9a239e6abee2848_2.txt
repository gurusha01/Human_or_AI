The paper addresses the challenging problem of rank-k ℓ₀-minimizing approximation of a matrix, providing novel algorithms for both real and Boolean cases. The authors propose approximation and bi-criteria solutions, achieving significant improvements in running time and approximation factors compared to prior work. For k > 1, the paper introduces the first provable guarantees for this problem, including a bicriteria algorithm that outputs a rank-O(k log(n/k)) matrix with an approximation factor of O(k² log(n/k)). For k = 1, the authors present a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm that operates in sublinear time, a notable advancement over previous methods. Additionally, in the Boolean case, the paper achieves a (1+O(ψ))-approximation with ψ = OPT/‖A‖₀, offering improved results for small ψ. These contributions are supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and proofs.
The paper is well-written and clear, with a logical structure that makes the technical content accessible. The authors provide an extensive literature review, situating their work within the broader context of low-rank approximation and related problems, such as robust PCA and Boolean matrix factorization. The novelty of the algorithms and proof techniques is evident, and the results advance the state of the art in ℓ₀-low rank approximation.
However, the paper has some limitations. The lack of experimental evaluation is a significant drawback, as it limits the understanding of the practical applicability and scalability of the proposed algorithms. While the theoretical contributions are strong, empirical validation would provide valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms on real-world datasets. Additionally, the extensive literature review occupies a substantial portion of the paper, which could have been better utilized for presenting experimental results or discussing potential applications.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and originality: The algorithms and proof techniques are innovative, addressing a previously underexplored problem with provable guarantees.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making the technical content accessible to readers.
3. Significance: The results are important, offering improvements in both running time and approximation factors for ℓ₀-low rank approximation.
4. Extensive literature review: The paper provides a thorough overview of related work, situating its contributions within the broader research landscape.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of experimental evaluation: The absence of empirical results limits the understanding of the algorithms' practical performance.
2. Space utilization: The extensive literature review could have been condensed to allocate more space for experimental validation or discussion of applications.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, contingent on the authors addressing the lack of experimental evaluation in a future revision. The theoretical contributions are significant and advance the state of the art, but empirical validation would strengthen the paper's impact and relevance.
