The paper presents an information-theoretic exploration of query-based clustering, focusing on the query complexity required to recover perfect or approximate clusterings. The authors draw a novel equivalence between semi-supervised clustering and locally encodable source coding, a concept that is underexplored in information theory. By leveraging this equivalence, the paper provides theoretical upper and lower bounds on the number of queries necessary for clustering under various scenarios, including noisy oracle settings. The introduction of AND queries as a more efficient alternative to traditional "same cluster" queries is a key contribution, and the paper demonstrates their superiority in both noiseless and noisy settings. The theoretical results are validated through experiments, including a real-world crowdsourcing dataset, showcasing the practical relevance of the proposed methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The equivalence between clustering and locally encodable source coding is a fresh perspective that bridges machine learning and information theory. This connection is likely to inspire further research in both fields.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed theoretical bounds on query complexity, supported by rigorous proofs. The introduction of AND queries and their analysis is particularly compelling, as it challenges the limitations of traditional XOR-based "same cluster" queries.
3. Practical Relevance: The real-world crowdsourcing experiment demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed methods. The results align well with the theoretical predictions, adding credibility to the claims.
4. Clarity in Contributions: The paper clearly delineates its contributions, including the introduction of AND queries, new lower bounds, and an efficient algorithm for noisy query settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Structural Assumptions: While the lack of structural assumptions (e.g., graph structure or cluster separability) makes the results broadly applicable, it also limits the practical utility in scenarios where such assumptions hold. Incorporating structural priors could improve the practical performance of the methods.
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments, though validating the theoretical results, are relatively limited in scale and diversity. For example, the crowdsourcing dataset is small, and the synthetic experiments could benefit from more varied settings (e.g., larger datasets or different noise models).
3. Comparison with Prior Work: While the paper references related work, it could benefit from a more explicit comparison of its results with existing clustering methods, especially in terms of query efficiency and accuracy.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The mathematical exposition, while rigorous, is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with information theory. Simplifying some derivations or providing more intuition could improve accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound framework for query-based clustering, which is a significant contribution to both machine learning and information theory.
- The use of AND queries and the associated theoretical analysis address a fundamental limitation of existing methods, advancing the state of the art.
- The validation through real-world crowdsourcing experiments demonstrates practical relevance, which is often missing in purely theoretical work.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation, while promising, is limited in scope and may not fully establish the robustness of the proposed methods across diverse settings.
- The lack of structural assumptions, while theoretically appealing, may limit practical applicability in real-world clustering tasks where such assumptions are often valid.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the study of query-based clustering and provides valuable insights for both the machine learning and information theory communities. While the experimental validation could be more comprehensive, the novelty and rigor of the work outweigh these limitations. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the experimental evaluation.
