This paper presents a significant contribution to the distributed consensus problem by introducing and analyzing an accelerated variant of the Min-Sum algorithm, termed Min-Sum Splitting. The authors demonstrate that while the standard Min-Sum algorithm fails to converge in general graph settings, the Splitting variant ensures convergence and achieves subdiffusive accelerated convergence rates. Notably, the paper establishes a novel connection between Min-Sum algorithms and lifted Markov chain techniques, as well as multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization. This dual perspective enriches the theoretical understanding of the acceleration mechanisms in distributed optimization.
The paper is well-written and clearly contextualizes its contributions within the broader literature. The authors provide a thorough review of prior work, including classical diffusive algorithms, lifted Markov chains, and accelerated gradient methods, and position their work as a unifying framework that bridges these approaches. The results are novel and represent a qualitative advance in the field, particularly in the rigorous derivation of convergence rates for Min-Sum Splitting and the demonstration of its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.
One of the paper's key strengths is its analytical rigor. The authors introduce an auxiliary message-passing scheme to track the evolution of the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm, enabling a detailed spectral analysis of its convergence behavior. The results show that the algorithm achieves a square-root improvement in convergence time over classical diffusive methods, scaling as \( O(D \log(D/\epsilon)) \) for graphs with diameter \( D \). This improvement is particularly impactful for graphs with geometric structures, such as cycles and tori, where diffusive methods are suboptimal.
However, the paper has a minor weakness in the clarity of its exposition regarding the splitting parameters \( \delta \) and \( \Gamma_{vw} \). On page 4, the interpretation of these terms as real numbers is not sufficiently detailed, which may hinder reproducibility for readers unfamiliar with the underlying mathematical framework. Providing additional intuition or examples for these parameters would enhance the paper's accessibility.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new algorithmic variant and establishes its theoretical properties, including accelerated convergence rates.
2. Connections: It draws a novel link between Min-Sum algorithms, lifted Markov chains, and multi-step optimization methods, offering a unified perspective.
3. Analytical Rigor: The use of auxiliary processes and spectral analysis provides strong theoretical support for the claims.
4. Impact: The results advance the state of the art in distributed consensus and motivate further research into generalizing the approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The description of the splitting parameters \( \delta \) and \( \Gamma_{vw} \) could be improved for better interpretability.
2. Global Information Dependence: The acceleration mechanism relies on global graph properties, such as the spectral gap, which may limit practical applicability in fully decentralized settings.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are both theoretically significant and practically relevant, addressing a fundamental problem in distributed optimization. The minor issue of clarity can be addressed in a revision, and the paper's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.
