This paper introduces a multitask learning framework for contextual bandits, leveraging ideas from kernelized contextual bandits and regularized multitask learning. The proposed algorithm, KMTL-UCB, aims to exploit task similarities to improve reward prediction and decision-making. The authors provide a method to estimate task similarities dynamically, which is crucial for real-world applications where such information is often unavailable. They also establish a regret bound for the algorithm, interpret its implications, and validate their approach through numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Significance of the Problem: The paper addresses a practical and impactful problem in sequential decision-making, with applications in recommendation systems, personalized advertising, and multi-class classification. The ability to estimate task similarities dynamically is a notable contribution that enhances the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The mathematical analysis appears sound, with a regret bound that is well-motivated and interpretable. The authors also provide insights into how task similarity impacts regret, which is a valuable theoretical contribution.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, particularly in settings with high task similarity. The comparison with baseline methods (Kernel-UCB in independent and pooled settings) highlights the advantages of multitask learning.
4. Clarity of Motivation: The paper is well-motivated, and the intuition behind multitask learning in contextual bandits is clearly explained.
Weaknesses:
1. Incremental Contribution: While the paper builds on existing work (e.g., Kernel-UCB and CGP-UCB), the novelty is somewhat incremental. The proposed method can be seen as a natural extension of prior work, and the distinction from Valko et al. (2013) and CGP-UCB is not sufficiently emphasized.
2. Computational Complexity: The growing kernel matrix poses scalability challenges, especially for large-scale problems. The paper does not adequately address this issue or propose strategies to mitigate it.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The regret analysis relies on algorithms detailed only in the supplementary material, making Theorem 4.1 unclear in the main text. This hinders the accessibility of the theoretical contributions.
4. Limited Novelty in Task Similarity Estimation: The method for estimating task similarity, while useful, is inspired by existing kernel transfer learning frameworks. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how this approach advances the state of the art.
Recommendation:
While the paper addresses an important problem and provides a technically sound solution, its contributions are incremental, and certain aspects (e.g., computational complexity and clarity of presentation) require improvement. The paper is suitable for acceptance if the authors can address these concerns, particularly by clarifying the novelty relative to prior work and discussing scalability. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Addresses a significant and practical problem.
- Provides a theoretically sound and empirically validated solution.
- Introduces a useful method for estimating task similarities dynamically.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Incremental contribution with limited novelty.
- Computational complexity is not adequately addressed.
- Theoretical analysis lacks clarity in the main text.
In summary, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to multitask learning in contextual bandits but requires revisions to strengthen its novelty and presentation.
