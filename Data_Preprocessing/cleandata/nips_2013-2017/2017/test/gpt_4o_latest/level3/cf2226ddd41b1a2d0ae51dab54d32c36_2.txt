The paper explores the problem of influence maximization under the General Threshold model with ε-almost submodular threshold functions, a significant extension to the traditional submodular models. The authors address a challenging and underexplored area, motivated by real-world diffusion processes where non-submodular behaviors are observed. The paper makes two primary contributions: (1) a strong inapproximability result for influence maximization when the number of ε-almost submodular nodes is sublinear, and (2) a principled approximation algorithm with theoretical guarantees for cases where the number of ε-almost submodular nodes is fixed. Both contributions are supported by rigorous proofs and extensive experimental evaluations.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles a novel problem by extending influence maximization to the nonsubmodular regime, aligning with empirical evidence from real-world networks. This work advances the state of the art by addressing a gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The inapproximability result is non-trivial and well-constructed, leveraging reductions from the set cover problem. The proposed approximation algorithm is theoretically sound, with clear guarantees under specific conditions.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets (NetHEPT, Flixster, DBLP) convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the algorithms outperform baseline methods, including PageRank and high-degree heuristics.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The definitions (e.g., ε-almost submodular functions) and theoretical analyses are clearly presented, making the technical content accessible to readers.
5. Broader Impact: The ε-almost submodular framework is conceptually significant and could inspire future work on diffusion models with arbitrary non-submodular functions.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: While the proposed algorithms are efficient for a fixed number of ε-almost submodular nodes, the naive greedy approach becomes computationally prohibitive for larger networks or more complex threshold functions. This limitation is acknowledged but not fully addressed.
2. Generality: The focus on ε-almost submodular functions, while insightful, restricts the applicability of the results to a specific class of non-submodular functions. Extending the framework to arbitrary non-submodular threshold functions remains an open challenge.
3. Minor Typos: There are minor typographical errors and phrasing issues in the manuscript (e.g., unclear references to equations and inconsistent notation). These do not detract from the overall quality but should be corrected for clarity.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper provides a significant theoretical and practical contribution to influence maximization under nonsubmodular diffusion models. Its novelty, rigorous analysis, and empirical validation make it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, addressing scalability concerns and refining the presentation would further strengthen the work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful problem formulation.
- Strong theoretical and empirical contributions.
- Well-written and organized manuscript.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited scalability for larger networks.
- Restricted focus on ε-almost submodular functions.
Overall, the paper is a valuable addition to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing foundational and applied machine learning research.
