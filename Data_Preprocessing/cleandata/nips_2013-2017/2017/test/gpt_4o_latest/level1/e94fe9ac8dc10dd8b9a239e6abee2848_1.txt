Review of the Paper: Approximation Algorithms for the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem
Summary
This paper addresses the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, an NP-hard variant of low-rank matrix approximation where the goal is to minimize the number of non-zero disagreements between the input matrix \( A \) and its rank-\( k \) approximation \( A' \). The authors propose several approximation algorithms that improve upon prior work in terms of either running time or approximation factor. For \( k = 1 \), they achieve a \( (2+\epsilon) \)-approximation in sublinear time, which is a significant improvement over the previously best-known \( O(\|A\|_0 n) \)-time algorithm. For binary matrices, they further refine the approximation factor to \( 1+o(1) \) under certain conditions. For \( k > 1 \), they present the first provable approximation guarantees, achieving a bicriteria solution with rank \( O(k \log(n/k)) \) and an approximation factor of \( O(k^2 \log(n/k)) \). The paper also includes lower bounds and practical algorithms for specific cases, such as Boolean matrices and robust PCA.
The work builds on prior research in low-rank approximation (e.g., Frobenius norm and \( \ellp \)-norm variants) and matrix rigidity, while addressing the unique challenges posed by the \( \ell0 \)-norm. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and discuss the implications of their results for applications like anomaly detection, binary matrix factorization, and robust PCA.
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces the first provable approximation guarantees for \( k > 1 \) in the \( \ell_0 \)-low rank approximation problem, filling a gap in the literature. The bicriteria algorithm is particularly innovative, balancing rank expansion and approximation quality.
2. Efficiency: The sublinear-time algorithm for \( k = 1 \) is a significant improvement over prior work, demonstrating the potential for handling large-scale matrices efficiently.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithms have clear applications in areas like anomaly detection, binary matrix factorization, and robust PCA, making the work impactful for both theoretical and applied domains.
4. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed proofs, structural results, and lower bounds, ensuring the robustness of their claims. The connections to matrix rigidity and \( \ell_p \)-norm approximations are well-articulated.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly delineates the contributions for \( k = 1 \), \( k > 1 \), and special cases like binary matrices, making it easy to understand the scope and limitations of the work.
Weaknesses
1. Practical Evaluation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks empirical validation of the proposed algorithms on real-world datasets. This limits the ability to assess their practical performance and scalability.
2. Complexity of Presentation: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may make it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the \( \ell_0 \)-norm or low-rank approximation to follow. A more intuitive explanation of key ideas and algorithms would improve accessibility.
3. Bicriteria Solution: The bicriteria algorithm for \( k > 1 \) achieves a rank of \( O(k \log(n/k)) \), which may not always align with the practical need for strict rank-\( k \) solutions. This trade-off is not extensively discussed.
4. Limited Comparisons: The paper does not include a detailed comparison with heuristic approaches commonly used in practice, such as PROXIMUS or other binary matrix factorization techniques. This would help contextualize the theoretical results.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by addressing an NP-hard problem with novel approximation algorithms and provable guarantees.
- The sublinear-time algorithm for \( k = 1 \) and the bicriteria solution for \( k > 1 \) are both innovative and impactful.
- The work is well-grounded in prior research and advances the state of the art in low-rank approximation.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of empirical validation limits the practical impact of the results.
- The bicriteria solution may not fully satisfy applications requiring strict rank-\( k \) approximations.
- The paper's dense presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The theoretical contributions are substantial and advance the field, but the authors should include empirical results and clarify the practical implications of their algorithms. Additionally, simplifying the presentation of key ideas would make the paper more accessible to a wider audience.
