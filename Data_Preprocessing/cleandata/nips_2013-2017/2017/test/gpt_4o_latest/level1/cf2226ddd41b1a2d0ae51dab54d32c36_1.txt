This paper addresses the problem of influence maximization in social networks under non-submodular diffusion models, specifically focusing on the general threshold model with ε-almost submodular threshold functions. The authors present a theoretical hardness result, showing that influence maximization remains difficult to approximate even when non-submodular nodes are close to submodular. They propose approximation algorithms with guarantees for networks containing a limited number of ε-almost submodular nodes and validate their methods through experiments on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that their algorithms outperform baseline methods in both influence spread and computational efficiency.
The paper builds on foundational work in influence maximization, such as Kempe et al. (2003) and Mossel & Roch (2007), which leverage submodularity to design efficient algorithms. However, the authors extend this line of research to the less explored non-submodular regime, motivated by empirical observations (e.g., Backstrom et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2012) that real-world networks often exhibit non-submodular influence dynamics. Their work is also conceptually related to studies on approximate submodularity (Horel et al., 2016) and optimization of non-submodular functions (Du et al., 2013).
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper tackles a relatively underexplored area by addressing influence maximization in non-submodular settings, specifically ε-almost submodular functions. This is a meaningful extension of prior work.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide a rigorous hardness result and derive approximation guarantees for their algorithms, which are well-supported by proofs and analysis.
3. Practical Relevance: The proposed algorithms are evaluated on real-world datasets (NetHEPT, Flixster, DBLP), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to baseline methods.
4. Clarity of Experiments: The experimental setup is well-detailed, and the results are presented clearly, showing consistent performance improvements over baselines.
5. Scalability: The use of techniques like Reverse Reachable Sets (RRsets) ensures that the algorithms are computationally efficient, a critical factor for large-scale networks.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Non-Submodularity: The paper focuses on ε-almost submodular functions, which, while a reasonable starting point, may not fully capture the diversity of non-submodular behaviors observed in real networks. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not explore more general non-submodular cases.
2. Dependence on ε: The performance guarantees are tied to the parameter ε, and the practical implications of varying ε are not deeply analyzed. For instance, how robust are the algorithms when ε is large or difficult to estimate?
3. Algorithmic Complexity: While the proposed algorithms are scalable for ε-almost submodular nodes, their performance may degrade when the number of such nodes increases significantly, as hinted in the experiments. This limitation could be explored further.
4. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the authors compare their methods to baselines like PageRank and High-Degree heuristics, they do not benchmark against more advanced influence maximization algorithms (e.g., Borgs et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015) under similar conditions.
Recommendation:
Pros for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a novel and meaningful contribution to influence maximization by addressing non-submodular diffusion models.
- The theoretical results are strong and well-supported, and the experimental validation is thorough.
- The work is relevant to both theoretical and applied researchers in social network analysis and algorithm design.
Cons for Acceptance:
- The focus on ε-almost submodular functions may limit the generality of the results.
- The paper could benefit from broader comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and deeper exploration of parameter sensitivity.
Overall, this paper is a solid contribution to the field and advances our understanding of influence maximization in non-submodular settings. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to address the limitations in scope and comparisons.
