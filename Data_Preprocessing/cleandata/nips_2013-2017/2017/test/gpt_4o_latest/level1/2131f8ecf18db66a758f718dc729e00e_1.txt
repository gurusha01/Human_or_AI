This paper explores the equivalence between locally encodable source coding (LESC) and semi-supervised clustering, presenting novel theoretical results and practical algorithms for efficient label recovery in crowdsourcing settings. The authors propose a querying framework based on AND queries, demonstrating its superiority over traditional "same cluster" (XOR) queries in terms of query efficiency and robustness to noise. They derive information-theoretic lower bounds on query complexity, propose near-optimal nonadaptive querying schemes, and validate their methods using both theoretical analysis and real-world crowdsourcing experiments.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces the concept of LESC in the context of clustering and crowdsourcing, which is a fresh perspective. The use of AND queries as a more efficient alternative to XOR queries is a significant contribution, both theoretically and practically.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed proofs for their claims, including lower bounds on query complexity and performance guarantees for their algorithms. These results are grounded in information theory and rate-distortion theory, showcasing technical depth.
3. Practical Relevance: The paper addresses a real-world problem in crowdsourcing, where minimizing query costs is crucial. The experiments on real datasets (e.g., movie clustering) add credibility to the proposed methods and highlight their practical applicability.
4. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their theoretical findings with both synthetic and real-world datasets. The comparison of AND queries with "same cluster" queries demonstrates the practical advantages of the proposed approach.
5. Clarity in Contributions: The paper clearly outlines its contributions, including exact and approximate recovery schemes, noisy query handling, and experimental validation.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is technically rigorous, it is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with information theory or clustering. The notation and mathematical derivations, though precise, could benefit from additional explanation or visual aids.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The real-world experiments, while valuable, are limited in scale (e.g., only 200 movies). Larger-scale experiments or comparisons with other state-of-the-art clustering methods would strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Assumptions on Noise: The independence assumption for noisy queries, while standard, may not hold in all crowdsourcing scenarios. A discussion on the impact of correlated noise or adversarial settings would improve robustness.
4. Focus on Binary Labels: Much of the theoretical analysis focuses on binary labels (k=2), with limited exploration of multi-class settings (k>2). Extending the results to more general cases would enhance the paper's significance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by connecting LESC with clustering and deriving novel bounds.
- The proposed AND query framework is both innovative and practical, with demonstrated advantages over existing methods.
- The combination of theoretical rigor and empirical validation makes the work a valuable contribution to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
- The experimental validation, while promising, is somewhat limited in scale and scope.
- The focus on binary labels may restrict the generalizability of the results.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper is a strong candidate for acceptance. It advances the state of the art in clustering and crowdsourcing by introducing a novel querying framework and providing rigorous theoretical insights. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and experimental scope, the strengths of the work outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve accessibility and expand the experimental evaluation.
