This paper introduces an innovative extension to recurrent neural network (RNN) language models by incorporating an unbounded cache mechanism that stores all past hidden activations and associated target words. The proposed model leverages approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization techniques to efficiently handle large-scale memory, enabling it to adapt to dynamic data distributions over much larger contexts than traditional local cache models. The authors demonstrate that their approach significantly improves perplexity on various datasets, including near-domain and far-domain adaptation scenarios, while maintaining computational efficiency.
The paper builds on prior work in adaptive language modeling, such as cache models [Grave et al., 2017; Merity et al., 2018], which improve predictions by leveraging local context. However, these models are limited to short-term memory and fail to scale to larger contexts or adapt to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By introducing a scalable non-parametric memory component, the authors address these limitations, combining the strengths of parametric and non-parametric approaches. This work also draws on advances in large-scale retrieval methods, such as product quantization [Jegou et al., 2011], to ensure efficient memory usage and fast retrieval.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The proposed unbounded cache model is well-motivated and technically robust. The use of approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization is a novel and effective solution to scaling memory for language modeling.
2. Significance: The model addresses a critical challenge in language modeling—adapting to dynamic data distributions and handling OOV words—making it highly relevant for real-world applications like dialogue systems and domain adaptation.
3. Experimental Rigor: The authors conduct extensive experiments across diverse datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in perplexity over baseline models. The results are well-documented, with clear comparisons to local cache models and static baselines.
4. Efficiency: The paper highlights the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, showing that it outperforms local cache models in both accuracy and speed.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the technical details are thorough, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations of key concepts, particularly for readers less familiar with large-scale retrieval methods.
2. Originality: While the unbounded cache is a novel extension, the work heavily builds on existing techniques (e.g., cache models, product quantization). The originality lies more in the combination of these methods than in entirely new methodologies.
3. Broader Impact: The paper does not discuss potential limitations or risks, such as memory overhead in extremely large-scale applications or the impact of noisy data on retrieval performance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a significant advancement in adaptive language modeling, addressing limitations of prior cache-based approaches.
- The experimental results are compelling, showing substantial improvements in perplexity across diverse datasets.

Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper could improve in clarity, particularly in explaining technical details to a broader audience.
- The originality of the contribution is somewhat incremental, as it builds on well-established techniques.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of language modeling by introducing a scalable, efficient mechanism for dynamic adaptation. While the clarity and originality could be improved, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance.
