The paper introduces "Adept," an adaptive stimulus selection method designed to optimize neural population responses, addressing a gap in neuroscience where existing methods primarily focus on single-neuron optimization. Adept leverages population-level objective functions and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) feature embeddings to predict neural responses and select stimuli that maximize both response magnitude and diversity. The authors validate Adept through simulations using CNNs as surrogates for neural populations and closed-loop electrophysiological experiments in macaque V4, demonstrating its efficacy in eliciting higher mean responses and greater response diversity compared to random stimulus selection or single-neuron optimization methods.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper presents a significant advancement by shifting from single-neuron to population-level optimization, a critical step for leveraging modern multi-neuron recording technologies. The use of CNN feature embeddings to predict neural responses is innovative and aligns with recent trends in applying deep learning to neuroscience.
   
2. Technical Soundness: The methodology is well-supported by theoretical formulations and experimental results. The authors rigorously compare Adept to alternative methods, demonstrating its superiority in optimizing population responses.
3. Significance: Adept addresses a challenging problem in neuroscienceâ€”efficiently identifying stimuli that drive neurons in higher cortical areas, where preferred stimuli are less predictable. The method has broad implications for experimental design and could facilitate studies of neural phenomena such as attention and variability.
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-organized, with detailed descriptions of the algorithm, objective functions, and experimental setups. The inclusion of kernel regression and comparisons across multiple noise models enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Generality of Feature Embeddings: While CNN embeddings are effective, their generalizability to other brain areas or non-visual modalities is unclear. The paper acknowledges this but does not explore alternative embedding methods or discuss potential limitations in depth.
2. Limited Exploration of Objective Functions: Although the authors test multiple objective functions, the choice of the final function (combining norm and scatter) could be better justified. For example, the trade-offs between maximizing response magnitude and diversity could be explored more systematically.
3. Generative Stimuli: The reliance on a pre-existing pool of candidate stimuli limits Adept's applicability to experiments requiring novel or dynamically generated stimuli. While the authors suggest future work using generative models, this limitation is not addressed experimentally.
4. Biological Interpretability: The paper focuses heavily on algorithmic performance but provides limited discussion on the biological implications of the chosen stimuli or the neural mechanisms underlying the observed responses.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper introduces a novel and impactful method that advances the state of the art in adaptive stimulus selection.
- It is technically rigorous, with comprehensive evaluations in both simulations and real-world experiments.
- The method has significant potential to influence future research in neuroscience and related fields.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The reliance on CNN embeddings may limit the method's applicability to other modalities or brain areas.
- The lack of experimental exploration of generative stimuli reduces the method's flexibility for certain experimental designs.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong scientific contribution, and its limitations are outweighed by its novelty, technical rigor, and potential impact. Addressing the generalizability of feature embeddings and providing more discussion on biological implications would further strengthen the work.
