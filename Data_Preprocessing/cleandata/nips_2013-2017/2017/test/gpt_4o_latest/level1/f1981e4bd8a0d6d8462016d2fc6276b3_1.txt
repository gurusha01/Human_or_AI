The paper addresses the challenging problem of learning sequence classifiers without labeled data by leveraging sequential output statistics, such as language models. This is a significant contribution to unsupervised learning, particularly in domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. The authors propose a novel cost function, Empirical Output Distribution Match (Empirical-ODM), which emphasizes a coverage-seeking property to avoid trivial solutions. They also introduce a Stochastic Primal-Dual Gradient (SPDG) algorithm to optimize this cost function effectively, overcoming challenges related to non-convexity and biased gradients. Experimental results on OCR and spelling correction tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves error rates approximately twice those of fully supervised learning, a notable improvement over existing unsupervised methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new cost function, Empirical-ODM, which improves upon prior work by avoiding trivial solutions and eliminating the need for strong generative models. The coverage-seeking property is a key innovation that addresses limitations in earlier approaches, such as [7].
2. Technical Soundness: The SPDG algorithm is well-motivated and rigorously analyzed. The authors effectively demonstrate how the primal-dual reformulation reduces optimization barriers, making the cost function more tractable.
3. Empirical Validation: The method is evaluated on two real-world tasks, OCR and spelling correction, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods. The results are robust across different N-gram models and data sources, including out-of-domain language models.
4. Clarity of Comparisons: The paper provides detailed comparisons with prior works, such as [7] and [30], highlighting the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of both theoretical formulation and empirical performance.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope: The current work is restricted to linear classifiers, which may limit its applicability to more complex tasks requiring nonlinear models, such as deep neural networks. While the authors acknowledge this and propose future extensions, the lack of experiments with nonlinear models is a limitation.
2. Scalability Concerns: The computational cost of summing over all possible N-grams in high-order language models or large vocabularies is not fully addressed. While the authors suggest potential solutions, such as parameterizing dual variables with recurrent neural networks, these remain speculative.
3. Clarity: While the technical content is thorough, some sections, particularly the derivation of the SPDG algorithm and the discussion of conjugate functions, could benefit from additional simplification or visual aids to improve accessibility for non-expert readers.
