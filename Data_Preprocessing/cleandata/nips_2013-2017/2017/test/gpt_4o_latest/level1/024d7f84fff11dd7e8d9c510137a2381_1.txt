This paper investigates the Min-Sum Splitting algorithm for solving the consensus problem in distributed optimization, with a focus on establishing convergence rates and demonstrating acceleration mechanisms. The authors show that while the ordinary Min-Sum algorithm fails to converge in graphs with cycles, the Min-Sum Splitting variant guarantees convergence and achieves subdiffusive accelerated rates. They draw connections between the acceleration mechanisms of Min-Sum Splitting and techniques like lifted Markov chains and multi-step first-order methods in convex optimization. The paper's main contributions include a novel proof of convergence rates for Min-Sum Splitting, a new auxiliary process for analyzing the algorithm, and a demonstration of how proper parameter tuning yields improved rates compared to classical diffusive methods.
The work builds on prior research on Min-Sum algorithms, such as [27], which analyzed convergence for specific graph topologies, and [34], which introduced the splitting approach. The authors extend these results by providing a general analysis of convergence rates for arbitrary graph topologies and by connecting Min-Sum Splitting to broader acceleration techniques. The paper also situates its contributions within the context of distributed optimization and consensus literature, referencing classical methods like Metropolis-Hastings and recent advances in accelerated algorithms.
Strengths:
1. Technical Depth: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including a novel proof technique using an auxiliary process to track the evolution of the algorithm. This approach simplifies the analysis and links convergence rates to spectral properties of the graph.
2. Significant Contributions: The results demonstrate a square-root improvement in convergence time over diffusive methods for certain graph topologies, such as cycles and tori. This is a meaningful advancement in distributed optimization.
3. Connections to Broader Techniques: By relating Min-Sum Splitting to lifted Markov chains and multi-step methods, the paper situates its contributions within a broader framework, offering insights that could inspire further research.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly outlines its main contributions, including the first analysis of convergence rates for Min-Sum Splitting and the design of a competitive protocol for consensus.
Weaknesses:
1. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks experimental results to validate the theoretical findings. While the proofs are rigorous, empirical evidence would strengthen the claims and demonstrate practical applicability.
2. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with Min-Sum algorithms or spectral graph theory. Simplifying some sections or providing more intuitive explanations could improve accessibility.
3. Global Information Dependency: The acceleration mechanism relies on global properties of the graph, such as the spectral gap, which may limit the practical applicability of the method in fully decentralized settings where such information is unavailable.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in distributed optimization and provides a novel theoretical contribution.
- The results are well-grounded in prior work and extend the state of the art in both Min-Sum algorithms and consensus methods.
- The connections to lifted Markov chains and multi-step methods are insightful and open avenues for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation weakens the practical impact of the results.
- The reliance on global graph properties may limit the applicability of the method in real-world decentralized systems.
- The paper's dense presentation could hinder comprehension for a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, contingent on the authors addressing the lack of empirical validation in a future revision. The theoretical contributions are strong, and the connections to broader acceleration techniques are compelling. However, the authors should consider simplifying the exposition to make the work more accessible to a wider audience.
