The paper introduces "Adept," an adaptive stimulus selection method designed to optimize population-level neural responses rather than focusing on single neurons. This work addresses a significant gap in neuroscience by proposing a principled approach to efficiently select stimuli that maximize both the magnitude and diversity of responses across a population of neurons. The authors validate Adept through simulations using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as surrogates for neural populations and in closed-loop electrophysiological experiments on macaque V4 neurons. The results demonstrate that Adept outperforms single-neuron optimization methods and random stimulus selection in eliciting larger and more diverse neural responses, with potential applications in probing neural phenomena in higher-order brain areas.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper presents a novel population-level approach to adaptive stimulus selection, which is a meaningful advancement over existing single-neuron methods. This innovation is particularly relevant for experiments involving higher-order brain areas where preferred stimuli are less predictable.
2. Strong Empirical Validation: The authors provide robust evidence for Adept's efficacy through simulations with CNNs and real-world experiments with macaque V4 neurons. The use of CNN feature embeddings to predict neural responses is a creative and well-justified approach, leveraging recent advances in deep learning.
3. Quantitative Improvements: Adept consistently outperforms random selection and single-neuron methods in eliciting larger mean responses and greater response diversity, as shown through rigorous statistical analyses.
4. Clarity of Objectives: The paper clearly defines its goals and systematically evaluates multiple objective functions, providing insights into their trade-offs (e.g., maximizing response magnitude vs. diversity).
5. Practical Utility: The method is computationally efficient, making it feasible for real-time closed-loop experiments. The authors also address potential limitations, such as noise and overfitting, demonstrating Adept's robustness.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Generalizability: While Adept is tested on macaque V4 neurons and CNNs, its applicability to other brain areas or sensory modalities is not fully explored. Future work could extend Adept to auditory or motor systems.
2. Dependence on CNN Feature Embeddings: The reliance on pre-trained CNNs for feature embeddings may limit Adept's performance in cases where CNNs poorly predict neural responses. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not propose concrete solutions, such as training task-specific embeddings.
3. Stimulus Generation: Adept currently selects from a pre-defined pool of stimuli. The paper briefly mentions the potential for generative models (e.g., GANs) but does not experimentally explore this direction, which could further enhance the method's utility.
4. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is well-organized, some sections (e.g., mathematical formulations) are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with kernel regression or CNN architectures. Simplifying these explanations could improve accessibility.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and adaptive experimental design. The method is innovative, well-supported by experiments, and has clear potential for advancing research on neural population dynamics. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations related to generalizability and stimulus generation in future work.
