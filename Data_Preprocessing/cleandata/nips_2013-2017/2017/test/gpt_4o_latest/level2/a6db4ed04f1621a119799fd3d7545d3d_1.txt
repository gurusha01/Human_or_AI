The paper presents a significant advancement in precipitation nowcasting by proposing a novel model, Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU), and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating deep learning models in this domain. The authors address two key limitations in prior work: the location-invariant convolutional recurrence structure of ConvLSTM and the lack of clear evaluation protocols for precipitation nowcasting. Their contributions include the development of the TrajGRU model, which actively learns location-variant recurrent connections, and the introduction of the HKO-7 dataset, along with balanced loss functions (B-MSE and B-MAE) and evaluation protocols that emphasize performance at higher rainfall thresholds.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Contributions: The TrajGRU model introduces a location-variant recurrent structure, which is a significant improvement over ConvGRU. The ability to learn spatiotemporal correlations more efficiently is well-justified and experimentally validated.
2. Comprehensive Benchmark: The creation of the HKO-7 dataset and the introduction of balanced loss functions address critical gaps in the field, providing a robust framework for future research.
3. Experimental Rigor: The paper evaluates seven models across multiple metrics, including conventional and balanced loss functions, and demonstrates the superiority of TrajGRU. The inclusion of both offline and online settings adds practical relevance.
4. Real-World Relevance: The focus on heavier rainfall thresholds and the use of online learning align well with real-world requirements for precipitation nowcasting systems.
5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the model, benchmark, and experimental setup.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Generalization Discussion: While TrajGRU is shown to outperform other models in precipitation nowcasting, the paper could better discuss its potential applicability to other spatiotemporal tasks, such as video prediction or object tracking.
2. Computational Complexity: Although the authors argue that TrajGRU is parameter-efficient, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of its computational overhead compared to simpler models like ConvGRU or optical flow-based methods.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper evaluates the impact of balanced loss functions, additional ablation studies on the architecture of TrajGRU (e.g., the number of links) could provide deeper insights into its design choices.
4. Dataset Limitations: The HKO-7 dataset, while extensive, is geographically limited to Hong Kong. The generalizability of the results to other regions with different weather patterns remains unclear.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by addressing critical limitations in precipitation nowcasting and proposing a novel, effective model.
- Con: The lack of detailed computational analysis and broader generalization discussion slightly limits its impact.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a strong contribution to the field, with well-supported claims, significant novelty, and practical relevance. Addressing the weaknesses, particularly computational analysis and generalization, would further strengthen its impact.
