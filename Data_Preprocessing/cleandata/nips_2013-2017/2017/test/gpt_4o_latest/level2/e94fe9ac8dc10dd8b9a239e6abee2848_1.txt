The paper addresses the `0-Low Rank Approximation Problem, an NP-hard variant of low-rank approximation that minimizes the number of non-zero disagreements between a given matrix and its rank-k approximation. The authors propose novel approximation algorithms that improve both the running time and approximation guarantees over prior work, particularly for the challenging cases of k > 1 and binary matrices. They also provide the first provable guarantees for this problem in certain settings, including sublinear-time algorithms for specific cases.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing a less-explored but important variant of low-rank approximation. The proposed algorithms are the first to provide provable guarantees for `0-Low Rank Approximation for k > 1, filling a notable gap in the literature.
2. Improved Efficiency: The authors achieve substantial improvements in running time, including sublinear time for k = 1 in specific scenarios. This is particularly impressive given the inherent complexity of the problem.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed proofs and theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithms, including approximation factors and running time bounds. The structural lemma and bicriteria algorithm are particularly noteworthy contributions.
4. Practical Relevance: The work has clear applications in areas such as robust PCA, binary matrix factorization, and anomaly detection, where minimizing disagreements is more meaningful than minimizing traditional norms like Frobenius.
5. Clarity in Results: The distinction between real and Boolean cases is well-articulated, and the paper provides tailored algorithms for each, along with lower bounds that highlight the computational challenges.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the practical performance of the proposed algorithms. While the theoretical contributions are strong, experiments on real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's impact and demonstrate the algorithms' utility in practice.
2. Complexity of Presentation: While the theoretical results are detailed, the presentation is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Simplifying some proofs or providing more intuitive explanations could improve accessibility.
3. Assumptions and Limitations: The paper assumes access to specific input formats (e.g., column adjacency arrays) and relies on parameters like ψ (OPT/‖A‖0) for performance guarantees. These assumptions may limit the applicability of the algorithms in some practical scenarios.
4. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper references prior work, a more detailed experimental or theoretical comparison with existing algorithms (e.g., for Frobenius norm or `p-norm approximations) would contextualize the improvements more effectively.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper addresses a challenging and underexplored problem with significant theoretical contributions.
- The proposed algorithms are novel, efficient, and come with strong theoretical guarantees.
- The work has potential applications in diverse fields, making it relevant to the NIPS audience.
Cons:
- The lack of experimental validation limits the paper's practical impact.
- The presentation is dense, which may hinder comprehension for a broader audience.
- Some assumptions (e.g., input formats) may restrict real-world applicability.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions to the field of low-rank approximation are both novel and significant. However, the authors are strongly encouraged to include experimental results in a future revision to validate the practical performance of their algorithms and to improve the accessibility of the presentation.
