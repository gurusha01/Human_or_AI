The paper addresses the critical issue of Byzantine resilience in distributed implementations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), proposing a novel aggregation rule, Krum, to ensure convergence despite the presence of Byzantine workers. The authors demonstrate that existing linear aggregation methods fail to tolerate even a single Byzantine worker, and they introduce a formal resilience property to guide the design of robust aggregation rules. Krum is shown to satisfy this property and is experimentally validated to outperform classical averaging in adversarial settings. The paper also explores a variant, Multi-Krum, which balances resilience and convergence speed.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles a pressing problem in distributed machine learning, where Byzantine failures can arise from software bugs, biases, or adversarial attacks. The introduction of Krum as a provably Byzantine-resilient aggregation rule is a significant contribution to the field. The work advances the state of the art by addressing a gap in existing methods, which fail under even mild adversarial conditions.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a formal definition of Byzantine resilience and prove that Krum satisfies this property under specific conditions. The convergence analysis is thorough, even considering non-convex cost functions, which are common in modern machine learning.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the resilience of Krum to various Byzantine attacks, including Gaussian and omniscient adversaries. The results are well-presented and highlight the practical utility of Krum in real-world scenarios.
4. Scalability: The computational complexity of Krum, \(O(n^2 \cdot d)\), is reasonable given the high dimensionality of modern machine learning models. The discussion on Multi-Krum provides a practical trade-off between robustness and efficiency.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the experiments are compelling, they are conducted on relatively simple tasks (spam filtering and MNIST classification). It would strengthen the paper to include evaluations on more complex datasets and models, such as large-scale deep learning tasks.
2. Assumptions on Gradient Estimators: The resilience of Krum relies on the assumption that correct workers compute unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance. This assumption may not always hold in federated learning settings with heterogeneous data distributions.
3. Lack of Comparison to Recent Work: Although the authors discuss related work in distributed computing and robust statistics, they do not compare Krum to more recent Byzantine-resilient methods, such as those based on geometric medians or robust optimization.
4. Practical Deployment Challenges: The paper does not address potential challenges in deploying Krum in real-world distributed systems, such as communication overhead or integration with existing frameworks.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Expand the experimental evaluation to include more diverse datasets, larger models, and federated learning scenarios with non-i.i.d. data distributions.
2. Compare Krum to other recent Byzantine-resilient methods to contextualize its performance and trade-offs.
3. Discuss practical deployment considerations, such as communication costs and fault tolerance in the parameter server.
4. Include more detailed proofs and supplementary material to enhance reproducibility.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of distributed machine learning by addressing a critical vulnerability in existing methods. The theoretical and experimental results are compelling, and the proposed Krum algorithm is both novel and practically relevant. While there are some limitations in the scope of experiments and comparisons, these do not detract significantly from the paper's overall quality. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements.
