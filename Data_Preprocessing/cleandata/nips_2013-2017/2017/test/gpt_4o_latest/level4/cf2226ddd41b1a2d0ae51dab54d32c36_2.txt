This paper investigates the problem of influence maximization within the General Threshold diffusion model, focusing on scenarios where node threshold functions exhibit near-submodularity (or epsilon-submodularity). The main contributions are as follows: 1) a formal proof demonstrating the inapproximability of the influence maximization problem under this model when a sufficient number of nodes have epsilon-submodular threshold functions; and 2) the development of an efficient, straightforward, and theoretically grounded approximation algorithm for cases involving a fixed number of epsilon-submodular threshold nodes.
This is a compelling paper for several reasons:
1- Influence maximization under the General Threshold model is a complex and underexplored research area;
2- The epsilon-submodularity assumption is highly plausible, as it aligns well with empirical observations of real-world diffusion processes;
3- Both the hardness result and the proposed approximation algorithms are insightful and non-trivial.
Aside from minor typographical issues (detailed below), the paper is exceptionally well-written. To the best of my knowledge, the technical proofs are sound. The experimental results are comprehensive and persuasive, aligning well with the theoretical predictions.
Minor comments (by line):
102: Should the equation's right-hand side use 1/(1-\epsilon) instead of (1-\epsilon)?  
237: Replace "liner" with "linear."  
241: Use "satisfying" instead of "satisfies."  
262: Correct "PagrRank" to "PageRank."  
297: Change "while 2.05" to "compared to 2.05."  
298: Replace "spreads" with "spread."  
299: Rephrase as "The more $\epsilon$-AS nodes present in the network, the greater the improvement observed."
