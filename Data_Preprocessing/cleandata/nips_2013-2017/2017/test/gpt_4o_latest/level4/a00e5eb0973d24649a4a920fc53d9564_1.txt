This paper examines theoretical limitations of variance-reduced stochastic algorithms for finite-sum problems (e.g., SAG, SDCA, SAGA, SVRG). These algorithms have had a significant impact on machine learning and convex optimization, as they achieve linear convergence for strongly convex problems with Lipschitz gradients (logarithmic dependence) while scaling with a factor of $n + \kappa$ rather than $n\kappa$.
The first result presented in this paper demonstrates that sequential iterative algorithms must identify which individual function is returned by the oracle to achieve linear convergence rates. For instance, algorithms like SAG and SAGA rely on this information to update their gradient memory buffers. Thus, it is not particularly surprising that knowledge of the function index is essential.
The paper further argues that such variance-reduced methods are incompatible with data augmentation during training. However, this limitation applies only when the data augmentation process is stochastic and does not involve a finite set of augmented samples.
The second result addresses the potential for accelerating these variance-reduced algorithms in the "Nesterov sense" (reducing the condition number dependency from $\kappa$ to $\sqrt{\kappa}$). It is shown that "oblivious" algorithms—those whose update rules remain fixed on average across iterations—cannot achieve such acceleration.
A practical implication of the first result, discussed in Section 3.2, is that knowledge of the strong convexity parameter is required to achieve accelerated convergence when the algorithm is stationary.
The paper also delves into the analysis of oblivious algorithms using restart techniques, which are well-established methods for mitigating the non-adaptive nature of accelerated algorithms when local conditioning is unknown.
Overall, the paper is well-written and demonstrates a clear pedagogical approach.
Minor comments:
- CLI is first defined in Definition 2 but is used earlier in the text.
- Typo in Line 224: "First, let us we describe" should be corrected to "First, let us describe."
