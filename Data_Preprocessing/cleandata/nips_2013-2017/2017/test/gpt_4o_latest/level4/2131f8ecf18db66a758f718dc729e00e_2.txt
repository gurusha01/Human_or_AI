This paper investigates a clustering problem aimed at reconstructing the true labels of elements based on potentially noisy and non-adaptive query-answers, each involving only a subset of elements. It establishes lower bounds on the number of queries required for exact or partial reconstruction of ground-truth labels across various scenarios. Additionally, it introduces an "AND-queries" algorithm applicable to the general k-cluster case and evaluates its performance on a real dataset.
While the paper provides theoretical analyses for different scenarios, develops an algorithm, and includes real-data simulations, it has notable shortcomings in presentation, clarity of results, and comparisons to related works. Substantial revisions and potentially new developments may be needed for publication. Detailed comments are as follows:
1. (Repeating the same questions is not allowed): This restriction appears overly limiting and could degrade performance compared to the unrestricted case, as repeated questions are a natural way to mitigate noise. To justify this model, the authors could provide extensive real-data simulations comparing their algorithm to one designed for the unrestricted case, potentially demonstrating superior performance. If this is not feasible, the unrestricted case may be more appropriate to explore. The authors seem concerned about independence versus dependence issues for multiple answers to the same query, which could complicate analysis. However, this could be addressed by focusing on a setting where the same query is posed to distinct annotators, assuming their answers are independent.
2. (Theorem 1): The noiseless setting with exact recovery has also been studied in [Ahn-Lee-Suh], which examines XOR-based "same-cluster" queries under a non-adaptive measurement model. However, the result in [Ahn-Lee-Suh] appears inconsistent with Theorem 1. For example, when \( p = 1/2 \) and \( \Delta \) is constant, Theorem 1 claims \( m = n / \log 2 \), whereas [Ahn-Lee-Suh] reports \( m = n \log n / \Delta \). This discrepancy needs detailed clarification. Furthermore, the proof of Theorem 1 is challenging to follow.
3. (Theorem 3): The lower bound expression for \( \delta \) is difficult to interpret. Specifically, it is unclear how to deduce the bound on \( m \) in terms of \( n \) and \( \delta \), which would allow readers to directly understand the performance gains due to the relaxed constraint reflected in \( \delta \).
4. (Theorem 4): Similar concerns regarding interpretability apply to Theorem 4. Additionally, the relationship between the upper bound in Theorem 4 and the lower bound in Theorem 3 is unclear. Could the gap between them be unbounded? The proof of Theorem 4 is also difficult to follow.
5. (Figure 2): The comparison is limited to the "same-cluster-query lower bound" and does not include the "same-cluster-query method." It would be helpful to determine whether a crossing point exists when compared to the method itself. If so, what insights can be drawn from this? The paper claims that the proposed approach outperforms the same-cluster-query scheme, but this claim is not substantiated by Figure 2.
6. (Algorithm 1): The algorithm requires prior knowledge of \( p \) or the relative sizes of clusters (as indicated in Theorem 6). How can such information be obtained in practice? Providing a justification would enhance the algorithm's practicality. Additionally, the pseudo-code is difficult to follow without referring to the proof of Theorem 5, which is itself challenging to understand.
7. (Figures 3, 4, and 5): The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as the same-cluster-query approach, which is critical to support the claim that the AND-queries algorithm outperforms existing methods.

(Additional comments):  
The rebuttal addressed some comments satisfactorily, but further clarification is needed:  
1. It remains unclear whether repeating the same question is indeed unhelpful. Did the referenced Nature paper demonstrate this? This point could be clarified in a revision.  
2. Regarding the comparison to the same-query method: including a detailed discussion, as mentioned in the response, would improve clarity.
