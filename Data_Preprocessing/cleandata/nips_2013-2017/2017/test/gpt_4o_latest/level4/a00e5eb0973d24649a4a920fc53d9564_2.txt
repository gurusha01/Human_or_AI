This paper presents a series of results regarding lower bounds for finite-sum optimization problems. Over the past two years, a nearly complete theoretical framework has emerged in this area, and this paper makes a valuable contribution to that body of work. I consider this to be an important and impactful area of research.
The paper is exceptionally well-written and more polished than the majority of NIPS submissions. I have only a few comments:
• I am unclear about the application of Fano's inequality in equation (10). Could you provide further clarification?
• Between lines 134-135, should the final term in the equation be \(n^2/2\) instead? I am having difficulty following this part.
• I was unable to locate the definition of \(t^{*}\) in equation (13).
• The use of the tilde appears inconsistent in conjunction with the big-\(\Omega\) notation throughout the paper.
• In Definition 2, it would be helpful to explicitly state that \(\theta\) typically includes the function index. Currently, the text preceding the definition—"the oracle may allow one to query about a specific individual function"—is somewhat vague.
• How does the result in Section 3.2 relate to Theorem 2 in reference [4]? Is it simply a strengthening due to the additional \(n\) term? Similarly, the result in Section 3.3 seems closely connected to findings in that paper. In the introduction, you mention that your work improves upon the results in [4]; I believe the precise nature of this improvement should be articulated more clearly.
