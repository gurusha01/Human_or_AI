The paper introduces algorithms to compute a rank-k ℓ₀-minimizing approximation for a given matrix A. It presents approximation algorithms for the real-valued case when p = 1 and p > 1, as well as for the boolean case. The authors offer approximation algorithms (some of which are notably sublinear) and, in certain instances, bi-criteria approximations.
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithms are compelling, and the proof techniques employed include some intriguing and novel elements.
- The paper is clearly and effectively written.
Weaknesses:
- The absence of experimental evaluation makes it challenging to assess the practical relevance and applicability of these algorithms.
- Reducing the space devoted to the extensive literature review in favor of incorporating experimental results would enhance the paper's overall impact.
