This paper proposes a GAN-based system for generating novel-view person images guided by a target skeleton, represented as keypoints. The system primarily incorporates established techniques such as DCGANs and U-nets, with its main contribution being its application to a specific computer vision task.
Pros:
- The proposed idea is intriguing, the manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, and the empirical experiments demonstrate that the system can synthesize images that appear realistic to some extent.
Cons:
- Given the application-oriented nature of this work, achieving strong results is crucial. My primary concerns are:
  - Lack of quantitative evaluation: For instance, user studies could have been conducted to assess how often the generated images successfully deceive human observers.
  - Limited visual quality of results: The empirical results are not visually compelling. For example, in Figure 1, the generated images are too small to be properly examined, yet even at this scale, there are noticeable visual artifacts when comparing the outputs to the target images. This makes it difficult to conclude that the results are of high quality or comparable to real images. Similar issues persist across most of the results, including those in the supplementary material. While I believe the authors are on the right track and the work shows promise, it seems premature to claim success at this stage.
After rebuttal:
After reviewing the authors' response, I remain unconvinced. Other reviewers have also highlighted concerns regarding both the quantitative and qualitative results, which are critical for a practical, application-focused study like this. While the rebuttal provides some additional efforts, these do not sufficiently address the core issues. As such, I feel this work may not yet be ready for presentation at a prestigious venue like NeurIPS.
