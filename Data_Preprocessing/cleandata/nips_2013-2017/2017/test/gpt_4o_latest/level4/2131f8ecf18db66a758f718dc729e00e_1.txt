The authors investigate a clustering framework where the learner can interact with an oracle by posing queries, with the objective of identifying the target clustering. These queries may take the form of same-cluster queries [or, more broadly, a fixed binary-valued function of the labels of the input instances]. The focus of the paper is on analyzing the query complexity of such models.
This query-driven clustering paradigm is a well-motivated and relatively recent area of research, with practical applications in domains like record deduplication, crowdsourcing, and more. The authors approach the problem from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, they derive upper and lower bounds on the number of queries required to achieve perfect (or approximate) recovery of the target clustering. Additionally, they extend their analysis to scenarios where the oracle is noisy. The information-theoretic techniques employed in the paper are novel and of interest to the machine learning community.
However, the absence of structural assumptions about the problem (e.g., the presence of a hypothesis class) limits the scope of the analysis. In particular, the bounds primarily depend on the marginal distribution of the labels, along with the noise level, making the studied setting somewhat different from the conventional frameworks in learning theory. Nonetheless, this work represents an important initial step and contributes to understanding the information-theoretic foundations of query-based clustering, especially in terms of establishing related lower bounds.
