The paper addresses the problem of \( \ell0 \)-Low Rank Approximation, where the objective is to approximate an input matrix \( A \) (\( m \times n \)) with a rank-\( k \) matrix \( A' \) that minimizes the entry-wise \( \ell0 \) distance. The authors present the first bicriteria approximation algorithm for this problem: for any \( k > 1 \), they provide a rank \( O(k \log(mn)) \) matrix \( A' \) such that \( ||A - A'||0 \leq \text{poly}(k \log(mn)) \times \text{OPT}k \), where \( \text{OPT}_k \) denotes the closest rank-\( k \) matrix to \( A \).
Additionally, the paper offers a \((2 + \epsilon)\)-approximation for the case \( k = 1 \) in sublinear time and proposes an algorithm for binary matrices, which appears to have more practical relevance. However, the approximation ratio for the binary case depends on the value of the optimal solution and performs well only when \( \text{OPT} = O(||A||_0) \), which raises some concerns about the robustness of the result.
The problem is theoretically well-motivated and standard, but its practical applications are not convincingly demonstrated. The paper lacks experimental validation and a thorough explanation of the problem's relevance in real-world scenarios. While the results are clean and technically sound, there are certain assumptions that lack sufficient justification:
- The assumption that the sum of rows and columns can be accessed in \( O(m + n) \) time (lines 138–140) is not well-supported. Given \( ||A||0 \) and adjacency list access, these sums can be computed efficiently. This assumption appears necessary for Theorems 13 and 14, but the same running time guarantees could be achieved by spending \( ||A||0 \) time to compute them.
- The conjecture or inapproximability result for Boolean \( \ell_0 \)-rank-1 approximation seems overly strong and is not substantiated with sufficient evidence.
Minor comments:
- Line 31: Change "rank-k" to "rank-\( k \)".
- Line 33: Correct "min(\( mn^2, mn^2 \))" to "min(\( mn^2, m^2n \))".
- Lines 131–137: Consider mentioning the incident list access model, which is a natural access model in the context of sublinear time algorithm design.
- Line 168: Correct \( S^{(0)} = [n] \) to \( S^{(0)} = [m] \).
- Line 234: Replace "The" with "we".
In conclusion, the paper investigates an interesting theoretical problem and makes reasonable progress in this area. However, its practical applicability is not well-supported, and the lack of experimental results and motivation for real-world use cases weakens the overall contribution.
