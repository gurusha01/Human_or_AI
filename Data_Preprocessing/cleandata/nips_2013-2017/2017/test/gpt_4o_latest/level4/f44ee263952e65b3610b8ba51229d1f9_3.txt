This paper explores an extension of the continuous cache models recently introduced by Grave et al. The authors propose an unbounded continuous cache model capable of accounting for events from an indefinite past. While the idea is intriguing, the paper lacks strong experimental evidence to substantiate its claims. The primary assertion is that this model outperforms Grave et al.'s approach, yet no direct comparison is provided. Instead, the paper appears to compare its model with older cache models, such as those by Kuhn et al. from the 1990s. However, this comparison is unclear, as the authors dedicate only one line (line 206) to describing the models they benchmark against. The phrase "the static model interpolated with the unigram probability distribution observed up to time t" seems to align with Kuhn et al.'s work and does not correspond to Grave et al.'s model.
The authors also emphasize the significance of large vocabularies but fail to disclose the vocabulary sizes used in their experiments. Additionally, it is unclear why all datasets were lowercased if the focus is on large vocabularies. These omissions, combined with the lack of clarity in the experimental section, detract from the paper's potential. This is unfortunate, as the initial sections (1-3) were highly promising. We recommend that the authors refine the experimental section to enhance the paper's publishability.
