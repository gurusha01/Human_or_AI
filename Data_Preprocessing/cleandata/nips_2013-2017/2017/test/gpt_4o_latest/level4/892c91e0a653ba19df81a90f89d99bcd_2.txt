An intriguing approach to accelerating experimental design for uncovering neural coding. The concept of leveraging a CNN to quantify stimulus similarity is compelling, but it introduces a paradoxical concern: if the CNN can accurately predict the statistical properties of neuronal responses (e.g., in V4), conducting the experiment becomes redundant, as analyzing the CNN data would yield all the necessary insights. Conversely, if the CNN only partially or inaccurately captures the stimulus similarity expected in the recorded brain region, this discrepancy could influence the experimental outcomes. It would be valuable to explore potential resolutions to this issue. Nevertheless, this represents a promising effort and is suitable for acceptance at NIPS.
