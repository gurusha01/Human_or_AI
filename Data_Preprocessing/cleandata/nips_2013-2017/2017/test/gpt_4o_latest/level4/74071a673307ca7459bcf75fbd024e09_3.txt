Review of paper 477 "A Screening Rule for l1-Regularized Ising Model Estimation"
This paper introduces a straightforward closed-form screening rule for l1-regularized Ising model estimation. Specifically, the authors establish (in Theorem 1) a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees the blockwise solution of the l1-regularized maximum likelihood estimation matches the full l1-regularized maximum likelihood solution. This result is derived from the KKT conditions for the l1-regularized MLE and stands out for its elegance, both in terms of conceptual simplicity and the clarity of its proof. The authors also highlight the remaining challenges, namely that while the NP-hard problem is reduced to smaller-dimensional subproblems, these subproblems remain NP-hard. Thus, the work represents meaningful progress in the right direction.
In summary, this is an elegant contribution that merits publication in NIPS.
A suggestion:
1. How does hyperparameter tuning (specifically determining \lambda) impact this approach? If one sweeps through \lambda, for sufficiently small values of \lambda, only a single block might be identified, potentially negating the computational savings. Providing some clarification on this point would strengthen the paper.
