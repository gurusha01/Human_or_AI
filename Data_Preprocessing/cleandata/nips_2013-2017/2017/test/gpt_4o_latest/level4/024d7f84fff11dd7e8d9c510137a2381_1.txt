This paper investigates the application of an accelerated variant of the min-sum algorithm, referred to as min-sum splitting, to address the distributed consensus problem. The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, with the contribution effectively contextualized within the current state of the art in this field. Based on my understanding (though I do not claim to be an expert in this specific area), the results appear to be novel and represent a significant qualitative advancement. Notably, the paper introduces an innovative connection between min-sum algorithms and lifted Markov chain techniques.
However, there is one aspect of the presentation that lacks clarity. On page 4, the authors describe the equivalent objective function minimized by the min-sum algorithm to derive the min-sum splitting scheme, stating: "...splitting each term $\phi{vw}$ into $\Gamma{vw}$ terms, and each term $\phiv$ into $\delta$ terms,..." This explanation is ambiguous, as $\delta$ and $\Gamma{vw}$ are defined on the preceding page as real numbers, making it unclear what is meant by "splitting" in this context.
