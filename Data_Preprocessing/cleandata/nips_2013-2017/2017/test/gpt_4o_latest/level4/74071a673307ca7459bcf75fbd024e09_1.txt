The author(s) propose a screening rule for identifying block structures in the Ising model. When combined with either exact or inexact optimization procedures, this screening rule has the potential to enable scalable parameter estimation for the Ising model. I have the following observations regarding the proposed approach:
(1) Block structure identification can also be achieved using methods such as spectral clustering or regularized spectral clustering. Once the block structure is identified, exact or inexact optimization can similarly be applied. How does the proposed screening procedure compare to performing eigenvalue decomposition on a graph Laplacian in terms of effectiveness or computational efficiency?
(2) The second-moment-based screening rule introduced here appears to share similarities with the screening rules proposed in Witten et al. (2011) and Mazumder & Hastie (2012). Could the authors elaborate on how their approach differs from or aligns with these existing methods in the literature?
(3) How robust is the block-wise parameterization of $\theta$? If the true $\theta$ lacks a block structure, could the initial screening rule result in inaccurate parameter estimation?
