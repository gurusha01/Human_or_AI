Review - Summary
The manuscript investigates contextual bandits with N arms, where in each round, the learner observes a context \( x{ti} \) for each arm, selects an arm to pull, and receives a reward \( r{ti} \).
The central question revolves around the structure to impose on the rewards. The authors highlight two common formulations:
1. \( \mathbb{E}[r{ti}] = \langle x{ti}, \theta \rangle \), which supports faster learning but has limited capacity.
2. \( \mathbb{E}[r{ti}] = \langle x{ti}, \theta_i \rangle \), which offers greater capacity but slower learning.
This paper explores a middle ground between these extremes, generalized through kernelization. 
The core idea is to enhance the context space such that the learner observes \( (z{ti}, x{ti}) \), where \( z_{ti} \) belongs to an additional space \( Z \). A kernel is then defined on this augmented space to measure context similarity and determine the extent of information sharing across arms.
Contribution
The primary contribution appears to be the proposal to augment the context space in this manner. The regret analysis utilizes standard techniques.
Novelty
While there is some novelty in the augmentation approach, it seems limited. If my understanding is correct, the analysis by Valko et al. could be directly applied to the augmented contexts with similar guarantees. Thus, the augmentation itself seems to be the main novel aspect.
Impact
The potential impact of this work is uncertain. The theoretical contribution is modest, while the practical experiments, though appreciated, are not particularly compelling. For instance, the omission of comparisons with linear Thompson sampling leaves a gap in the experimental evaluation.
Correctness
I reviewed the proofs in the supplementary material only briefly, but the regret bounds appear to pass basic plausibility checks.
Overall
This paper feels borderline in terms of acceptance. My score could improve if the authors can convincingly demonstrate that their theoretical results provide more substantial insights than those derived from the analysis in Valko et al.
Other Comments
- Line 186: The assumption that after time \( t \), \( n_{a,t} = t/N \) is entirely unjustified. How meaningful are the conclusions based on this assumption?  
- It is unfortunate that the analysis could not be extended to Algorithm 1. I assume the sup-"blah blah" algorithms are not practically viable? It would be helpful to include a figure showing their regret relative to Algorithm 1. These issues warrant further attention, though I recognize the inherent difficulty of the problem.
Minors
- Capitalize \( A_t \) and other random variables for consistency.  
- Line 49: Replace "one estimate" with "one estimates."  
- Line 98: Clarify \( za \) as \( za \in \mathcal{Z} \).  
- Line 110: The use of \( t_a \) as a set dependent on \( t \) and \( a \) feels unconventional.  
- Line 114: The excessive use of primes is distracting.  
- Ensure a noise assumption (e.g., bounded or sub-Gaussian) is explicitly stated for the rewards. Did I miss this?  
- Line 135: The augmented context here is also \( (a, x_a) \).
