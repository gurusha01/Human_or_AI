This paper examines the support recovery performance of the PHT algorithm proposed by Jain et al. While Jain et al.'s work primarily focused on estimation error within the PHT family, the present paper seeks to extend the analysis to support recovery performance.
The technical contributions of the paper appear to be sound. However, it is not entirely clear how the techniques employed here differ from those in [4]. I would be open to revising my rating if the authors can clarify this distinction.
The paper's presentation requires significant improvement:  
- There are numerous typos throughout the manuscript, and a thorough proofreading pass is necessary.  
- The title of the paper is grammatically incorrect. It seems the authors intended "Towards a Unified Analysis of Support Recovery." The phrase "a towards unified analysis" also appears elsewhere in the manuscript and is incorrect.  
- In the abstract, the authors refer to \(\kappa\) as "THE condition number," but it is unclear for some time which condition number is being referenced. This should be revised to something like "where \(\kappa\) is an appropriate condition number," as the authors likely do not wish to formally define it in the abstract.
