The paper investigates the influence maximization problem within the context of a non-submodular model, diverging from the conventional submodularity assumption. The problem addressed is novel and presents significant challenges. Nonetheless, the paper has the following shortcomings: First, the \varepsilon-AS assumption lacks persuasiveness, and supporting data analysis would strengthen its validity. Second, the proofs are hard to follow, and providing intuitive explanations accompanied by examples is essential to enhance their clarity.
