The influence maximization problem is known to be P-hard in general. A greedy algorithm can achieve a constant-factor approximation when the local influence functions (and, as shown by Mossel and Roch [8], the global influence function) are submodular. This paper explores the extent to which influence can be approximated when the local influence functions are not strictly submodular but only approximately submodular. Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that even if only a sublinear fraction of the nodes exhibit approximate submodularity, the influence function becomes inapproximable in polynomial time. This result is established through the construction of a specific example that "amplifies" the effects of non-submodularity, leading to a non-approximable influence function. On the other hand, the authors show that when only a constant number of nodes are approximately submodular, a constant-factor approximation is achievable, and they propose an algorithm to achieve this.
The paper addresses a compelling problem and provides significant theoretical insights. The algorithm proposed in the latter part of the paper is supported by simulation results. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
