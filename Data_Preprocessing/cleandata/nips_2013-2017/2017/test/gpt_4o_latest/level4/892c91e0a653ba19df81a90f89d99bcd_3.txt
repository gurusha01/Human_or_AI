This paper introduces a straightforward and practical method for active learning, termed the Adept algorithm, which identifies visual stimuli that optimize a population cost function. The proposed approach is both elegant and intuitive. The methodology is primarily framed around the challenge of selecting experimental conditions in scenarios where the experimenter must decide which stimuli to present based on neural recordings from a specific region, with Adept adaptively determining the next set of images to display. Pretrained convolutional neural networks were employed to predict responses to unknown stimuli using kernel methods, leveraging a set of underlying features via Nadaraya-Watson regression. The first experiment utilized synthetic data generated from a separate CNN, while the second, more compelling experiment involved a feedback loop where stimuli were presented to macaques with neural recordings from V4. This experiment demonstrated an average 20% improvement in mean neuronal response to the selected stimuli.
- The method does not address variability in neural responses. It would be valuable to explore comparisons under different noise models.
