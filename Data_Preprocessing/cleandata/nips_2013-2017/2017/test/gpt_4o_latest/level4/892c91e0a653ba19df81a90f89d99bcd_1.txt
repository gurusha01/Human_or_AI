The authors propose an algorithm, Adept, for selecting stimuli in closed-loop experiments with the goal of maximizing variance in neural population firing. This represents a significant advancement in closed-loop stimulus selection, which has traditionally concentrated on characterizing the response properties of individual neurons. The algorithm leverages pre-computed stimulus features, derived from a neural network, to predict firing rates for novel stimuli. The methods are well-explained, and the stimulus selection process is computationally efficient enough to be practical for real-world experimental applications.
However, there are some limitations to the Adept method (potentially addressable in future work). As acknowledged by the authors, the algorithm's applicability is constrained by the need for a robust set of features to describe the stimulus space. Such features may not always be readily available outside specific domains, such as V4. It would be insightful to investigate the algorithm's performance when the chosen features inadequately capture the basis for predicting spike ratesâ€”particularly for subsets of the neural population. For instance, would the algorithm perform worse than random stimulus selection for those neurons?  
Additionally, the algorithm is restricted to a predefined, discrete set of stimuli. Lastly, it remains unclear how the stimulus selection process might be influenced by various types of noise, especially correlated noise across neurons or over time, in the recorded responses.
