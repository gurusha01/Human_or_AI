Review - Summary  
This paper introduces a novel GRU-based architecture tailored for precipitation nowcasting, a task that can be framed as a video prediction problem with a fixed camera perspective. Additionally, the authors present a new benchmarking framework for precipitation nowcasting and assess their model's performance on this benchmark as well as a modified version of the moving MNIST dataset.
Technical Quality  
This is a solid application-focused paper, and the proposed architecture is quite intriguing. However, for completeness, I would have appreciated comparisons with LSTM-based networks and fully connected RNNs. That said, the authors have already included a well-rounded selection of baseline models, which is commendable.
Clarity  
The paper is generally well-structured and easy to read. While the explanation of the ConvGRU is straightforward and clear, the description of the proposed TrajGRU is more challenging to follow. The key innovation in the new model involves replacing state-to-state convolutions/multiplications with a transformation that appears to be a specialized version of the module described by Jaderberg et al. (2015) (reference 10 in the paper). However, it is unclear how the structure-generating network gamma produces the flow fields U and V. A more explicit explanation of this process, along with a clearer emphasis on how it differs from Jaderberg et al.'s transformation module, would enhance clarity. Nonetheless, the purpose of the trajectory selection mechanism is sufficiently clear to maintain the coherence of the narrative.
Novelty  
Although the overall architecture resembles the ConvLSTM and the paper leans toward an application-oriented focus, the concept of learning trajectories using spatial transformer-inspired modules strikes me as quite original.
Significance  
The proposed dataset appears to be a valuable benchmark, though I lack sufficient expertise in precipitation nowcasting to fully evaluate its utility. Similarly, I am not well-versed in the state-of-the-art for this domain to thoroughly assess the reported performance improvements. Since the benchmark is newly introduced, its significance may become clearer over time. The work would have been more robust with an additional comparison on an existing precipitation nowcasting benchmark. Nevertheless, the idea of learning sparsely connected temporal trajectories could have broader applicability in other domains where high-dimensional distributions exhibit independence properties and redundancy.
Pros:  
- Innovative model design  
- Comprehensive baselines and practical evaluation  
- Generally well-written paper  
Cons:  
- The model's description and motivation are somewhat brief and difficult to follow.  
- The novelty is somewhat incremental compared to ConvGRU/LSTM.  
EDIT: The authors' rebuttal addressed several of my initial concerns, and the additional experiments they provided have improved the overall quality of the paper. As a result, I have raised my score.
