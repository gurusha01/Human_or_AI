Review - Summary:
The paper introduces an architecture for generating images of a person by combining the appearance of a person from an input image with a specified input pose (represented via heat maps).
Strengths:
+ The proposed task is innovative.  
+ Introduction of a novel two-stage coarse-to-fine architecture.  
+ The paper is well-written and clear.  
+ While the results exhibit some noticeable artifacts, they are nonetheless promising.  
+ Comprehensive evaluation of design choices.  
Weaknesses:
- The quantitative evaluation is relatively weak; however, this is understandable (and not a significant drawback) given the lack of suitable evaluation metrics for the task.  
Comments:
Considering the iterative refinement nature of the proposed architecture, it would be beneficial to include references to recent work on iterative refinement using cascaded networks in the related work section, such as [a, b]:  
[a] J. Carreira, P. Agrawal, K. Fragkiadaki, and J. Malik. Human pose estimation with iterative error feedback. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.  
[b] A. Newell, K. Yang, and J. Deng. Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.  
- Line 110: "we find that using residual blocks as basic component improves the generation performance." Could you clarify in what specific way the performance is improved? Please elaborate.  
Although the evaluation is generally thorough, I am curious about how the Stage 2 network would perform if it were directly provided with the inputs for Stage 1 and trained adversarially. Is the blurring observed in the Stage 1 + GAN results attributable to the intermediate fully connected layer?  
Overall Rating:
Given the novelty of the problem and the proposed approach, I confidently recommend the paper for acceptance.  
Rebuttal:
While I appreciate the authors' effort to conduct a user study, its preliminary nature makes it unconvincing, and I have chosen to discount it in my evaluation. The authors are strongly encouraged to include a more substantive human evaluation in their revision. Nevertheless, my positive assessment of the work remains unchanged.
