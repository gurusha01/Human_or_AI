This paper analyzes the support recovery performance of the PHT algrorithm of Jain et al. While in Jain et al.'s paper the main focus (at least with respect to the PHT family) was estimation error, the current paper aims to extend this to support recovery performance. 
The technical contribution of the paper appears sound to me. However, its not entirely clear how different the techniques are to those used in [4]. I am willing to revise my rating if the authors can make this more clear. 
The presentation of the paper needs improvement. 
- There are several typos throughout. A thorough pass needs to be made. 
- The title of the paper is grammatically incorrect -- perhaps the authors meant "Towards a Unified Analysis of Support Recovery". This phrase "a towards unified analysis" is used in other places in the manuscript, and its incorrect. 
- In the abstract the authors use \kappa and say that it is THE condition number, while it is unclear for a while which condition number it is. This should be replaced by something like "where \kappa is an approporiate condition number", since the authors probably dont want to introduce the formal definition in the abstract.
