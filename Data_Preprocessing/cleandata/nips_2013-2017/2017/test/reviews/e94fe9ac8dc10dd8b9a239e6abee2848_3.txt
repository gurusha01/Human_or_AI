This paper considers the problem of approximating matrices when no clear metric is present on the data and the l_0 norm is used (the number of non-zero elements in the difference between the original data and the approximation).
A low-rank solution is proposed.
The paper doesn't seem to give a practical case where this is useful.
In fact, "low rank" implies some linearity and hence implicitly a metric, which lay not make a lot of sense if we can't interprete the data with a metric to start with. E.g., for k=1 one can easily make the first row and then one element in each other row of A-A' equal to zero (so 2n-1 elements), but then predicting linearly the values of the other elements seems arbitrarily.
Also, if the elements in A are continuous variables drawn from a distribution with no linear properties, the probability that for any low rank approximation A' more than these minimal number of elements of A-A' can be made equal to exactly zero (the requirement of the l_0 norm) is equal to 0.
In that sense, if the data is drawn randomly from a continuous distribution, with very high probability, OPT^{(k)} is something like (n-k)(m-k). If k is "low", then theorems as Theorem 2 talking about multiples of OPT^{(k)} are rather trivial (because O(k^2) OPT^{(k)} > 2.OPT^{(k)} > mn) for "random" data.
So maybe the problem is to "discover" that by some external cause the data is very close already to low rank, in the sense that a lot of elements happen to match exactly the linear low rank relation to other elements.
In amongst others line 272, the authors too indicate that the work is most interesting if A is already close to low rank.
The mathematical elaboration and randomized algorithms are quite interesting from a theory point of view.
Moving some details to the supplementary material, and making a consistent story connecting the presented algorithms to clear learning problems, could make this a nice paper.
Some details:
* Line 48: supplementary -> supplementary material
* Line 244: having two times "w.h.p." in the same statement is not really necessary (but could be a compact way to present the result).
