This paper develops a GAN-type system to generate a novel-view person images guided by a target skeleton (represented as keypoints). The system contains mostly known techniques such as DCGANs, U-nets, so the contribution is about the specific computer vision application. 
Pros:
* The proposed idea is interesting, the writing is easy to follow, and empirical experiments show that it is able to synthesize images that are realistic-looking at some level.
Cons:
* As this work is application oriented, it is important to achieve good results. My main complain is 
	 there is no quantitative evaluation. For example, is it possible to organize user studies to evaluate how many times the generated images can trick human eyes.
	 the empirical results are not visually appealing. Take fig.1 for example, the generated images are too small to see. Even this way, there are many noticeable visual errors when comparing the results to the targets. It is thus a bit discouraging to conclude that the results so far are of good quality or close to real images. The same issue stays for almost all the results including the supplementary figures. Personally I feel the authors are at the right direction and the work is promising, while it is yet to stop and declare victory at this stage.
After rebuttal:
I am still not convinced after reading the authors' feedback. In particular, it has also been pointed by other reviewers that there are still issues regarding quantitative as well as qualitative results, all is important for such a practical oriented work. The rebuttal shows some attempts but they still do not address these concerns to a satisfied degree. I feel it may not be ready to be well presented in a venue like NIPS.
