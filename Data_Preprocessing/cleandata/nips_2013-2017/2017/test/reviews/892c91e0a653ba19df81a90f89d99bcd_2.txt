An interesting method to speed up experiemntal design to reveal neural coding. The idea of using CNN to quantify stimulus similarity is interesting, but it also raises a paradox issue: if a CNN is able accurately predict the statistics of neuronal responses (such as in V4), then we do not have to do the experiment anymore, since analyzing the CNN data can tell us everything; on the other hand, if the CNN only partially or mistakenly measures the stimulus similarity that should be observed in the brain area recorded, then this mismatch will affect the experimental result. It would be interesting to see how this issue can be solved. But overall, this is a good attemp and is acceptable by NIPS.
