This paper makes novel contributions in the following two aspects: proposing a new dataset for nowcasting (if the dataset goes public, the reviewer is not able to find such a claim in the paper though) and applying the idea from 'Spatial Transformer Network' in a convRNN setup to predict the next few frames given a recent history.
The introduction is well written, and the problem is well motivated. The rest of paper is clearly structured, but with following two points that are less satisfactory: 
1. The use of \mathcal{U}t, and \mathcal{V}t and their corresponding \gamma function deserves much more detailed discussion as, according to the rest of the paper, this is the only technical difference from the Spatial Transformer Network where a 2*3 affine transformation matrix is learned instead. It is quite unclear why such scheme is abandoned and resorted to continuous optical flow.
2. The experiments are to some certain degree convincing. The measured difference are often statistically not significant (my guess as a reviewer as no confidence interval is given). In addition, as baselines, Conv3Ds often underperform Conv2Ds, which the reviewer finds strange given the nature of the problem. 
The reviewer would like the authors to properly address my above concerns to revise the feedback. 
Addition: The author feedback helps to resolve my questions.
