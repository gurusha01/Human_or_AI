The paper studies the problem of l0-Low rank approximation in which the goal is to approximate an input matrix A (m\times n) with a rank-k matrix A' whose entry-wise l0 distance is minimum. The paper provides the first biceriteria approximation algorithm for this problem: for any k > 1 in poly(mn), provide a rank O(k\log(mn)) such that ||A-A'||0 \leq poly(k log(mn)) \times OPTk where OP_k denotes the closets rank-k matrix to A.
Moreover, they provide a (2+\eps)-approx for the case k=1 in sublinear time and further provide an algorithm for the case of binary matrices which seem to be more applicable in practice. However, the approximation ratio depends on the value of optimal solution and works well when OPT is O(||A||_0). The ratio makes the result a bit questionable.
The problem theoretically seems natural and standard; however, its application is not well-motivated. The paper also lacks experiments and solid explanation of the application of problem in practice. The results are clean and standard. However, there are some assumptions for which not sufficient evidences have been provided:
•	Why do they need to have the assumption that sum of rows and column can be accessed in O(m+n)? (lines 138-140). Assuming ||A||0 and the adj list access you can easily compute them. Apparently, it is required for Theorem 13 and 14 where one can spend ||A||0 in running time and compute them and still achieve the same running time guarantees.
•	The conjecture or the inapproximability result for Boolean l_0 rank-1 seems strong without any evidence.
Minor comments:
•	Line 31: rank-k -> rank-$k$
•	Line 33: min(mn^2, mn^2) -> probably min(mn^2, m^2n)
•	Line 131-137: you can mention incident list access model which is a very natural access model in the area of sublinear time algorithms design
•	Line 168: S^(0) = [n]  S^(0) = [m]
•	Line 234: The -> we
To sum up, the paper has studied and interesting theoretical problem and provides reasonable progress on that. However, its applicability in practice is not well supported.
