Review of paper 477 "A Screening Rule for l1-Regularized Ising Model Estimation"
This paper presents a simple closed-from screening for
l1-regularized Ising model estimation. Specifically, the authors
prove (in Theorem 1) a necessary and sufficient condition that
ensures that blockwise solution of the l1-regularized maximum
likelihood estimation is identical the complete l1-regularized
maximum likelihood solution. This result is based on the KKT
conditions for the l1-regularized MLE and is elegant both in terms
of its simplicity and the simplicity of its proof. The authors also
discuss the challenges remaining, i.e., that the NP-hard problem is
now reduced to a set of lower dimension yet still NP-hard problems.
Hence, making progress in the right direction.
Overall, an elegant result worthy of publication in NIPS.
A thought:
1. How does the hyper parameter tuning (finding \lambda) affect
this problem? If one scans through lambda, then for low enough
values of \lambda only one block can be found and the computation
time will not be reduced. Some clarification would be helpful.
