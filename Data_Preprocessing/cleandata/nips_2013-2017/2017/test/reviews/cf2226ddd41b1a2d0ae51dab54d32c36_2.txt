This paper studies influence maximization in the general threshold diffusion model, specifically when node threshold functions are almost submodular (or epsilon-submodular). The key results are: 1) a proof of inapproximability for the influence maximization problem under this model when there are sufficiently many epsilon-submodular threshold nodes; 2) an efficient, simple and principled approximation algorithm for this problem when there is some fixed number of epsilon-submodular threshold nodes.
 This is a strong paper for the following reasons:
 1- Influence maximization under the General Threshold model is a challenging and poorly studied problem;
 2- The epsilon-submodularity condition is very reasonable because it is consistent with empirical evidence in real diffusion processes;
 3- The hardness result and the approximate algorithms are intuitive and non-trivial.
 Barring minor typos and the like (see below for details), the paper is very well-written. In my understanding, the technical proofs are correct. The experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing, and the results are consistent with the theoretical guarantees.
 Minor comments (by line):
 102: shouldn't the equation right-hand side have 1/(1-\epsilon) instead of (1-\epsilon)?
 237: "linear" instead of "liner"
 241: "satisfying" instead of "satisfies"
 262: "PageRank" instead of "PagrRank"
 297: "compared to 2.05" instead of "while 2.05"
 298: "spread" instead of "spreads"
 299: "The more $\epsilon$-AS nodes there are in the network, the more improvement is obtained"
