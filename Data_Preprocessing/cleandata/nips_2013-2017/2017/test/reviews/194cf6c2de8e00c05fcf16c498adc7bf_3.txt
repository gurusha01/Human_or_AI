The paper proposes a new approach to the study of eye movements. The authors correctly summarize the current state of the art (as far as I understand it, but I admit from the outset I am not an expert in perception or eye movements). Basically these approaches are based on a saliency map that is defined over an image and fixations points are selected in a optimization/maximization approach. This model (EYMOL) works according to a different assumption and instead is defined directly on trajectories of gaze according to a "Least Action Principle." The details of some of the math were beyond my ability to evaluate because I don't have the necessary physics background (particularly the extensive appendix). However, even still I was able to understand the key elements of the approach and how it differs from past models. The model is helpfully applied to real data set of eye-movements and is compared against a variety of alternative models. While it doesn't dominate on every measure, the results are favorable for the new approach and demonstrate that it has some validity.
I think the paper might be of interest to some people in the vision science community (e.g., attendees of VSS). I'm not quite as convinced this makes a great contribution to NIPS, however I think that should be evaluated against other reviewer's opinions who are more expert. I think it likely advances a new and interesting theory that could inspire further empirical research, and so has both novelty and merit for perception sciences.
