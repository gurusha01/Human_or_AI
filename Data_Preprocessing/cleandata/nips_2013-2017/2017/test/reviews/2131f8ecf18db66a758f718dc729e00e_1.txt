The authors study a clustering model where the learner is allowed to ask queries from an oracle and the goal is to find the target clustering. The queries can be same-cluster queries [or more generally, a fixed binary-valued function of the label of the input instances]. The authors study the query complexity of such models. 
The query-based clustering model is a well-motivated and relatively recent research area, with applications in record-deduplication, crowdsourcing, etc. The authors study the problem from the information theoretic perspective. In particular, they provide upper and lower bounds on the number of required queries to perfectly (or approximately) recover the target clustering. They also consider the case that the oracle is noisy. The information-theoretic tools that they use are interesting and new to ML community.
Because no structural assumption is made about the problem (e.g., having a hypothesis class, etc.) the analysis is limited. In fact, the marginal distribution of the labels is the main parameter that the bounds are based on (aside from the noise level). Therefore, the studied setting is a bit far from the usual settings studied in learning theory. However, this is a first step, and can help in understanding the information-theoretic aspects of query-based clustering, especially the related lower-bounds.
