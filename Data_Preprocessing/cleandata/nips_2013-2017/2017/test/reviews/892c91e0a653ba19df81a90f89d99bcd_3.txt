This paper developed a simple and practical method for active learning (the Adept algorithm) a visual stimuli that maximizes a population cost function. The approach is elegant and intuitive. The technique was primarily discussed through the importance of choosing experimental conditions for experiments in which the experimenter must choose which kind of stimuli to present given a particular area of neural recording, and that Adept can adaptively find images to show next. Pretrained convolutional neural networks were used to estimate the response of unknown stimuli using kernel methods with a set of underlying features using Nadaraya-Watson regression. The first experiment used synthetic data from a separate CNN. The second, more interesting example performed a feedback experiment by showing stimuli to macaque's while recording in V4, and was able to see an average 20% higher mean response from neurons with chosen stimuli.
- The approach doesn't account for variability in the response. It would be interesting to see comparison under different noise models.
