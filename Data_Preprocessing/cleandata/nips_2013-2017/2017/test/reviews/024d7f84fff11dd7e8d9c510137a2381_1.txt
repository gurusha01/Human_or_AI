This paper applies an accelerated variant of the min-sum algorithm, called min-sum splitting, to the distributed consensus problem. The paper is very well written, with the contribution clearly placed in the context of the state of the art in the topic. To the best of my knowledge (although I am not an expert on the topic), the results are novel and constitute a qualitative advance. In particular, the paper presents a novel connection between min-sum algorithms and lifted Markov chain techniques.
There is a detail which is not clear in the presentation. In page 4, when describing the equivalent objective function that is minimized by the min-sum algorithm to yield the min-sum splitting scheme, the authors write: "...splitting each term $\phi{vw}$ into $\Gamma{vw}$ terms, and each term $\phiv$ into $\delta$ terms,..." However, it is not clear what this means, since $\delta$ and $\Gamma{vw}$, as introduced on the previous page are real numbers.
