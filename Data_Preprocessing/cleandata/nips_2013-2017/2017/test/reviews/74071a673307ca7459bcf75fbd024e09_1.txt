The author(s) present a screening rule for block structure identification in Ising model. This screening rule combined with exact or inexact optimization procedure can lead to scalebale parameter estimation in Ising model. I have following thoughts on the proposed approach-
(1) Finding a block structure can also be done by using spectral clustering or regularized spectral clustering. Once the block structure is recovered then the exact or inexact optimization can be carried out there as well. How different (or may be effective) the screening procedure compared to a eigenvalue decomposition on a graph Laplacian?
(2) The second moment screening rule procedure proposed here is similar to the screening rule proposed in Witten et al. (2011) and Mazumder & Hastie (2012). How different/similar is the current approach with the existing ones in the literature?
(3) How robust is the block wise parametrization of $theta$ is? If the true $\theta$ does not have a block structure is the initial screening rule could lead to inaccurate parameter estimation?
