Summary. This paper studies support recovery of the partial hard thresholding algorithm, and have derived, under certain conditions, the iteration complexity of the partial hard thresholding algorithm.
Quality. There seems no explicit description about the condition under which the PHT(r) algorithm terminates, which makes the statement of Proposition 1 difficult to understand.
It would have been better if concrete arguments on specific problem examples were given. They are presented only in a very brief and abstract manner in the last paragraph of Section 2. In particular, if nonzeros in \bar{x} are distributed according to a distribution without discontinuity at x=0, then xmin should scale as O(1/n), so that it should become difficult to satisfy the xmin condition when n is large.
COMMENT AFTER REBUTTAL: In the above, I should have written that x_min should scale as O(1/d). I am pretty sorry for my careless mistake.
Clarity. I think that the description of the simulations is so brief that one cannot relate the simulation setups with the theoretical results. More concretely, the function F(x) adopted in the simulations should be explicitly stated, as well as the condition numbers and other parameters appearing in the theoretical results. Of interest also would be whether the 10,000 iterations are sufficient with regard to the theoretical guarantees. Also, nonzeros of the signals are generated as Gaussians, so that x_min values vary from trial to trial, as well as the s values specified.
Lemma 4 and Theorem 5 in the main text appear in the supplementary material as Lemma 19 and Theorem 20 without explicit statement that they are the same.
Originality. I think that this work would be moderately original, in that it seems that it has extended the existing arguments on support recovery via hard thresholding to partial hard thresholding, which would certainly be non-trivial.
Significance. Since the partial hard thresholding includes the conventional hard thresholding as well as what is called the orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement as special cases, the theoretical support-recovery guarantees for the partial hard thresholding algorithm presented here should be of significance.
