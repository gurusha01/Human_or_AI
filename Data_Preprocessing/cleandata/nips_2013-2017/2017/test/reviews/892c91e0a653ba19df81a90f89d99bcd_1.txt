The authors present an algorithm for selecting stimuli in a closed-loop experiment to maximize the variance in firing across a population of neurons (Adept). This is an important step in closed-loop stimulus selection, which have focused on learning the response properties of single neurons. The algorithm uses pre-computed features of the stimuli given by a neural network to predict firing rates to new stimuli. The methods were presented clearly and the stimulus selection is efficient enough to be useful to real experiments.
There are a few limiting points of the Adept method (which may be addressed in future work). The applicability of this algorithm is limited, as mentioned by the authors, in that it depends on having a good set of features to describe the stimulus space. Such features may not always be available outside select areas such as V4. It would be valuable to explore the Adept algorithm's behavior when the features chosen do not provide a good basis for prediction spike rates (perhaps for only a portion of the population - would the algorithm learn less for those cells than random stimulus selection?).
Additionally, the algorithm assumes a limited discrete set of stimuli. Finally, it is not clear how the stimulus selection may be affected by different types of noise (in particular, correlated noise across cells or time) in the responses.
