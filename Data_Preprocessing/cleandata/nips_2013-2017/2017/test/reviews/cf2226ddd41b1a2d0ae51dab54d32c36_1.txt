The paper studies the influence maximization problem under the non-submodular model. The work differs from the traditional sub-modularity assumption. The problem is new and challenging. However, the paper has the following weakness: First, the \varepsilon-AS assumption is not convincing. I'd like to see data analysis to support the assumption. Second, the proofs are difficult to read. Intuitive explanations with examples are necessary to support the proofs.
