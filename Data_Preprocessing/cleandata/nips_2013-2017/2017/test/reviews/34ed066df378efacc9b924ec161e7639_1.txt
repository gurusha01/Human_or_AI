Summary:
The paper proposes an architecture for generating a images containing a person that combines the appearance of a person in an input image and a specified input pose (using heat maps).
Strengths:
+ the proposed task is novel
+ novel two stage coarse-to-fine architecture
+ well written
+ while the results contain discernible artifacts, they are promising
+ extensive evaluation of design decisions
Weaknesses:
- the quantitative evaluation is generally weak; this is understandable (and not a major weakness) given that no suitable evaluation metrics exist
Comments:
Given the iterative refinement nature of the proposed architecture, it is suggested that some recent work on iterative refinement using cascaded networks be included in the related work, e.g., [a,b]:
[a] J. Carreira, P. Agrawal, K. Fragkiadaki, and J. Malik. H man pose estimation with iterative error feedback. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.
[b] A. Newell, K. Yang, and J. Deng. Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.
- line 110: "we find that using residual blocks as basic component improves the generation performance" In what way? Please elaborate.
While the evaluation is generally extensive, I was left curious how using the Stage 2 network with the inputs for Stage 1 and trained adversarially would perform. Is the blurring observed with Stage 1 + GAN due to the intermediate fully connected layer?
Overall rating:
Based on the novelty of the problem and approach I am confidently recommending that the paper be accepted.
Rebuttal:
While this reviewer appreciates the attempt at a user study, given its very preliminary nature, I do not find it convincing and thus am discount it in my review rating. The authors are urged to include a substantive human evaluation in their revision. Nonetheless, my positive review of the work still stands.
