The paper proposes algorithms for finding a rank-k ell_0-minimizing approximation of a given matrix A. It gives approximation algorithms for the real case when p=1 and p > 1 and it also studies the boolean case. For all these cases the authors provide approximation algorithms (in some cases surprisingly sublinear) and in others bi-criteria approximations.
Strengths:
-- The algorithms are interesting and the proof techniques involved have some interesting twists.
-- The paper is well written.
Weakenesses:
-- The lack of experimental evaluation makes it hard to see the applicability of these algorithms in practical scenarios.
-- It would be interesting to reduce the space occupied for the extensive literature review and provide some experimental evaluation.
