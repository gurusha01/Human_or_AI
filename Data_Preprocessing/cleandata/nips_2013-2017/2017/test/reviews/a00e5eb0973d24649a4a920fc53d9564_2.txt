This paper establishes a number of results concerning lower bounds for finite sum optimisation problems. Over the last 2 years a close to complete theory has been established, which this paper contributes further to. This is an important area of research in my opinion.
This paper is very well written and is more polished than most NIPS submissions. I don't have many comments:
• I'm not following the use of Fano's inequality in equation (10), could you please clarify?
• Should the last part of the equation between lines 134-135 be n^2/2 instead? I'm not following it.
• I can't find the definition of t^{*} in equation 13.
• I think the tilde is not used consistently when big-Omega notation is used in the paper.
• In definition 2, it would help if it's more clearly stated that \theta typically contains the function index. Currently you just have some text before the definition "the oracle may allow one to query about a specific individual function". 
• How does the result of section 3.2 relate to Theorem 2 in reference 4? Is it just a strengthening by the additional n term? . The result of section 3.3 is also closely related to results in that paper. In the introduction you state that you improve on the results in [4], I think the exact nature of the improvement needs to be more clearly stated.
