Influence maximization is a P hard problem to solve in general. A greedy algorithm is successful in giving a constant fraction approximate solution when the local influence functions (and by Mossel, Roche [8], also the global influence function) is submodular. This paper investigates the question of how well can one approximate influence if the local influence functions are not exactly submodular, but approximately submodular. Somewhat surprisingly, even when a only a sublinear fraction of the nodes are approximately submodular, the influence function cannot be approximated well in polynomial time. The authors establish this result by constructing a special example which "amplifies" the non-submodularity and gives rise to a non-approximable influence function. Furthermore the authors show that if only a constant number of nodes are approximately submodular, it is possible to obtain a constant fraction approximation, and the authors propose an algorithm to do the same.
The paper considers a very interesting problem and has interesting theoretical results. The effectiveness of the algorithm in latter half of the paper is backed by simulations. I recommend this paper be accepted.
