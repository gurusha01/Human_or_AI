Multitask Spectral Learning of Weighted Automata
The paper proposes an approach to estimate a common representation of multiple weighted finite automata (WFA), via multitask spectral learning. To do so, the multitask problem is formulated as novel vector-valued WFAs, from which a joint feature space is extracted using spectra learning. The method is evaluated in synthetic (randomly generated WFAs) and real data (task-related learning using 33 languages), where the multitask approach is shown to outperform single task learning. This paper appears to be a first attempt to the multitask approach for WFAs.
One major comment is perhaps a somewhat weaker description of the context and motivation. The approach is immediately presented with a spectral learning (SL) of WFAs, without spending too much time on when, where and why SL-WFA is used, in what context - nor on referencing the advantages and limitations of other competing algorithms in that context. A small related work section is provided, but may not be enough convincing on why the proposed approach is better. The evaluation is also comparing SL-WFAs against (M)SL-WFAs. This is nice to evaluate single vs multi-task, but give no information on why one should use the proposed approach, ML-SL, over other methods. 
The paper, however, presents a nice methodology for estimating a joint feature maps, with potential applications where finite-state machines are used (language-related tasks are illustrated). The methodology is well supported with upper bound conditions and an analysis on computational complexity.
