The paper extends a saddle point derivative of the SVRG algorithm to the case of entropy regularization (rather than Euclidean). The algorithm is applied to the problem of adversarial prediction, where the authors simplify the objective function so that it can be solved efficiently. The algorithm is then evaluated experimentally.
The only comment that I have about the paper is its presentation and writing. It seems the authors have tried to cram a lot of material into such a short paper. This makes the paper hard-to-follow at times and its reading tiresome.
Nonetheless, the contributions are novel albeit straight-forward, and as such I suggest its acceptance.
