The paper considers online convex optimization with constraints revealed in an online manner. In an attempt to circumvent a linear regret lower bound by Mannor et al [17] for adaptively chosen constraints, the paper deals with the setting where constraints are themselves generated stochastically. As a side effect, superior results are obtained for related problems such as OCO with long-term constraints.
The paper does a nice job of introducing previous work and putting the contribution in perspective. The main algorithm of the paper is a first order online algorithm that performs an optimization step using the instantaneous penalty and constraint functions. The formulation is similar to the one that leads, for example, to the classical Zinkevich's OGD update rule except for a term that involves the new constraint functions introduced at that time step. The formulation also uses an adaptive time varying regularization parameter (called a "virtual queue" in the paper) for the constraint terms in the formulation. Indeed, as Lemma 1 indicates, the solving the formulation is equivalent to a projected gradient descent (PGD)-style step, with the notion of "gradient" now including the constraint function subgradients as well. The virtual queue values are updated to remain lower bounds on the total constraint violation incurred till now.
In terms of theoretical analysis, the arguments relating regret to drift etc seem routine. The most novel portion of the analysis seems to be the drift analysis and its adaptation to the ||Q(t)|| terms (Lemma 7). The paper reports one experimental use of the algorithm on a distributed job scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm is able to offer comparable throughput to a previously proposed approach called REACT while lowering costs by around 10%.
- It would be nice if the paper could clearly point out the challenges in extending the PGD framework to incorporate time varying constraints. It seems except for the drift analysis, the rest of the arguments are routine after proper choices have been made for virtual queue values etc.
- Please give some intuition on how was the form of the virtual queue values (equation 3) motivated. It seems to be a lower bound on the cumulative violation (or "backlog") but some intuition would much help.
- Do the results presented in the paper extend to online mirrored descent? I do not see any obvious hurdles but some comments would be nice.
- Experimental work is a bit sparse.
