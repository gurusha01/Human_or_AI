This paper considers online convex optimization with time varying constraints. The goal is to minimize the regret similar to standard online convex optimization setting, and at the same time keep the average violation of stochastic constraints well-bounded. The authors address the problem in both fixed and stochastic settings and under mild conditions on the constraints, obtain the optimal \sqrt{T} log T bounds on both regret and violation of constraints that improves upon the best known T^{3/4} bound on the violation of constraints. The authors conducted preliminary experiments on a stochastic job scheduler that complements their theoretical results.
The problem being dealt with is interesting and has proper motivation, though previous papers have dealt it with in the past, in one way or another, but this paper has shown a significant improvement over existing bounds on the regret and violation of constraints. The presentation of the paper was mostly clear. The claimed contributions are discussed in the light of existing results and the paper does survey related work appropriately. Regarding the quality of the writing, the paper is reasonably well written, the structure and language are good. The paper is technically sound and the proofs seem to be correct as far as I checked (I did not have enough time to carefully check the Appendix and just did few sanity checks, but definitely will take a careful look in rebuttal period). 
Overall, the problem dealt with consists of a new view to the online linear optimization with constraints that requires a new type of analysis. The exact setup of the feedback lacks motivation, but overall the idea of an analysis aimed to have long-term violation of constraints instead of expensive (and sometime impossible) projections in online learning is sufficiently interesting and motivated.
