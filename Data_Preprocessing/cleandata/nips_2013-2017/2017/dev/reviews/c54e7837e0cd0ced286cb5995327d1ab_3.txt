This work is an important contribution to improving SGD training of the Neural Networks.
One remark I would like to make:
Renormalizing moving-average affine transformation A(r,d) and the output affine transformation A(beta,gamma) form a composition which is also an affine transformation (see Algorithm 1, page 4). Therefore, one can "hide" (r,d) transformation inside the redefined (beta, gamma). Thus, the renormalization becomes a modification of the (beta,gamma) training algorithm.
