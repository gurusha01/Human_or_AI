The authors claim that the 1-bit mechanism for mean estimation is tuned for efficient communication. Is there any difference between the basic randomizer in [3] with one item and the 1-bit mechanism? If the protocol is equivalent to the basic randomizer in [3] in a specific setting, it should be clearly stated.

Please compare the utility in terms of n and d with existing histogram protocols.
Sec 3.1
It was unclear to me what privacy is guaranteed after alpha-point rounding. If a data collector reports her data repeatedly (say N times), the privacy budget should be set following the composition theorem. The alpha-point rounding introduces another random source into the responses and it certainly improves privacy to some extent, but the composition theorem still is applied as long as she responds to the data collector multiple times.
