I found this an interesting paper with strong technical results (although it is far from my areas of expertise, do I don't have high confidence in my review).
A few comments:
* Sections 3 and 4 feel a little bit disjointed - they are two very separate threads, and it feels like the paper lacks a little focus. Would it make sense to put section 4 first?
* The inclusion of the regularizer ||\theta||^2 in (10) is a little abrupt - not very well explained - more explanation/justification would be helpful.
* The application to LP boosting using entropy regularization would benefit from more discussion: how does the resulting algorithm compare to the methods introduced in the original paper?
