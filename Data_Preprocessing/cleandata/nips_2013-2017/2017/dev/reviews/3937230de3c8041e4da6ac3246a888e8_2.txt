This paper is not the first one that addresses variational autoencoders with external memory modules (which the authors falsely claim). For instance,
Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu, Bo Zhang, "Learning to Generate with Memory," Proc. ICML 2016
solve the same problem, in a match more potent way than this work (I reckon this method as a quite trivial extension of existing VAEs).
Since the authors have failed to identify all the related work, and properly compare to them, this paper certainly cannot be accepted to NIPS.
