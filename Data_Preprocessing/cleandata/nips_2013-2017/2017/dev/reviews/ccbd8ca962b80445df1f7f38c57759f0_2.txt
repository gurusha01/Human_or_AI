The authors present a memory-efficient, approximate implementation of the LiFE method for track filtering/reweighing in diffusion MRI. The LiFE method takes any input set of white matter fibre tracks and assigns each of them a weight such that their overall distribution matches the apparent fibre density in the diffusion MRI data. In the original work, this was described as a large non-negative least squares (NNLS) problem. In this work, the design matrix is approximated using discrete atoms associated with fibre orientation, enabling to cast the NNLS problem as a memory-efficient, sparse tensor representation. Performance of the approximation, as well as memory efficiency of the tensor encoding, are demonstrated in human brain data.
The paper is well-written and clear. The conclusions are supported by the data. The work is an important contribution, of interest to the diffusion MRI tractography community. I have only 2 points of criticism:
1. I disagree with the terminology "decomposition" and "factorization" in the title and throughout the text. This vocabulary is commonly associated with methods such as the singular value decomposition and nonnegative matrix factorization, in which a single matrix or tensor is represented as a linear combination of unknown matrices or tensors, computed simultaneously under certain constraints. In this work, matrix M and its sparse tensor representation D and Phi are precomputed as inputs to the method. At its core, LiFE(sd) is computing the remaining nonnegative weights, only one factor in the tensor representation.
2. The stick model only accounts for restricted, intra-axonal diffusion, ignoring hindered extra-cellular diffusion or free water compartments. Furthermore, the axial diffusivity seems to be fixed at 1 ms/um^2 in this work. How appropriate is this model and its fixed parameter value for these data? At what b-value was the data acquired and is this sufficiently high to assume that CSF and extra-cellular diffusion are sufficiently attenuated?
