This paper investigates connections between discrete and continuous approaches for decomposable submodular function minimization. The authors claim better theoretical time complexity bounds and experimental results on image segmentation. 
1.In line 73 of page 2, instead of saying "improves the worst-case complexity by a factor of r", it is better to clarify what the current state-of-art result is, what is the paper's contribution; otherwise, readers won't know the significant of your results.
2. In line 140 of page, the bounds contain the maximum value of the function. But this only makes sense when the function is integer-valued. The author should be clearer on this. Also, are these algorithms weakly polynomial or strongly polynomial? 
3. In line 144, it is better to notify the reader that when C_i is small ~O(1), r has to be no smaller than ~O(n). Also, how do you compare your results with the state-of-art submodular minimization running time?
4. In Corollary 3.4, what is the definition of epsilon-approximate? 
5 When introducing the algorithms, it is better to use \algorithm environments than using plain text.
