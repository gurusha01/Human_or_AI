This paper presents a natural extension of spectral methods for learning WFAs to
the multitask setting. The idea is quite simple, one can jointly train WFAs that
share the same underlying operators but that have different ending vectors. The
interpretation of this as sharing a latent (forward) space among different tasks
seems sound. I found the paper self contained, clear and easy to read. 
Although the idea is quite simple if one is familiar with spectral learning of WFAs, I am quite confident it is novel. I believe this is a nice contribution. My one criticism is that the proposed notion of relatedness might be too strong to be
useful in real learning problems. It would be nice if the authors could discuss
ways in which this notion of relatedness could be relaxed.
