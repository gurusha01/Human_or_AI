This work describes an extension of the hyperalignment (HA) method,
i.e. functional alignment across subjects. This extension directly
addresses some limitations of previous HA methods in the literature:
nonlinearity, scalability and high-dimensionality. The proposed
method, called deep hyperalignment (DHA), defines the objective
function to minimize by reformulating the HA objective function in
terms of multiple stacked layers of nonlinear transformations with a
(multi-layer) kernel function. The objective function is reformulated
in terms of templates and then eigendecomposition. Explicit derivative
is derived. Thus, optimization can be carried out also for a dataset
with large number of subjects. The proposed method is tested using
standard SVM classification and compared to the main HA algorithms in
the literature. The experimental setup is based on 5 task-based
datasets and 2 movie-based datasets. DHA shows superior performance
with respect to other algorithms, in all cases.
The paper is well written, even though complex to read in Section 3
("Deep Hyperalignment"). I invite the authors to make that part more
accessible. I see no major issues in the paper, but I am not expert in
the mathematical derivations of the proposed method. The experimental
evidence is convincing and significant.
