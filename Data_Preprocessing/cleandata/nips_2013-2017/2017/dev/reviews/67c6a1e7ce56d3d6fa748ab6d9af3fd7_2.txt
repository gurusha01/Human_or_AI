The paper introduces a simple yet efficient way of incorporating attention modelling in CNN-based action recognition networks.
The paper is clearly written, the contribution is interesting and the experimental validation is convincing.
Minors comments:
Section 2 speaks of "performance" without explicitly stating which evaluation metrics are considered, except for [36] where it is said that mean average precision is considered (btw the acronym mAP is not properly defined here), this should be fixed to be clearer.
A few typos were left that need further proofreading.
