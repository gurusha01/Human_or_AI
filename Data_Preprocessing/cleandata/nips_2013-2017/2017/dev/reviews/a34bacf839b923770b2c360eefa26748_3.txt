The authors propose Hybrid, a framework to estimate the probability mass function for point processes. They reduce the problem to estimating the mass function conditioned on a given history, and solve the mass transport equation on each intervals to obtain the mass for the future, until the desired time t. This method is shown to have better sampling efficiency compared to MC. 
I would like the authors to be more clear on the following points:
(1) Regarding applying this framework, is the intensity function \lambda(t) known (pre-defined) or learned from the data? I assumed that it is pre-defined since the first step (line 190) of generating history samples depends on the intensity function.
(2) When comparing the running time in line 52 and line 269, the criteria is to achieve the same MAPE on \mu. Does the same conclusion still hold when the target is the MAPE of the probability mass function (i.e., P(N(t))) itself?
