This paper considers active hypothesis testing where the algorithm only receives an indirect feedback. It proposes a method based on incomplete Bayesian update, and at each step greedily chooses the action that maximizes a lower bound on the expected posterior of the true hypothesis. It gives matching lower bound and upper bound on the number of samples required w.r.t. delta, the confidence parameter.
This paper is clearly written, and I believe its results are correct (I didn't read the appendix). It considers a new model, and the algorithm proposed is new (but similar to the existing methods in [11] and [13])
My main concern is the motivation of this paper. This paper proposes a new model of active hypothesis testing, but gives little justification for it. The paper does provide an example in section 5 (I think it would be better to move it into section 1 or 2), but even that example is unnatural to me: why don't we just let the workers output the labels? How can you know the quality of the worker?
Another issue is that the analysis is limited:
1. The upper and lower bounds are only with respect to delta. What is the dependency on |J|, |W|, or some other quantities?
2. How is the sample complexity of the proposed method compared with other methods like the Chernoff algorithm, GBS algorithm, and a naive passive method? The paper provides numerical results, but I would expect to see theoretical comparisons.
