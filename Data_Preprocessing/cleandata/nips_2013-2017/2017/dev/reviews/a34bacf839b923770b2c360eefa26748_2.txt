This paper provides a framework for analysis of point processes, in particular to predict a function f(N(t)) where N(t) measures the number of times an event has occurred up until a time t. The paper derives an ODE (4) that determines evolution of probability that N takes a particular values at time t (so, the derivative in the ODE is wrt t. After approximating the solution to this ODE, the expectation of f can be taken.
This paper is distant from my expertise, so I advise the committee to pay closer attention to other reviews of this paper!
From my outsider's perspective, this paper could benefit from an expositional revision at the least. In particular, it's easy to "lose the forest through the trees." The paper gives a nice high-level introduction to the problem and then dives right into math. It'd be great to give a "middle" level of detail (just a paragraph or two) to fill the gap --- e.g. make all the variables lambda, phi, f, N, H_t, ... concrete for a single application---including a clear statement of the input and output data (this wasn't clear to me!). Roughly just a few sentences to the effect "As an example, suppose we wish to predict X from Y. We are given Z (notated using variables W in our paper) and wish to predict A (notated B in our paper)." This would help me contextualize the math quite a bit---I could follow the equations formally but was struggling on an applications side to understand what was going on.
Note:
* Given the recent popularity of "optimal transport" in machine learning, it might be worth noting that here you refer to "mass transport" as the ODE/PDE for moving around mass rather than anything having to do with e.g. Wasserstein distances.
* Theorem 2 is quite natural, and before the proof sketch I'd recommend explaining what's going on in a few words. All this equation is saying is that phi(x,t) changes for two potential reasons: An event occurs in the regime that hasn't reached phi(x,t), bumping up phi(x-1,t) --- this is the second term --- or an extra event occurs and bumps things up to phi(x+1,t) --- the first term.
* l.153 --- why should the upper bound for x be known a priori?
* l.190(ii) --- is it clear at this point what you mean by "compute the intensity function" --- this seems vague
* Paragraph starting l.207 -- what is u?
