The paper introduces a new hypothesis class complexity measure called "split-sample growth rate", which counts the number of possible hypotheses ERM can output on a subsample of half the data, and proves generalization bounds using this measure. The utility of this measure is demonstrated by application to optimal auctions, which have particularly simple split-sample growth rates.
I found the simplicity of the approach compelling, and the results significant, though the paper was quite dense and not easy to read in places. A major omission in my opinion is a conclusion which comments on the potential for "split-sample growth rate" to find applications beyond auctions, and I ask the authors to comment on this in the author response.
Line 23- remove first comma
Line 106- by doing so- not show
Lemma 1- statement and proof are fairly dense and difficult to understand
Line 160- missing closing }
Line 162- it would be nice if the authors could show this derivation
