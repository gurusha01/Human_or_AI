This paper addresses the important contemporary problem of spike detection and sorting on multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Efficient algorithms for this problem are critical given the increased number such experiments and the number of simultaneously recorded neurons. The ability to scale into the regimes of 10^4 to 10^6 electrodes is challenging and requires sophisticated analysis methods. 
The authors have correctly identified key attributes of robustness, scalability, modularity and the use of prior information in the development of powerful algorithms. The paper employs a substantial amount of methods and machinery that the authors are well familiar with and understand the problem space well.
Algorithm 1 placed early in the paper is not particularly helpful or readable, and doesn't really offer anything that the text description doesn't provide. The overview section is important to approach first but the writing here is not as clear as it might be and moves over a wide range of topics very quickly.
It is very difficult to determine the real veracity of the algorithms proposed. In particular the neural net training stage is compelling but difficult to penetrate how it would really work. Having training data, potentially different for each labs use, may be problematic and it is difficult to gauge how well this will really work, although the authors provide some good simulations.
In summary, this is potentially an interesting approach although the complexity of the method, its seemingly ad hoc nature and its comparatively not transparent presentation make it less attractive. The approach is interesting although very complicated with technical justification absent from the main paper or relegated to the Supplementary materials, which are substantial.
