In summary, this work is concerned with variance reduction via Rao-Blackwellization for general point processes. The main insight is to condition on the filtration generated by the process and solve the differential equation describing the time evolution of the corresponding conditional distributions. The latter is facilitated by working on discrete state spaces, made finite with suitable truncation and the use of numerical integration to perform time discretization. Although I find the contribution novel and am convinced of its utility in practical applications, I would like the author/s to be more transparent about the impact of the above-mentioned spatial truncation and temporal discretization. In particular, the claim that their proposed methodology returns unbiased estimators is inaccurate when these approximations are taken into account. That said, I believe debiasing methods described by McLeish (2010) and Rhee and Glynn (2015) may be employed here. 
Typo on page 5, line 190: the form of the estimator for expectation of test function f is missing averaging over replicates.
