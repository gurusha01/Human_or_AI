Summary:
This paper extends the matrix-based LiFE model, which can be used to represent the measured diffusion signal (dRMI) by the trajectories of fascicles contained in brain connectomes generated via tractography algorithm, to a tensor-based LiFE_sd model by factorizing the 3rd-order encoded candidate connectome tensor into coefficient core tensor Phi along with factor dictionary D and weight vector w. 
In this way, the LiFE_sd with compact multi-linear representation can significantly reduce the size of LiFE model while maintaining the approximation accuracy.
Strength:
1. The paper applies tensor decomposition methods on a novel application of estimating the brain contectome to improve the potentiality on the big data, which could be significantly important in neuroscience. 
2. Some analysis results such as accuracy and size compression are availbe when comparing with matrix-based model.
3. The paper is clearly written.
Weakness:
1. From the methodology aspect, the novelty of paper appears to be rather limited. The ENCODE part is already proposed in [10] and the incremental contribution lies in the decomposition part which just factorizes the Mv into factor D and slices Phiv. 
2. For the experiment, I'd like to the effect of optimized connectome in comparison with that of LiFE model, so we can see the performance differences and the effectiveness of the tensor-based LiFE_sd model. This part of experiment is missing.
