The authors presented a new algorithm, named the IBAG algorithm, for active sequential learning. The main idea is that it 
requires only a limited knowledge of a set of target actions. The authors did an extensive theoretical formulation and evaluation of their approach, and showed that it outperforms, in most cases, the benchmark approach (Chernoff's algorithm). 
Overall, I think that this paper adds value to existing literature on hypotheses testing under the active learning setting and in presence of limited information.
