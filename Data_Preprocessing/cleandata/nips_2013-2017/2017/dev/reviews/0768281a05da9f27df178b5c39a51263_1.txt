Summary
This paper proposes a hyperalignment method based on using neural network in place of basis functions under a framework similar to kernel hyperalignment. The method is applied to a number of real fMRI datasets. Increased classification accuracy with reduced computation time compared to another deep learning architecture is shown.
Comment
1. The novelty of this paper is unclear. From the text, the proposed method seems to be a combination of previous contributions. Does using neural network in place of basis functions result in an objective that is much harder to optimize? The optimization procedure seems to be "inspired" by previous works also.
2. Works on functional alignment by Georg Lang should be cited.
3. The original purpose of alignment is to establish subject correspondence so subject variability can be modelled. The best way to demonstrate better correspondence is to visually show that the subjects' activation patterns better align. By using a classification task for assessment as done in this work, it is difficulty to tell if it is better alignment that resulted in better classification or simply a better functional representation that resulted in better performance. In fact, it is unclear how to map the aligned data to the original anatomical space for interpretation purposes.
4. Since G is not unique, would that have a major impact on the results?
5. The results might reflect overfitting, i.e. biased, since the best performance over a range of parameter values is reported, as opposed to conducting proper nested cross validation. Models with greater flexibility would tend to perform better. Also, the range of parameter values would have a great influence on the results.
6. Functional hyperalignment presumably does not require pre-anatomical alignment. Does the performance gain hold if no spatial normalization is performed?
