The paper introduces a novel sample complexity measure, termed the split-sample growth rate, which refines the analysis of generalization error in statistical learning theory. The authors claim that this measure strengthens the Rademacher complexity framework and simplifies the analysis of sample complexity in optimal auction design. The paper demonstrates the utility of this measure through theoretical analysis and its application to various auction settings, achieving results comparable to or better than prior work.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The introduction of the split-sample growth rate is a significant theoretical contribution. It provides a structural perspective on generalization error by focusing on the hypotheses generated by empirical risk minimization (ERM) on subsets of data. This approach is innovative and could have broader implications beyond auction design.
2. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly articulates the main theoretical results, particularly the bound on generalization error in terms of the split-sample growth rate. The derivation of these bounds is rigorous and well-supported by mathematical proofs.
3. Simplification of Auction Analysis: The application of the split-sample growth rate to auction settings is compelling. The authors show that this measure simplifies the analysis of sample complexity for various auction classes, such as single-item auctions and multi-item pricing mechanisms, while achieving bounds that match or improve upon prior work.
4. Broader Applicability: The authors argue that the split-sample growth rate is not limited to auction design but is applicable to general PAC learning settings. This generality enhances the significance of the contribution.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical validation of the proposed measure. While the theoretical results are strong, demonstrating the practical utility of the split-sample growth rate through experiments on real-world datasets or simulations would strengthen the paper.
2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: Although the authors acknowledge the worse dependence on the confidence parameter Î´ in high-probability bounds, the discussion of this limitation is brief. A more detailed exploration of its implications and potential remedies would be valuable.
3. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper compares its results with prior work using pseudo-dimension and Rademacher complexity, the discussion could be expanded to include a more detailed qualitative and quantitative comparison, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and ease of application.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of statistical learning theory and auction design. The split-sample growth rate is a novel and promising measure that simplifies sample complexity analysis while maintaining or improving upon existing bounds. However, the lack of empirical validation and limited discussion of limitations slightly detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address these concerns in a revised version.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Theoretical novelty with potential for broad applicability.
- Simplification of sample complexity analysis in auction settings.
- Rigorous mathematical proofs supporting the claims.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Limited discussion of practical limitations and computational trade-offs.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the conference and should be accepted with minor revisions.
