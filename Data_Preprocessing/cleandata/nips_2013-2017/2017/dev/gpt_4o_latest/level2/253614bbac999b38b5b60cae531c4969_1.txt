The paper addresses the critical challenge of maintaining privacy in the repeated collection of telemetry counter data, proposing novel locally differentially private (LDP) mechanisms that are both theoretically robust and empirically validated. The authors focus on two key analytical tasks—mean estimation and histogram estimation—and introduce mechanisms that provide formal privacy guarantees even after prolonged data collection. Their contributions include a 1-bit response mechanism for single-round data collection, an innovative α-point rounding technique for memoization, and the deployment of these methods by Microsoft to collect telemetry data from millions of devices.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The paper tackles a significant limitation of existing LDP mechanisms, which fail to provide strong privacy guarantees for repeated data collection. The proposed α-point rounding and memoization techniques are innovative and address this gap effectively. The deployment by Microsoft demonstrates the practical utility and scalability of the methods.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide formal privacy guarantees for their mechanisms, including proofs of LDP preservation and error bounds for mean and histogram estimation. The introduction of behavior patterns to quantify privacy leakage in repeated data collection is a meaningful theoretical advancement.
3. Empirical Validation: The mechanisms are evaluated on real-world datasets, including telemetry data from millions of users, and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed mechanisms achieve comparable or better accuracy while offering enhanced privacy protection.
4. Deployment: The deployment in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update adds credibility to the work and highlights its real-world impact. The ability to collect data for multiple apps with minimal additional privacy loss is a particularly noteworthy feature.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, such as the α-point rounding and its integration with memoization, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with approximation algorithms or LDP. Simplifying these explanations or providing more intuitive examples would improve accessibility.
2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: Although the authors acknowledge that their privacy guarantees are weaker in repeated collection settings compared to single-round LDP, the discussion on potential attacks leveraging auxiliary information could be expanded. For instance, the implications of output perturbation on accuracy and privacy trade-offs deserve more attention.
3. Comparative Analysis: While the paper compares its mechanisms with existing methods, the evaluation could include more diverse datasets and scenarios to better generalize the findings. Additionally, the performance of the mechanisms under extreme conditions (e.g., highly dynamic user behavior) is not thoroughly explored.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical and underexplored problem in LDP, offering both theoretical and practical contributions.
- The deployment by Microsoft demonstrates the real-world relevance and scalability of the proposed methods.
- The empirical results are robust, showing that the mechanisms are competitive with or superior to existing approaches.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in the technical sections, to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
- The discussion of limitations and potential vulnerabilities in the proposed framework is somewhat limited.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of privacy-preserving data collection and is well-aligned with the goals of the conference. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and discussion of limitations, these do not detract from the importance and quality of the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
