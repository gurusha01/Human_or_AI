The paper presents a significant advancement in solving zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games, using heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em poker as a case study. It introduces novel subgame-solving techniques, including "reach" subgame solving and nested subgame solving, which address key challenges in this domain. The distinction between "unsafe" and "safe" subgame solving is well-articulated, with the latter ensuring opponent strategies can adapt within subgames to maintain theoretical guarantees. The introduction of "gifts" in reach subgame solving to account for alternate paths and the dynamic handling of large action spaces through nested subgame solving are particularly innovative contributions.
The paper is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over prior approaches, with reach subgame solving and nested subgame solving achieving lower exploitability and outperforming action translation in handling off-tree actions. The practical application of these techniques in Libratus, the first AI to defeat top human players in heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em, underscores the significance of this work.
The exposition is clear and well-organized, making the complex concepts accessible to readers. However, the role of "gifts" in maxmargin solving could benefit from additional explanation to clarify their impact on exploitability and theoretical guarantees. Additionally, the observed performance gap between no-split and split variants of reach subgame solving, despite better theoretical guarantees for the latter, warrants further discussion to provide deeper insights into this discrepancy. A minor correction is also needed for a mislabeled figure reference ("Figure 4a" should be "Figure 1").
The originality of the work is evident in its novel techniques and their integration into a unified framework for subgame solving. The paper builds on prior research in imperfect-information games but significantly extends the state of the art by addressing limitations of existing methods and introducing new capabilities, such as nested subgame solving.
The results are highly significant, as they advance the field's understanding of subgame solving in imperfect-information games and provide practical tools for tackling large-scale problems. The demonstrated success in a challenging real-world benchmark further highlights the potential for these techniques to influence future research and applications in strategic decision-making domains.
