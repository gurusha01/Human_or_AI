The paper introduces a novel sample complexity measure, the split-sample growth rate, which strengthens the Rademacher complexity framework for bounding generalization error. The key contribution lies in focusing on hypotheses that can be output by empirical risk minimization (ERM) on subsets of samples, leading to a new generalization bound (Lemma 1, Theorem 2). This approach simplifies the analysis of sample complexity for various auction classes and has potential applications beyond auction design.
Strengths:
The proposed split-sample growth rate is an elegant and pedagogically valuable idea. It provides a more structural and intuitive way to analyze generalization error by restricting the hypothesis space to outcomes of ERM on subsamples. This simplification is particularly impactful in auction design, where the authors demonstrate that the sample complexity of many auction classes can be derived with straightforward counting arguments. For example, the analysis of single-item auctions, multi-item auctions, and additive valuations is significantly streamlined compared to prior work using pseudo-dimension or compression bounds. Moreover, the method yields tighter or comparable bounds while removing unnecessary logarithmic factors in some cases. The broader applicability of the split-sample growth rate to general statistical learning theory is another notable strength, as it could inspire further research in other domains.
Weaknesses:
While the theoretical results are sound, the paper leaves some important questions unresolved. Specifically, the linear dependence on \(1/\delta\) in the high-probability bound (Theorem 2) is suboptimal compared to the standard \(O(\log(1/\delta))\) dependence in Rademacher complexity bounds. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide a resolution or a clear argument for its necessity. Additionally, the proof of Lemma 1 closely follows the textbook Rademacher complexity analysis, and the paper could better emphasize what is novel versus standard in the derivation. Another concern is the lack of experimental validation or practical examples outside the auction setting to demonstrate the broader utility of the proposed measure.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the novelty of the proof of Lemma 1 by explicitly distinguishing new contributions from standard techniques.
2. Address the open question regarding the \(1/\delta\) dependence in Theorem 2 or provide a more detailed discussion of why this limitation arises.
3. In Section 4, explicitly state that the hypothesis class \(H\) is chosen because it contains the optimal auction in each scenario, rather than \(H\) changing arbitrarily.
4. Acknowledge prior work more thoroughly, particularly the connections to the 2005 FOCS paper by Balcan et al., which also uses counting arguments for sample complexity bounds in a transductive setting.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution by introducing the split-sample growth rate and demonstrating its utility in auction design. However, the unresolved issues regarding the high-probability bound and the lack of clarity in certain sections slightly detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, as the core idea is novel and has significant potential for further exploration.
