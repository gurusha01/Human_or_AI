This paper addresses the challenging problem of decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM), a practical variant of submodular minimization with high computational complexity. The authors make significant theoretical and practical contributions by improving the analysis of state-of-the-art DSFM algorithms and providing a systematic experimental comparison of discrete and continuous approaches. Specifically, the paper improves the running time analysis of continuous algorithms by a factor proportional to the number of functions in the decomposition, leveraging combinatorial arguments to simplify and enhance prior results.
Strengths:  
1. Theoretical Contributions: The improved convergence guarantees for gradient-based methods are a notable advancement, particularly the tighter bounds on condition numbers (κ and l), which lead to faster running times. The combination of discrete and continuous optimization techniques is innovative and provides a fresh perspective on DSFM.  
2. Experimental Framework: The authors introduce a clear distinction between "level-0" (quadratic minimization subroutines) and "level-1" (function minimization using level-0) algorithms, enabling fair comparisons. This framework is a valuable contribution to the field, addressing a gap in prior experimental studies.  
3. Practical Insights: The experiments reveal a tradeoff between discrete algorithms (e.g., IBFS, which requires more level-0 calls but less overhead) and gradient-based methods (e.g., RCDM and ACDM, which rely less on level-0 but involve higher level-1 computation). This insight is critical for practitioners selecting algorithms based on problem context.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is densely written, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with DSFM. Key parameters such as κ and l are not discussed in sufficient detail, and their implications for algorithm performance could be better contextualized.  
2. Theoretical Comparisons: While the paper improves running time bounds, it does not adequately compare these bounds across algorithms like RCDM, ACDM, and IBFS. A more detailed discussion of the tradeoffs between these methods would strengthen the theoretical contributions.  
3. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to specific types of potentials (e.g., unary, pairwise, square, and region potentials) and image segmentation tasks. Broader applications of DSFM could be explored to validate the generality of the findings.  
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper makes a clear theoretical contribution by improving the running time analysis of DSFM algorithms and simplifying prior proofs.  
- The experimental framework is well-designed and addresses a critical gap in prior work.  
- The insights into algorithm selection based on problem context are practically valuable for researchers and practitioners.
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The dense writing and insufficient discussion of key parameters may limit the paper's accessibility and impact.  
- The lack of broader experimental validation across diverse applications weakens the generalizability of the results.  
- The theoretical comparisons among algorithms could be more comprehensive.
Recommendation:  
This paper offers a meaningful contribution to the field of submodular optimization, particularly in advancing the understanding of DSFM algorithms. However, improvements in clarity, broader experimental validation, and theoretical comparisons are necessary for a stronger impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these issues.
