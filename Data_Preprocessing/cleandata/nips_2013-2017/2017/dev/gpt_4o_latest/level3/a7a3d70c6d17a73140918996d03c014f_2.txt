The paper introduces the "split-sample growth rate" as a novel complexity measure for hypothesis classes and demonstrates its utility by deriving generalization bounds. This measure refines the Rademacher complexity analysis by focusing on hypotheses generated by empirical risk minimization (ERM) on subsets of the data. The authors apply this framework to analyze the sample complexity of optimal auctions, showing that many auction classes exhibit simple split-sample growth rates, leading to streamlined and improved bounds. The paper also highlights connections to existing concepts like local Rademacher complexity and pseudodimension, situating its contributions within the broader landscape of statistical learning theory.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The introduction of the split-sample growth rate is a significant theoretical advancement. It provides a structural perspective on generalization error, which could have implications beyond auction design.
2. Simplification of Analysis: The application to auction theory demonstrates the practical utility of the measure, yielding bounds that are competitive with or improve upon prior results while simplifying the analysis.
3. Clarity in Results: The derivation of generalization bounds and their application to various auction classes is rigorous and well-supported by theoretical arguments.
4. Potential Broader Impact: While the paper primarily focuses on auctions, the split-sample growth rate is positioned as a general tool for statistical learning theory, hinting at broader applicability.
Weaknesses:
1. Density and Accessibility: The paper is dense and challenging to follow in places, particularly in the statement and proof of Lemma 1. This could hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Limited Scope of Applications: While the authors note the potential applicability of the split-sample growth rate beyond auctions, the paper does not explore or discuss these broader applications in detail.
3. Clarity in Presentation: Specific sections, such as the derivation in Line 162, would benefit from additional explanation to improve readability. The omission of a closing brace on Line 160 and minor grammatical issues (e.g., Line 23 and Line 106) detract from the overall polish.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Broader Applications: Include a discussion or example of how the split-sample growth rate could be applied to other domains, such as supervised learning or reinforcement learning, to emphasize its generality.
2. Improved Readability: Simplify the presentation of Lemma 1 and its proof, possibly by including an intuitive derivation or example. Address the noted typographical and grammatical issues.
3. High-Probability Bounds: The paper mentions an open question regarding the dependence on Î´ in high-probability bounds. While this is a challenging issue, even a brief discussion of potential approaches or implications would strengthen the paper.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant theoretical contribution with practical implications for auction theory and potentially broader areas of machine learning. While the paper could benefit from improved clarity and a broader discussion of applications, these issues do not detract from its overall quality and impact. The split-sample growth rate is a compelling concept that advances the state of the art in understanding generalization error.
