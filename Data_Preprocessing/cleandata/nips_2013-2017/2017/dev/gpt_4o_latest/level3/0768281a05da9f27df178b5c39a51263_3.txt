The paper presents a novel method, Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), to address the challenging problem of functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI datasets. DHA extends traditional hyperalignment (HA) techniques by leveraging deep neural networks as flexible, parametric kernels, enabling it to handle nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and large subject cohorts more effectively. Unlike prior methods, DHA does not rely on fixed kernel functions and employs rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, leading to scalable and efficient performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DHA outperforms state-of-the-art HA methods across multiple open fMRI datasets, making it a promising contribution to the field.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles a significant problem in neuroscience and machine learning, as functional alignment is critical for multi-subject fMRI analysis. The proposed method is well-motivated, combining elements of existing approaches (e.g., kernel methods, SVD, and deep learning) in a novel way. The experiments are thorough, utilizing diverse datasets and competitive baselines, and the results consistently show DHA's superiority in classification accuracy and runtime. The authors also provide detailed parameter settings and ablation studies, which enhance reproducibility and demonstrate the robustness of the method. Additionally, the paper highlights the scalability of DHA, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches like Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA) and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE).
Weaknesses:  
While the mathematical formulation of DHA is comprehensive, the methods section is dense and could benefit from a clearer summary or illustrative figures to aid reader comprehension. The lack of preprocessing details for the datasets is a notable omission, as preprocessing can significantly impact fMRI analysis outcomes. Furthermore, the validation strategy raises concerns, as the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation might not fully capture generalization performance. Including comparisons with literature-reported results, rather than relying solely on author-generated baselines, would strengthen the evaluation. Finally, while the English quality is generally good, minor issues with clarity and repetition detract from the overall readability.
