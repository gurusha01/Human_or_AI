This paper addresses the problem of online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, extending the classical OCO framework by incorporating time-varying, i.i.d. stochastic constraints. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves \(O(\sqrt{T})\) expected regret and constraint violations, and \(O(\sqrt{T} \log T)\) high-probability bounds for both metrics. This represents a significant improvement over prior work, which achieved \(O(T^{3/4})\) bounds for constraint violations. The theoretical contributions are complemented by experiments on a real-world stochastic job scheduling problem, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed method.
Strengths:
1. Significant Theoretical Advancements: The paper makes a notable improvement over existing results in OCO with constraints, achieving tighter bounds for both regret and constraint violations. This is a substantial contribution to the field.
2. Novelty: The focus on long-term constraint violations without requiring expensive projections onto complex sets is both novel and practical. The use of virtual queues and drift analysis to handle stochastic constraints is elegant and well-motivated.
3. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a logical flow from problem formulation to algorithm design, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The related work is thoroughly surveyed, situating the contributions within the broader literature.
4. Experimental Validation: The preliminary experiments on a stochastic job scheduling problem provide evidence of the algorithm's practical effectiveness. The comparison with baselines demonstrates its superior performance in balancing cost and constraint satisfaction.
Weaknesses:
1. Feedback Setup Motivation: While the paper introduces a novel feedback setup, the motivation for this specific choice could be elaborated further. For example, why this setup is particularly relevant for real-world applications could be clarified.
2. Limited Experimental Scope: The experimental results, while promising, are limited to a single application (job scheduling). Additional experiments across diverse domains would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Proof Verification: While the proofs appear technically sound, a detailed check of the appendix is pending. This is a minor issue but worth noting for completeness.
4. Scalability Considerations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the computational complexity or scalability of the proposed algorithm, which could be a concern for large-scale problems.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a well-motivated and challenging problem, making a significant theoretical contribution.
- The results advance the state of the art in OCO with constraints, with both expected and high-probability guarantees.
- The experimental results, though limited, demonstrate the practical relevance of the algorithm.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental validation could be more comprehensive, covering a broader range of applications.
- The feedback setup, while interesting, could benefit from stronger justification.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of online optimization and is likely to be of interest to both theoretical and applied researchers. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the feedback setup motivation and expand the experimental scope.
