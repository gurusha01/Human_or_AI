The paper addresses the problem of online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, a significant generalization of Zinkevich's OCO framework. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves sublinear regret and constraint violations in both expectation and high probability, with guarantees of \(O(\sqrt{T})\) and \(O(\sqrt{T} \log(T))\), respectively. The algorithm is tested on a real-world job scheduling problem in distributed data centers, demonstrating its practical utility in minimizing electricity costs while respecting stochastic constraints.
Strengths
The paper is technically sound and well-structured, presenting a novel algorithm that advances the state of the art in OCO with stochastic constraints. The regret guarantees are strong and clearly derived, with detailed theoretical analysis supported by a new drift lemma for stochastic processes. The experimental results on job scheduling provide a compelling real-world application, showcasing the algorithm's effectiveness compared to baseline methods. The authors also highlight the algorithm's versatility in handling special cases like long-term constraints, stochastic constrained convex optimization, and deterministic constrained convex optimization, further emphasizing its significance.
Weaknesses
Despite its strengths, the paper has several areas that require improvement. First, the connection between the proposed algorithm and deterministic constrained convex optimization is not sufficiently clarified, leaving the relationship between the two settings ambiguous. Additionally, prior work ([A], [16]) is not adequately discussed, and the reuse of results from [B] is underexplored, which weakens the contextualization of the contribution. The experimental section, while promising, lacks sufficient details on baselines, implementation, and reproducibility. For example, the figures could be improved for clarity, and variability in results (e.g., repetitions and standard errors) is not assessed. The rationale behind the algorithm's trade-off between drift and penalty is also underexplained, which could hinder understanding for a broader audience. Finally, while Lemma 5 is central to the theoretical contribution, its novelty is unclear due to limited discussion and the reviewer's expertise in this specific area.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Provide a clearer discussion of the algorithm's relationship to deterministic constrained convex optimization and prior work ([A], [16], [B]).
2. Expand the experimental section with more details on baselines, reproducibility, and variability assessment (e.g., standard errors or confidence intervals).
3. Improve the clarity of figures and provide more intuitive explanations of the trade-off between drift and penalty.
4. Explore the possibility of making parameters \(\alpha\) and \(V\) time-dependent to enhance performance.
5. Clarify the acceptability of constraint violations in the stochastic setting and discuss the potential for extending the analysis to dynamic regret.
Recommendation
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of OCO with stochastic constraints and is technically rigorous. However, the issues with prior work discussion, experimental details, and clarity of certain aspects suggest that the paper would benefit from a major revision before acceptance. If these concerns are adequately addressed, the paper would be a strong candidate for publication.
