The paper proposes HYBRID, a novel framework for predicting user activities modeled by point processes. The authors reformulate the prediction problem and introduce a mass transport equation to compute the conditional probability mass function, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over existing methods. The framework is generalizable to arbitrary point processes and prediction tasks, and its efficacy is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including social network activity and recommender systems.
Strengths
The paper makes several notable contributions:
1. Reformulation of the Prediction Problem: The introduction of a new random variable with reduced variance is a significant theoretical advancement, extending the Rao-Blackwell theorem to point processes.
2. Mass Transport Equation: The novel differential-difference equation formulation is both elegant and practical, enabling efficient computation of conditional probability mass functions.
3. Generalizability: Unlike prior methods, HYBRID is applicable to arbitrary functions and point processes, which is a substantial improvement over problem-specific or heuristic approaches.
4. Empirical Validation: The framework demonstrates superior predictive performance and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, with a significant reduction in sample size and runtime.
5. Clarity of Explanations: The section on event information effectively highlights the sample efficiency of the framework, and Figure 2 provides an intuitive understanding of the transport dynamics.
Weaknesses
1. Title: The title could better reflect the paper's focus. A suggestion is: "HYBRID: A Framework for Efficient Estimation of the Probability Mass Function of Point Processes."
2. Paper Length: At 32 pages, the paper is overly long and could be condensed to around 20 pages for clarity and focus.
3. References: The citations are heavily clustered around a few authors, and datasets should be directly credited to their original contributors. Additionally, related work such as "Marked Temporal Dynamics Modeling based on Recurrent Neural Network" could be included if relevant.
4. Generalizability Claim: While the framework claims general applicability, an example of a point process not covered by prior art would strengthen this claim.
5. Figures: Figure 3 raises questions about the train/test split methodology, which should be clarified.
6. Writing Issues: Several typos were noted, including "state-of-arts," "adversely influence," "phenomena of interests," and "RMSE is defines."
Technical Evaluation
- Quality: The paper is technically sound, with solid proofs (e.g., Appendix C) and well-supported claims. However, the reviewer lacks expertise in point processes and recommends expert evaluation of the proofs in Appendix A.
- Clarity: The paper is generally well-organized, though some sections could be streamlined. The explanation of the transport equation is particularly clear and insightful.
- Originality: The use of the conditional intensity function as a random variable for prediction is novel, as is the transport equation formulation.
- Significance: The results are impactful, offering both theoretical advancements and practical improvements in predictive performance and efficiency.
Recommendation
This is a promising and solid submission, likely in the top 50% of NIPS papers. While the reviewer lacks expertise in point processes, the novelty and utility of the contributions are evident. The paper should be accepted, contingent on addressing the weaknesses noted above.
