The paper presents a novel and efficient sparse approximation of the Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) model for tractography using a Tucker tensor decomposition framework, termed LiFESD. This approach addresses the computational inefficiencies of the original LiFE model, which is memory-intensive and computationally prohibitive for high-resolution datasets. By leveraging sparse tensor decomposition, the authors achieve significant compression (up to 40x), reducing memory requirements from approximately 40GB to 1GB, while maintaining a model approximation error of less than 1%. The theoretical bounds for accuracy and compression are rigorously derived and validated experimentally on real-world datasets, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed method.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a strong technical contribution by introducing a novel application of tensor decomposition to a critical problem in neuroscience. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental results convincingly validate the proposed method. The authors demonstrate the scalability of LiFESD across varying numbers of gradient directions and fascicles, highlighting its practical utility for modern high-resolution datasets. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and intuitive figures that enhance accessibility for readers, including those unfamiliar with tensor decomposition or tractography. Additionally, the method's potential to advance connectomics and related fields is well-articulated, making it a significant contribution to both neuroscience and computational modeling.
Weaknesses:  
The primary limitation lies in the superficial evaluation of the model's application to tractography. While the authors acknowledge this as a result of space constraints, a more detailed analysis of the biological or neuroscientific implications of the results would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the argument regarding convex models lacks sufficient depth and could be made more convincing. Minor issues include a sentence structure problem in line 195 and a typographical error ("aproach" â†’ "approach") in line 202, which should be corrected for clarity.
