This paper presents two novel techniques, "Reach" and "Nested," for solving two-player zero-sum games with imperfect information. These methods address the challenges of subgame solving, where strategies in one part of the game may depend on outcomes in other, unreached subgames. The authors build on prior work in subgame solving and abstraction techniques, demonstrating significant theoretical and practical improvements. Notably, these methods contributed to the development of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top human players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, a landmark achievement in AI research.
The "Reach" method innovatively incorporates the concept of leveraging opponent mistakes in prior steps, allowing for a more adaptive and less exploitable strategy. By considering potential "gifts" (suboptimal opponent actions) and redistributing value across subgames, "Reach" ensures lower exploitability compared to previous techniques. The "Nested" approach, on the other hand, dynamically re-solves subgames in real time, using more detailed information as the game progresses. This method also addresses the challenge of off-tree actions (opponent moves not in the abstraction) by generating tailored responses, outperforming traditional action translation methods.
Strengths:  
1. Significance: The techniques represent a major advancement in solving imperfect-information games, with practical applications in negotiation, auctions, and security. The success of Libratus underscores the real-world impact of this work.  
2. Originality: Both "Reach" and "Nested" introduce novel ideas that extend beyond existing subgame-solving methods, particularly in their handling of opponent mistakes and off-tree actions.  
3. Quality: The theoretical guarantees provided for "Reach" and the experimental results demonstrating reduced exploitability are robust and compelling. The nested subgame-solving experiments further validate the practical superiority of these methods.  
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the challenges in imperfect-information games and how the proposed techniques address them. The authors also provide detailed experimental results to support their claims.
Weaknesses:  
1. Accessibility: While the technical details are thorough, the paper lacks intuitive explanations for some of the key concepts, particularly the "Reach" method. This makes it challenging for readers outside the immediate subfield to fully grasp the contributions. The author response helped clarify "Reach," but additional illustrative examples or visual aids in the paper would improve accessibility.  
2. Generality: The techniques are evaluated primarily in the context of poker. While this is a standard benchmark, additional experiments in other domains would strengthen the claim of general applicability.
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in imperfect-information games with novel and impactful contributions.  
- The techniques have been rigorously evaluated both theoretically and empirically, with results that advance the state of the art.  
- The success of Libratus demonstrates the practical significance of the work.
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The limited explanation of key techniques may hinder understanding and reproducibility for some readers.  
- Broader evaluation across different domains would better establish the generality of the methods.
Overall, this paper represents a high-quality contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and accessibility.
