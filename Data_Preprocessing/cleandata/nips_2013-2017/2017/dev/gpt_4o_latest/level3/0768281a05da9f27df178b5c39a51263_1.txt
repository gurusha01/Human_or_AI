The paper proposes Deep Hyperalignment (DHA), a novel approach to functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI analysis, leveraging deep neural networks as a flexible kernel. DHA addresses key challenges in hyperalignment (HA), including nonlinearity, high dimensionality, and scalability to large datasets. By employing rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, DHA achieves reduced runtime and eliminates the need for training data during new subject alignment. Experimental results demonstrate superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art HA methods, validating DHA's efficacy.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contributions: The use of deep neural networks as a kernel function is a significant departure from traditional fixed kernel approaches, providing flexibility and adaptability across subjects. The combination of rank-m SVD and SGD for optimization is computationally efficient and well-suited for large datasets.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating DHA's superior performance in classification accuracy, runtime, and feature representation compared to existing methods like CAE, SRM, and SVDHA.
3. Scalability: The method's ability to handle high-dimensional data and a large number of subjects is a notable improvement over prior HA techniques.
4. Clarity of Experimental Setup: The experiments are well-documented, with clear comparisons to baseline and state-of-the-art methods, and the use of diverse datasets strengthens the generalizability of the results.
Weaknesses:
1. Novelty Concerns: While DHA introduces a deep learning-based kernel, the method appears to combine existing ideas (e.g., multi-set CCA, DGCCA, and deep networks) without a clear distinction from prior works. The innovation could be better articulated, particularly in how DHA fundamentally advances the state of the art.
2. Missing Citations: The paper omits relevant citations, such as works by Georg Lang on functional alignment, which could provide important context and contrast for the proposed method.
3. Assessment Methodology: Evaluating alignment quality via classification tasks introduces ambiguity. It is unclear whether the observed performance gains stem from improved alignment or better functional representation.
4. Interpretability: The inability to map aligned data back to anatomical space limits the interpretability of the results, which is critical for neuroscience applications.
5. Uniqueness of G: The non-uniqueness of the DHA template (G) raises questions about the robustness and reproducibility of the results. This aspect is acknowledged but not adequately addressed.
6. Overfitting Risk: Reporting the best performance across parameter ranges without nested cross-validation raises concerns about potential overfitting.
7. Dependence on Spatial Normalization: The paper does not clarify whether DHA's performance gains persist without pre-anatomical spatial normalization, which could limit its applicability in real-world settings.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to functional alignment in fMRI analysis, the concerns about novelty, interpretability, and methodology warrant further clarification. Addressing these issues, particularly the ambiguity in evaluation metrics and the omission of key citations, would strengthen the paper. I recommend conditional acceptance provided the authors address the novelty concerns, include missing references, and clarify the interpretability and robustness of the method.
