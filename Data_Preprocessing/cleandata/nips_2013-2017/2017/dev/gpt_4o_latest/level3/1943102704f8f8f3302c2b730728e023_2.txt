This paper introduces Yet Another Spike Sorter (YASS), a multistage pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). The authors present a "triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit" framework that leverages neural networks for detection, Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models (DP-GMM) for clustering, and matching pursuit for recovering missed or collided spikes. The pipeline is designed to improve robustness, scalability, and modularity, and it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency on both synthetic and real datasets. The authors emphasize the importance of leveraging prior information and modular design to handle the challenges of large-scale MEA datasets.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in neuroscience researchâ€”scalable and reliable spike sorting for dense MEAs. The modular design of YASS allows for iterative improvements, and the use of neural networks for detection is a notable advancement, significantly reducing false positives and improving alignment. The coreset-based clustering and divide-and-conquer approach enhance scalability, making the method suitable for large datasets. The authors provide empirical evidence of YASS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods like Kilosort, Spyking Circus, and MountainSort, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. The computational efficiency of YASS, achieving real-time performance on a single CPU core, is a significant contribution to the field.
Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks clarity in several critical areas. Key methodological details are buried in the supplementary material, making it difficult for readers to follow the main text. The authors should streamline the presentation and ensure that essential details are included in the main manuscript. Additionally, the requirement for hand-labeled data in the detection stage introduces a supervised component, which is not explicitly acknowledged in comparisons with unsupervised methods like Kilosort. This omission could lead to unfair interpretations of the results. The decision to discard overlapping signals on multiple electrodes raises concerns about the fairness of comparisons, as this may disadvantage YASS in certain scenarios. Finally, the novelty of the approach is somewhat obscured by the lack of a detailed performance breakdown, making it unclear whether the improvements stem from novel contributions or the integration of existing techniques.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.  
- Addresses a critical bottleneck in neuroscience research with a scalable and modular approach.  
- Provides empirical comparisons with multiple state-of-the-art methods, showing clear advantages.  
Con:  
- Lack of clarity in the main text, with critical details relegated to the supplementary material.  
- Supervised components and methodological assumptions (e.g., discarding overlapping signals) are not adequately highlighted, raising fairness concerns in comparisons.  
- Unclear novelty due to the absence of a detailed performance breakdown.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper makes significant contributions to the field, the lack of clarity and transparency in some aspects of the methodology and comparisons is a concern. I recommend acceptance with major revisions to address these issues, particularly the need for clearer writing, explicit acknowledgment of supervised components, and a detailed performance breakdown to better assess the novelty of the contributions.
