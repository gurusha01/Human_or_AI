In this paper, the authors propose a method to estimate multiple weighted automata (WFAs) using spectral learning algorithms applied to the associated Hankel tensor. Specifically, they employ rank factorization via singular value decomposition (SVD) on the Hankel tensor and demonstrate how this factorization can be utilized to learn individual functions. I have the following comments:
Is the factorization technique for the Hankel tensor presented in this paper a novel contribution? Clarifying this point would help position the work in the context of existing literature.
In Definition 2, the authors introduce a measure of relatedness, denoted as τ. Is there a specific rationale behind this particular definition? I was unable to connect it to other quantities discussed in the paper. Providing additional details on the purpose of defining τ would be beneficial. Furthermore, does τ influence the choice of R, the common rank?
I was expecting the advantages of estimating multiple functions jointly to be evident through the dependence of error measures on τ in Theorem 5 (or perhaps in a more generalized version of it) or through computational complexity analysis. However, it appears that the computational complexity is worse than when estimating each WFA individually. Could the relatedness among functions not be exploited to improve computational efficiency? It would be particularly insightful to explore a more generalized version of Theorem 5. For instance, if the WFAs are minimally related, would the performance degrade compared to estimating them individually? In simulations, what happens if dS is 0 or at least smaller than dT? It is concerning that even when there is some commonality, if dS and dT are equal, the proposed multi-task spectral learning (MT-SL) approach seems to offer no advantage over standard spectral learning (SL).
To demonstrate the benefits of joint learning, particularly for maximally related WFAs, the authors argue that the estimation error for "enough" tasks would scale as O(T²) compared to O(T) when tasks are learned individually, where T is defined as ||E||F/sR(H). However, I could not understand why O(T²) would be considered an improvement over O(T). Is T ≤ 1? Clarifying this point would help in assessing the claimed benefits of the proposed approach.
