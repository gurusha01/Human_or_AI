In summary, this paper addresses variance reduction through Rao-Blackwellization for general point processes. The key idea involves conditioning on the filtration generated by the process and solving the differential equation that governs the time evolution of the associated conditional distributions. This approach is implemented by working within discrete state spaces, which are rendered finite via appropriate truncation, and applying numerical integration for temporal discretization. While I find the contribution to be novel and believe it holds significant promise for practical applications, I encourage the author(s) to provide greater clarity regarding the effects of the aforementioned spatial truncation and temporal discretization. Specifically, the assertion that their proposed methodology yields unbiased estimators is not accurate when these approximations are considered. However, I suggest that debiasing techniques, such as those introduced by McLeish (2010) and Rhee and Glynn (2015), could be applied in this context.
Additionally, there is a typo on page 5, line 190: the form of the estimator for the expectation of the test function f omits averaging over replicates.
