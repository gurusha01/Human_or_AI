This study presents an enhancement to the hyperalignment (HA) approach, which focuses on functional alignment across subjects. The proposed extension specifically addresses key limitations of existing HA methods in the literature, including issues of nonlinearity, scalability, and high dimensionality. The new method, referred to as deep hyperalignment (DHA), reformulates the HA objective function by introducing multiple stacked layers of nonlinear transformations using a (multi-layer) kernel function. The objective function is further redefined in terms of templates and eigendecomposition, with explicit derivation of the gradient provided. Consequently, the optimization process becomes feasible even for datasets with a large number of subjects. The method is evaluated through standard SVM classification and benchmarked against leading HA algorithms in the field. The experimental evaluation spans five task-based datasets and two movie-based datasets, with DHA consistently outperforming other methods across all cases.
The manuscript is well written, though Section 3 ("Deep Hyperalignment") is particularly dense and challenging to follow. I encourage the authors to simplify or clarify this section to improve accessibility. While I am not an expert in the mathematical derivations underlying the proposed approach, the experimental results are compelling and demonstrate significant improvements.
