This paper introduces a memory-augmented generative model that employs stochastic, discrete memory addressing by treating memory as a non-parametric conditional mixture distribution. The proposed variational memory addressing framework integrates discrete memory addressing variables with continuous latent variables, enabling the generation of samples even with a limited number of memory entries, which is particularly advantageous for few-shot learning. The authors implement a VAE-based version of their model and evaluate its performance on few-shot recognition tasks using the Omniglot dataset. Their model demonstrates significant improvements over Generative Matching Networks, a prior memory-augmented network model. Additional analysis reveals that the proposed model effectively retrieves relevant portions of memory even when faced with hundreds of unseen instances.
Pros:
- The idea of performing discrete, stochastic memory addressing within a memory-augmented generative model is novel and well-justified. The authors also provide a strong rationale for why this approach is superior to soft-attention mechanisms.
- The proposed variational addressing method is shown to be effective for few-shot learning, even in scenarios where existing soft-attention-based models fail.
- The use of KL divergence to interpret memory utilization is a promising and practical approach.
Cons:
- The primary limitation is that the experimental evaluation is restricted to character datasets, albeit standard ones. It would strengthen the paper if results were provided for other types of data, such as images, and if comparisons were made with (or combined with) recent generative models like GANs.
Overall:  
This is a strong paper that presents an innovative and effective solution. It successfully addresses the limitations of existing soft-attention-based memory addressing models and demonstrates its utility for few-shot learning. I recommend accepting this paper.
Minor Issues:
- Line 104: "unconditioneal" → "unconditional"
- Line 135: Missing "of" between "context" and "supervised."
- Line 185: "eachieving" → "achieving"
- Table 1: Add a label "number of shots" for the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 19.
