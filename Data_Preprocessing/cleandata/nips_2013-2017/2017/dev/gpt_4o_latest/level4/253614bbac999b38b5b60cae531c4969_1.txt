The authors assert that the 1-bit mechanism for mean estimation is optimized for efficient communication. However, how does this differ from the basic randomizer in [3] when applied to a single item? If the protocol is indeed equivalent to the basic randomizer in [3] under certain conditions, this equivalence should be explicitly clarified.

Kindly provide a comparison of the utility in terms of n and d with existing histogram protocols.

The privacy guarantees after alpha-point rounding remain unclear. If a data collector repeatedly reports her data (e.g., N times), the privacy budget must be adjusted in accordance with the composition theorem. While alpha-point rounding introduces an additional source of randomness into the responses, which likely enhances privacy to some degree, the composition theorem still applies as long as the data collector provides multiple responses.
