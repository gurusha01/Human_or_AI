This paper introduces a natural extension of spectral methods for learning Weighted Finite Automata (WFAs) to the multitask setting. The core idea is straightforward: WFAs can be jointly trained to share the same underlying operators while having distinct ending vectors. The interpretation of this approach as sharing a latent (forward) space across different tasks appears conceptually sound. The paper is self-contained, well-written, and easy to follow.
While the idea may seem relatively simple to those familiar with spectral learning of WFAs, I am confident in its novelty. Overall, I consider this a valuable contribution. My primary concern is that the proposed notion of relatedness might be overly restrictive for practical learning scenarios. It would be beneficial if the authors could explore and discuss potential ways to relax this notion of relatedness.
