The paper builds upon the saddle point derivative of the SVRG algorithm by extending it to incorporate entropy regularization instead of the standard Euclidean setting. The proposed algorithm is applied to the adversarial prediction problem, where the authors reformulate the objective function to enable efficient solution methods. The approach is subsequently validated through experimental evaluation.
My primary concern with the paper lies in its presentation and writing style. The authors appear to have condensed a substantial amount of material into the limited space available, which occasionally renders the paper difficult to follow and somewhat taxing to read.
That said, the contributions are novel, albeit relatively straightforward, and I recommend the paper for acceptance.
