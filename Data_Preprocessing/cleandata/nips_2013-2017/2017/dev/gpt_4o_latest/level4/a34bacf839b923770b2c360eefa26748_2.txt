This paper introduces a framework for analyzing point processes, specifically aimed at predicting a function \( f(N(t)) \), where \( N(t) \) represents the count of events up to a given time \( t \). The authors derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) (Eq. 4) that governs the evolution of the probability distribution of \( N \) taking specific values at time \( t \), with the derivative in the ODE being with respect to \( t \). By approximating the solution to this ODE, the expectation of \( f \) can subsequently be computed.
As this paper falls outside my primary area of expertise, I recommend that the committee give significant weight to other reviewers' assessments of this work.
From my perspective as a non-expert, the paper would benefit from a clearer exposition. In particular, it is easy to "miss the bigger picture" amidst the technical details. While the paper offers a strong high-level introduction to the problem, it transitions too quickly into the mathematical formalism. Adding an intermediate level of explanation—perhaps a paragraph or two—would bridge this gap effectively. For example, the authors could provide a concrete example that makes the variables \( \lambda, \phi, f, N, H_t, \) etc., more tangible in the context of a specific application. This might include a clear statement of the input and output data. For instance, a few sentences along the lines of: "As an example, suppose we aim to predict \( X \) from \( Y \). We are given \( Z \) (denoted as \( W \) in the paper) and wish to predict \( A \) (denoted as \( B \) in the paper)." Such an explanation would greatly aid in contextualizing the mathematical framework and equations, which I could follow formally but found challenging to interpret in terms of practical applications.
Additional observations:
- Given the rising interest in "optimal transport" within the machine learning community, it may be worth clarifying that the term "mass transport" here refers to the ODE/PDE formulation for moving mass, rather than concepts like Wasserstein distances.
- Theorem 2 is intuitive, but it would be helpful to provide a brief explanation before diving into the proof sketch. Essentially, the equation describes how \( \phi(x,t) \) evolves due to two factors: (1) an event occurring in a regime that hasn't yet reached \( \phi(x,t) \), which increases \( \phi(x-1,t) \) (the second term), or (2) an additional event occurring, which increases \( \phi(x+1,t) \) (the first term).

- Line 190(ii): The phrase "compute the intensity function" feels vague—could this be clarified further?
- Paragraph starting at line 207: What does \( u \) represent in this context? This is not immediately clear.
