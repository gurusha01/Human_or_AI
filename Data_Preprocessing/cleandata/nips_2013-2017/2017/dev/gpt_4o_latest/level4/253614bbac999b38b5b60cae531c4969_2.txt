The authors present a more efficient mechanism for local differential privacy. Specifically, they introduce a 1-bit local differential privacy method for mean estimation in a distributed and effective manner, as well as a d-bit method for histogram estimation. These two objectives are highlighted as being particularly relevant for the collection of telemetry data. The primary contribution lies in the communication efficiency of the proposed methods, which is critical for large-scale deployment. The authors also mention that this mechanism has been implemented at scale in industry, potentially representing the largest deployment of differential privacy to date. While this industrial deployment does not directly enhance the scientific contribution, it underscores the practicality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the approach.
The authors have provided an additional version of their paper as supplementary material, which includes proofs, more figures, and extended sections of the main text. This approach is somewhat problematic, as supplementary material should only contain additional content, while the main paper should remain self-contained without redundancy. It is also inconvenient for reviewers to search for proofs within the supplementary material. A clearer separation between the main submission and supplementary material is necessary.
Overall, the paper is clearly presented, although this clarity is partly due to offloading parts of the content to the supplementary material. However, the section on alpha-rounding remains somewhat unclear. The authors are encouraged to provide further clarification regarding the guarantees associated with this component.
While the experimental study is compelling, there are concerns about the reproducibility of the results. Since the experiments appear to rely on real user and company data, it is unclear how future work could compare against these results. It would be helpful if the authors could provide an alternative solution, such as simulated data, to ensure that comparisons remain open and accessible to the research community. Nevertheless, the experiments are deemed convincing and effectively support the paper's main claims.
