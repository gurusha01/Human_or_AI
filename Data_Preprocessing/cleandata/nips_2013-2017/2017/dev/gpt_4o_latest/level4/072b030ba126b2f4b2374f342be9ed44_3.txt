The primary contribution of this paper is a convergence proof for minimizing the objective \( \sum fi(x) + g(x) \), where \( fi(x) \) is smooth and \( g(x) \) is nonsmooth, in an asynchronous setting. The problem is well-motivated, as there is, to the best of my knowledge, no existing proof addressing this scenario.
A central aspect of the work is the block separability of the variable, which facilitates decomposition in the prox step (since the gradient of each \( f_i \) typically affects only specific indices of \( x \)). This is a significant practical assumption, as without it, the prox operator could lead to locking issues, which are often unavoidable. (It would be interesting to explore whether element-wise prox operations, such as shrinkage, could also be decomposed in this framework.)
The paper presents two main theoretical results. Theorem 1 establishes a convergence rate for proxSAGA, which offers a slight improvement over prior results. Theorem 2 provides a convergence rate for the asynchronous setting, which is a more novel and impactful contribution.
Overall, I find this to be a strong paper with a valuable theoretical contribution that has practical relevance. While the sparsity assumption limits its generality, the authors acknowledge that addressing asynchrony without sparsity for nonsmooth functions remains an open problem, which is a fair and transparent statement.
Potential Major Concern:
- Theorem 2 heavily relies on a result from Leblond (2017), which assumes that \( g \) is smooth. It is unclear from the proof whether the portions borrowed from Leblond (2017) are valid without this assumption. This needs to be clarified.
Minor Comments on the Paper:
- Line 61: There is an unnecessary semicolon after "sparse."
- Line 127: Typo—"a a."
Minor Comments on the Proof (Primarily Theorem 1):
- Equation (14): The expression appears reversed—it should be \( x - z \), not \( z - x \).
- Line 425: Do you mean \( x^+ = x - \gamma v_i \)?
- Lemma 7: The right-hand side (RHS) could be divided by 2 (the triangle inequality in line 433 is loose).
- Line 435: The reference to the "third term" seems incorrect—it should be the "fourth term."
- Line 444: It is unclear why \( \mathbb{E}[Di] = I \). \( Di \) seems to depend on the problem structure rather than asynchrony.
- Equation (33): The two expressions appear identical—there seems to be a typo, possibly involving a missing \( T_i \).
- Line 447: The split and the relationship between \( \alphai \), \( \alphai^+ \), and \( \nabla f_i \) are not entirely clear.
- Line 448: There seems to be a mix-up in the second line, where \( \nabla fi(x^*) \) changes to \( \nabla fi(x) \).
While these issues should be addressed, none of them appear to undermine the core results, especially since the findings are closely related to previously established results.
Comments on Theorem 2 Proof:
I only skimmed the proof of Theorem 2, but it appears reasonable overall. However, the reliance on results from Leblond (2017) raises concerns, particularly regarding the assumptions on \( g \), which need to be made more explicit.
