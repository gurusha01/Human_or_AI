This paper is not the first to explore variational autoencoders with external memory modules, contrary to the authors' claim. For example:
Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu, Bo Zhang, "Learning to Generate with Memory," Proc. ICML 2016
addresses the same problem in a significantly more robust manner compared to this work (which I consider to be a relatively straightforward extension of existing VAEs).
Given the authors' failure to comprehensively identify and compare to all relevant prior work, this paper cannot be accepted to NIPS.
