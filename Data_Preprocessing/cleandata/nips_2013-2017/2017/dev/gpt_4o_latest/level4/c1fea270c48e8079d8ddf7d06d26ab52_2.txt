This paper explores the relationship between discrete and continuous methods for minimizing decomposable submodular functions. The authors present claims of improved theoretical time complexity bounds and demonstrate experimental results in the context of image segmentation.
1. On line 73 of page 2, instead of stating "improves the worst-case complexity by a factor of r," it would be more effective to explicitly outline the current state-of-the-art results and clearly delineate the paper's specific contributions. Without this context, readers may struggle to grasp the significance of the presented results.
2. On line 140 of the paper, the bounds provided involve the maximum value of the function. However, this assumption is only meaningful if the function is integer-valued. The authors should clarify this point. Additionally, it is important to specify whether the proposed algorithms are weakly polynomial or strongly polynomial.
3. On line 144, it would be helpful to inform the reader that when \( C_i \) is small (approximately \( O(1) \)), the parameter \( r \) must be at least \( O(n) \). Furthermore, the authors should provide a comparison of their results with the state-of-the-art running times for submodular minimization to contextualize their contributions.
4. In Corollary 3.4, the definition of an \(\epsilon\)-approximate solution should be explicitly stated to avoid ambiguity.
5. When presenting the algorithms, it would enhance readability and clarity to use the \texttt{algorithm} environment rather than plain text.
