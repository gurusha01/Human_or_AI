The paper introduces a method for estimating a shared representation of multiple weighted finite automata (WFA) through multitask spectral learning. To achieve this, the multitask problem is reformulated using novel vector-valued WFAs, which enable the extraction of a joint feature space via spectral learning. The proposed approach is evaluated on both synthetic data (randomly generated WFAs) and real-world data (task-related learning across 33 languages), demonstrating that the multitask framework outperforms single-task learning. Notably, this work appears to be the first to explore a multitask learning approach for WFAs.
A primary concern is the somewhat limited discussion of the context and motivation. The paper introduces the spectral learning (SL) of WFAs rather abruptly, without sufficiently elaborating on the scenarios in which SL-WFA is applicable, its relevance, or its advantages and limitations compared to other competing algorithms. While a brief related work section is included, it may not convincingly establish why the proposed approach is preferable. Additionally, the evaluation primarily compares SL-WFAs with multitask SL-WFAs (M-SL-WFAs). While this comparison effectively highlights the benefits of multitask learning over single-task learning, it does not provide insight into why the proposed approach, M-SL, should be chosen over alternative methods.
Despite these concerns, the paper presents a well-designed methodology for estimating joint feature maps, with promising applications in areas involving finite-state machines (as illustrated in language-related tasks). The methodology is further supported by theoretical guarantees, including upper bound conditions, and an analysis of computational complexity.
