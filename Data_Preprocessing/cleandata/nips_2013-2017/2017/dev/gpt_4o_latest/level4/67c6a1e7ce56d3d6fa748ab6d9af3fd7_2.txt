The paper presents a straightforward yet effective approach to integrating attention modeling into CNN-based action recognition frameworks.  
The manuscript is well-written, the proposed contribution is compelling, and the experimental results are persuasive.  
Minor comments:  
In Section 2, the term "performance" is mentioned without explicitly clarifying the evaluation metrics being used, except in [36], where it is noted that mean average precision is applied (however, the acronym mAP is not properly defined in this instance). This should be revised for greater clarity.  
Additionally, there are a few typographical errors that require further proofreading.
