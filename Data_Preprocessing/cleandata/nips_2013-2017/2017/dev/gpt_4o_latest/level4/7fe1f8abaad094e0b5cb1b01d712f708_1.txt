Review - Summary:  
The paper addresses the problem of solving two-player zero-sum games with imperfect information, such as poker. It introduces, as I understand it, two novel concepts: (1) "Reach," which enables the algorithm to leverage any advantage or "gift" obtained from the opponent's earlier mistakes during the game; and (2) "Nested," which involves dynamically re-solving subgames in real time using more detailed information. Specifically, while the original game may be solved as an abstraction, this approach allows for more precise solutions when encountering smaller subgames during play.
Opinion:  
Although I am not deeply familiar with the literature on game-solving and poker-playing algorithms, the paper appears to be well-written and presents intriguing and significant contributions to the field. A notable limitation is the relatively sparse explanation and discussion of the new techniques' contributions beyond the technical details, which made it challenging for me to fully assess their impact. However, the standout strength of the paper is that these techniques were instrumental in achieving the first victory over top human players in no-limit hold'em poker—a major milestone for AI as a whole.
Comments:  
I struggled to develop an intuition for why "Reach" is beneficial—specifically, how recognizing that Player 1 made an earlier mistake in the game tree enables improvements in a particular subgame. Gaining a clearer understanding of this would be valuable, as it seems to be a critical aspect of the paper's contributions.
After author response:  
The explanation provided for the intuition behind "Reach" was helpful—thank you.
