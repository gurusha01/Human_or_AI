The authors present Hybrid, a framework designed to estimate the probability mass function for point processes. The approach reformulates the problem as estimating the mass function conditioned on a given history and addresses it by solving the mass transport equation over successive intervals to compute the mass for future events up to the desired time \( t \). The proposed method demonstrates improved sampling efficiency compared to Monte Carlo (MC) methods.
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. In the context of applying this framework, is the intensity function \( \lambda(t) \) assumed to be pre-defined or learned from the data? My understanding is that it is pre-defined, as the first step (line 190) of generating history samples appears to rely on the intensity function.
2. When comparing the running time in line 52 and line 269, the evaluation criterion is achieving the same Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for \( \mu \). Would the same conclusion hold if the target metric were the MAPE of the probability mass function itself (i.e., \( P(N(t)) \))?
