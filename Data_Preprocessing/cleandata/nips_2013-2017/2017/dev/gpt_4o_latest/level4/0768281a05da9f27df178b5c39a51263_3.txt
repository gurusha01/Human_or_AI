The challenge of functionally aligning multi-subject fMRI datasets is a critical and complex issue in neuroimaging. Hyperalignment represents a well-known class of anatomy-independent functional alignment techniques. This manuscript introduces an extension to hyperalignment by leveraging a deep neural network kernel. While I am not sufficiently familiar with the literature to definitively assess its novelty, I believe this approach to be innovative. Although this research direction is not unexpected, it is a logical and promising avenue to explore, and the experimental results presented are highly impressive.
The methods are described in detail, with comprehensive proofs provided in the supplementary material. However, I found this section overly dense and lacking a clear summary of the final model design and parameter choices. Including a figure to visually outline the method would have been extremely beneficial. The related work is reviewed thoroughly. While the proposed method can be seen as a synthesis of several existing approaches, the individual components have been thoughtfully combined in a novel manner and implemented with care.
The experimental evaluation is commendably thorough, utilizing multiple open datasets and comparing against several competing methods. The authors provide detailed reporting of experimental setups, including the parameters used for each alignment method. However, additional details on preprocessing would have been valuable. There appears to be some parameter validation on the test data ("the best performance for each dataset is reported," p6), which is suboptimal. Nonetheless, the number of parameter values tested is limited, and the results are strong enough that they would likely hold under a more rigorous training/validation/test split. My primary concern with this section is that all reported results were computed by the authors themselves; it would strengthen the paper to reference comparable results from the existing literature.
The quality of the English is generally good but occasionally inconsistent. For instance, the phrase "time complexity fairly scales with data size" is unclear, and the sentence in which it appears is repeated three times throughout the manuscript (including once in the abstract). A round of proofreading would improve the overall clarity and polish of the text.
