The paper presents a novel hypothesis class complexity measure termed "split-sample growth rate," which quantifies the number of hypotheses that empirical risk minimization (ERM) can produce on a subsample comprising half the data. The authors establish generalization bounds based on this measure. The practical utility of the measure is illustrated through its application to optimal auctions, which exhibit notably simple split-sample growth rates.
I found the approach's simplicity to be compelling and the results to be significant. However, certain sections of the paper were dense and somewhat challenging to follow. A key shortcoming, in my view, is the absence of a concluding discussion on the potential broader applicability of the "split-sample growth rate" beyond auctions. I encourage the authors to address this in their response.
