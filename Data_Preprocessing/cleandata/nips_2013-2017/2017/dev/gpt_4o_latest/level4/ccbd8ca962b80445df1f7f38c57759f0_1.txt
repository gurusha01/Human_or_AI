The paper introduces an efficient approximation of the "Linear Fascicle Evaluation model" (LiFE), a framework commonly employed in tractography. A significant limitation of the LiFE model is its poor computational scalability, rendering it impractical for analyzing MRI data at full resolution. To address this, the authors propose a sparse approximation leveraging a Tucker model (tensor decomposition). They provide theoretical evidence that the proposed approximation is both accurate and achieves high compression, which is further substantiated through experimental validation. The proposed model and its accompanying analysis appear robust. However, my primary concern with the paper is the superficial treatment of the model's evaluation for tractography, which is limited to just a few lines of text. I acknowledge that the strict page limits of a NIPS paper constrain the authors' ability to provide a more comprehensive evaluation, so I am inclined to overlook this shortcoming.
Aside from this, the paper is exceptionally well-written, with clear and intuitive figures that guide the reader effectively. As someone who is not an expert in either tractography or tensor models, I found the paper highly accessible and enjoyable to read. I do want to emphasize that my perspective is that of a non-expert in these specific domains.
A few minor comments (not critical for the rebuttal):
*) In line 36, the authors note that tractography is poorly understood and that competing methods often yield vastly different results. They then argue that this motivates the use of convex models. I find this reasoning unconvincingâ€”differences in results are more likely attributable to varying modeling assumptions rather than whether a global optimum has been achieved.
*) Following the propositions: the authors take the time to explain the key aspects of their propositions in plain language. This effort is often overlooked by other authors, and I want to commend the authors for doing so, as it significantly enhances the paper's readability. Thank you!
*) In line 195, the sentence "...dataset Fig. 4.a." seems incorrect. Perhaps the figure reference should be enclosed in parentheses?
*) In line 202, there is a typo: "aproach" should be corrected to "approach."

After reviewing the rebuttal and the other reviews, I maintain my recommendation that this paper should be accepted.
