This paper tackles the significant and timely challenge of spike detection and sorting on multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Developing efficient algorithms for this task is crucial, given the growing prevalence of such experiments and the increasing number of neurons recorded simultaneously. Achieving scalability to the range of 10^4 to 10^6 electrodes is a demanding goal that necessitates advanced analytical techniques.
The authors have appropriately highlighted essential attributes such as robustness, scalability, modularity, and the incorporation of prior information as critical components for designing effective algorithms. The paper demonstrates the authors' strong familiarity with the methods and tools employed, as well as a solid understanding of the problem domain.
However, Algorithm 1, introduced early in the paper, does not add significant value. It is neither particularly clear nor more informative than the accompanying textual description. The overview section, while important, is not as well-written as it could be, covering a broad range of topics too quickly and lacking clarity.
Assessing the actual validity of the proposed algorithms is challenging. The neural network training stage, while intriguing, is difficult to fully comprehend in terms of its practical implementation. The reliance on training data, which may vary across different laboratories, raises concerns about generalizability. Although the authors provide some promising simulation results, it remains unclear how well the approach would perform in real-world scenarios.
In conclusion, this work presents a potentially interesting method, but its complexity, somewhat ad hoc nature, and lack of transparency in presentation detract from its appeal. While the approach is innovative, it is highly intricate, with much of the technical justification either missing from the main text or relegated to the extensive Supplementary Materials.
