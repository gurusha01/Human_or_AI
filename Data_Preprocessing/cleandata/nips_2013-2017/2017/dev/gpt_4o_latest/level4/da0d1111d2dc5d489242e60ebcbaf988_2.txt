The paper addresses the problem of online convex optimization (OCO) with constraints that are revealed in an online manner. To bypass the linear regret lower bound established by Mannor et al. [17] for adaptively chosen constraints, the authors focus on a setting where the constraints are generated stochastically. As a byproduct of this approach, the paper achieves improved results for related problems, such as OCO with long-term constraints.
The paper effectively reviews prior work and situates its contributions within the broader context. The primary algorithm proposed is a first-order online algorithm that performs an optimization step based on the instantaneous penalty and constraint functions. The formulation resembles the classical Zinkevich's Online Gradient Descent (OGD) update rule, with the addition of a term that incorporates the new constraint functions introduced at each time step. Furthermore, the algorithm employs an adaptive, time-varying regularization parameter (referred to as a "virtual queue" in the paper) to account for the constraint terms. As shown in Lemma 1, solving this formulation is equivalent to performing a Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-style step, where the "gradient" is augmented to include subgradients of the constraint functions. The virtual queue values are updated to serve as lower bounds on the cumulative constraint violations incurred up to the current time step.
From a theoretical perspective, the analysis linking regret to drift and related metrics appears standard. The most innovative aspect of the analysis lies in the drift argument and its adaptation to the ||Q(t)|| terms, as detailed in Lemma 7. The paper also includes an experimental evaluation of the algorithm on a distributed job scheduling problem, where the proposed method achieves comparable throughput to a prior approach called REACT while reducing costs by approximately 10%.
- The paper would benefit from explicitly highlighting the challenges involved in extending the PGD framework to handle time-varying constraints. Apart from the drift analysis, much of the argumentation seems routine once appropriate choices for the virtual queue values and related parameters are made.
- Additional intuition regarding the motivation behind the form of the virtual queue values (Equation 3) would be helpful. While it appears to act as a lower bound on cumulative violations (or "backlog"), providing more insight into its derivation would strengthen the paper.
- Do the results extend to online mirrored descent? While no immediate obstacles are apparent, some discussion on this point would be valuable.
- The experimental evaluation is somewhat limited.
