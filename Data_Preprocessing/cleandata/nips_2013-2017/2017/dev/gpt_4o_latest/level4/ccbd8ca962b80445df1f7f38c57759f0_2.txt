The authors propose a memory-efficient, approximate implementation of the LiFE method for track filtering and reweighting in diffusion MRI. The LiFE method assigns weights to a given set of white matter fibre tracks such that their overall distribution aligns with the apparent fibre density observed in the diffusion MRI data. In the original formulation, this was framed as a large non-negative least squares (NNLS) problem. In the present work, the authors approximate the design matrix using discrete atoms linked to fibre orientation, enabling the NNLS problem to be reformulated as a memory-efficient, sparse tensor representation. The performance of this approximation, along with the memory efficiency of the tensor encoding, is demonstrated on human brain data.
The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow. The conclusions are well-supported by the presented data. This work represents a significant contribution that will be of interest to the diffusion MRI tractography community. However, I have two main points of criticism:
1. I find the use of the terms "decomposition" and "factorization" in the title and throughout the text to be misleading. These terms are typically associated with methods like singular value decomposition or nonnegative matrix factorization, where a single matrix or tensor is expressed as a linear combination of unknown components that are computed simultaneously under specific constraints. In this work, the matrix M and its sparse tensor representation (D and Phi) are precomputed and provided as inputs to the method. Fundamentally, LiFE(sd) is solving for the remaining nonnegative weights, which represent only one factor in the tensor representation.
2. The stick model employed here accounts only for restricted, intra-axonal diffusion, neglecting hindered extracellular diffusion and free water compartments. Additionally, the axial diffusivity is fixed at 1 ms/μm² in this study. How suitable is this model and its fixed parameter value for the data used? What was the b-value of the acquisition, and is it sufficiently high to justify the assumption that CSF and extracellular diffusion are adequately attenuated?
