This paper introduces the concept of the split-sample growth rate, a novel sample complexity measure, and demonstrates its utility in analyzing the generalization error of empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithms. The authors show that the expected generalization error can be bounded by \(O(\sqrt{\log(\taûH(2m))/m})\), where \(\taûH(m)\) is the split-sample growth rate. This measure simplifies the analysis of sample complexity in various settings, particularly in optimal auction design, and offers a structural refinement of the Rademacher complexity framework. The paper also applies this measure to derive sample complexity bounds for several auction classes, achieving results comparable to or better than prior work using pseudo-dimension or Rademacher complexity.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Generality: The split-sample growth rate is a new and generalizable concept that strengthens existing Rademacher complexity analyses. Its applicability extends beyond auction design to general statistical learning theory, making it a potentially impactful contribution.
2. Simplification of Analysis: The proposed measure simplifies the derivation of sample complexity bounds, especially for auction classes. For example, the authors show that the sample complexity for single-item auctions with player-specific reserves can be bounded with straightforward counting arguments.
3. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical results, including a main theorem that bounds generalization error using the split-sample growth rate. The connections to local Rademacher complexity and effective hypothesis space are well-articulated.
4. Applications to Auctions: The paper demonstrates the practical utility of the measure by analyzing a variety of auction settings, including multi-item and multi-bidder scenarios, and provides improvements over prior work in some cases.
5. Clarity of Results: The high-level intuition and step-by-step derivation of bounds are clearly presented, making the results accessible to readers familiar with statistical learning theory.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the practical utility of the split-sample growth rate in real-world scenarios or other learning tasks beyond auctions.
2. Dependence on Markov's Inequality: The high-probability bounds rely on Markov's inequality, resulting in a suboptimal dependence on the confidence parameter (\(1/\delta\)) compared to the logarithmic dependence achieved by McDiarmid's inequality in standard Rademacher complexity analyses. This limitation is acknowledged but not fully addressed.
3. Scope of Applications: Although the split-sample growth rate is claimed to have broad applicability, the paper primarily focuses on auction design. Additional examples from other domains could strengthen the case for its general utility.
4. Assumptions on ERM: The results depend on specific properties of the ERM process, such as tie-breaking rules, which may not generalize to all learning settings.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- Introduces a novel and theoretically sound measure of sample complexity.
- Simplifies analysis for important problems in auction design.
- Provides improvements over prior work in some cases.
- Establishes connections to existing complexity measures like Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension.
Cons:
- Limited empirical validation and examples outside auction design.
- Suboptimal high-probability bounds due to reliance on Markov's inequality.
- Dependence on specific properties of ERM may limit generalizability.
Recommendation
This paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing the split-sample growth rate and demonstrating its utility in auction design and statistical learning theory. While the lack of empirical validation and broader applications is a limitation, the novelty and rigor of the theoretical results warrant acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity of assumptions and potential extensions to other domains.
