This paper addresses the problem of Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, extending Zinkevich's foundational OCO framework to include multiple stochastic functional constraints that are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and only revealed after decisions are made. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves \(O(\sqrt{T})\) expected regret and constraint violations, and \(O(\sqrt{T} \log(T))\) high-probability bounds for both metrics. The paper also includes experiments on a real-world data center scheduling problem, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed approach.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The paper makes a significant contribution by generalizing OCO to stochastic constraints, a setting that naturally arises in applications like online routing in wireless networks and data center scheduling. This extension fills a gap in the literature and builds on prior work such as Zinkevich (2003) and Mannor et al. (2009).
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving upon prior results for special cases like OCO with long-term constraints and stochastic constrained convex optimization. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with clear derivations of regret and constraint violation bounds.
3. Practical Relevance: The experimental results on data center scheduling are compelling, showing that the algorithm performs comparably to the best fixed decision in hindsight while outperforming baseline methods like "react" and "low-power" in balancing electricity cost and job servicing.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, theoretical results, and experimental setup. The use of lemmas and theorems to structure the analysis is effective.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions: The paper assumes i.i.d. stochastic constraints and bounded subgradients, which may limit applicability in scenarios where constraints are non-i.i.d. or subgradients are unbounded. While the authors acknowledge this, a discussion of potential extensions to non-i.i.d. settings would strengthen the paper.
2. Empirical Scope: The experiments focus on a single application (data center scheduling). While this is a relevant and challenging problem, additional experiments in other domains (e.g., online portfolio selection or wireless networks) would provide broader validation of the algorithm's utility.
3. Algorithm Complexity: The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, particularly in high-dimensional settings, is not explicitly discussed. This could be a concern for practitioners dealing with large-scale problems.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper addresses a well-motivated and challenging problem with significant theoretical and practical implications.
- It provides rigorous theoretical guarantees and demonstrates empirical success in a real-world application.
- The work advances the state of the art in OCO with constraints, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Con:
- The assumptions on i.i.d. constraints and bounded subgradients may limit the generality of the results.
- The experimental validation could be more comprehensive, covering a wider range of applications.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to OCO with stochastic constraints are both novel and impactful, and the theoretical and empirical results are strong. Addressing the noted limitations in future work would further enhance its impact.
