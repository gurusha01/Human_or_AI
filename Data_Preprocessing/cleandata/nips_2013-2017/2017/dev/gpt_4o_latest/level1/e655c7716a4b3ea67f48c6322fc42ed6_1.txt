This paper introduces a novel multitask learning framework for weighted finite automata (WFAs) by leveraging vector-valued WFAs (vv-WFAs). The authors propose a spectral learning algorithm for vv-WFAs that jointly learns multiple related tasks, enforcing the discovery of a shared representation space. The theoretical contributions include defining a measure of relatedness between tasks, extending the classical Fliess theorem to vector-valued functions, and providing a robust multitask spectral learning algorithm (MT-SL). The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing improved performance in multitask settings, particularly when tasks are closely related.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The introduction of vv-WFAs as a generalization of WFAs is a significant contribution. This model provides a natural framework for multitask learning in sequence-based tasks, addressing a gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper is grounded in solid theoretical analysis, including the extension of the Fliess theorem to vector-valued functions and the development of a relatedness measure. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is further supported by leveraging recent results in singular subspace estimation.
3. Practical Relevance: The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable, as demonstrated by its application to real-world datasets (e.g., Universal Dependencies PoS tagging). The experiments highlight the practical utility of MT-SL in scenarios with limited target task data.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic and real-world data convincingly demonstrate the advantages of multitask learning using vv-WFAs, particularly in low-data regimes. The comparison with baseline methods (SL and SL-bagging) is thorough and well-motivated.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the theoretical sections are rigorous, they are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with spectral learning or tensor algebra. The paper could benefit from additional intuitive explanations and visualizations to aid understanding.
2. Limited Exploration of Relatedness: The relatedness measure Ï„ is introduced but not deeply analyzed in the experiments. It would be valuable to explore how varying levels of relatedness between tasks impact the performance of MT-SL.
3. Baseline Comparisons: The paper compares MT-SL primarily with single-task spectral learning (SL) and a naive SL-bagging approach. Including comparisons with other multitask learning methods (e.g., neural networks or Bayesian approaches) would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
4. Scope of Applications: While the paper mentions potential applications in reinforcement learning and other domains, the experiments are limited to sequence modeling tasks. A broader range of applications would better demonstrate the versatility of vv-WFAs.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a novel and well-justified contribution to multitask learning for sequence data, a relatively underexplored area.
- The theoretical insights are sound and extend existing work in spectral learning.
- The empirical results are compelling and demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed approach.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The dense theoretical presentation may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
- The experimental evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse baselines and applications.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning and spectral methods. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and evaluation breadth, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address clarity and expand baseline comparisons.
