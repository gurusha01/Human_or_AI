This paper presents a comprehensive study on the connections between discrete and continuous approaches for decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM). The authors provide improved running time estimates for state-of-the-art continuous algorithms using combinatorial arguments and conduct a systematic experimental comparison of discrete and continuous methods.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors improve the worst-case complexity bound of the most recent continuous optimization methods by a factor of r, the number of functions in the decomposition, and (2) they provide a systematic experimental comparison of discrete and continuous approaches, revealing a tradeoff between the two methods.
The support for these claims is strong, with a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The authors use a combination of discrete and continuous optimization techniques, including the alternating projections algorithm, random coordinate descent, and accelerated random coordinate descent. They also provide a detailed analysis of the condition numbers and running times of these algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field, citing relevant literature and providing a clear overview of the problem and its applications. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a clear discussion of the tradeoffs between discrete and continuous methods.
The usefulness of the paper is high, as it provides new insights into the connections between discrete and continuous approaches for DSFM and presents a comprehensive evaluation of different algorithms. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear outline of the contributions and limitations of their work.
The originality of the paper is also high, as the authors present new theoretical results and experimental evaluations that advance the state-of-the-art in DSFM. The paper is well-suited for the NIPS conference, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and optimization.
