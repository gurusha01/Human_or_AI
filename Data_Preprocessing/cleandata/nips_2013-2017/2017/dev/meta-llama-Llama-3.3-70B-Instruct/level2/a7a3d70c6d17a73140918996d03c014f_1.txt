This paper introduces a new measure of sample complexity, referred to as the split-sample growth rate, which is used to bound the expected generalization error in the context of optimal auction design. The authors show that this measure can greatly simplify the analysis of sample complexity for many auction classes, and they provide several examples to demonstrate its applicability.
The main claim of the paper is that the expected generalization error is upper bounded by O (√ log(τ̂H(2m)) m ), where τ̂H(m) is the split-sample growth rate of the hypothesis space H at value m. This claim is supported by a strengthening of the Rademacher complexity analysis of the expected generalization error.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of optimal auction design and the concept of sample complexity, and they carefully explain the intuition behind the split-sample growth rate.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide a simple and intuitive analysis of sample complexity for many auction classes, and its potential to be applicable to general statistical learning theory. The authors also provide several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including single-item auctions, multiple-item auctions, and auctions with player-specific reserves.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it assumes that the revenue of any auction lies in the range [0, 1], which may not be realistic in all scenarios. However, the authors note that this assumption can be relaxed by re-scaling the equations, which would lead to a blow-up in the sample complexity of the order of an extra (β − α) multiplicative factor.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimal auction design and sample complexity analysis. The split-sample growth rate is a useful tool for bounding the expected generalization error, and the authors' approach has the potential to be widely applicable.
