This manuscript is not pioneering in its exploration of variational autoencoders integrated with external memory modules, contrary to the authors' assertion. Notably, preceding research such as the work by Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu, and Bo Zhang, "Learning to Generate with Memory," presented at ICML 2016, has already effectively addressed this issue with a more robust approach. In comparison, the current method appears to be a relatively straightforward extension of existing VAE frameworks. Given the authors' oversight in comprehensively identifying and comparing their work to relevant studies, this paper falls short of the standards required for acceptance at NIPS.
