This manuscript proposes a logical expansion of spectral techniques for learning Weighted Finite Automata (WFAs) into a multitask framework. The core concept, which involves jointly training WFAs that share common underlying operators but have distinct ending vectors, is straightforward. The notion that this shared structure represents a common latent space across tasks appears well-founded. The paper is well-organized, concise, and accessible, making it easy to follow.
While the underlying idea may seem intuitive to those familiar with spectral learning of WFAs, it appears to be an original contribution. The simplicity of the concept belies its potential impact, and I consider this a valuable addition to the field. One potential drawback is that the proposed definition of relatedness may be overly restrictive for practical learning scenarios. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore potential methods for relaxing this definition of relatedness to enhance the applicability of their approach.
