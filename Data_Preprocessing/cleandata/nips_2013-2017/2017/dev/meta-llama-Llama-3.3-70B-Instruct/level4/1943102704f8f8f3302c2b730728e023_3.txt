This manuscript tackles the timely and significant challenge of detecting and sorting spikes on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), a problem whose importance is amplified by the growing number of such experiments and the increasing number of neurons recorded simultaneously. The development of efficient algorithms capable of scaling to regimes of 10^4 to 10^6 electrodes poses a substantial challenge, necessitating advanced analytical techniques.
The authors have appropriately highlighted the crucial attributes of robustness, scalability, modularity, and the incorporation of prior knowledge in the design of effective algorithms. The paper demonstrates a comprehensive command of various methods and a deep understanding of the problem domain, showcasing the authors' familiarity and expertise.
However, Algorithm 1, presented early in the manuscript, lacks clarity and readability, failing to provide significant additional insight beyond the textual description. While the overview section is essential reading, its rapid coverage of a broad range of topics compromises its clarity.
Evaluating the validity and efficacy of the proposed algorithms proves challenging. Specifically, the neural network training phase, although intriguing, is difficult to comprehend in terms of its practical implementation. The requirement for training data, which may vary between laboratories, raises concerns about the algorithm's generalizability and performance, despite the authors' provision of simulation results.
In conclusion, this approach holds potential interest, yet its complexity, apparent ad hoc nature, and opaque presentation detract from its appeal. Although the method is intriguing, its technical underpinnings are not fully elaborated in the main manuscript, with substantial justifications relegated to the supplementary materials.
