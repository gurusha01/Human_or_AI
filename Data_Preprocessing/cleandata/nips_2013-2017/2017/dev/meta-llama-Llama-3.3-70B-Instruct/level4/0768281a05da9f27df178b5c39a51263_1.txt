This paper presents a novel hyperalignment approach that leverages neural networks instead of basis functions, building upon a framework akin to kernel hyperalignment. The proposed method is validated on multiple real fMRI datasets, demonstrating improved classification accuracy and reduced computational time compared to another deep learning architecture.
Several concerns arise regarding the paper's contributions:
1. The originality of this work is questionable, as it appears to combine existing concepts. Replacing basis functions with neural networks may lead to a more challenging optimization problem, and the optimization procedure seems to draw inspiration from prior research.
2. Notable works on functional alignment, such as those by Georg Lang, are absent from the references.
3. The primary goal of alignment is to establish subject correspondence, enabling the modeling of subject variability. However, the use of a classification task to evaluate the method makes it difficult to discern whether improved classification performance is due to better alignment or a more effective functional representation. Moreover, it is unclear how to map the aligned data back to the original anatomical space for interpretative purposes.
4. The non-uniqueness of G may significantly impact the results, which warrants further investigation.
5. The reported results may be biased due to overfitting, as they represent the best performance across a range of parameter values rather than being obtained through proper nested cross-validation. More flexible models tend to perform better, and the choice of parameter range can substantially influence the outcomes.
6. Given that functional hyperalignment presumably does not require pre-anatomical alignment, it is essential to determine whether the observed performance gain persists when spatial normalization is not performed.
