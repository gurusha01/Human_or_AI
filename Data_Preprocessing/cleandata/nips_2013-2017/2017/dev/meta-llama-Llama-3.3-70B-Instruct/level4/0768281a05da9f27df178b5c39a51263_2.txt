This study presents an enhanced version of the hyperalignment (HA) technique, specifically designed for functional alignment across subjects. The proposed deep hyperalignment (DHA) method effectively addresses key limitations of existing HA approaches, including nonlinearity, scalability, and high-dimensionality. By redefining the HA objective function in terms of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations using a multi-layer kernel function, DHA enables the optimization process to be performed on large datasets with numerous subjects. The method involves reformulating the objective function using templates and eigendecomposition, with an explicit derivative derived to facilitate optimization. The performance of DHA is evaluated using standard SVM classification and compared to prominent HA algorithms in the literature, with experiments conducted on five task-based datasets and two movie-based datasets. The results demonstrate that DHA outperforms other algorithms in all cases.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, although Section 3 ("Deep Hyperalignment") may benefit from simplification to improve readability. While the mathematical derivations of the proposed method are not within my area of expertise, the experimental evidence presented is compelling and significant, with no major issues identified in the paper.
