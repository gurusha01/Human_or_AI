This paper introduces a novel approach to learning a shared representation of multiple weighted finite automata (WFAs) through multitask spectral learning. By formulating the multitask problem as vector-valued WFAs, the authors extract a joint feature space using spectral learning techniques. The methodology is validated on both synthetic data, comprising randomly generated WFAs, and real-world data, involving task-related learning across 33 languages, demonstrating the superiority of the multitask approach over single-task learning. Notably, this work appears to pioneer the application of multitask learning to WFAs.
A significant suggestion for improvement lies in enhancing the contextualization and motivational background of the approach. The paper promptly delves into spectral learning of WFAs without adequately elaborating on the scenarios, motivations, and contextual advantages of employing spectral learning for WFAs, or discussing the comparative benefits and drawbacks of alternative algorithms. Although a brief related work section is included, it may not sufficiently justify the superiority of the proposed multitask spectral learning approach over existing methods. Furthermore, the evaluation primarily focuses on comparing single-task and multitask spectral learning of WFAs, which, while informative for assessing the multitask approach, does not provide a comprehensive rationale for choosing the proposed method over other available techniques.
Despite these considerations, the paper presents a robust methodology for estimating joint feature maps, holding promise for applications involving finite-state machines, as exemplified by language-related tasks. The methodology is rigorously supported by theoretical analyses, including upper bound conditions and computational complexity assessments, underscoring its potential and validity.
