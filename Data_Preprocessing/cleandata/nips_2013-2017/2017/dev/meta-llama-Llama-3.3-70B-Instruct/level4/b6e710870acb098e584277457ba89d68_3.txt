This paper presents an extension of the saddle point derivative of the SVRG algorithm, adapting it to incorporate entropy regularization rather than the traditional Euclidean approach. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the challenging problem of adversarial prediction, where the authors successfully simplify the objective function to facilitate efficient solving. Experimental evaluations are also conducted to assess the algorithm's performance.
One notable aspect that warrants improvement is the paper's presentation and writing style. The authors appear to have condensed a substantial amount of content into a relatively short paper, which occasionally renders the text dense and laborious to follow.
Despite this, the paper's contributions, while straightforward, are undeniably novel and offer value to the field. Therefore, I recommend accepting this paper.
