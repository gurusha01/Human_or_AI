The authors introduce a innovative approach to inference in Gaussian processes with linear equality constraints, differing from existing methods that rely on techniques like data augmentation. Instead, the proposed method seamlessly integrates the linear constraints into the GP kernel, ensuring that all samples from the GP adhere to the constraints, thus providing an elegant solution to linearly constrained GP regression problems.
A significant challenge with this approach lies in identifying an operator Gx that spans the nullspace of Fx, a task that is not straightforward. Although Algorithm 1 proposes an iterative method for constructing such an operator, it lacks clear guidance on the critical step of selecting a set of scalar operators (\xig). While the choice of differential operators in the running example seems intuitive given the form of Fx, a more general approach to selecting these operators is unclear. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether such an operator is guaranteed to exist.
Minor suggestions include:
- Reordering the structure to place Section 3.1, which discusses related concepts, under a "Related Work" section, ideally positioned before Section 3 for a more logical flow.
- Enhancing the formality of the explanation regarding the interpretation of Fx and Gx as matrices and the consideration of F_x[f] as matrix-vector multiplications, as the current discussion may leave readers questioning the validity and applicability of this perspective.
