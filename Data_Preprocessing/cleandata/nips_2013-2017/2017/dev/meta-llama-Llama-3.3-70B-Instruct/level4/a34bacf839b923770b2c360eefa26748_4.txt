In essence, this study explores the application of Rao-Blackwellization to reduce variance in general point processes. The key idea involves conditioning on the process-generated filtration and solving the differential equation that governs the temporal evolution of the associated conditional distributions. This approach is made feasible by restricting the analysis to discrete state spaces, which are rendered finite through appropriate truncation, and leveraging numerical integration for time discretization. While I consider the contribution to be innovative and potentially valuable in practical contexts, I think it is essential for the authors to provide more clarity regarding the effects of spatial truncation and temporal discretization on their methodology. Specifically, the assertion that their approach yields unbiased estimators is not entirely accurate when considering these approximations. However, I suggest that debiasing techniques, such as those outlined by McLeish (2010) and Rhee and Glynn (2015), could be utilized to address this issue. Additionally, a minor error was noted on page 5, line 190, where the estimator form for the expectation of test function f omits averaging over replicates.
