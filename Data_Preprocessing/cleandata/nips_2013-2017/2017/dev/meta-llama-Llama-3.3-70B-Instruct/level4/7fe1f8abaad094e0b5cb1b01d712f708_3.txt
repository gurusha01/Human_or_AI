The authors propose algorithms and experimental results for addressing zero-sum imperfect information extensive-form games, using heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em poker as a primary application. 
They commence by clarifying the difference between "unsafe" and "safe" subgame solving methods. The unsafe approach fixes the opponent's strategy outside the subgame, thereby maintaining a constant distribution of the player's state within the initial information set. In contrast, the safe method allows the opponent's strategy within the subgame's head to vary, making the distribution of true states responsive to the player's strategy.
The authors then introduce "reach" subgame solving, which involves calculating a "gift" for each path leading to the subgame. This gift represents the additional value the opponent could have obtained by choosing a different subgame and is added to the margin for each information set.
Furthermore, they propose nested subgame solving as a means to handle large action spaces. This involves computing the trunk strategy for an abstracted version of the game, while generating and solving new subgames on-the-fly whenever the opponent plays an action not included in the abstraction.
Experimental results indicate that combining these two methods yields highly effective outcomes in practice.
Overall, the presentation is well-organized and easy to follow, with impressive algorithm performance. However, there are a few minor suggestions for improvement:
1. The concept of gifts is motivated as enabling P2 to be less concerned with P1 reaching the subgame along a particular path (L.173-174). It would be beneficial to provide more concrete explanation, such as how the gift can be added to the margin because it measures the unattractiveness of a branch to the opponent, aligning with the goal of max-margin solving to make the subgame as unattractive as possible to the opponent.
2. The authors note (L.297-303) that despite having better theoretical guarantees, the no-split variants consistently outperform the split variants. They mention that scaling gifts too aggressively can affect this, but it is unclear how this relates to the experimental results, which do not involve scaling. It would be helpful to know if awarding the full gift to every subgame without division or scaling ever results in worse exploitability in practice. If so, an example would be appreciated; if not, the authors' intuition on this matter would be valuable. Additionally, while any split supposedly suffices for theoretical guarantees (L.210), it is apparent that some splits may leave more value unexploited than others.
3. At L.88, "Figure 4a" is likely a typo and should be corrected to "Figure 1".
