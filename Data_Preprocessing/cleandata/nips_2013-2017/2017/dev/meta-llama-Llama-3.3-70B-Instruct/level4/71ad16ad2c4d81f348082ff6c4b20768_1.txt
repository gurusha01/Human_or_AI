UPDATE: Thank you for your response, which has been read.
This manuscript explores a fascinating topic, namely, the incorporation of symmetries or invariances into kernels, with a primary focus on Bayesian nonparametric regression. In this context, constraints can be imposed as prior information, although the form of the regression function remains unspecified. A notable example of such a constraint arises when the modeled field is known to be of the divergence type, ensuring the conservation of a specific physical quantity. Previous research in this area has included the development of ANOVA kernels and Stein's method-based kernels, both of which are constrained to have vanishing integrals. The present work distinguishes itself by attempting to accommodate more general forms of constraints, a commendable effort given the widespread use of generic kernels in machine learning applications without strong physical justification.
Although I believe the proposed method lacks generality and is not supported by a theoretical framework that would guarantee its effectiveness beyond special cases, it remains an interesting contribution that could be suitably included in the NIPS proceedings.
Several suggestions for improvement are noted:
- The authors should contextualize their work in relation to the existing literature, specifically "Learning with Algebraic Invariances, and the Invariant Kernel Trick" by Franz J. Király, Andreas Ziehe, and Klaus-Robert Müller.
- The claim on page 4 that the prior for f "inherits" the properties of the prior for g is incorrect. If g has a prior GP(0,k) where k generates a Sobolev space of order b, and \mathcal{F} is a differential operator of order c, then the prior on f would be related to a Sobolev space of order b - c, indicating different smoothness properties for f and g.
- The equation "fi = \Phii \xi f" on page 5 appears to be presented without loss of generality, but it is actually an ansatz. This should be clearly labeled as such, similar to the equation "g = \Gamma \xi^g", to avoid confusion.
- The limited applicability of the method should be more explicitly acknowledged, potentially through the inclusion of an example where the method fails, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and limitations.
