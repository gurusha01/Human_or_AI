This paper presents a significant contribution by providing a convergence proof for the minimization of the sum of functions fi(x) and g(x), where fi(x) is smooth and g(x) is nonsmooth, in an asynchronous setting. The problem addressed is well-motivated, as there is a lack of existing proofs for this scenario, to the best of my knowledge.
A crucial aspect of this work is the block separability of the variable, which enables decomposition gains in the proximal step, as the gradient of each fi(x) only affects specific indices of x. This assumption is practically important, as it avoids potential locks in the proximal operation. It would be interesting to explore the decomposition of element-wise proximal operators, such as shrinkage.
The paper presents two primary theoretical results. Theorem 1 establishes a convergence rate for proxSAGA, which improves upon a previous result. Theorem 2 provides a convergence rate for an asynchronous setting, which is a more significant and groundbreaking contribution.
Overall, I consider this to be a good paper with a valuable theoretical contribution that is also practically useful. However, the paper would be stronger without the sparsity assumption, although the authors acknowledge that investigating asynchrony without sparsity for nonsmooth functions is an open problem.
One potential major comment is that Theorem 2 relies heavily on a result from Leblond (2017), which assumes smooth g's. It is unclear whether the borrowed results require this assumption, and clarification is needed.
Minor comments on the paper include:
- Line 61: a semicolon is needed after "sparse".
- Line 127: "a a" should be corrected.
Minor comments on the proof, primarily for Theorem 1, include:
- Equation (14) is incorrect, as it should be x-z instead of z-x.
- Line 425: it seems that x+ should be defined as x - gamma vi.
- Lemma 7 can be improved by dividing the RHS by 2, as the triangle inequality in line 433 is loose.
- Line 435: the reference to the third term is incorrect, as it should be the fourth term.
- Line 444: the explanation for EDi = I is unclear, as Di relates to problem structure, not asynchrony.
- Equation (33) appears to contain a typo, with missing Ti.
- Line 447: the split and relationship between alpha i, alpha i+, and grad fi are unclear.
- Line 448: there seems to be a mix-up, with nabla fi(x*) being replaced by nabla fi(x).
While these comments require attention, they do not seem fatal, especially given the similarity to previously proven results. I have only briefly reviewed the proof of Theorem 2, which appears reasonable, except for the concern regarding the borrowed results from Leblond (2017) and the need for clearer assumptions on g.
