This manuscript presents a theoretical framework for analyzing point processes, specifically focusing on predicting a function f(N(t)), where N(t) represents the cumulative number of events occurring up to time t. The authors derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) (equation 4) that governs the evolution of the probability distribution of N(t) over time, with the derivative taken with respect to time t. By approximating the solution to this ODE, the expectation of f can be subsequently calculated.
Given that this paper falls outside my area of expertise, I recommend that the committee carefully consider the evaluations provided by other reviewers.
From an outsider's perspective, the manuscript could benefit from revisions to enhance its exposition. The introduction provides a clear overview of the problem, but the transition to the mathematical formulation is abrupt. Adding a intermediate level of detail, such as a paragraph or two, would help bridge this gap. For instance, illustrating the variables lambda, phi, f, N, and H_t with a concrete example, including a clear description of the input and output data, would facilitate understanding. A brief statement, such as "Suppose we aim to predict X from Y, given Z (denoted by variables W) and seeking to predict A (denoted by B)," would provide valuable context and enable a clearer comprehension of the mathematical developments.
Notable points include:
* The concept of "mass transport" refers to the ODE/PDE governing the movement of mass, distinct from the notion of optimal transport in machine learning, which often involves Wasserstein distances.
* Theorem 2 is intuitively reasonable, and a brief explanation preceding the proof sketch would be helpful. Essentially, the equation describes how phi(x,t) changes due to two possible reasons: an event occurring in a regime that has not yet reached phi(x,t), increasing phi(x-1,t) (represented by the second term), or an additional event occurring, which increments phi(x+1,t) (captured by the first term).
* On line 153, it is unclear why the upper bound for x should be known a priori.
* On line 190(ii), the phrase "compute the intensity function" appears vague and could be clarified.
* In the paragraph starting on line 207, the variable u is introduced without explanation, and its meaning should be defined.
