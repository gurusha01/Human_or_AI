The authors introduce Hybrid, a novel framework for estimating the probability mass function of point processes. By conditioning the mass function on a given history, they formulate the problem as solving the mass transport equation over successive intervals to derive the mass for future times up to a specified point t. This approach demonstrates improved sampling efficiency over traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods.
To enhance clarity, the authors should provide additional details on the following aspects:
(1) Could the authors clarify whether the intensity function, \lambda(t), is predetermined or inferred from the data when applying this framework? Based on the initial step of generating history samples (line 190), which relies on the intensity function, it is assumed to be predefined.
(2) In the comparison of running times (lines 52 and 269), the benchmark is achieving an equivalent Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) on \mu. It would be beneficial to know if the same conclusion holds when the target is the MAPE of the probability mass function itself, specifically P(N(t)).
