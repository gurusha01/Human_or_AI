This paper explores the relationships between discrete and continuous methods for minimizing decomposable submodular functions, asserting improved theoretical time complexity bounds and experimental outcomes in image segmentation.
1. On page 2, line 73, rather than stating that the approach "improves the worst-case complexity by a factor of r", it would be beneficial to contextualize the current state-of-the-art results and clearly outline the contribution of this paper, as this would provide readers with a deeper understanding of the significance of the findings presented.
2. The bounds mentioned in line 140 of the page incorporate the maximum value of the function, which is only applicable when the function is integer-valued. The authors should provide clarification on this point and specify whether the algorithms in question are weakly polynomial or strongly polynomial.
3. In line 144, it is advisable to inform the reader that when C_i is relatively small, approximately O(1), the value of r must be at least O(n). Furthermore, a comparison of the results with the current state-of-the-art submodular minimization running time would be insightful, highlighting how this work advances the field.
4. The definition of epsilon-approximate, as referenced in Corollary 3.4, requires clarification to ensure that readers fully comprehend the implications and the precision of the approximation method employed.
5. When introducing algorithms, utilizing the \algorithm environment would be preferable to plain text, as it would enhance the readability and presentation of the technical content, making it easier for readers to follow and understand the methodologies described.
