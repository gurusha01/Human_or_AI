Review- Summary:
The concept of Rademacher complexity provides a robust framework for establishing generalization guarantees. Specifically, the Rademacher complexity of a class H on a sample S can be approximated as the expected maximum discrepancy between training and test performance when S is randomly divided into training and test sets, with the maximum taken over all h in H (eqn 11). This paper introduces a key observation that the fundamental steps in the standard generalization bound proof remain valid if, instead of considering the maximum over all h in H, one focuses solely on the h's that the procedure can potentially output when given half of a double sample (Lemma 1). Although the typical final high-probability step in this argument does not directly apply, the paper demonstrates (Theorem 2) that a useful generalization bound can still be obtained through alternative means. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how this generalization bound yields favorable sample complexity guarantees for various natural auction classes, in some cases surpassing the best prior guarantees and simplifying their analysis.
Evaluation:
While the core idea can be viewed as an observation to some extent, the paper's value lies in its presentation of a neat and instructive concept that could be effectively taught in a classroom setting. This concept enables a simpler sample complexity analysis for auctions, which is a significant advantage. Additionally, it may have further applications. However, a limitation of the paper is that it does not address whether the linear dependence on 1/delta in Theorem 2 is necessary, which would enhance the paper's completeness. Overall, the paper's contributions outweigh its limitations, leading to a positive assessment.
Questions:
Is the linear dependence on delta in Theorem 2 inherent, or can alternative approaches yield an O(log(1/delta)) bound? The current proof relies on Markov's inequality, and while the paper explains why McDiarmid's inequality cannot be used to achieve an O(log(1/delta)) bound, it leaves open the possibility of other methods or the existence of D,H with a heavier-tailed chance of failure. Resolving this question would contribute to the paper's completeness. Moreover, can a bound similar to Theorem 2 be expressed in terms of the maximum number of hypotheses producible from half of the actual sample S, rather than the supremum over S of size m in the definition of \hat{\tau}?
Suggestions:
The proof of Lemma 1 essentially follows the standard Rademacher bound proof, with modifications to replace H with \hat{H}_{S \union S'}. To clarify the novelty of the approach, it would be beneficial to explicitly inform the reader of this adaptation at the outset. A similar discussion, as seen in Theorem 2, highlighting the differences from the usual argument, would be quite useful. In Section 4, when examining various scenarios, it would be more accurate to state that "an optimal auction belongs to the hypothesis class H of ..." rather than "the space of hypotheses H is ...", as the generalization guarantees apply to any H, and the meaningful H is being specified for each scenario. Additionally, it is worth noting that the concept of counting possible outputs of an auction mechanism to obtain sample complexity bounds has been previously explored in the auction literature, such as in the FOCS 2005 paper "Mechanism design via machine learning" by Balcan, Blum, Hartline, and Mansour, although in a transductive setting where the argument is more straightforward.
