This paper presents an extension of the matrix-based LiFE model to a tensor-based LiFEsd model, enabling the representation of measured diffusion signals (dRMI) in brain connectomes generated via tractography algorithms. The proposed model achieves this by factorizing a 3rd-order encoded candidate connectome tensor into a coefficient core tensor Phi, a factor dictionary D, and a weight vector w, thereby providing a compact multi-linear representation. This enhancement allows the LiFEsd model to significantly reduce the size of the LiFE model while maintaining its approximation accuracy.
The strengths of this paper include its application of tensor decomposition methods to estimate brain connectomes, a novel approach that holds significant potential in neuroscience, particularly in handling big data. The paper also provides comparative analysis results, such as accuracy and size compression, when benchmarked against the matrix-based model. Furthermore, the clarity of the writing makes the paper accessible.
However, there are notable weaknesses. From a methodological standpoint, the paper's novelty appears somewhat limited. The ENCODE component has been previously proposed in [10], and the incremental contribution primarily lies in the decomposition aspect, which involves factorizing Mv into factor D and slices Phiv. 
A significant omission in the experimental section is the comparison of the optimized connectome's effect with that of the LiFE model. Including this comparison would provide insight into the performance differences and the effectiveness of the tensor-based LiFE_sd model, a crucial aspect that is currently missing.
