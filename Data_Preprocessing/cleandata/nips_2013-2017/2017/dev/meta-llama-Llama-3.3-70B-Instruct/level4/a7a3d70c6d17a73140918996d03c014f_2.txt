This paper presents a novel hypothesis class complexity measure, referred to as the "split-sample growth rate", which quantifies the number of possible hypotheses that can be output by Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) on a subsample comprising half of the data. The authors establish generalization bounds utilizing this measure and demonstrate its utility through an application to optimal auctions, characterized by remarkably simple split-sample growth rates.
The approach's simplicity and the significance of the results are notable, although the paper's density and complexity in certain sections make it challenging to follow. A significant oversight, in my view, is the absence of a conclusion that discusses the potential of the "split-sample growth rate" to be applied beyond the realm of auctions. I request that the authors address this in their response.
Specifically, I suggest the following revisions: On Line 23, the comma after the initial phrase could be removed for improved clarity. Line 106 would benefit from rephrasing to avoid the phrase "by doing so", instead opting for a more direct explanation. The statement and proof of Lemma 1 are somewhat opaque and warrant simplification for easier comprehension. A closing bracket appears to be missing on Line 160, which should be corrected for readability. Lastly, it would enhance understanding if the authors could explicitly show the derivation on Line 162, providing a clearer insight into their methodology.
