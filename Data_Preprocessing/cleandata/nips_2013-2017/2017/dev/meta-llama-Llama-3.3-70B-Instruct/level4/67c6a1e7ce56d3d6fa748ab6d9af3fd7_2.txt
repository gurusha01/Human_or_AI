This paper presents a straightforward yet effective approach to integrating attention modelling into CNN-based action recognition networks. The manuscript is well-organized, the contribution is noteworthy, and the experimental results are persuasive. 
Minor comments:
In Section 2, the term "performance" is used without explicitly specifying the evaluation metrics employed, apart from reference [36], which mentions the consideration of mean average precision (note that the acronym mAP is not properly defined at this point). This ambiguity should be addressed for enhanced clarity.
Additionally, a few typographical errors remain, indicating the need for further proofreading to ensure accuracy.
