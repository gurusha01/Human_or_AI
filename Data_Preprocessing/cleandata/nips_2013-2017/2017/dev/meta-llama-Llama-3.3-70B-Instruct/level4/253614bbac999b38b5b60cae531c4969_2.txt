The authors present an enhanced mechanism for local differential privacy, introducing a 1-bit method for mean estimation and a d-bit approach for histogram estimation, both of which are deemed highly relevant for telemetry data collection. The key innovation lies in improved communication efficiency, a crucial factor for large-scale implementation. Notably, the authors mention that this mechanism has been deployed on a large scale in industry, potentially representing the most extensive deployment of differential privacy to date, which underscores the practicality and effectiveness of their approach.
The submission includes a supplementary version of the paper with proofs, as well as additional figures and an extended main text. However, this blurs the line between the main submission and supplementary material, which ideally should only contain ancillary content, allowing the main paper to stand alone without repetition. The absence of a clear distinction between the submission and supplementary material necessitates that the reviewer search for proofs, which is inconvenient.
The presentation is generally clear, although the decision to include additional content in the supplementary material contributes to this clarity. Nevertheless, the explanation of alpha-rounding remains somewhat obscure, and the authors are requested to provide further clarification on the claimed guarantees.
The experimental study is intriguing, but it raises concerns regarding the reproducibility of the results, particularly since the study appears to utilize real user and company data. To facilitate follow-up research and ensure comparability, it would be beneficial to offer an alternative solution, such as simulated data, to maintain an open-source framework for comparison. Despite this, the experiments are found to be convincing and supportive of the primary claim.
