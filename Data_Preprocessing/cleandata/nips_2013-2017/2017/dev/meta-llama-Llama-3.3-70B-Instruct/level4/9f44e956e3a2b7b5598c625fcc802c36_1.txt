The authors have introduced the IBAG algorithm, a novel approach to active sequential learning that relies on a restricted understanding of a specific set of target actions. Through a comprehensive theoretical framework and rigorous evaluation, they demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over the established Chernoff's algorithm in the majority of cases. In my opinion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the existing body of research on hypothesis testing in active learning environments with limited information, enhancing our current understanding in this field.
