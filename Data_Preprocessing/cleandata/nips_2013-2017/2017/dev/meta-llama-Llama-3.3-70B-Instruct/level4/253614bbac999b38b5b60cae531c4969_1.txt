The authors assert that their 1-bit mechanism for mean estimation is optimized for efficient communication, but it is unclear how this differs from the basic randomizer presented in [3] when only one item is considered. If, in a specific context, the proposed protocol is equivalent to the basic randomizer in [3], this equivalence should be explicitly acknowledged.
Theorem 2
A comparison of the utility, in terms of both n and d, with existing histogram protocols would provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Sec 3.1
The privacy guarantees following alpha-point rounding are not clearly defined. In scenarios where a data collector submits her data multiple times (e.g., N times), the privacy budget should be determined in accordance with the composition theorem. While alpha-point rounding introduces an additional layer of randomness, potentially enhancing privacy, the composition theorem remains applicable when multiple responses are provided to the data collector, necessitating a careful consideration of the cumulative privacy budget.
