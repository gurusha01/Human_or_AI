This paper presents an efficient approximation of the "Linear Fascicle Evaluation model" (LiFE) for tractography, addressing the model's poor computational scalability that renders it impractical for full-resolution MRI data analysis. The authors propose a sparse approximation utilizing a Tucker model, demonstrating both its accuracy and high compression ratio through theoretical proof and experimental evaluation. The model and analysis appear robust. However, my primary concern is the superficial treatment of the model's evaluation for tractography, which is only briefly mentioned. Given the space constraints of a NIPS paper, this limitation is understandable.
The paper is well-written, with intuitive figures that facilitate reader comprehension. As a non-expert in tractography and tensor models, I found the paper enjoyable to read. 
Some minor comments include: 
1) The argument that competing methods' wildly different results motivate convex models seems unfounded, as these discrepancies likely stem from differing modeling assumptions rather than the attainment of a global optimum.
2) The authors' effort to explain their propositions in plain language is commendable and enhances the paper's readability.
3) A potential error exists in the sentence "...dataset Fig. 4.a," possibly requiring the figure reference to be parenthetical.
4) A typo ("aproach" instead of "approach") is found in line 202.
After reviewing the rebuttal and other evaluations, I reaffirm my assessment that this paper merits acceptance.
