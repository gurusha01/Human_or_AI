This manuscript explores the concept of active hypothesis testing under indirect feedback, presenting a methodology that utilizes incomplete Bayesian updates to select actions maximizing a lower bound on the expected posterior of the true hypothesis at each step. The authors derive matching upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity with respect to the confidence parameter delta.
The paper is well-structured and its findings appear to be accurate, although a thorough examination of the appendix was not conducted. The proposed model and algorithm represent a novel contribution, albeit with similarities to existing approaches outlined in references [11] and [13].
However, the primary concern lies in the motivation behind this research. The introduction of a new active hypothesis testing model is not adequately justified, with the provided example in section 5 feeling somewhat contrived and potentially more effective if relocated to the introductory sections. Questions arise regarding the practicality of the proposed scenario, such as why direct label output from workers is not considered and how worker quality is assessed.
Furthermore, the analysis has limitations:
1. The bounds on sample complexity are exclusively related to delta, without exploration of dependencies on other critical quantities like |J| or |W|.
2. A theoretical comparison of the proposed method's sample complexity to that of alternative approaches, including the Chernoff algorithm, GBS algorithm, and passive methods, is lacking. While numerical results are presented, a more comprehensive theoretical analysis would strengthen the manuscript.
