Review - Deep Hyperalignment
Although I was unable to thoroughly read the entire paper due to time limitations, I was able to grasp the overall content.
The challenge of functionally aligning multi-subject fMRI datasets is a longstanding and complex issue in the field of neuroimaging. Hyperalignment is a well-established class of anatomy-free functional alignment methods, and the current manuscript proposes an extension of this approach using a deep neural network kernel. While I am not intimately familiar with the existing literature, this method appears to be novel. Although the research direction may not be entirely unexpected, it is a logical and promising avenue to explore, and the experimental results are outstanding.
The methodology is thoroughly explained, with detailed proofs provided in the supplementary materials. However, I found this section to be overly dense and lacking a concise summary of the final design and parameter choices. The inclusion of a figure illustrating the method would have been highly beneficial. The related work is well-surveyed, and the new method can be seen as a thoughtful combination of existing approaches, carefully implemented in a novel way.
The experiments are remarkably comprehensive, utilizing multiple open datasets and competing methods, with detailed reporting of methodologies, including parameters used for each alignment method. Additional information on preprocessing steps would have been helpful. It appears that some parameter validation was performed on the test data ("the best performance for each dataset is reported" p6), which is not ideal. Nevertheless, the number of parameter values tested is relatively small, and the results are so strong that I believe they would withstand a more rigorous training/validation/test split. My primary concern with this section is that all reported results were computed by the authors themselves; it would be beneficial to also reference comparable results from the existing literature.
The English quality is generally good, but there are occasional issues. For example, the phrase "time complexity fairly scales with data size" is unclear, and the sentence containing it is repeated three times in the manuscript, including once in the abstract. Some proofreading is necessary to refine the manuscript.
