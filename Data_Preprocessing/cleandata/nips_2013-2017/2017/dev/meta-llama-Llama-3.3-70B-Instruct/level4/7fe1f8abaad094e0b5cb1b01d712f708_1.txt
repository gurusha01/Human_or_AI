Review - Summary: This paper tackles the challenge of solving two-player zero-sum games with imperfect information, such as poker, by introducing two novel concepts. Firstly, the "Reach" approach enables the algorithm to leverage any advantageous position or "gift" obtained in previous steps of the game, where the opponent made an error. Secondly, the "Nested" method involves re-solving subgames in real-time using more detailed information, allowing for a more precise solution of initially abstracted games.
Opinion: Although I am not extensively familiar with the literature on game-solving and poker-playing, the paper appears to be well-written and presents interesting and significant advancements in the field. However, a limitation of the paper is the lack of explanatory discussion on the contributions of the new techniques beyond a technical level, making it challenging for me to assess their impact. The paper's key strength lies in the fact that these techniques have recently contributed to the first victory of AI over top human players in no-limit hold-'em, a notable milestone in the development of artificial intelligence.
Comments: Initially, I struggled to understand the intuition behind the "Reach" concept, specifically why recognizing an opponent's earlier mistake in the game tree improves performance in a particular subgame. However, after the author's response, I found the provided intuition for "Reach" to be helpful and clarifying.
