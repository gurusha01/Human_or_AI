This paper presents a compelling approach, with a clear and concise methodology. Batch normalization has established itself as a valuable tool in mitigating internal covariate shift, particularly in deep neural networks. However, its limitations in handling small mini-batches are well-documented, primarily due to the unreliable estimation of mean and variance for each mini-batch, and the discrepancy between the mini-batch and population statistics used during training and inference. The authors address these shortcomings by introducing an additional affine transformation, known as renormalization, which corrects the bias between local and global normalization, thereby aligning training and inference normalization. The concept is straightforward yet appears to yield significant improvements, as evidenced by the experimental results. 
I do not have substantial criticisms of the paper. Nevertheless, to further strengthen the findings, I suggest expanding the experimental section to include results from mini-batches of diverse sizes, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the batch renormalization technique's behavior. Specifically, exploring the scenario where the mini-batch size is reduced to one would be intriguing, as conventional batch normalization becomes inapplicable, while renormalization remains viable, potentially offering insights into its robustness and adaptability.
