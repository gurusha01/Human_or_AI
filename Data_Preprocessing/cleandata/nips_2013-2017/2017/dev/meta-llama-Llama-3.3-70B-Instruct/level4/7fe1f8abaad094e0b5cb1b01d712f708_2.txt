This study introduces a novel approach, termed "reach subgame solving," aimed at enhancing decision-making processes in imperfect information, two-player zero-sum games. The core concept revolves around leveraging knowledge of payoff discrepancies experienced by the opponent when navigating paths towards and away from information sets. Additionally, the authors propose an extension of this method to accommodate multiple independent subgames.
The manuscript is well-structured, and the authors provide theoretical proofs demonstrating the low exploitability of their approach, measured by its deviation from the Nash equilibrium value - a unique value in zero-sum games that eliminates concerns about equilibrium selection. Empirical evidence is also presented, showcasing the method's superiority over existing techniques, including a standard baseline, the unsafe subgame solving method, which, although performing well in most benchmarks, lacks theoretical guarantees. Notably, the paper claims a milestone achievement as the first method to outperform four human subjects in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.
A potential avenue for future exploration is whether the concepts presented could be applied if exploitability were redefined in relation to alternative equilibrium notions, such as coarse correlated equilibria. Furthermore, it would be intriguing to investigate the feasibility of adapting this method to non-zero-sum games, or bimatrix games, to expand its applicability beyond the current scope.
