[UPDATE AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE]
I have revised my evaluation and increased my confidence in this paper, primarily due to the authors' commitment to incorporating a performance breakdown into the manuscript, should it be accepted. Additionally, I recommend that the authors explicitly acknowledge that their method involves supervised stages, whereas some comparison methods, such as Kilosort, are unsupervised. I concur with the authors' response that prior information should be utilized when available. Nevertheless, as this methodological detail is crucial for interpreting the comparisons presented, it is essential to make it explicit to facilitate the community's understanding of the results.
[ORIGINAL REVIEW]
The authors have developed a multistage spike sorter, referred to as YASS, which adheres to the traditional pipeline of spike detection, feature extraction, and clustering. The most notable aspect of this work is that the YASS system demonstrates superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Despite this commendable performance, this study raises several concerns, which are outlined below.
Major Concerns:
1. The impressive performance of YASS comes at the cost of requiring hand-labeled data for the detection step, which is not a requirement for all methods to which YASS is compared. This discrepancy renders the comparisons not entirely equivalent. The need for experimenters to provide hand-labeled data imposes an additional burden, which is not necessary for completely unsupervised methods.
2. Many components in the YASS pipeline are derived from previous work. Although there are certainly novel components that may warrant publication at NIPS, the authors do not provide a performance breakdown to demonstrate that these novel contributions are essential for achieving the reported levels of performance. It is possible that the overall performance is attributed to the specific selection of previously developed components rather than the inclusion of newly developed ones.
Minor Concerns:
3. According to my understanding, the proposed method discards signals that appear on multiple electrodes, retaining only the waveform signal with the largest amplitude (lines 138-140). This approach differs from that of Kilosort, for example. This design choice seems disadvantageous and raises another concern that the comparison may not be entirely equivalent to Kilosort. If the experimental data did not contain overlapping signals across channels, YASS' performance would not be negatively impacted by this design choice, and Kilosort's performance would not be advantageous in comparison, as one of its primary features would not be relevant. If my interpretation is incorrect, this text should be clarified. Regardless, the authors should provide clarification on the precise application setting regarding overlapping signals across channels.
4. The writing style is somewhat opaque. I would encourage the authors to clarify their presentation by distilling the critical mathematical and algorithmic details (whether in the form of text or equations) and incorporating them into the main paper. Currently, almost none of these essential details are available without consulting the supplements, which presents a significant burden to both the reader and the reviewer.
