The authors propose an approximate, memory-efficient implementation of the LiFE method for filtering and reweighing fibre tracks in diffusion MRI, which assigns weights to input white matter fibre tracks to match the apparent fibre density in the diffusion MRI data. Originally formulated as a large non-negative least squares problem, this work approximates the design matrix using discrete atoms associated with fibre orientation, allowing the problem to be cast as a memory-efficient, sparse tensor representation. The effectiveness of the approximation and the memory efficiency of the tensor encoding are demonstrated using human brain data.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with conclusions that are well-supported by the data. This work represents a significant contribution to the diffusion MRI tractography community. However, two points of criticism are noted:
1. The use of the terms "decomposition" and "factorization" in the title and throughout the text is misleading, as these terms typically refer to methods like singular value decomposition and nonnegative matrix factorization, where a matrix or tensor is represented as a linear combination of unknown matrices or tensors computed simultaneously under certain constraints. In contrast, the matrix M and its sparse tensor representation D and Phi are precomputed inputs, and the method primarily computes the remaining nonnegative weights, which is only one factor in the tensor representation.
2. The stick model employed in this work only accounts for restricted, intra-axonal diffusion and neglects hindered extra-cellular diffusion and free water compartments. Additionally, the axial diffusivity is fixed at 1 ms/um^2. The suitability of this model and the fixed parameter value for the given data is questionable. Furthermore, the b-value at which the data was acquired and whether it is sufficiently high to assume adequate attenuation of CSF and extra-cellular diffusion signals are not clarified.
