This manuscript presents an asynchronous adaptation of the SAGA algorithm, a stochastic gradient method designed for finite sum convex optimization, as initially introduced by Defazio et al in 2014. In my interpretation, the manuscript tackles two primary challenges: asynchronicity and proximity. The authors successfully introduce three key enhancements to the original SAGA method. Firstly, they propose a sparse update mechanism that leverages block coordinate-wise updates, utilizing extended support for gradients when the regularization is decomposable. Secondly, they develop an asynchronous variant of SAGA, capable of handling delay quantities of up to sqrt(n)/10. Lastly, they incorporate the use of proximal operators to accommodate nonsmooth regularizers. In terms of convergence analysis, the authors demonstrate a linear convergence rate, contingent upon the strong convexity of the overall sum function f and the individual Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of fi. Although the step-size utilized is marginally smaller than that of the original SAGA, the convergence factor remains comparable, likely attributable to differing assumptions. 
The manuscript effectively integrates several advanced concepts from existing literature, including SAGA with variance reduction, sparse updates, Hogwild, and asynchronization techniques such as Arock, to surpass the limitations of these individual methods. The proof presented is remarkably clear and well-organized. 
In my view, the improvements presented are substantial and hold significant practical importance for obvious reasons. The numerical results provided strongly corroborate the theoretical contributions, with experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets empirically demonstrating a linear speedup of the novel algorithm. 
Overall, this manuscript offers significant contributions to both theoretical and experimental aspects of the field. Its merits warrant acceptance for presentation at NIPS. 
Minor comments include the need for definitions of certain concepts and notations, such as support (supp) and \Omega(\cdot), as well as addressing inconsistencies in reading and notation, including the consistent use of "step size" throughout the text. Specific line edits include revising line 46 and line 142 for consistency, deleting an article on line 152, and bolding the variable y on line 361, as well as removing a redundant article on line 127.
