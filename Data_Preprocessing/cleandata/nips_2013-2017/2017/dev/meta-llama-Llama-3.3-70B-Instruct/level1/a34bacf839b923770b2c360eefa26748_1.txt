This paper proposes a novel framework, HYBRID, for predicting user activities based on point processes, which are powerful tools for modeling user behaviors in social sciences. The authors address the limitations of existing works, which are often problem-specific, ignore parts of the stochasticity in point processes, or rely on heuristics. HYBRID provides an efficient estimator of the probability mass function of point processes, applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks with an arbitrary function f.
The paper's main strengths are:
1. Technical soundness: The authors provide a rigorous mathematical formulation of the prediction problem and derive a novel mass transport equation to compute the conditional probability mass function of point processes.
2. Originality: The proposed framework is a significant departure from existing works, which often rely on simplifying assumptions or heuristics. HYBRID's ability to handle general point processes and arbitrary functions f makes it a valuable contribution to the field.
3. Empirical evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating the superiority of HYBRID over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
However, there are some areas for improvement:
1. Clarity: While the paper is well-organized, some sections are dense and require careful reading. Additional explanations or illustrations could help to improve the paper's clarity.
2. Related work: The authors could provide a more comprehensive review of existing works on point processes and prediction tasks, highlighting the limitations and gaps that HYBRID addresses.
3. Scalability: While the authors demonstrate the efficiency of HYBRID, it would be beneficial to discuss the framework's scalability to larger datasets and more complex point process models.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* HYBRID addresses a significant problem in social sciences and provides a novel, technically sound solution.
* The framework's ability to handle general point processes and arbitrary functions f makes it a valuable contribution to the field.
* The empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of HYBRID over state-of-the-art methods.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper's clarity could be improved, which might hinder the understanding of the proposed framework.
* The related work section could be more comprehensive, providing a clearer context for HYBRID's contributions.
* The scalability of HYBRID could be further discussed, particularly in the context of larger datasets and more complex point process models.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of point processes and prediction tasks, with a strong technical foundation and empirical evaluation.
