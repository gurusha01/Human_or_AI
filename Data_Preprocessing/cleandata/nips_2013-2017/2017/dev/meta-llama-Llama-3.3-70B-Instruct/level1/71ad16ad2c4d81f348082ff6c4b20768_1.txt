This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into Gaussian processes (GPs) for multivariate regression problems. The authors introduce a modification of the covariance function to ensure that the constraints are fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. The method is based on transforming the target function using a linear operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints in a continuous manner.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-structured, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, both on simulated and real-data examples.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and elegant approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into GPs.
* The provision of a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator.
* The demonstration of the method's effectiveness on various examples, including a real-data experiment.
* The clear and concise writing style, making the paper easy to follow.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function g, which might not always be the case.
* The reliance on a parametric ansatz for constructing the transformation operator Gx, which might not be the most efficient or robust approach.
* The lack of a rigorous analysis of the requirements on Gx, which could lead to a more straightforward construction algorithm.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into GPs.
* The method has been demonstrated to work well on various examples, including a real-data experiment.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption that the target function can be expressed in terms of an underlying potential function g might not always be valid.
* The reliance on a parametric ansatz for constructing Gx might not be the most efficient or robust approach.
* The lack of a rigorous analysis of the requirements on Gx could lead to limitations in the method's applicability.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Gaussian processes and multivariate regression, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the assumption about the target function and the reliance on a parametric ansatz, to further improve the paper.
