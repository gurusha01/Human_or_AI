This paper presents a novel approach to online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves a remarkable balance between regret and constraint violations, with expected regret and constraint violations of O(√T) and high probability regret and constraint violations of O(√T log(T)).
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of the algorithm and its analysis. The theoretical results are impressive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including expected and high-probability bounds on regret and constraint violations.
The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the significance of the proposed approach and its connections to other areas, such as stochastic constrained convex optimization and deterministic constrained convex optimization. The experimental evaluation of the algorithm on a real-world data center scheduling problem demonstrates its effectiveness in practice.
