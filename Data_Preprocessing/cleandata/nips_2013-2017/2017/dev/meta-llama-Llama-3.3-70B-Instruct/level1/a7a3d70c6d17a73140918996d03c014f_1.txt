This paper introduces a new measure of sample complexity, referred to as the split-sample growth rate, which is used to bound the expected generalization error in the context of optimal auction design. The authors show that this measure can greatly simplify the analysis of the sample complexity of many auction classes, and they provide several examples to demonstrate its applicability.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good overview of the background and motivation for the work, and the technical sections are thorough and well-explained. The authors also provide a clear comparison with previous work, highlighting the advantages of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new and useful measure of sample complexity, which can be applied to a wide range of problems beyond optimal auction design.
* The provision of several examples demonstrating the applicability of the split-sample growth rate to different auction classes.
* The clear and thorough explanation of the technical results, making it easy for readers to understand the authors' arguments.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the revenue of any auction lies in the range [0, 1], which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The authors do not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of their approach, and how it compares to other methods for bounding sample complexity.
* Some of the proofs and technical results may be difficult to follow for readers without a strong background in statistical learning theory.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimal auction design and sample complexity analysis. The introduction of the split-sample growth rate is a useful tool that can be applied to a wide range of problems, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their results.
