This paper proposes Batch Renormalization, a novel extension to Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) that addresses the limitations of BatchNorm when dealing with small or non-i.i.d. training minibatches. The authors argue that the dependence of BatchNorm on the entire minibatch is the source of its drawbacks, and propose a per-dimension correction to ensure that the activations match between the training and inference networks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the motivation behind Batch Renormalization. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a good overview of the existing methods that address the limitations of BatchNorm. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithm and its components.
The experimental results are impressive, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Batch Renormalization in improving the training of deep models on small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. The authors evaluate their method on the task of image classification, and show that it outperforms BatchNorm on both small and non-i.i.d. minibatches. The results are significant, and demonstrate the potential of Batch Renormalization to improve the performance of deep models in a variety of applications.
