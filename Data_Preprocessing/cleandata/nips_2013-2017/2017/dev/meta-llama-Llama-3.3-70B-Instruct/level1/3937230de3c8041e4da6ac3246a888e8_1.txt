This paper proposes a novel approach to augmenting generative models with external memory, interpreting the output of a memory module with stochastic addressing as a conditional mixture distribution. The authors apply variational inference to memory addressing, enabling effective training of the memory module using target information to guide memory lookups. The model is evaluated on the tasks of generative few-shot learning and unconditional density modeling, demonstrating its ability to identify and access relevant memory contents even with hundreds of unseen Omniglot characters in memory.
The paper builds upon previous work on memory-augmented neural networks and variational autoencoders, but introduces a new perspective on memory addressing as a stochastic operation. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their model, including a detailed description of the variational inference procedure and the training process.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its advantages and limitations. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the model's ability to perform precise memory lookups and generate high-quality samples.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between their approach and other related work, such as soft-attention mechanisms and hierarchical VAEs. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the model's behavior and limitations, particularly in terms of its scalability and robustness to different types of data.
