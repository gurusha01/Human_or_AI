This paper proposes a novel method called Deep Hyperalignment (DHA) for functional alignment in multi-subject fMRI analysis. The main idea of DHA is to use a deep network as a kernel function to map fMRI responses of each subject to a common space, allowing for non-linear and high-dimensional data. The authors claim that DHA outperforms other state-of-the-art hyperalignment methods, including Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA), Shared Response Model (SRM), and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE).
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a good introduction to the background and motivation of the research. The authors provide a detailed description of the DHA method, including the optimization algorithm and the experimental setup. The results show that DHA achieves superior performance to other methods in terms of classification accuracy and area under the ROC curve.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel method that combines deep learning and hyperalignment techniques
* The use of a deep network as a kernel function, which allows for non-linear and high-dimensional data
* The experimental results, which show that DHA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear comparison with other deep learning-based methods for fMRI analysis
* The limited number of datasets used for evaluation, which may not be representative of all fMRI analysis tasks
* The need for further validation of the results, including the use of more datasets and the evaluation of the method's robustness to different experimental conditions
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear description of the proposed method and its evaluation. However, further work is needed to fully validate the results and to compare the method with other deep learning-based approaches for fMRI analysis.
Arguments pro acceptance:
