This paper presents a novel approach to multitask learning for weighted finite automata (WFAs), which are finite state machines that can succinctly represent functions mapping sequences of observations to real numbers. The authors introduce the concept of vector-valued WFAs, which generalize WFAs to vector-valued functions, and propose a spectral learning algorithm for these models. This algorithm, called Multi-Task Spectral Learning (MT-SL), enables the joint learning of multiple related tasks by discovering a shared representation space.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of multitask learning for WFAs. They also provide a thorough review of related work and a detailed explanation of their proposed approach. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-SL on both synthetic and real-world data.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a novel model, vector-valued WFAs, which provides a natural framework for multitask learning of WFAs.
* The proposal of a spectral learning algorithm for vector-valued WFAs, which is efficient and effective.
* The theoretical analysis of the algorithm, which provides insights into the benefits of multitask learning for WFAs.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-SL on both synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The assumption that the tasks are related, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The requirement for a complete basis of prefixes and suffixes, which can be computationally expensive to obtain.
* The lack of comparison with other multitask learning approaches, such as deep learning-based methods.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to multitask learning for WFAs.
* The theoretical analysis is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their proposed approach.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption that the tasks are related may not always be valid in practice.
* The requirement for a complete basis of prefixes and suffixes can be computationally expensive to obtain.
* The lack of comparison with other multitask learning approaches may limit the impact of the paper.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to multitask learning for WFAs, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper, such as the assumption of related tasks and the requirement for a complete basis of prefixes and suffixes, in future work.
