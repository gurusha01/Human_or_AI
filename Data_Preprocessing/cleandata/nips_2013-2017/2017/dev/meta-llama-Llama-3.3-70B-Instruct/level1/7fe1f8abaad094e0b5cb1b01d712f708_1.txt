This paper introduces a novel subgame-solving technique for imperfect-information games, which has stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance than prior methods. The authors provide a thorough review of prior approaches to subgame solving, including Unsafe subgame solving, Subgame Resolving, and Maxmargin subgame solving. They then present their new technique, Reach subgame solving, which considers the opponent's potential actions and gifts in other subgames, leading to improved exploitability.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the concepts and techniques. The notation and background section is comprehensive, making it easy to follow the rest of the paper. The experiments section presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed techniques, including a comparison with prior methods and an analysis of the results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel subgame-solving technique with stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance.
* A thorough review of prior approaches to subgame solving, providing a clear understanding of the context and motivations for the new technique.
* A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed techniques, including experiments on various games and comparisons with prior methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in game theory and imperfect-information games, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the sections, such as the notation and background section, are quite dense and may require multiple readings to fully understand.
* The paper could benefit from more visual aids, such as diagrams or figures, to help illustrate the concepts and techniques.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and comprehensive presentation of their work. The proposed technique has the potential to significantly improve the state of the art in imperfect-information games, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel subgame-solving technique with stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance.
* The authors provide a thorough review of prior approaches to subgame solving, providing a clear understanding of the context and motivations for the new technique.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in practice.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in game theory and imperfect-information games, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts.
* Some of the sections are quite dense and may require multiple readings to fully understand.
* The paper could benefit from more visual aids to help illustrate the concepts and techniques.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games and has the potential to improve the state of the art. However, I suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more accessible to non-experts and adding more visual aids to help illustrate the concepts and techniques.
