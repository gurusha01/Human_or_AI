This paper presents a novel approach to active sequential hypothesis testing with limited knowledge of the outcome distributions. The authors propose the Incomplete-Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) policy, which combines an Incomplete-Bayesian update rule with an Adaptive Gradient action selection rule. The IBAG policy is shown to be competitive with existing algorithms, such as Chernoff's algorithm, and in many cases outperforms them.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs of the theorems are provided in the supplementary material.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors tackle a novel and important problem, which is relevant to many real-world applications, such as medical diagnostics, crowdsourcing, and customer hotline centers.
* The proposed IBAG policy is intuitive and easy to implement, and it does not require full knowledge of the outcome distributions.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the IBAG policy, including a lower bound on the sample size and an upper bound on the expected number of samples required.
* The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the IBAG policy in various scenarios, including comparisons with existing algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the principal sets of the actions are known with certainty, which may not be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between caution and cost, although they mention it as an interesting direction for future work.
* The paper could benefit from more discussions on the potential applications and implications of the IBAG policy in real-world scenarios.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and important contribution to the field of active sequential hypothesis testing.
* The proposed IBAG policy is competitive with existing algorithms and has the potential to be widely applicable.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the IBAG policy, including theoretical bounds and numerical results.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the principal sets of the actions are known with certainty, which may limit the applicability of the results.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between caution and cost, which could be an important consideration in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more discussions on the potential applications and implications of the IBAG policy in real-world scenarios.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a novel and important contribution to the field of active sequential hypothesis testing, and the proposed IBAG policy has the potential to be widely applicable. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a more detailed analysis of the tradeoff between caution and cost, and discussing the potential applications and implications of the IBAG policy in real-world scenarios.
