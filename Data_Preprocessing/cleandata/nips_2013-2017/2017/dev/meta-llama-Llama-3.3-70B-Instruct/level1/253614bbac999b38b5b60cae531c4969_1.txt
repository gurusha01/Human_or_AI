This paper presents a novel approach to locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms for repeated collection of counter data, which is a crucial problem in telemetry applications. The authors propose a framework that combines 1-bit LDP mechanisms with memoization and output perturbation to provide strong privacy guarantees even after an arbitrarily long period of data collection.
The paper relates to previous work on LDP, particularly in the context of single-round data collection. The authors build upon existing mechanisms, such as those proposed by Duchi et al. [8, 7, 9] and Bassily and Smith [4], and modify them to accommodate repeated data collection. The use of memoization and output perturbation is inspired by the work of [12], but the authors introduce a new technique called α-point rounding to address the issue of privacy leakage due to small changes in user behavior.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel framework for repeated LDP collection of counter data, which addresses a significant problem in telemetry applications.
* The introduction of α-point rounding, a technique that allows for strong privacy guarantees while minimizing accuracy losses.
* The provision of formal privacy guarantees, including Theorems 3 and 4, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.
* The empirical evaluation of the proposed mechanisms, which shows that they are comparable to or even outperform existing state-of-the-art mechanisms for single-round data collection.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that user behavior remains approximately consistent or varies slowly, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The potential vulnerability of the proposed mechanisms to attacks based on auxiliary information, as discussed in Section 3.2.1.
* The need for careful tuning of parameters, such as the discretization granularity s and the output perturbation probability γ, to balance privacy and accuracy.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of LDP, addressing a crucial problem in telemetry applications.
* The proposed mechanisms are theoretically sound and empirically evaluated, demonstrating their effectiveness.
* The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the ideas, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumptions made about user behavior may not always hold in practice, which could limit the applicability of the proposed mechanisms.
* The potential vulnerability to attacks based on auxiliary information may be a concern in certain scenarios.
* The need for careful parameter tuning may require additional expertise and resources in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a well-written and significant contribution to the field of LDP, and the proposed mechanisms have the potential to be widely applicable in telemetry applications. However, the assumptions and limitations of the approach should be carefully considered in the context of specific use cases.
