This paper proposes a framework for analyzing point processes to predict a function based on the number of events that have occurred up to a certain time. The framework, called HYBRID, provides an efficient estimator of the probability mass function of point processes and is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks with an arbitrary function f.
The paper is well-structured and provides a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed framework. The authors also provide a detailed explanation of the mathematical formulation and the algorithm used to solve the problem. The experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from an expositional revision to provide a clearer understanding of the math and its applications. The use of "mass transport" terminology may be confused with "optimal transport" from machine learning, and a clarification note may be helpful. Additionally, Theorem 2 needs a brief explanation before the proof sketch to provide context for the equation and its components.
The upper bound for x in the equation should be justified, as it is unclear why it should be known a priori. The term "compute the intensity function" is vague and needs clarification, particularly in the context of the equation. The variable "u" in the paragraph starting at line 207 is unclear and needs definition or explanation.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The clarity of the paper could be improved with a clearer explanation of the math and its applications. The paper is well-organized, but some sections could be reorganized to improve the flow of the paper. The paper adequately informs the reader, but some definitions and explanations could be added to make the paper more accessible to non-experts.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel framework for analyzing point processes. The paper is a significant contribution to the field, and the results are important and likely to be used by other researchers and practitioners. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field, and with some improvements, it could be even stronger.
