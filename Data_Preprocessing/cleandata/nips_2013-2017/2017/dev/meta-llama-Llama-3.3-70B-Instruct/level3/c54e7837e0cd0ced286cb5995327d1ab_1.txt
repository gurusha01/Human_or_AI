This paper proposes a novel subgame-solving technique for imperfect-information games, which has stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance than prior methods. The authors introduce Reach subgame solving, an improvement to past subgame-solving techniques that considers what the opponent could have alternatively received from other subgames. This approach leads to a reduction in exploitability over the blueprint strategy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The technique is evaluated on several poker games, including heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em, and the results show that Reach subgame solving outperforms prior methods, including action translation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed technique has stronger theoretical guarantees than prior methods, which ensures that the exploitability of the strategy is no higher than that of the blueprint strategy.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in practice, with significant improvements in exploitability over prior methods.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the technique, making it easy to understand and implement.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The technique requires a significant amount of computational resources, which may limit its applicability to large games.
* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the technique, which would be useful for understanding its scalability.
* The experimental results are limited to poker games, and it is unclear how well the technique would perform on other imperfect-information games.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games and provides a novel technique for subgame solving. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in practice, and the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the approach.
