This paper proposes a novel algorithm for spike sorting in dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The algorithm, called Yet Another Spike Sorter (YASS), is a multistage pipeline that combines a neural network-based detection method, outlier triaging, and a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering approach. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of YASS on both synthetic and real datasets, showing improved accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' methodology and results. The use of pseudocode and supplemental sections provides additional details for readers interested in the technical aspects of the algorithm. The experimental section is thorough, with a comparison to several competing algorithms and an evaluation of the pipeline's performance on different datasets.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle large-scale datasets, which is critical for modern neuroscience research. The authors' use of a coreset construction approach and a divide-and-conquer strategy allows for efficient processing of large datasets, making YASS a scalable solution for spike sorting.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The connection to "Deterministic constrained convex optimization" is not clearly explained, and it is unclear why a non-feasible solution is acceptable. Additionally, the experimental section could benefit from more details on the baselines, implementation, and assessment of variability in results. The analysis could also be extended to the dynamic regret setting, which could provide further insights into the algorithm's performance.
Furthermore, the paper lacks references to previous work, such as [A], which provides similar algorithmic techniques and guarantees. The experimental results could also be improved by providing more details on the starting points, box constraints, and log-scale for unserved jobs, which would make the results more reproducible and clearer.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience, providing a fast, accurate, and scalable solution for spike sorting in dense MEAs. With some minor improvements, the paper could be even stronger, providing a more comprehensive and well-rounded contribution to the field.
