This paper presents a novel approach to online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves a remarkable O(√T) expected regret and constraint violations, as well as O(√T log(T)) high-probability regret and constraint violations.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including a thorough review of the related work. The technical contributions of the paper are substantial, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a drift lemma for stochastic processes that is used to establish the expected and high-probability bounds.
The algorithm itself is innovative and builds upon the traditional OCO framework by introducing virtual queues to handle the stochastic constraints. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a detailed examination of the drift and penalty terms.
The paper also includes a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm, which demonstrates its effectiveness in a real-world data center scheduling problem. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs closely to the best fixed decision in hindsight, both in terms of electricity cost and constraint violations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and innovative approach to OCO with stochastic constraints
* A thorough and detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance
