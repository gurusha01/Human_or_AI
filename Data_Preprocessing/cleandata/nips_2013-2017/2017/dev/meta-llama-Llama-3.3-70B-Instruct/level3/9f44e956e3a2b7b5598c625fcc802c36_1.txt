This paper presents a novel algorithm for online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a new learning algorithm that achieves O(√T) expected regret and constraint violations, and O(√T log(T)) high probability regret and constraint violations. The algorithm is based on a drift-plus-penalty approach, which minimizes an upper bound of the drift-plus-penalty expression at each round.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem setting and the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and thorough, with a detailed proof of the expected and high probability performance bounds. The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application, namely online job scheduling in distributed data centers.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and addresses a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides a clear understanding of the algorithm's performance.
* The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application.
