This paper introduces a new approach to online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves a remarkable O(√T) expected regret and constraint violations, as well as O(√T log(T)) high probability regret and constraint violations. The algorithm is based on a drift-plus-penalty framework, which is a clever combination of the traditional OCO algorithm and a queue-based approach to handle the stochastic constraints.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem setting, the algorithm, and the theoretical analysis. The use of a Lyapunov function to analyze the drift of the virtual queues is a nice touch, and the proof of the main theorem is rigorous and well-organized.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle multiple stochastic constraints, which is a significant improvement over previous work in this area. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in various special cases, including OCO with long-term constraints, stochastic constrained convex optimization, and deterministic constrained convex optimization.
The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm in a real-world data center scheduling problem. The comparison with other baselines, such as the "react" and "low-power" strategies, shows that the proposed algorithm performs closely to the best fixed decision in hindsight, both in terms of electricity cost and constraint violations.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more intuition behind the choice of the algorithm parameters, such as V and α. Secondly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the algorithm, particularly in the context of large-scale problems. Finally, the authors could consider exploring other applications of the algorithm, such as in resource allocation or network optimization problems.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization. The algorithm proposed in this paper has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains, and the theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding its performance.
