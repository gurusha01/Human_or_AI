This paper presents a novel approach to generative modeling by augmenting variational autoencoders (VAEs) with external memory. The key idea is to interpret memory-read operations as a conditional mixture distribution, allowing for the application of variational inference to memory addressing. This approach enables effective training of the memory module using target information to guide memory lookups. The paper provides a thorough theoretical framework, including a variational lower bound and a stochastic gradient estimator using VIMCO.
The paper's strengths include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors address a previously unexplored problem in generative modeling, providing a novel perspective on memory-augmented neural networks. The theoretical contributions are well-supported by experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generative few-shot learning tasks. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and concise notation.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper relies heavily on the VIMCO estimator, which may not be the most efficient or effective approach. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their model assumes sparsity, which may not always be the case in practice. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the proposed approach and existing methods, such as soft-attention-based models.
Some minor comments include errors in equations and typos, which should be corrected in the final version. The paper could also benefit from more visualizations and illustrations to help readers understand the model's behavior and performance.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The proposed approach has the potential to advance the state of the art in generative few-shot learning and related tasks.
