This paper presents an online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with stochastic constraints, which is a generalization of the traditional OCO problem. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves a regret of O(√T) and constraint violations of O(√T) in expectation, and O(√T log(T)) in high probability. The algorithm is applied to a real-world problem of online job scheduling in distributed data centers, where it performs closely to the best fixed decision in hindsight.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed algorithm, and its analysis. The authors provide a detailed proof of the regret and constraint violation bounds, which is helpful for understanding the theoretical guarantees of the algorithm. The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in a practical setting.
However, there are a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, the authors claim that their algorithm is the first to address OCO with stochastic constraints, but they do not provide a thorough review of existing literature on OCO with stochastic constraints. It would be helpful to provide a more comprehensive review of related work to contextualize the contributions of the paper.
Secondly, the algorithm is compared to three baselines in the experiment section, but the baselines are not clearly explained. It would be helpful to provide more details about the baselines, such as their parameters and how they were implemented.
Thirdly, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the algorithm. For example, how does the algorithm handle cases where the stochastic constraints are not i.i.d.? How does the algorithm perform in scenarios where the objective function is not convex?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper could be even stronger.
