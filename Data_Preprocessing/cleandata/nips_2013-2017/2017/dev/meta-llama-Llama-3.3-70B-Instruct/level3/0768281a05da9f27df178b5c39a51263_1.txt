This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), which is a critical step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed pipeline, called YASS, is based on a multistage "triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit" approach that combines efficient detection, clustering, and deconvolution techniques to improve the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of spike sorting.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' methodology and results. The use of a neural network-based detection method, a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) for clustering, and a matching pursuit approach for deconvolution are all well-motivated and effectively implemented. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their pipeline on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.
However, there are some concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed pipeline. The combination of a neural network-based detection method, DP-GMM clustering, and matching pursuit deconvolution may not be entirely new, as similar techniques have been used in previous works. The authors could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the related work and how their pipeline differs from existing approaches.
Additionally, the use of a classification task to assess alignment is not entirely convincing, as it is unclear whether the improved performance is due to better alignment or a better functional representation. The authors should consider using more direct measures of alignment quality to support their claims.
The non-uniqueness of the matrix G may also have a significant impact on the results, which is not addressed in the paper. The authors should provide more discussion on how this issue affects their pipeline and how they mitigate its effects.
The results may also be biased due to overfitting, as the best performance over a range of parameter values is reported without proper nested cross-validation. The authors should consider using more robust evaluation procedures to ensure the generalizability of their results.
Finally, it is unclear whether the performance gain of functional hyperalignment holds even without spatial normalization, which is not explicitly stated in the paper. The authors should provide more discussion on the importance of spatial normalization and how it affects their results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria for a good scientific paper. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the related work and the novelty of the proposed pipeline.
