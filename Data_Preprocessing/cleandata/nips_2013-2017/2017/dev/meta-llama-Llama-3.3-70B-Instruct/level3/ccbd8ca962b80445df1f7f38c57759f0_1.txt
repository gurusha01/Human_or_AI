This paper proposes a novel approach to subgame solving in imperfect-information games, which is a crucial component in achieving strong performance in these types of games. The authors introduce a new technique called Reach subgame solving, which modifies the augmented subgame in Resolving and Maxmargin by increasing the alternative payoff for infoset I1 âˆˆ Stop by considering the gifts that P1 could have received from other subgames. This approach leads to stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance than prior subgame-solving methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the concepts and techniques used. The notation and background sections are thorough, and the experimental results are convincing. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with prior approaches, including Unsafe subgame solving, Subgame Resolving, and Maxmargin subgame solving.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new and effective subgame-solving technique, the provision of strong theoretical guarantees, and the demonstration of improved performance in practice. The authors also show that their approach can be used in nested subgame solving, which leads to dramatically better performance than the usual approach of action translation.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. The authors could have provided more details on the implementation of the Reach subgame solving algorithm and the computational resources required. Additionally, the paper could have benefited from more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed technique beyond poker.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The approach is novel and significantly different from previous contributions, and the related work is adequately referenced.
Overall, I agree with accepting the paper, and I believe that it makes a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games. The proposed technique has the potential to be applied to a wide range of games and domains, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
