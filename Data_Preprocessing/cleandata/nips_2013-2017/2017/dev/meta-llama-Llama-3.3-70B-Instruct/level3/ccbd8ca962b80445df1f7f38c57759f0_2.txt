This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games, introducing a novel subgame-solving technique that outperforms prior methods in both theory and practice. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, a benchmark challenge for AI in imperfect-information games.
The paper is well-written, clear, and provides a thorough explanation of the concepts and techniques used. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, as well as a comparison with existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed technique, Reach subgame solving, achieves lower exploitability than previous safe methods and even outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, action translation, in nested subgame solving.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical guarantees with practical performance. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of their approach, including a proof of the exploitability reduction, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale experiments.
The paper also raises some interesting questions and directions for future research. For example, the authors note that the gifts used in the Reach subgame solving algorithm may not always be efficiently divided among subgames, and that more aggressive scaling of gifts can sometimes lead to better performance. This suggests that there may be opportunities for further optimization and improvement of the algorithm.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution. The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-supported presentation of the ideas and results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, and demonstrate its significance and impact on the field. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The contributions are significant, the presentation is clear and well-organized, and the results are compelling. The paper has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field of imperfect-information games and AI research more broadly.
