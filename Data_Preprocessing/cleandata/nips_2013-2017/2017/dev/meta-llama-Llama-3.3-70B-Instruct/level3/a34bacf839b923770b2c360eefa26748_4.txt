This paper proposes a novel framework, HYBRID, for predicting user activities based on point processes. The framework provides an efficient estimator of the probability mass function of point processes, which is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks with an arbitrary function f. The authors achieve this by reformulating the prediction problem and designing a new random variable with reduced variance, and then deriving a mass transport equation to compute the conditional probability mass function.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed solution. The authors provide a thorough background on point processes and their applications, and they clearly explain the limitations of existing methods. The technical details of the framework are well-presented, and the authors provide a scalable algorithm for solving the mass transport equation.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HYBRID in predicting user activities in social networks and recommender systems. The results show that HYBRID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and it can achieve similar performance with much smaller sample sizes.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors claim that their estimator is unbiased, but this is not entirely accurate due to spatial truncation and temporal discretization. The authors should provide more transparency about the potential biases and discuss possible debiasing methods, such as those proposed by McLeish (2010) and Rhee and Glynn (2015).
Additionally, there is a typo on page 5, line 190, where the estimator for the expectation of a test function is missing averaging over replicates. The authors should correct this error to ensure the accuracy of their results.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of point processes and user activity prediction. With some minor revisions to address the limitations and errors, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the NIPS conference.
