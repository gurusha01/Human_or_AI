This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games, introducing a novel subgame-solving technique that outperforms prior methods in both theory and practice. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the challenges in imperfect-information games, where the optimal strategy in a subgame may depend on the strategy in other, unreached subgames.
The proposed technique, called Reach subgame solving, modifies the augmented subgame in Resolving and Maxmargin by increasing the alternative payoff for infoset I1 âˆˆ Stop by considering the gifts that P1 would have received from other subgames. This approach ensures that the strategy for P2 in the subgame is pressured to be no worse than that of the blueprint, while also allowing for potential improvements.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, showing that it achieves lower exploitability than prior safe techniques, including Resolving and Maxmargin. The authors also introduce a method for nested subgame solving in response to the opponent's off-tree actions, which leads to dramatically better performance than the usual approach of action translation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details. The experiments are thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed technique, discussing its potential limitations and areas for future improvement.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as DeepStack. However, the authors do provide a comparison with action translation, which is a widely used approach in imperfect-information games.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of imperfect-information games, and the proposed technique has the potential to be widely adopted in practice. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em poker, which is a challenging and widely studied benchmark.
