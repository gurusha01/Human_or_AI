This paper presents a novel pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), addressing the critical first step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. The proposed methodology, dubbed Yet Another Spike Sorter (YASS), is a multistage procedure that combines a neural network-based detection method, efficient outlier triaging, and a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) clustering approach. The pipeline is designed to be modular, scalable, and robust, leveraging prior information and adapting to the large dense MEA setting.
The paper is well-structured, and the methodology is thoroughly explained with detailed proofs. However, the section on methods is dense and lacks a clear summary of the final design and parameter choices, making a figure illustrating the method necessary. The experiments are impressively thorough, involving several open datasets and competing methods, but could be improved with more detail on preprocessing and a better training/validation/test split.
The quality of English is mostly good, but occasional problems and repetitive sentences require proof-reading to clarify and improve the manuscript. The manuscript could benefit from including comparable results from the literature to validate the reported results and increase the credibility of the new method.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses a significant problem in the field of neuroscience, and the proposed solution is novel and well-motivated. The paper is well-written, and the methodology is sound. However, the lack of a clear summary of the final design and parameter choices, as well as the need for more detail on preprocessing and a better training/validation/test split, are notable weaknesses.
The paper's strengths include its thorough experimentation, impressive performance on both synthetic and real datasets, and its potential to have a major practical and scientific impact in large-scale neuroscience. The weaknesses include the density of the methods section, the need for more detail on preprocessing, and the lack of comparable results from the literature.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and has the potential to make a major impact. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, including adding a clear summary of the final design and parameter choices, providing more detail on preprocessing, and including comparable results from the literature.
