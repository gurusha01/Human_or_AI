This paper presents a novel approach to online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO framework. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves a remarkable balance between regret and constraint violations, with expected regret and constraint violations of O(√T) and high probability regret and constraint violations of O(√T log(T)).
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of the algorithm and its analysis. The use of a drift lemma for stochastic processes is a nice touch, and the authors provide a thorough proof of the lemma and its application to the algorithm.
The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world scenario of online job scheduling in distributed data centers. The comparison with other baselines, such as "react" and "low-power," shows that the proposed algorithm performs closely to the best fixed decision in hindsight, both in terms of electricity cost and constraint violations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and significant extension of the traditional OCO framework to handle stochastic constraints
* A well-structured and clear presentation of the algorithm and its analysis
* A thorough proof of the drift lemma and its application to the algorithm
* Impressive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The analysis of the algorithm relies heavily on the drift lemma, which may not be immediately familiar to all readers
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed algorithm
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in optimization and control theory
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. However, I would suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to address some of the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed algorithm.
