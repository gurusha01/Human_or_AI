This paper proposes a novel approach to online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors develop a new algorithm that achieves a regret of O(√T) and constraint violations of O(√T) in expectation, and O(√T log(T)) in high probability. The algorithm is based on a drift-plus-penalty framework, which is a common approach in stochastic optimization.
The paper is well-written, and the results are technically sound. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the notation is well-defined. The algorithm is described in detail, and the analysis is thorough. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work, which provides a good context for the contributions of the paper.
One of the strengths of the paper is the development of a new drift lemma for stochastic processes, which is used to establish the bounds on the regret and constraint violations. The lemma is novel and can be useful in other stochastic optimization problems. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm, including a discussion of the intuition behind the drift-plus-penalty framework and the role of the virtual queues in the algorithm.
The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm in a real-world data center scheduling problem. The comparison with other baselines, such as the best fixed decision in hindsight, react, and low-power, shows that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of both electricity cost and constraint violations.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. One of the main limitations is that the algorithm assumes that the stochastic constraints are i.i.d. over time, which may not be the case in all applications. Additionally, the algorithm requires knowledge of the bounds on the subgradients of the loss functions and the constraint functions, which may not be available in practice.
In terms of originality, the paper makes significant contributions to the field of stochastic optimization. The development of a new drift lemma and the application of the drift-plus-penalty framework to OCO with stochastic constraints are novel and can be useful in other problems. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to contextualize the contributions of the paper.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a important problem in stochastic optimization. The results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications, including data center scheduling, portfolio optimization, and resource allocation. The paper is well-written, and the results are technically sound, making it a strong candidate for publication.
