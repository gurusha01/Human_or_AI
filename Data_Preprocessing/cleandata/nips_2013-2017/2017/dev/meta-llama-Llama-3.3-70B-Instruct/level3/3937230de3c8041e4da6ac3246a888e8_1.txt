This paper proposes a novel approach to augmenting generative models with external memory, using variational inference to train the memory module. The authors introduce a stochastic addressing mechanism, which allows the model to sample a discrete memory address and retrieve the corresponding content from memory. This approach enables the model to perform precise memory lookups during inference and training, and is particularly well-suited for generative few-shot learning tasks.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's behavior and performance, including experiments on both MNIST and Omniglot datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to effectively use the external memory to improve its performance on generative few-shot learning tasks, and is able to scale to large memory sizes.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to clearly relate the proposed approach to previous work in the field, including variational autoencoders, memory-augmented neural networks, and attention mechanisms. The authors provide a detailed discussion of the differences between their approach and previous work, and demonstrate how their approach can be used to improve upon existing methods.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that the algorithm does not scale well with respect to the external memory size, due to the increasing variance of black box gradients with the size of the memory. This may limit the applicability of the approach to very large memory sizes.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to augmenting generative models with external memory, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a range of tasks. The paper is well-written, clearly explained, and provides a thorough analysis of the model's behavior and performance.
