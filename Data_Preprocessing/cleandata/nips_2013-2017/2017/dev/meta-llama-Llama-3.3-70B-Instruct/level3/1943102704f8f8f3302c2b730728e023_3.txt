This paper presents a novel approach to subgame solving in imperfect-information games, which is a crucial problem in game theory and artificial intelligence. The authors introduce a new technique called Reach subgame solving, which improves upon previous methods by considering the potential gifts that a player could receive from other subgames. This approach leads to stronger theoretical guarantees and better practical performance than prior subgame-solving methods.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem of subgame solving in imperfect-information games. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the Reach subgame solving technique, including its theoretical foundations and practical implementation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it outperforms previous methods in terms of exploitability.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical applications. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the Reach subgame solving technique, including its safety guarantees and exploitability bounds. At the same time, they demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the approach through experiments on large-scale games, including heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.
The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence, as it presents a new approach to solving complex games that can be applied to a wide range of domains. The authors' development of the Libratus AI, which defeated top human professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, is a notable achievement that demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of clarity in some sections, particularly in the presentation of the Reach subgame solving technique. The authors could provide more intuitive explanations and examples to help readers understand the underlying concepts. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other subgame-solving methods, including a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.
