This paper introduces a novel technique called "reach subgame solving" for decision making in imperfect-information, two-player zero-sum games. The method leverages knowledge of payoff differences to inform decisions, leading to low exploitability and improved performance over existing methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various experiments, including heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, where it outperforms human subjects and prior state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a thorough background on imperfect-information games and the challenges of solving them, while the subsequent sections delve into the specifics of the reach subgame solving technique and its applications.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical considerations. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their approach, including proofs and guarantees on exploitability, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The experiments are well-designed and comprehensive, covering various game settings and comparing the performance of different subgame-solving techniques.
The paper also raises interesting questions about the potential for adapting the reach subgame solving method to other notions of exploitability, such as correlated equilibria, and to non-zero sum games, like bimatrix games. These directions for future research are intriguing and could lead to significant advances in the field.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear presentation of the results. The authors are careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, providing a balanced view of its potential and limitations.
The clarity of the paper is also noteworthy, with clear and concise language used throughout. The organization is logical and easy to follow, making it simple for readers to understand the authors' arguments and reproduce their results.
The originality of the paper is another significant strength, as the reach subgame solving technique represents a novel combination of familiar techniques. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from previous contributions and demonstrate its unique advantages.
Finally, the significance of the paper is evident in its potential impact on the field of imperfect-information games. The authors' results have important implications for the development of AI systems that can effectively play complex games, and their approach could lead to significant advances in areas like game theory, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
