This paper introduces a new algorithm for online convex optimization (OCO) with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting. The authors propose a novel learning algorithm that achieves O(√T) expected regret and constraint violations, and O(√T log(T)) high probability regret and constraint violations. The algorithm is based on a drift-plus-penalty approach, which minimizes an upper bound of the drift-plus-penalty expression.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem setting and the proposed algorithm. The technical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed proof of the main results. The experiment section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application, namely online job scheduling in distributed data centers.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm for OCO with stochastic constraints, which is a significant extension of the traditional OCO setting.
* The provision of a thorough technical analysis, including a detailed proof of the main results.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real-world application.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper is dense and difficult to read in some places, requiring improvements in clarity and presentation.
* The authors do not provide a conclusion discussing the potential for the proposed algorithm to find applications beyond the specific problem setting considered in the paper.
* There are several technical errors and suggestions for improvement, including formatting issues, missing symbols, and requests for additional derivations or explanations.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a significant contribution to the field of online convex optimization and stochastic optimization.
