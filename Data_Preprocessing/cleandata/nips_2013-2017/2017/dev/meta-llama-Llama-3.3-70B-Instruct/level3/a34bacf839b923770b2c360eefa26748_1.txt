This paper proposes a novel framework, HYBRID, for predicting user activities based on point processes. The framework provides an efficient estimator of the probability mass function of point processes, which is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks with an arbitrary function f. The authors reformulate the prediction problem, design a new random variable with reduced variance, and derive a differential-difference equation to compute the conditional probability mass function. The framework is evaluated on real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details. The proof in Appendix C is well-structured and convincing. The use of numerical methods for approximating the integration of the probability mass function is well-done, and the authors' use of ode45 from Matlab is consistent with the method's documentation.
The paper's contribution of a novel transport equation seems novel and useful, and I could not find any similar work in the field. The authors also provide a scalable algorithm for solving the ODE, which is efficient and easy to implement.
However, I have some minor comments on the paper's writing. There are a few typos and suggestions for rephrasing certain sentences to improve clarity. Additionally, the paper's references are dominated by a single cluster of authors, and it would be beneficial to cite the original contributors of the datasets used in the paper.
To further improve the paper, I would like to see an example of a point process that is not covered by prior art to help understand the impact of the paper's contributions. Furthermore, the paper's claim of a new random variable, g(Htminus), may not be entirely new, as the concept of a conditional intensity function is already known in the field.
Overall, I recommend the inclusion of this paper in NIPS based on my understanding of the content. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of point processes and has the potential to impact various applications in social sciences. However, I may not be able to fully evaluate the paper's technical contributions due to my lack of expertise in the area.
