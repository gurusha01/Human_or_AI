This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporate linear operator constraints into Gaussian process regression by modifying the mean and covariance functions. The authors provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints in a continuous manner. The framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world problems, demonstrating its benefits over traditional data augmentation strategies.
The paper is well-written, clear, and original, with a strong related work section that highlights the significance of the problem and the novelty of the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature and provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their method.
However, the experimental section is considered weak, with only two examples presented, and the evaluation metrics used are limited. Additionally, the paper lacks convincing examples of the significance and practical applications of the proposed approach, particularly in probabilistic numeric methods.
The reviewer finds the problem addressed by the authors relevant and important, but feels that the authors failed to demonstrate its potential impact and applications. The paper is considered borderline due to its weak experimental section and lack of demonstrated practical applications, despite its good quality and originality.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to incorporating linear operator constraints into Gaussian process regression.
* The authors provide a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator, which allows for the incorporation of constraints in a continuous manner.
* The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with a strong related work section.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The experimental section is weak, with only two examples presented, and the evaluation metrics used are limited.
* The paper lacks convincing examples of the significance and practical applications of the proposed approach, particularly in probabilistic numeric methods.
* The authors failed to demonstrate the potential impact and applications of the proposed approach, which makes it difficult to assess its relevance and importance.
Overall, the paper has the potential to be a good contribution to the field, but it needs to be strengthened with more extensive experiments and a clearer demonstration of its practical applications and significance.
