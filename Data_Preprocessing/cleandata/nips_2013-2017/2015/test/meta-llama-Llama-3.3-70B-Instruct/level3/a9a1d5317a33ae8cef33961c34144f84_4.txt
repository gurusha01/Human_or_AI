This paper proposes a novel approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes, aiming to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both training and testing. The authors introduce a new objective function for decision tree learning, which optimizes the partitioning of data at each node to achieve pure and balanced splits. Theoretical analysis shows that this approach can lead to effective reduction of the average Shannon entropy over the entire tree. The authors also propose an online decision tree construction procedure, called LOMtree, which constructs a logarithmic depth tree by recursively splitting nodes based on the proposed objective function.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed approach. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing training and testing time while maintaining competitive accuracy.
However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed. Firstly, the comparison with other methods, such as the Venn-Abers predictors, is limited, and more introduction and comparison are needed to clarify the differences and advantages of the proposed approach. Secondly, the experimental results are based on only one UCI dataset, and more datasets, especially challenging ones, should be used to confirm the superiority of the proposed method. Additionally, the sensitivity of the proposed method to the parameter k used in CVAP should be investigated, as it generally obtains the best performance.
The novelty of the paper is not entirely clear, as some of the ideas and techniques used are similar to those in previous work. The authors should clarify how their approach differs from previous contributions and provide more references to related work. Furthermore, the experimental design could be improved by providing more details on the datasets used, the experimental setup, and the evaluation metrics.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical. However, the originality of the paper could be improved, and more references to related work should be provided.
Overall, the paper is a good contribution to the field of multiclass classification, and with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
