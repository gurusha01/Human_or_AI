This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors introduce a "gating network" that discriminatively trains a feed-forward architecture to predict latent variables in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is a widely used generative model for image restoration. The key idea is to reduce the computational cost of inference in GMMs by replacing the expensive "gating" step with a learned gating network.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of image restoration and the existing approaches. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a significant reduction in computational cost.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The authors show that their approach can achieve a speedup of two orders of magnitude while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The paper also highlights the modularity advantage of generative models, demonstrating that the proposed approach can be used for various image restoration tasks, including denoising and deblurring.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly those that use discriminative approaches. Secondly, the paper could benefit from more visualizations and illustrations to help readers understand the technical details of the proposed method. Finally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of their approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides a clear contribution to the field of image restoration. The authors have also demonstrated the significance of their approach through extensive experiments and comparisons with other methods.
