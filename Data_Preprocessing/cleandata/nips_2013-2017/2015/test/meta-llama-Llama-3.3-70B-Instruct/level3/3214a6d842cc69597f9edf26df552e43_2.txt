This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty, with a focus on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors derive a concentration-of-measure inequality that provides probabilistic bounds on the expected cost of executing a new stochastic policy, taking into account the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation.
The paper's main strength lies in its ability to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety, which is essential in applications such as robotics and control systems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments on a simple robot navigation scenario and a more complex aerial vehicle navigation problem.
One of the key contributions of this paper is the derivation of a novel inequality bound that accounts for the unboundedness of the policy adaptation ratio. The authors employ a robust estimation technique, which truncates higher moments of the random variable, to obtain a more robust estimate of the expected cost. This approach is shown to be effective in providing tight bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with stochastic optimization and control theory. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the significance of their contributions.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the connection between the derived bounds and the PAC-Bayesian approach, which is mentioned as a potential direction for future work. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of samples and the confidence level, and how these affect the tightness of the bounds.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques from stochastic optimization and control theory to address the problem of robustness analysis. The authors' use of concentration-of-measure inequalities and robust estimation techniques to derive probabilistic bounds on the expected cost is a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of this work lies in its potential to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety in a wide range of applications, including robotics, control systems, and decision making under uncertainty. The authors' approach could be used to develop more robust and reliable control systems, which is essential in many real-world applications.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of stochastic optimization and control theory. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough review of related work. The authors' approach has the potential to make a significant impact in a wide range of applications, and the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this area.
