This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors introduce a "gating network" that is discriminatively trained to predict the latent variables in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is a key component of the generative model. This approach allows for a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining the modularity and flexibility of generative models.
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the existing approaches to image restoration, including both generative and discriminative models. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a detailed description of the gating network and its training procedure.
However, I found the method description to be somewhat rough and the empirical evaluation not thorough enough. The authors could provide more clarification on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and compare it to other alternatives. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed variational inference method is not fully clear, and the authors should provide more information on when it is expected to work and fail.
The performance of the methods when using sampled points as inducing inputs is unknown and requires further investigation. The authors should also provide a rule of thumb for selecting the number and placement of inducing points. Furthermore, the paper lacks clear explanations of key terms, such as matrices K and L, and contains unnecessary discussions on directly learning marginal kernel parameters.
Despite these limitations, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of image restoration. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a significant reduction in computational cost, which is a major advantage over existing methods. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the technical contributions, including the gating network and its training procedure. Additionally, the authors should provide more thorough empirical evaluations, including comparisons to other alternative methods and a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I would rate this paper as follows:
* Quality: 7/10 (the paper is technically sound, but the method description could be improved, and the empirical evaluation is not thorough enough)
* Clarity: 8/10 (the paper is well-written, but some key terms and concepts could be explained more clearly)
* Originality: 9/10 (the paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration that combines the strengths of generative and discriminative models)
* Significance: 8/10 (the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of image restoration, but the empirical evaluation could be more thorough)
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the limitations mentioned above.
