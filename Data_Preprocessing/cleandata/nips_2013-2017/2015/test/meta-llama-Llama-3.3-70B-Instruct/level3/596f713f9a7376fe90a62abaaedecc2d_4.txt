This paper proposes a fast approximate inference approach for MAP estimation with the generative EPLL method, which achieves a significant speedup of 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the exact EPLL inference with a relatively modest drop in performance. The authors' goal of retaining the benefits of generative approaches while improving inference efficiency is well-motivated, but the proposed method is not generic and only addresses a specific problem of inference with the EPLL method.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approximate inference procedure yields similar performance to the exact EPLL inference, making it possible to apply EPLL to large images. However, I am puzzled by why EPLL is the only generative approach that is competitive with discriminative methods, and I think this would be an interesting direction to explore.
While the paper makes an important contribution by yielding a generative image restoration approach that is competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative methods in terms of restoration quality and speed of inference, it over-promises its contributions. The paper does not propose a deep integration between generative and discriminative methods, but rather a specific solution for a specific problem. Furthermore, the discussion of discriminative and generative approaches is not nuanced and does not consider other important aspects such as the ability to use different loss functions at test time.
The explanation of the gating network in the paper is hard to understand and needs clarification, and there are several typos and formatting issues throughout the paper. The paper's title and abstract are also misleading, as they suggest a more general method than what is actually proposed.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I evaluate the paper as follows:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. However, the paper could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method.
* Clarity: The paper is not clearly written, and the explanation of the gating network needs clarification. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed description of the experimental setup and results.
* Originality: The paper proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques, but it is not entirely clear how this work differs from previous contributions.
* Significance: The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique approach to generative image restoration.
