This paper proposes a novel approach for learning the structure of a nonparametric graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. The authors introduce a penalized score matching objective, which can be efficiently minimized using existing group lasso solvers. The approach is based on the idea of minimizing the Fisher divergence between the model score function and the data score function, which does not require the evaluation of the normalizing constant.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed approach, including the theoretical guarantees and experimental results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several simulated datasets, including a chain graph-based Gaussian model and a nonparanormal distribution. The results show that the proposed approach can recover the true underlying graphical structure with high probability, even when the sample size is relatively small.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle nonparametric graphical models, which is a significant departure from existing approaches that rely on parametric assumptions. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical guarantees, including the assumptions and the proof of the main theorem.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing approaches, such as graphical lasso and nonparanormal models. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of the regularization parameter and the kernel function, which are critical components of the proposed approach.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach for learning nonparametric graphical models, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of score matching as a divergence measure is also a new and interesting idea. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the related work and how the proposed approach differs from existing methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed approach. The experimental results are convincing, and the theoretical guarantees provide a solid foundation for the approach. With some minor improvements, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of graphical models.
