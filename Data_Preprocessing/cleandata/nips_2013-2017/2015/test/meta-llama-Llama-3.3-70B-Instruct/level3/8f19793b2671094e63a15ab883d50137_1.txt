This paper proposes a method for matrix estimation from linear measurements, assuming the estimated matrix is positive semidefinite (PSD). The authors study the problem of recovering a d x d PSD matrix from n linear measurements using an ordinary least squares estimator with a PSD constraint, without regularization. The main contribution of the paper is to show that this approach achieves good statistical properties, including a bound on the estimation error for low-rank matrices.
The paper is well-motivated, and the problem of matrix estimation is an important one in many fields. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections of the paper are also well-written, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the proposed estimator.
However, the paper has some limitations. The estimation error is unbounded if the number of linear measurements n is too small, even if the matrix to recover has low rank, unless certain conditions on the design are met. Additionally, the scaling of the constants in the bound on the estimation error with n, d, and r is unknown, which makes it difficult to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed approach.
The paper is not well-written in some places, with some equations and definitions requiring improvement. The notation is also not consistent throughout the paper, which can make it difficult to follow. Furthermore, the paper is considered too preliminary for acceptance to NIPS, as it lacks a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on real-world datasets and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by experimental results. The paper is not a complete piece of work, as it lacks a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The authors are not careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work, as they do not provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach.
In terms of clarity, the paper is not well-written in some places, with some equations and definitions requiring improvement. The notation is also not consistent throughout the paper, which can make it difficult to follow. The paper does not adequately inform the reader, as it lacks a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new approach to matrix estimation, but it is not clear how this approach differs from previous contributions. The paper does not provide a thorough discussion of related work, which makes it difficult to evaluate the novelty of the proposed approach.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in matrix estimation, but the results are not significant enough to warrant acceptance to NIPS. The paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and the experimental results are limited.
Overall, I would not recommend accepting this paper to NIPS in its current form. The paper needs to be revised to address the limitations mentioned above, including providing a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on real-world datasets, comparing the proposed approach with state-of-the-art methods, and improving the writing and notation.
