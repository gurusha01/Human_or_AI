This paper presents a novel approach to denoising using generative models, specifically Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), with a focus on discriminative training to improve speed. The authors argue that their method offers a speed advantage over traditional denoising methods, such as those using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, I question whether this speed advantage is significant, and whether the modularity of GMMs is the only potential benefit over MLPs.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the authors' story, making it easy to follow and understand. The approach is simple, yet the results are convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, discussing both its strengths and weaknesses.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The authors are careful and honest in their evaluation, acknowledging the limitations of their approach. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to reproduce the results.
However, I have some doubts about the originality and significance of the paper. While the approach is novel, it is not clear how it differs significantly from previous contributions. The authors could have provided more context and references to related work to demonstrate the uniqueness of their approach. Additionally, the practical importance of modularity in real-world applications is questionable, as the noise model is often known or limited to a few choices.
