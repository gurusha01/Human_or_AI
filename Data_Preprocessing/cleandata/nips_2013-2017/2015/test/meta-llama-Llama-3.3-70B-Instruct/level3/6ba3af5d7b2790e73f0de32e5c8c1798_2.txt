This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of nonparametric graphical models without assuming a specific parametric form. The authors utilize a penalized score matching objective, which avoids the need to compute the normalization constant, making it applicable to a broad family of infinite-dimensional exponential families. The method is based on minimizing the expected distance between the model score function and the data score function, and the authors establish a representer theorem, allowing for efficient optimization using group lasso solvers.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The theoretical guarantees provided in Section 4 are impressive, and the experiments in Section 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering the true graph structure.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to learning nonparametric graphical models, which avoids the need for parametric assumptions.
* The establishment of a representer theorem, allowing for efficient optimization using group lasso solvers.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the proposed method, including consistency and convergence rates.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method in experiments, including comparisons with existing methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of additive node and edge potentials, which may not always hold in practice.
* The requirement for a large sample size to achieve good performance, which may be a limitation in some applications.
* The lack of comparison with other nonparametric graphical model learning methods, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graphical model learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and assumptions of the method, and to explore its applications in practice.
