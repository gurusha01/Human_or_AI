This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of a kernel-based graphical model using score-matching as the objective of the learning procedure. The method is scalable and asymptotically consistent, making it a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-organized, and the authors clearly explain their contributions and ideas.
The theoretical analysis and experiments are thorough, and the authors provide a clear understanding of the proposed approach. However, there are some areas that could be improved. For instance, the paper lacks discussion or empirical evaluation of how to choose the kernel parameters, which is a crucial aspect of the method. The authors could have provided more insight into this or suggested possible approaches, such as grid-search and cross-validation.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from more clarity in the mathematical developments and notations. The authors could have provided a table of notations or derived certain equations in the supplementary material to make the paper more readable. The paper is original, with significant development with respect to previously published work, but the authors could have related their work to other existing research that uses kernels with probabilistic graphical models.
The proposed idea is interesting and potentially impactful, particularly for structure learning for non-Gaussian variables. However, the authors do not discuss the normalization constant estimation, which is an essential aspect of the method. The authors provide several minor comments and suggestions, including typos, formatting issues, and requests for additional information or clarification on certain points.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the topic. The proposed approach has the potential to be a significant contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the mentioned areas, it could be even stronger. The arguments for acceptance include the originality and significance of the proposed approach, the thorough theoretical analysis and experiments, and the potential impact on the field. The arguments against acceptance include the lack of discussion on kernel parameter selection, the need for more clarity in mathematical developments and notations, and the omission of normalization constant estimation.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, but some areas could be improved for better readability.
