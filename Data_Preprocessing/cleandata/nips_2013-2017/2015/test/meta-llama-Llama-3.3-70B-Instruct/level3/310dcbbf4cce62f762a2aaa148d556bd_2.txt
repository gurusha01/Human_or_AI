This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of stochastic decision making under uncertainty, particularly in the context of iterative stochastic policy optimization. The authors develop a novel approach to derive probably-approximate bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation for a given decision strategy. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides a thorough analysis of the problem.
The main strength of the paper lies in its ability to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety, which is a critical aspect of decision making under uncertainty. The authors achieve this by employing concentration-of-measure inequalities and developing a robust estimation technique to handle unbounded likelihood ratios. The resulting bounds are applicable to a wide range of stochastic decision problems, including those with complex constraints and nonlinear dynamics.
The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through a simple robot navigation scenario and a more complex aerial vehicle navigation problem. The experimental results show that the bounds can be tight and provide a good estimate of the expected cost and probability of collision.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The analysis is restricted to finite discrete contexts, fixed costs, and a single budget constraint, which may not be representative of all real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the theoretical aspects of the problem, with limited discussion on the practical implications and potential applications of the approach.
To further improve the paper, it would be beneficial to include more experimental results and case studies to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach in different domains. Moreover, the authors could explore the potential of using the developed bounds to design new algorithms that directly minimize the bound and therefore have built-in robustness properties.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides a clear motivation for the research. The approach is novel and differs from previous contributions in the field.
