This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by proposing a new algorithm, PEGI, for provable model recovery in the presence of Gaussian noise. The algorithm is based on a pseudo-Euclidean gradient iteration and does not require the complicated quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step used in previous methods. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the SINR-optimal demixing solution and demonstrate that it can be recovered using the proposed algorithm.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical innovations and contributions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to existing methods, particularly in the medium sample regime. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the related work and the limitations of previous methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is the clarity of the presentation, which makes it easy to follow and understand the technical contributions. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the SINR-optimal demixing solution and its relationship to the proposed algorithm. The experimental results are convincing, and the comparison to existing methods is thorough.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The figure text is too small, and the legends of some figures are not observable, which reduces the clarity of the paper. Additionally, the discussion of the results in Section 4 could be more detailed, providing more insight into the plots and their significance.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on prior work by Arora et al. and Voss et al., which reduces the apparent originality of the work. However, the result is still significant in enabling the development of robust algorithms for ICA in the presence of Gaussian noise.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its relationship to existing methods. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of ICA.
