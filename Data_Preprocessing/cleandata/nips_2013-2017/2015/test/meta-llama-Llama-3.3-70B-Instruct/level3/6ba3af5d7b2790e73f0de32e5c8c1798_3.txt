This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of nonparametric graphical models without assuming a particular parametric model. The authors utilize a penalized score matching objective, which can be efficiently minimized using existing group lasso solvers. The method does not require computing the normalization constant, making it applicable to a broad family of infinite-dimensional exponential families.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of their method, including the model formulation, estimation procedure, and statistical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in cases where the underlying distribution is non-Gaussian.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The paper lacks certain details, making it challenging to reproduce the results. For instance, the implementation of the LSTM model is unclear, and the experimental setup, including the learning rate, momentum, and hyperparameter selection, is not well-explained. Additionally, the data construction process is not transparent, and it is unclear whether pruning was used to balance the dataset.
The authors assume the effectiveness of curriculum learning and the multiplicative interaction between actions without providing experimental validation. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
Despite these limitations, the paper presents an impressive result, and the proposed approach has the potential to advance the state of the art in nonparametric graphical model learning. The authors demonstrate the ability of their procedure to recover the true graph structure without knowledge of the data-generating process, which is a significant contribution to the field.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to nonparametric graphical model learning, which combines score matching with group lasso solvers. The paper provides a unique perspective on the problem and offers a new solution that differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to impact the field of machine learning and statistics. The proposed approach can be applied to various applications, including computational biology, natural language processing, and computer vision. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in nonparametric graphical model learning.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the mentioned limitations and provide more details about the implementation and experimental setup.
