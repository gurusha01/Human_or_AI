This paper proposes a novel algorithm, PEGI, for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. The algorithm extends the Gradient-Iteration (GI) ICA algorithm by formulating the signal recovery problem in a pseudo-Euclidean space, which allows for the sidestepping of the complicated quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step required by the conventional GI-ICA algorithm.
The paper is well-written, and the proposed method is technically sound. The authors provide a clear explanation of the pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in recovering the mixing matrix A in noisy ICA. The experimental results show that PEGI outperforms existing practical algorithms, including those specifically designed for beamforming, in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) demixing.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle the case of complex signals and its robustness to noise. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the indeterminacies of ICA and demonstrate how their algorithm can perform SINR-optimal source recovery.
However, there are a few areas that require improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work, particularly in the area of underdetermined blind signal separation (BSS). Additionally, the authors should ensure that the notation is clear and consistent throughout the paper, such as defining $^\dagger$ as the pseudo-inverse.
Furthermore, the paper appears to reuse sentences from another manuscript, which raises concerns about plagiarism or self-plagiarism. The authors should take care to rephrase or properly cite any reused material.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to ICA in the presence of Gaussian noise, which is a significant contribution to the field. The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a practical and provably SINR-optimal recovery method for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise.
Overall, I would rate the paper as very good in quality, excellent in clarity, good in originality, and good in significance. The proposed method is a key innovation in the field of noisy ICA, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm and its performance.
