This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty, with a focus on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors derive a concentration-of-measure inequality to compute probabilistic bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation, which can be used to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety.
The paper introduces a unique setup, analyzing contextual bandits against a stronger baseline that utilizes adaptive linear programming to make decisions on suboptimal rounds. The authors also propose a robust estimation technique to handle the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide formal guarantees on future executions of control algorithms, its applicability to a wide range of stochastic decision-making problems, and its potential to advance the state of the art in robust model-predictive control. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their approach, with a simple example to illustrate the application of the bounds.
However, there are some areas that require clarification and further development. For instance, the special treatment of boundary cases, particularly when rho equals q_j, is not fully explained and requires further justification. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with existing work in the field, such as the relationship between their approach and other methods for robustness analysis.
The paper's significance lies in its potential to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety in stochastic decision-making problems, which is crucial in applications such as robotics and autonomous systems. The authors' approach could also be applied to other areas, such as finance and healthcare, where robust decision-making is essential.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation of the approach. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, and the authors are careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-written, with sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to robustness analysis, which combines concentration-of-measure inequalities with robust estimation techniques. The paper also provides a unique perspective on the application of probabilistic bounds to stochastic decision-making problems.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robustness analysis and stochastic decision-making, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications. With some further clarification and development, the paper could be even stronger and more effective in conveying its message.
