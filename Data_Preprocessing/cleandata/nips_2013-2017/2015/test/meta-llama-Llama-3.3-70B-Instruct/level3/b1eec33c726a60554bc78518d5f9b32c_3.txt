This paper explores regression problems with multiple vector-valued outputs that share common attributes, focusing on two popular models: pooled and SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regression) models. The authors investigate the performance of Alternating Minimization (AM) as a solution, demonstrating that its performance is within universal constant factors of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) under these models. This contribution is significant as it provides insights into the efficacy of AM in handling complex regression problems with shared attributes.
The paper's strengths lie in its technical soundness, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis. The authors are careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work, acknowledging areas for further exploration, such as the potential impact of using fresh samples on the performance of AM. The writing is clear, and the organization of the paper is logical, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the topic.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations to the paper. The results are limited to two specific models (pooled and SUR), and it would be beneficial to discuss the generic conditions under which AM can perform well compared to MLE for regression problems. Additionally, applying the results to real-world data would be a valuable extension to demonstrate the practical implications of the research. The use of fresh samples in theorem 1 may contribute to an additional logarithmic factor, which is an area worthy of further investigation.
In terms of originality, the paper combines familiar techniques in a novel way, providing a unique perspective on the performance of AM in regression problems with shared attributes. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper differs from previous contributions in its focus on the pooled and SUR models.
The significance of the results is notable, as they address a challenging problem in regression analysis. The paper advances the state of the art by providing a theoretical understanding of the performance of AM in these models, which could be useful for practitioners and researchers working on related problems.
Arguments for acceptance:
- Technical soundness and well-supported claims
- Clear writing and logical organization
- Novel combination of familiar techniques

Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, demonstrating a clear understanding of the research question and providing valuable insights into the performance of AM in regression problems with shared attributes. With some extensions to address the limitations and further exploration of the results, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
