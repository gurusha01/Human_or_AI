This paper presents a method for estimating low-rank semidefinite matrices from noisy inner products, without relying on nuclear norm regularization. The approach involves solving a constrained least squares problem, which is shown to be effective when the measurements do not have semidefinite matrices in their nullspace. The paper provides theoretical results, simulations, and a real data experiment to verify the claims made.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide accurate estimation without regularization, which can be beneficial in certain situations where choosing a regularization parameter can be challenging. The approach is also computationally efficient, with a computational overhead consisting of sorting and other computations taking time O(n). The paper's results are more general than those of previous works, and the comparison to recover the rates of special cases would help understand the strength of the results.
However, the paper's weaknesses include the lack of practical motivation for the sampling model and experimental setup. The results require special measurements that do not have semidefinite matrices in their nullspace, which may not be satisfied by "generic" Gaussian measurements. Additionally, the paper's results seem somewhat under-interpreted, and the reviewer is eager to hear the authors' responses to several questions and concerns.
The paper's significance lies in its ability to provide a new approach to estimating low-rank semidefinite matrices, which can be useful in various applications such as machine learning and signal processing. The paper's originality lies in its ability to provide a constrained least squares approach that does not rely on nuclear norm regularization.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is good. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the results and the potential applications of the approach.
Overall, the paper presents a solid contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong paper. The arguments for acceptance include the paper's originality, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field. The arguments against acceptance include the lack of practical motivation and the under-interpretation of the results.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more discussion on the practical implications of the results, explore the potential applications of the approach, and address the concerns mentioned above. Additionally, the authors could provide more comparisons to previous works and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approach in more detail. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
