This paper presents an interesting analysis of iterative stochastic policy optimization, a crucial problem in decision-making under uncertainty. The authors employ concentration-of-measure inequalities to derive a novel inequality bound that accounts for the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation. The bound serves as a high-confidence certificate for providing future performance or safety guarantees.
The paper's strengths include its well-motivated problem formulation, clear presentation, and reasonably fine experiments. The authors provide a simple robot control scenario and initial steps towards applications to challenging aerial vehicle navigation problems, demonstrating the potential applicability of their approach.
However, the current analysis is limited as it only provides an upper bound for policy evaluation without proposing an algorithm to utilize this bound. The analysis is considered standard and lacks significant theoretical contribution on its own, making it less impactful. Furthermore, the tightness and practicality of the oracle-like upper bound are questioned, particularly in relation to the choice of alpha and its effect on the bound's meaningfulness.
The paper's quality is good, with well-supported claims and a clear presentation. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The clarity of the paper is also good, with a well-organized structure and sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
In terms of originality, the paper's approach is not entirely new, as it builds upon existing work on randomized algorithms in control theory and statistical learning. However, the application of these concepts to iterative stochastic policy optimization is a novel combination. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper's results is moderate, as they provide a useful bound for policy evaluation, but the lack of a concrete algorithm to utilize this bound limits its practical impact. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a reasonable way, but it does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents an interesting analysis of iterative stochastic policy optimization.
* The authors provide a clear presentation and reasonably fine experiments.
* The paper's approach is a novel combination of existing concepts.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The current analysis is limited, and the lack of a concrete algorithm to utilize the bound limits its practical impact.
* The analysis is considered standard and lacks significant theoretical contribution.
* The tightness and practicality of the oracle-like upper bound are questioned.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the limitations and concerns mentioned above. The authors should consider proposing a concrete algorithm to utilize the derived bound and providing more rigorous analysis of the bound's tightness and practicality.
