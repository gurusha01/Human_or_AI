This paper presents a novel approach to probabilistic prediction, introducing two new algorithms: Inductive Venn-Abers Predictors (IVAPs) and Cross-Venn-Abers Predictors (CVAPs). The authors demonstrate that these algorithms can produce well-calibrated probability predictions, which is a crucial property in many applications. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new regularization technique for isotonic regression, which is shown to improve the calibration of probability predictions. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with existing calibration methods, including Platt's method and isotonic regression. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, particularly CVAPs, in achieving good empirical performance.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The structure of Section 3 could be improved to enhance clarity and readability. Additionally, the method's extension to the spiked case with diagonal noise term requires prior knowledge of the noise term's variance, and its estimation and generalization to non-diagonal noise cases are not discussed. The experimental section could also be improved with the use of subsections to better organize the presentation of results and discussions.
The paper's contributions to the field are significant, as it addresses the important problem of calibration in probabilistic prediction. The proposed algorithms have the potential to be widely applicable, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and experimental results. The paper is well-suited for the NIPS conference, as it presents a novel approach to a fundamental problem in machine learning.
