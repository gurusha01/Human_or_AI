This paper proposes a new algorithm, PEGI, for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. The algorithm is based on a pseudo-Euclidean gradient iteration and is shown to be efficient and accurate in recovering the mixing matrix A. The paper also addresses the issue of optimal demixing in noisy ICA and shows that the SINR-optimal demixing matrix can be constructed from the recovered mixing matrix A and the covariance of the observed data.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical innovations and contributions. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the advantages of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to existing ICA algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new algorithm, PEGI, which is conceptually simple and efficient.
* The addressing of the issue of optimal demixing in noisy ICA, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The provision of thorough experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of Gaussian noise, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The requirement of a large number of samples to achieve good performance, which may not be feasible in some applications.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as those based on deep learning techniques.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes significant contributions to the field of ICA. The proposed algorithm, PEGI, is efficient and accurate, and the addressing of the issue of optimal demixing in noisy ICA is a significant advancement. However, the assumptions and limitations of the algorithm should be carefully considered in practice.
