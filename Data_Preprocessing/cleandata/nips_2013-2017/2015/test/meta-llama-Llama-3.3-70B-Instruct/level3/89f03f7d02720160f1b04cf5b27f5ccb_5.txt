This paper proposes a new method called PEGI, which extends the GI-ICA method and avoids the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step. The paper is well-written with high technical quality, but the contribution of the paper itself may be limited as most materials are from the GI-ICA paper. The additional optimality result in Section 3 is interesting but its novelty is questionable as a similar result can be found in existing literature.
The presentation of the method needs improvement, specifically in explaining how the gradient and Hessian of kurtosis are estimated from data and the advantage of PEGI over quasi-orthogonalization. The method is a reasonable extension of GI-ICA, but the presentation should be improved to clearly show its motivation and advantage over existing methods.
The paper's quality is good, with a clear and well-organized structure. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the paper could be improved by providing more context and comparison with existing methods. The originality of the paper is limited, as the method is an extension of an existing approach, but the combination of PEGI with the analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model is a new contribution.
The significance of the paper is moderate, as it provides a new method for ICA with Gaussian noise, but the impact on the field may be limited due to the similarity with existing methods. The experimental results show that PEGI outperforms existing practical algorithms, but more comparisons and analysis would be necessary to fully assess the significance of the method.
