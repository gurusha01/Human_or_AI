This paper presents a novel approach to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. The authors propose a new algorithm, PEGI (Pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), which recovers the mixing matrix A in the noisy ICA setting without requiring orthogonalization of the source signals. The algorithm is based on a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean space, which resolves technical issues common to existing algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical innovations and contributions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PEGI algorithm in recovering the mixing matrix and achieving SINR-optimal demixing. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of existing algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm that addresses the limitations of existing ICA algorithms in the presence of Gaussian noise.
* The provision of a clear and concise explanation of the technical innovations and contributions.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the PEGI algorithm through experimental results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as those using deep learning techniques.
* The limitation of the algorithm to the case of Gaussian noise, which may not be applicable to all real-world scenarios.
* The need for further analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the algorithm.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of ICA and provides a novel approach to addressing the challenges of noisy ICA. The results are promising, and the algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications.
