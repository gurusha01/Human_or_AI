This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors focus on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a well-studied problem in statistics and machine learning, and address the challenge of optimizing the parameters of the mixture model. They find that direct use of standard manifold optimization is ineffective due to slow algorithms, but a simple re-parametrization and tweaking of the optimization program improves performance greatly.
The proposed algorithm converges in time comparable to or better than the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, with similar final objective function values. The experimental results are impressive, showing a speedup factor of more than 100 while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. The authors also demonstrate the modularity advantage of generative models by applying the same prior to different image restoration tasks, such as deblurring and restoration of large images.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a detailed comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. The authors also provide a thoughtful discussion of the advantages and limitations of their approach.
