This paper proposes two new algorithms for probabilistic prediction, namely Inductive Venn-Abers Predictors (IVAPs) and Cross-Venn-Abers Predictors (CVAPs), which are designed to produce well-calibrated probability predictions. The authors demonstrate that IVAPs are automatically perfectly calibrated, while CVAPs, which are built on top of IVAPs using cross-validation, exhibit good empirical performance.
The paper is well-motivated, and the introduction provides a clear overview of the background and related work. The technical presentation is generally sound, although there are some areas that require improvement. For instance, the notation and terminology could be more clearly defined, and some of the explanations could be more concise.
One of the strengths of the paper is the thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in comparison to existing calibration methods. The results show that CVAPs consistently outperform other methods, including Platt's method and isotonic regression, in terms of log loss and Brier loss.
However, there are some areas that require further improvement. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time complexity of the proposed algorithms, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with other related work. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the theoretical properties of CVAPs, such as their calibration guarantees.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithms and their evaluation. The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic prediction, and the results have the potential to be useful in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field, and with some further refinement, it could be even stronger.
