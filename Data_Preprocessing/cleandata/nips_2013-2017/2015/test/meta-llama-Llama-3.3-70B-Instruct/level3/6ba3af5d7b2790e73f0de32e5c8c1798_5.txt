This paper presents a novel approach to learning the structure of nonparametric graphical models without assuming a specific parametric form for the underlying distribution. The authors propose a penalized score matching objective, which can be efficiently minimized using existing group lasso solvers. The approach is based on the idea of minimizing the Fisher divergence between the model and the data, which does not require computing the normalization constant. This makes the method applicable to a broad family of infinite-dimensional exponential families.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a comprehensive analysis, including both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulation studies, comparing it to existing methods such as graphical lasso. The results show that the proposed method can recover the true graph structure with high probability, even when the underlying distribution is non-Gaussian.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough understanding of the topic, considering not only the implementation of a generative model but also the underlying motivations and testing hypotheses. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow their arguments. The use of a representer theorem to reduce the optimization problem to a finite-dimensional group lasso problem is a significant contribution.
However, the main limitation of the paper is that the results on usefulness are inconclusive, and the overall impact of the work is unclear. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in simulation studies, it is unclear how well the method will perform in practice, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation, and their approach is novel and well-motivated. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel approach to learning nonparametric graphical models, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The authors provide a comprehensive analysis, including both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
* The approach is based on a well-motivated idea, and the use of a representer theorem to reduce the optimization problem to a finite-dimensional group lasso problem is a significant contribution.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The results on usefulness are inconclusive, and the overall impact of the work is unclear.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison to existing methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice.
