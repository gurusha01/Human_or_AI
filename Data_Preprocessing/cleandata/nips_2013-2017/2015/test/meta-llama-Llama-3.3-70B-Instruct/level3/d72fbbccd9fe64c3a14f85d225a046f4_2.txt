This paper presents a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors propose a multilayer model using Poisson Factor Analysis and binary units, which provides an elegant and scalable model with straightforward MCMC and SVI inference. The model is an incremental improvement from prior work, notably Zhou et al. (2012), and is likely to be of significant interest to the community despite its limited novelty.
The paper's technical soundness is evident in its well-supported claims and thorough evaluation of the proposed method. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand. The writing is concise and informative, providing enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
However, the experimental analysis lacks exploration of the proposed model itself, including questions about layer widths, overdispersion, and layer width decay. The comparison to other models, such as ORSM and LDA, is incomplete and lacks explanation for the significant performance differences. Additionally, the experimental investigation into the network structure is lacking, with the structure seeming to be arbitrarily fixed rather than thoroughly explored.
The paper's significance lies in its ability to combine the modularity of generative models with the efficiency of discriminative models. The results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a significant speedup in runtime, making it a valuable contribution to the field of image restoration.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and elegant approach to image restoration
* The proposed method combines the strengths of generative and discriminative models
* The results show significant improvement in runtime while maintaining state-of-the-art performance
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experimental analysis is limited and lacks exploration of the proposed model
* The comparison to other models is incomplete and lacks explanation for performance differences
* The network structure is not thoroughly explored and seems to be arbitrarily fixed
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of image restoration. While there are some limitations to the experimental analysis, the results are promising and demonstrate the potential of the proposed method. With some revisions to address the limitations, this paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
