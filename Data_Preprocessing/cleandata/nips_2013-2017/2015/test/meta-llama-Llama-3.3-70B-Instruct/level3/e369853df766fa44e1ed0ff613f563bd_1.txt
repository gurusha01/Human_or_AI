This paper introduces a novel label tree classifier, LOMtree, that achieves logarithmic time complexity in the number of classes for both training and testing. The approach is based on a top-down tree construction method, where each node in the tree consists of a binary classifier. The authors propose a new objective function, J(h), which encourages pure and balanced splits at each node, and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the average entropy over the entire tree.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the empirical results are impressive, showing that LOMtree outperforms other logarithmic time methods and is competitive with one-against-all classifiers in terms of accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel objective function, J(h), which is theoretically justified and empirically effective.
* The development of an online algorithm for tree construction and training, which is efficient and scalable.
* The thorough theoretical analysis, which provides a clear understanding of the approach and its limitations.
* The impressive empirical results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of LOMtree in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The connection between the proposed objective function and existing measures, such as confirmation measures and decision tree learning methods, is not fully explored.
* The difference between the proposed LOMtree and standard decision trees is not clearly explained, and the trade-off between test-time complexity and function class complexity is not fully investigated.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work, such as incremental learning of trees and Hoeffding trees.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the approach is novel and effective. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the empirical results are impressive. The paper has the potential to be very influential in the field of large-scale machine learning, and I recommend accepting it for publication at NIPS.
