This paper proposes a new algorithm, PEGI, for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. The algorithm uses a pseudo-Euclidean inner product space to recover the mixing matrix A, and it does not require the complicated quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step used in previous algorithms. The paper also combines PEGI with an analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model, and it shows that the resulting algorithm provides a complete SINR-optimal recovery algorithm in the ICA model with arbitrary Gaussian noise.
The paper is well-positioned, motivated, and of high technical quality, with a surprisingly simple ensuing algorithm. The use of a pseudo-Euclidean inner product space is a novel approach that resolves technical issues common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. The experimental results demonstrate that PEGI outperforms existing practical algorithms at the task of noisy signal recovery, including those specifically designed for beamforming, when given sufficiently many samples.
However, the novelty and improvement in performance of the proposed algorithm may be limited compared to previous work, particularly in relation to reference [21]. The method requires a large number of data points, potentially limiting its practical usefulness, especially in high-dimensional settings like the 14-dimensional example provided.
Here are the arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pro:
* The paper proposes a new algorithm for noisy ICA that is conceptually simple, efficient, and accurate in testing.
* The algorithm does not require the complicated quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step used in previous algorithms.
* The paper combines PEGI with an analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model, and it shows that the resulting algorithm provides a complete SINR-optimal recovery algorithm in the ICA model with arbitrary Gaussian noise.
* The experimental results demonstrate that PEGI outperforms existing practical algorithms at the task of noisy signal recovery.
Con:
* The novelty and improvement in performance of the proposed algorithm may be limited compared to previous work, particularly in relation to reference [21].
* The method requires a large number of data points, potentially limiting its practical usefulness, especially in high-dimensional settings.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing algorithms and a more thorough analysis of the limitations of the proposed algorithm.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of ICA. However, the limitations of the algorithm and the potential for improvement should be carefully considered. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new algorithm for noisy ICA and combines it with an analysis of objectives for optimal recovery. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way. 
Therefore, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the limitations and potential for improvement.
