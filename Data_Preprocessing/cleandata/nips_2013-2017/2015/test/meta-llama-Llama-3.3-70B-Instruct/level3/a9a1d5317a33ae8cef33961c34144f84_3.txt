This paper proposes two techniques, inductive Venn-Abers predictors (IVAPs) and cross-Venn-Abers predictors (CVAPs), for post-processing a binary classifier's output to produce probabilistic predictions. While the paper presents some interesting ideas, it has several weak spots that make it unacceptable in its current form.
One major issue is that the distinction between contribution and background remains unclear until the conclusion. The content of Section 2 seems trivial and unimpressive, and the paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the novelty and significance of the proposed methods. Furthermore, the hyperparameters of the learning machines were set by minimizing the training error, which can lead to over-fitting and renders the experimental results meaningless.
The improvement over baseline methods is consistent but small, and the new methods may not be relevant due to their increased space and time requirements. The paper lacks discussion on the relevance and usefulness of the new methods, and minor comments include issues with Platt's method, experimental evaluation, and plot readability. Additionally, the title's claim of "Large-scale" is misleading, as nothing in the paper is actually large-scale, and the plots in Figure 1 are too small to be readable.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is not a complete piece of work, and the authors are not careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper is also an issue, as it is not well-organized, and the reader is not adequately informed.
The originality of the paper is questionable, as the problems or approaches are not new, and the paper does not provide a novel combination of familiar techniques. The related work is not adequately referenced, and the paper does not significantly differ from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is also limited, as the results are not important, and other people are unlikely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper does not address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and it does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would argue against acceptance of this paper in its current form. The paper needs significant revisions to address the issues mentioned above, including clarifying the contribution and background, providing more convincing experimental results, and discussing the relevance and usefulness of the new methods.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes two new algorithms for probabilistic prediction, which could be of interest to the machine learning community.
* The paper presents some experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper has several weak spots, including unclear distinction between contribution and background, trivial and unimpressive content, and lack of discussion on relevance and usefulness.
* The experimental results are not convincing, and the paper lacks theoretical analysis to support the claims.
* The paper is not well-organized, and the clarity is an issue.
* The originality and significance of the paper are limited.
