This paper proposes a novel approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes, aiming to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both training and testing. The authors introduce a new objective function for decision tree learning, which optimizes the purity and balancedness of the partitions at each node. They also develop an online decision tree construction procedure, called LOMtree, which quickly achieves improvement in test error compared to other logarithmic training time approaches.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the empirical evaluation on multiple multiclass datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new objective function for decision tree learning, which optimizes both purity and balancedness of the partitions.
* The development of an online decision tree construction procedure, which is efficient and effective in practice.
* The thorough empirical evaluation on multiple multiclass datasets, which demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the number of classes is very large, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which could be an important consideration in practice.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multiclass classification, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in practice. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
