This paper presents a robustness analysis of decision-making under uncertainty, focusing on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors derive a novel inequality bound that accounts for the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation. The bound serves as a high-confidence certificate for providing future performance or safety guarantees.
The paper is well-written, and the results are thorough. However, I have some concerns regarding the originality of the paper. The problem of contextual bandits can be reduced to a budgeted and time-constrained bandit problem with finite arms, which has been extensively studied in the literature. I would like to see a more detailed discussion on how the authors' approach differs from existing work in this area.
Furthermore, I would like to see a clean upper bound in terms of arm gaps for the problem-dependent case, and ideally matching lower bounds in both problem-dependent and independent cases. The regret bounds in Theorem 2 seem to be suboptimal, and I suspect that they can be refined to include the sum of inverse arm gaps.
The paper raises important questions about the regret bounds, and I appreciate the authors' effort in providing a detailed analysis. However, I believe that the results are not very surprising, and the regret of order log(T) is a well-known result in the contextual bandits literature.
To better understand the complexity of the context and the originality of the setting, I would like to see lower bounds for the problem, ideally problem-dependent and problem-independent. This would provide a more complete picture of the trade-offs involved in the problem and help to assess the significance of the authors' contributions.
In terms of strengths, the paper is well-organized, and the writing is precise. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work and demonstrate the applicability of their approach to a simple robot control scenario. The use of concentration-of-measure inequalities to compute future expected cost and probability of constraint violation is a nice touch, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.
Overall, I think that the paper has some merits, but it requires more work to establish its originality and significance. I would like to see a more detailed discussion on the related work, a cleaner upper bound, and lower bounds to better understand the complexity of the problem.
