This paper proposes a new algorithm, PEGI, for solving the noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem. The algorithm is based on a gradient iteration method in a pseudo-Euclidean space and is designed to recover the mixing matrix A up to the inherent ambiguities of the noisy ICA model. The paper also combines PEGI with an analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model, providing a complete SINR-optimal recovery algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its clear presentation, originality, and positive theoretical results on convergence and optimal SINR reconstruction. The algorithm's performance is also demonstrated to outperform existing practical algorithms, such as JADE, FastICA, and 1FICA, in terms of SINR demixing, especially when given sufficient samples.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The algorithm's performance requires a large number of samples to outperform standard ICA methods, with over 50,000 samples needed in the given example. Additionally, compared to the existing GI-ICA method, PEGI shows only marginal improvement for large data sets with over 50,000 samples, making its superiority not significantly notable. The method's performance improvements over existing methods are not convincing, raising the risk of it being just another ICA method unless specific signal or noise settings are identified where PEGI clearly outperforms standard methods.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce its results. The problems and approaches are new, and the paper provides a novel combination of familiar techniques. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper demonstrates a good understanding of the existing literature.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a new and original algorithm for solving the noisy ICA problem.
* The algorithm's performance is demonstrated to outperform existing practical algorithms in terms of SINR demixing.
* The paper provides a clear and well-written presentation of the algorithm and its theoretical results.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The algorithm's performance requires a large number of samples to outperform standard ICA methods.
* The method's performance improvements over existing methods are not convincing, and specific signal or noise settings need to be identified where PEGI clearly outperforms standard methods.
* The paper's results may not be significant enough to warrant publication in a top-tier conference like NIPS.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear presentation of a new algorithm for solving the noisy ICA problem. While the algorithm's performance is demonstrated to outperform existing practical algorithms, the method's limitations and the lack of convincing performance improvements over existing methods raise some concerns about its significance and impact.
