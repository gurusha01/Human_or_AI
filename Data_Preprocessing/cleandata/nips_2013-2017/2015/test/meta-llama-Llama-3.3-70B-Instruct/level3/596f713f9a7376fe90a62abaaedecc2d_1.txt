This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce the computational expense of inference algorithms for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) priors by learning a smaller gating network to compute posterior mixture assignments. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve comparable performance to the original GMM but with a significant speedup of two orders of magnitude in runtime. The key idea is to train a discriminative, feed-forward architecture to predict the state of latent variables in a generative model of natural images, which can be used for inference in different tasks with different likelihood terms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach and its advantages over existing methods. The experimental results are impressive, showing that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks such as denoising and deblurring. The authors also demonstrate the modularity of their approach by applying it to different image restoration tasks without requiring separate training for each task.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to combine the advantages of generative and discriminative approaches. The authors show that their method can maintain the modularity of generative models while achieving the computational efficiency of discriminative models. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method and demonstrates its efficiency in practice.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The authors could provide more details on the computations involved in the gating network, including the number of multiplies and adds required. Additionally, the authors could evaluate their approach with different numbers of mixture components to understand how it affects the accuracy-time trade-off and the number of neurons required in the hidden layer.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image restoration and machine learning. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of image restoration tasks, and its modularity and efficiency make it an attractive solution for practical applications.
