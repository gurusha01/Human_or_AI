This paper presents a study on the effect of noise correlation in multi-output regression models, comparing the performance of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) methods. The authors propose an Alternative Minimization (AltMin) algorithm to solve the non-convex problem of joint optimization of covariance and regression weights in certain linear models. The contribution of the paper is a finite-sample study of AltMin and MLE, showing that both methods can benefit from correlation, but OLS cannot, with significant differences in certain examples.
The paper provides theoretical bounds for OLS and MLE, indicating that the upper bound of AltMin is indeed tight, and also includes empirical studies to validate the theory. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work. The paper is reasonably good, providing intuition, theory, and simple experiments, and the authors' response to concerns is appreciated.
However, I do have some questions and concerns. The sensitivity of the results to the value of eps is not fully explored, and the assumption of Gaussian noise may not be realistic in all scenarios. Additionally, there are some typos and errors in the proof of certain theorems and lemmas that need to be addressed. 
In terms of the quality, clarity, originality, and significance of the paper, I would say that it is technically sound, well-written, and provides a novel combination of familiar techniques. The problems and approaches are new, and the paper differs from previous contributions in its finite-sample study of AltMin and MLE. The results are important, and the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. 
Arguments pro acceptance include the paper's technical soundness, clarity, and originality, as well as its significance and potential impact on the field. Arguments con acceptance include the need for further exploration of the sensitivity of the results to certain parameters and the assumption of Gaussian noise. Overall, I believe that the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
