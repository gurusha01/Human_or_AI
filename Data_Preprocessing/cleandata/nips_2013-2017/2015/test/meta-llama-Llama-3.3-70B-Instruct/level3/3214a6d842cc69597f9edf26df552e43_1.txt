This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty, with a focus on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors employ concentration-of-measure inequalities to compute probabilistic bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation, providing a high-confidence certificate for future performance or safety guarantees. The approach is illustrated with a simple robot control scenario and applied to a more complex aerial vehicle navigation problem.
The paper's strengths include its novel application of concentration-of-measure inequalities to stochastic policy optimization, its ability to provide probabilistic bounds on expected cost and constraint violation, and its potential for use in a wide range of applications, including robotics and control theory. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their approach, making it easy to follow and understand.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper's reliance on linearization may be problematic, as it may not always be reliable in variational inference with non-conjugate models. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on previous approaches using linearization and more references to related work. The notation and definitions, such as the definition of f_n, could be clearer, and the organization of the paper could be improved.
The significance of the paper is uncertain due to questions about the reliability of the proposed method. While the authors provide some experimental results, more thorough evaluation and comparison to existing methods would be necessary to fully assess the effectiveness of their approach. The paper raises several technical questions and concerns, including unsubstantiated claims and potential issues with the linearization procedure.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper presents a novel and potentially useful approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty.
* The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their approach.
* The paper has potential for use in a wide range of applications, including robotics and control theory.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper's reliance on linearization may be problematic.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on previous approaches using linearization and more references to related work.

* The significance of the paper is uncertain due to questions about the reliability of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty. However, it could benefit from more thorough evaluation and comparison to existing methods, as well as clearer notation and definitions. With some revisions to address these concerns, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
