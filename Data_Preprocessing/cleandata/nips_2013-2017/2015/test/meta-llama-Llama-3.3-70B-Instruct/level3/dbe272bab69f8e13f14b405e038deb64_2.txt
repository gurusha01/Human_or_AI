This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors suggest training a feed-forward architecture, referred to as a "gating network," to predict the state of latent variables in a generative model of natural images, specifically a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). This approach aims to maintain the modularity of generative models while achieving the computational efficiency of discriminative models.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation behind the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough review of existing image restoration methods, including both generative and discriminative approaches. The technical details of the proposed method are also well-explained, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
However, I have some comments and suggestions for improvement. Firstly, I would like to see more detailed performance metrics, such as accuracy results and benchmark algorithm details, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. Additionally, the use of "EM algorithm" as a benchmark is unclear, and more details should be provided on the convergence criteria and implementation specifics.
I would also like to see more plots and visualizations to illustrate the results, such as two-dimensional contour plots showing the time and performance for numerical examples and benchmarks. Furthermore, plots of likelihood and time as a function of iteration would be helpful to understand the convergence behavior of the proposed method.
One of the main weaknesses of the paper is the lack of evidence that the algorithms actually work. There are no accuracy results, benchmark algorithm details, or performance vs iteration data provided. This makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of generative and discriminative models, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work and how the proposed approach differs from existing methods.
Overall, I think the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field, but it requires some revisions to address the aforementioned comments and suggestions. With more detailed performance metrics, additional plots and visualizations, and a clearer discussion of related work, the paper could be even more convincing and effective in demonstrating the benefits of the proposed approach.
