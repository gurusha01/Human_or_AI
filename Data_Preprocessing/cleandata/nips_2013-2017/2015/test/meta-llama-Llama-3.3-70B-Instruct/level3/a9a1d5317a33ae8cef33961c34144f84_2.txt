This paper proposes two novel methods, Inductive Venn-Abers Predictors (IVAPs) and Cross-Venn-Abers Predictors (CVAPs), for converting scoring outputs into probabilities. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of these methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in achieving perfect calibration and improving predictive accuracy. The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field by addressing a widespread problem in machine learning.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise presentation, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed methods. The authors have also provided sufficient information for reproducing the experimental results, which is essential for verifying the claims made in the paper. The proposed methods are novel and differ from existing approaches, such as Platt's method and isotonic regression, which makes this paper a valuable addition to the field.
The experimental results show a clear advantage of CVAPs over existing methods, particularly in terms of log loss. However, the results in Tables 1 and 2 are less convincing, and the authors should provide further justification for the observed differences. Additionally, the authors could have explored the performance of IVAPs and CVAPs on more diverse datasets to demonstrate their robustness.
The paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors have provided a thorough analysis of the proposed methods, and the experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The proposed methods are novel and address a significant problem in machine learning, making this paper a valuable contribution to the field.
