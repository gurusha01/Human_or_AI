This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors suggest training a feed-forward architecture, referred to as a "gating network," to predict the latent variables in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of natural images. This approach allows for a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining the modularity and performance of generative models.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow for non-experts in the field. The results presented in the paper are impressive, demonstrating a speedup of two orders of magnitude in runtime while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with other methods, including BM3D, EPLL, and discriminative approaches.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance the trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The authors demonstrate that by using a learned gating network, they can achieve a significant reduction in computational cost without sacrificing performance. The paper also highlights the modularity advantage of generative models, which can be used to perform a variety of image restoration tasks without requiring separate training for each task.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the training process of the gating network, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the learned gating network, including its interpretability and robustness to different types of noise and image degradations.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of generative and discriminative approaches to image restoration. While the use of GMMs and feed-forward architectures is not new, the authors' approach to training a gating network to predict latent variables is a unique contribution to the field.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image restoration and machine learning. The authors' approach has the potential to be widely applicable to a variety of image restoration tasks, and the paper provides a thorough and well-written presentation of the methodology and results. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, with some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above.
