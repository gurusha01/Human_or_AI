This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty, with a focus on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors introduce a modified proximal gradient algorithm for variational Bayes, which is equivalent to natural gradient descent with a certain choice of step sizes, providing a clean way to deal with nonconjugacy. However, the algorithm has some flaws, including not being a true proximal gradient algorithm due to the incorrect direction of the KL term, and convergence cannot be guaranteed except in special cases.
The submission lacks sufficient analysis to demonstrate the algorithm's utility, with performance gains being too small to justify the increased runtime required. The paper is mostly clear, but Sections 5-6 are difficult to follow and require revision to improve understanding. The work appears original, but its significance is currently low due to insufficient experimental results to justify its practical significance.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to robustness analysis and its potential applications in robotics and other fields. The authors provide a clear and well-organized introduction to the problem and their approach, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow for the most part. However, the paper's weaknesses, including the flaws in the algorithm and the lack of sufficient analysis and experimental results, outweigh its strengths.
Arguments for acceptance include the paper's originality and potential significance, as well as its clear and well-organized presentation. However, arguments against acceptance include the flaws in the algorithm, the lack of sufficient analysis and experimental results, and the difficulty in following certain sections of the paper.
To improve the paper, the authors should address the flaws in the algorithm and provide more sufficient analysis and experimental results to demonstrate its utility and practical significance. Additionally, the authors should revise Sections 5-6 to improve their clarity and readability. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of robustness analysis and decision making under uncertainty.
Overall, I would recommend that the authors revise and resubmit the paper, addressing the flaws and weaknesses mentioned above, in order to strengthen their contribution and increase its potential impact.
