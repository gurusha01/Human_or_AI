This paper proposes a new algorithm, PEGI (pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for independent component analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. The algorithm uses a fixed-point iteration to maximize directional kurtosis in a pseudo-Euclidean space, which allows for the recovery of the mixing matrix A up to inherent ambiguities. The authors also provide an analysis of how to choose the pseudo-Euclidean space optimally for the noisy ICA case.
The paper is clearly written, and the proposed method is significant as it performs ICA in a noise-corrupted setting, which is an important problem. The extension to the complex case is straightforward, and the method has the potential to be useful in practice. The use of gradient-based fixed-point iterations for kurtosis maximization in a pseudo-Euclidean space is a novel contribution, and the analysis of how to choose this space optimally for the noisy ICA case is also a valuable contribution.
However, the paper lacks some key references to related work, and its originality is similar to existing methods like fastICA and GI-ICA, but with some important differences. The experimental section is weak, only considering synthetic data and lacking comparison with other robust ICA methods, such as RobustICA and relative Newton method. The estimation of 4-th order cumulants/kurtosis requires a large amount of data, and the practical usefulness of the method for real-world data remains to be demonstrated.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel algorithm for ICA in the presence of Gaussian noise, which is a significant problem.
* The method has the potential to be useful in practice, and the extension to the complex case is straightforward.
* The use of gradient-based fixed-point iterations for kurtosis maximization in a pseudo-Euclidean space is a novel contribution.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper lacks some key references to related work, which may indicate a lack of thoroughness in the literature review.
* The experimental section is weak, and the method is not compared to other robust ICA methods.
* The estimation of 4-th order cumulants/kurtosis requires a large amount of data, which may limit the practical usefulness of the method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is significant. However, the experimental section needs to be strengthened, and the comparison with other robust ICA methods needs to be added. With some revisions to address these issues, the paper has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field of ICA.
