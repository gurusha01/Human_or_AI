This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of self-supervised learning (SSL), bridging several areas of research. The authors introduce the background and contributions, leveraging the Zhang and Ando result to demonstrate that SSL can be reduced to an equivalent kernel-based supervised learning problem. They provide an error bound showing that minimizing the spectral norm of the graph kernel matrix improves generalization, as discussed in sections 2 and the appendix.
The paper's strengths lie in its ability to link large-scale topological properties of the data graph to the convergence of the embedding estimation, a notable contribution that advances the state of the art. The authors propose a spectral norm regularization term, added to the Zhang and Ando formulation, which provides connections between error convergence and the Lovasz number of the data graph in section 3. Additionally, a proximal solver is introduced in section 4 to handle the constraint of a cone-polytope intersection, along with an approximate projection step. The paper also proposes an MKL extension in section 5 and concludes with experimental results on several datasets in section 6.
However, there are areas for improvement. The notation and equations could be clarified, such as the correspondence between equations 3 and 1, and the notation of equation 5. The algorithm's efficiency and feasibility are also questioned, particularly in ensuring that K_r is PSD, and suggestions are made for optimizing on a factorization of K instead. Furthermore, the paper contains some errors, including an incorrect reference year for Zhang and Ando's work.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper could be improved, with some suggestions for reorganization and additional information to aid the reader. The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, and the significance of the results is evident in its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. Overall, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field, and with some revisions to address the areas for improvement, it could be a strong contribution to the conference.
