This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of nonparametric graphical models without assuming a specific parametric form. The authors utilize a penalized score matching objective, which allows for efficient estimation of the graph structure using existing group lasso solvers. The key advantage of this approach is that it does not require computation of the normalization constant, making it applicable to a broad family of infinite-dimensional exponential families.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed methodology. The theoretical guarantees provided in Section 4 are impressive, demonstrating that the proposed estimator can recover the true graph structure with high probability under mild conditions.
The experimental results presented in Section 5 are also convincing, showing that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, such as graphical lasso, in certain scenarios. The use of a nonparanormal distribution in the second simulation demonstrates the flexibility and robustness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some minor suggestions for improvement. Firstly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, particularly in comparison to existing methods. Secondly, the authors may want to consider providing more insight into the choice of kernel and hyperparameters used in the experiments.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution.
