This paper addresses the significant problem of converting arbitrary class membership scores into well-calibrated probabilities, providing a useful technique that works well. The authors propose two new algorithms, Inductive Venn-Abers Predictors (IVAPs) and Cross-Venn-Abers Predictors (CVAPs), which extend isotonic regression by utilizing cross-validation to generate multiple scoring sets and combining the scores generated on each. The paper covers both theoretical and algorithmic issues related to the problem, presenting a comprehensive approach.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers. The technique is theoretically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The originality of the paper lies in the combination of familiar techniques, such as isotonic regression and cross-validation, to create a novel approach to probabilistic prediction. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper provides a clear explanation of how it differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
The strengths of the paper include its comprehensive approach, theoretical soundness, and good empirical performance. The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of empirical studies on upper and lower probabilities produced by IVAPs and CVAPs, which could provide additional information about the reliability of the merged probability prediction.
