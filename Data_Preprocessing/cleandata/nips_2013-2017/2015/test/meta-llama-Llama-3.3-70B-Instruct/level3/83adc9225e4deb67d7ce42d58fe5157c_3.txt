This paper presents a novel nonparametric procedure for estimating the structure of sparse undirected probabilistic graphical models from data using kernels and group lasso solvers. The approach is based on minimizing a penalized score matching objective, which avoids the need to compute the normalizing constant, making it applicable to a broad family of infinite-dimensional exponential families. The paper is well-written, clearly explained, and utilizes challenging math to arrive at an elegant solution, making it a significant addition to the field of structure learning.
The main weakness of the paper is the evaluation section, which should have included more complex graph structures with weaker edges to demonstrate real-world performance. However, the simulation studies provided do illustrate the ability of the procedure to recover the true graph structure without knowledge of the data-generating process.
The paper's quality is good, with a well-executed idea and sensible steps in reducing the optimization problem. The originality of the paper lies in its crucial contribution, Theorem 3.2, which is new, elegant, and potentially very useful, building on existing results in a novel way. The paper has significant implications, expecting to lead to new ideas and applications in structure inference, and is a highly relevant and well-written contribution to the conference.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to handle nonparametric densities, its efficiency in minimizing the proposed objective using existing group lasso solvers, and its consistency in recovering the true graph structure with high probability under mild conditions. The weaknesses include the limited evaluation section and the potential for improvement in the algorithm's efficiency.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of structure learning, with a well-written and clearly explained approach that has the potential to lead to new ideas and applications.
