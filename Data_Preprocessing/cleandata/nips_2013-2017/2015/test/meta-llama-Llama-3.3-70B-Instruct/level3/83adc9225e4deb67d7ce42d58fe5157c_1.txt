This paper proposes a new nonparametric model for estimating the structure of probabilistic graphical models using infinite dimensional exponential family and score matching. The method avoids expensive computation of log partition and can be solved using group lasso algorithms. However, the approach has some limitations, such as only working with l1 norm and its extension to other regularizers being unclear.
The paper provides theoretical consistent analysis of the estimated sparse structure using primal-witness approach, but lacks comparison with existing approaches. The writing is not clear, and the paper fails to discuss the relationship between its work and existing research, particularly [28]. The non-asymptotic rates of convergence seem worse than existing results, making it unclear when or why the method should be used with finite samples.
Despite these limitations, the problem addressed in the paper is interesting and challenging, and the connection with group lasso provides a good solver for the model. The paper demonstrates the ability of the procedure to recover the true graph structure without knowledge of the data generating process through simulation studies.
The strengths of the paper include:
* Proposing a new nonparametric model for estimating the structure of probabilistic graphical models
* Avoiding expensive computation of log partition using score matching
* Providing theoretical consistent analysis of the estimated sparse structure
* Demonstrating the ability of the procedure to recover the true graph structure through simulation studies
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Limited to l1 norm and unclear extension to other regularizers
* Lack of comparison with existing approaches
* Poor writing and failure to discuss relationship with existing research
