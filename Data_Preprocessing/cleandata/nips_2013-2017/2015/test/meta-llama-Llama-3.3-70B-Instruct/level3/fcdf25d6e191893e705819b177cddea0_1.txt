This paper proposes a novel approach to probabilistic prediction, introducing two new algorithms: Inductive Venn-Abers Predictors (IVAPs) and Cross-Venn-Abers Predictors (CVAPs). The authors aim to create probabilistic predictors that enjoy perfect calibration and are computationally efficient. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in various settings.
The strengths of the paper include its well-supported theoretical analysis, which provides a solid foundation for the proposed methods. The empirical results are also impressive, showing that CVAPs consistently outperform existing calibration methods, such as Platt's method and isotonic regression. The authors' use of various underlying algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks, adds to the paper's strength, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from more high-level explanations and summaries, particularly in Section 3, to help readers understand the technical details. Additionally, there are several technical issues and unclear points, such as the definition of IDT and the conversion of IDT to a CPDAG, that need to be addressed. The title and method name could be more specific, and the paper could be improved with more visual examples and clearer explanations.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is well-organized, but some parts could be improved for better clarity and flow.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to probabilistic prediction, combining the ideas of Venn predictors and cross-validation. The paper provides a unique contribution to the field, and the results are significant, demonstrating the potential of the proposed methods in various applications.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it provides a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning and probabilistic prediction. The strengths of the paper, including its thorough theoretical analysis and impressive empirical results, outweigh its weaknesses, and the authors have demonstrated the potential of their proposed methods.
