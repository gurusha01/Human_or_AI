This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors introduce a gating network, a feed-forward architecture that predicts the latent variables in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is a key component of the generative model. The gating network is trained discriminatively to minimize the cross-entropy between the approximate posterior probability and the exact posterior probability. The results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant speedup of two orders of magnitude in runtime, while maintaining the modularity advantage of generative models.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and technical details of the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough review of existing methods, including generative and discriminative approaches, and highlight the advantages and limitations of each. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in image denoising, deblurring, and restoration.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance the trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The authors show that by using a learned gating network, they can achieve comparable performance to the full inference method, but with a significant reduction in computational cost. The paper also highlights the modularity advantage of generative models, demonstrating that the proposed method can be used for various image restoration tasks without requiring separate training for each task.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the paper could benefit from additional illustrations, such as a figure to explain Equation 3, to help readers understand the technical details. Additionally, the comparison to existing methods, specifically [23], could be improved by clarifying the computational gains and scalability. The paper could also provide more detailed analysis of the classification experiment results, including a simple supervised baseline for comparison.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image restoration and machine learning. The proposed approach has the potential to be widely adopted, given its ability to balance accuracy and runtime, and its modularity advantage. The paper is well-written, and the results are impressive, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
