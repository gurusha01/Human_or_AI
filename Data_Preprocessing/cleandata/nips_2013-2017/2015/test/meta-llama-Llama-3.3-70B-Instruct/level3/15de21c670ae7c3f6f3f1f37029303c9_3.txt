This paper presents a novel approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes, aiming to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both training and testing. The authors propose a top-down tree construction approach, where each node in the tree consists of a binary classifier, and the tree is trained in an online fashion. The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new objective function, which encourages pure and balanced splits at each node, leading to a logarithmic depth tree.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a boosting statement that guarantees the effectiveness of their approach. The empirical evaluation is also comprehensive, with experiments on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and ODP.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a new objective function that encourages pure and balanced splits, leading to a logarithmic depth tree.
* The provision of a boosting statement that guarantees the effectiveness of the approach.
* The comprehensive empirical evaluation on several benchmark datasets.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The condition required by the theorems is difficult to ensure in practice, and the authors do not provide a clear way to enforce this condition artificially.
* The approach may not be suitable for all types of data, and the authors do not provide a clear way to determine when the approach is applicable.
* The comparison with other approaches is limited, and the authors do not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, this paper presents a novel and promising approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes. While there are some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh them, and the approach has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field.
