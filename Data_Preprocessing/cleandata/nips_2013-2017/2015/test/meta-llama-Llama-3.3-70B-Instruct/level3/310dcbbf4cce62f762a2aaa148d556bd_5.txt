This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of stochastic decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on providing probably-approximate bounds on the robustness of computed decision variables. The authors employ a statistical learning viewpoint, utilizing concentration-of-measure inequalities to derive bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation. The approach is demonstrated through a simple robot navigation scenario and initial steps towards applications to challenging aerial vehicle navigation problems.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read and understand. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, highlighting the importance of robustness guarantees in stochastic decision-making problems. The technical content is sound, with a thorough analysis of the problem and a well-structured presentation of the results.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to provide high-confidence bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation, which is essential for ensuring the reliability of control algorithms in the presence of uncertainties. The authors also demonstrate the applicability of their approach to various scenarios, including discrete-time stochastic control and aerial vehicle navigation.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. For instance, the paper could benefit from additional numerical experiments to support the claims made, particularly in the context of aerial vehicle navigation. Furthermore, the authors could provide more clarity on the rationale behind their approach and how it differs from existing methods in the field.
In terms of future work, the authors suggest using a parametric model for the reward, particularly when dealing with a large number of contexts, to improve the algorithm's effectiveness. This is a promising direction, as it could enable the development of more efficient and scalable algorithms for stochastic decision-making problems.
Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications, from robotics to finance. The authors' approach is novel, well-motivated, and thoroughly analyzed, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
