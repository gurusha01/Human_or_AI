This paper proposes a novel approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes, aiming to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both training and testing. The authors introduce a new objective function for decision tree learning, which optimizes the partitioning of data at each node to achieve pure and balanced splits. Theoretical analysis shows that this approach can lead to effective reduction of the average Shannon entropy over the entire tree. The authors also propose an online algorithm, LOMtree, for empirical evaluation, which constructs a logarithmic depth tree by recursively splitting nodes based on the proposed objective function.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed approach addresses a significant problem in multiclass classification, where the number of classes is extremely large. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. The LOMtree algorithm is also shown to outperform other logarithmic time methods and significantly closes the gap with the one-against-all approach, which is often intractable for large-scale problems.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The manuscript lacks awareness of existing literature on stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian dynamics, which could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the problem. The authors' algorithm is related to the Monte Carlo EM algorithm, and existing theories cover more general scenarios without requiring uniform ergodicity or reinitializing Markov chains. The presentation of results is suboptimal, with unclear assumptions for Theorem 1 and 2, requiring readers to refer to surrounding text for clarity. Additionally, the strong assumptions used to develop results, such as Theorem 6, are unnecessary, and more general results can be found in existing literature.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new objective function and an online algorithm for multiclass classification, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the authors could have provided a more detailed comparison with existing methods and a more thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of their approach.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to address a challenging problem in multiclass classification and provide a novel solution that achieves logarithmic time complexity. The results are important, and the approach has the potential to be used in various applications, such as natural language processing, search, and detection tasks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should provide a more comprehensive review of existing literature, clarify the assumptions and presentation of results, and provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods.
