This paper proposes a novel optimization formulation for learning labels on graph vertices by jointly optimizing embedding and labels with a regularization term. The regularization term is based on the spectral norm of the graph kernel matrix, derived from an upper bound on generalization error stated in Theorem 1. The proposed method has an asymptotic upper bound on generalization error with favorable scaling compared to previous results, translatable to an upper bound on labeled sample complexity. The optimization problem can be cast as a semi-definite program (SDP), but the authors suggest using an inexact proximal method for scalability to large graphs with thousands of vertices.
The paper builds upon previous work in graph learning and optimization, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work in the field. The proposed method is novel and has the potential to advance the state of the art in graph learning. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method over previous methods, demonstrating its significance and importance.
However, I had difficulty understanding the main result, Theorem 4, due to unclear assumptions and terminology. The paper could benefit from clearer explanations and definitions of the technical terms used. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with previous work and discuss the limitations of their method.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, novelty, and significance. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental results to support their claims. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of clarity in some sections, particularly in the presentation of Theorem 4. The authors could improve the paper by providing clearer explanations, definitions, and comparisons with previous work.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant method for graph learning
* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental results
* The paper has the potential to advance the state of the art in graph learning
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper lacks clarity in some sections, particularly in the presentation of Theorem 4
* The authors could provide more detailed comparisons with previous work and discuss the limitations of their method
Overall, I believe that the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of graph learning, but it requires some revisions to improve clarity and address the limitations of the method.
