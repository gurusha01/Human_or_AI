This paper proposes a new algorithm, PEGI (Pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with Gaussian noise. The main claim of the paper is that PEGI can recover the mixing matrix A in the noisy ICA setting with arbitrary Gaussian noise, and that it can be combined with an SINR-optimal demixing approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
The support for this claim comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that PEGI can recover the columns of A up to scale and permutation, and that the SINR-optimal demixing matrix can be constructed from the recovered matrix A and the covariance of the observed data. The experimental results demonstrate that PEGI outperforms existing ICA algorithms, including those specifically designed for beamforming, in terms of SINR demixing performance.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the contributions of their paper. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with existing algorithms.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle arbitrary Gaussian noise, which is a significant improvement over existing algorithms that assume white or spherical noise. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the indeterminacies of ICA and show how their algorithm can handle these indeterminacies.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the number of sources is known, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the algorithm requires a significant amount of data to achieve good performance, which may not be feasible in some applications.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of ICA, and their algorithm has the potential to be widely used in practice. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, and the experimental results are convincing.
