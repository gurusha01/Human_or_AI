This paper presents a novel approach to maximum likelihood learning in exponential families, particularly in the context of undirected graphical models. The main claim of the paper is that by restricting the parameters to a "fast-mixing" set, where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the stationary distribution, a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) can be established for the maximum likelihood solution.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence of gradient descent with MCMC-based gradient estimates, both in the convex and strongly convex cases. The authors prove that with a sufficient number of iterations, samples, and Markov chain transitions, the algorithm can approximate the maximum likelihood solution with high probability. The paper also provides explicit schedules for the number of iterations, samples, and Markov chain transitions required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include its rigorous theoretical analysis, which provides a clear understanding of the convergence properties of the algorithm. The paper also highlights the importance of fast-mixing parameters in achieving efficient maximum likelihood learning. The example provided in the paper demonstrates the practical applicability of the approach.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The analysis assumes that the parameter set is constrained to a fast-mixing set, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods, such as contrastive divergence, which is a commonly used approach for maximum likelihood learning in graphical models.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the theoretical results and their implications. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential directions for future work.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and rigorous approach to maximum likelihood learning in exponential families.
* The analysis provides a clear understanding of the convergence properties of the algorithm.
* The paper highlights the importance of fast-mixing parameters in achieving efficient maximum likelihood learning.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis assumes that the parameter set is constrained to a fast-mixing set, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods.
* The approach may not be applicable to all types of graphical models.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of maximum likelihood learning in exponential families. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the limitations of the approach and provide a clearer comparison with existing methods in future work.
