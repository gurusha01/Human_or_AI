This paper proposes a new variational inference method based on a proximal framework that uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the proximal term. The authors make two main contributions: (1) they propose a KL proximal-point algorithm and show its equivalence to variational inference with natural gradients, and (2) they use the proximal framework to derive efficient variational algorithms for non-conjugate models.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the main ideas and contributions. The authors provide a thorough review of the related work and establish the connection between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing comparable performance to existing methods and significant speedups in some cases.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proximal framework and its application to variational inference.
* The paper establishes a connection between the proposed method and existing methods, such as natural gradient descent and expectation propagation.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential for significant speedups.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with variational inference and proximal methods, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the derivations and proofs are relegated to the supplementary material, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the technical details.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of variational inference. The proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable and could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of variational inference algorithms.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for variational inference.
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the main ideas and contributions.
