This paper proposes a new local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), which identifies the direct causes and effects of a target variable in a causal network. The main claim of the paper is that CMB can achieve comparable accuracy to global causal discovery methods while being more efficient, often by more than one order of magnitude.
The support for this claim comes from both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's soundness and completeness, showing that it can identify the same causal structure as global methods under standard assumptions. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMB outperforms global discovery algorithms and has comparable edge accuracy with local-to-global algorithms, while achieving significant speedups.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical foundations. The use of Lemmas 1-3 to establish the identifiability condition is particularly noteworthy, as it provides a rigorous framework for understanding the algorithm's limitations and potential applications.
One potential limitation of the paper is that it assumes causal sufficiency, which may not always hold in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest possible future work on relaxing this assumption. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the algorithm's computational complexity and its potential scalability to large datasets.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of causal discovery, and the proposed CMB algorithm has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners. The strengths of the paper include its rigorous theoretical analysis, clear exposition, and impressive experimental results. The weaknesses are relatively minor and primarily relate to the limitations of the algorithm and potential areas for future improvement.
