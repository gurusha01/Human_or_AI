This paper proposes two novel deep neural network architectures for spatio-temporal prediction problems, specifically for predicting future frames in Atari games conditioned on control variables or actions. The authors evaluate their architectures on several Atari game domains and demonstrate that they can generate visually-realistic and useful-for-control frames over 100-step futures.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed architectures can predict future frames in Atari games conditioned on actions, and (2) the predicted frames are useful for control. The authors support these claims with experimental results, including qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the predicted frames, as well as evaluations of the usefulness of the predicted frames for control using a model-free controller (DQN).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed description of their architectures and experimental results. The use of curriculum learning with multi-step prediction objectives is a nice touch, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the learned representations, including the discovery of contingent regions and the disentanglement of factors of variation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of two novel deep neural network architectures for spatio-temporal prediction problems
* The evaluation of the architectures on several Atari game domains
* The demonstration of the usefulness of the predicted frames for control using a model-free controller (DQN)
* The thorough analysis of the learned representations
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The limited evaluation of the architectures on other domains beyond Atari games
* The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for spatio-temporal prediction
* The limited analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed architectures
Overall, I believe that this paper is a good scientific contribution to the field of computer vision and reinforcement learning. The proposed architectures are novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness in predicting future frames in Atari games conditioned on actions. The analysis of the learned representations is also thorough and provides interesting insights into the workings of the proposed architectures.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes novel and well-motivated architectures for spatio-temporal prediction problems
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architectures in predicting future frames in Atari games conditioned on actions
* The analysis of the learned representations is thorough and provides interesting insights into the workings of the proposed architectures
Arguments con acceptance:
* The evaluation of the architectures is limited to Atari game domains
* The comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for spatio-temporal prediction is limited
* The analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed architectures is limited
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should consider adding more evaluations on other domains beyond Atari games and comparing their architectures to other state-of-the-art methods for spatio-temporal prediction. Additionally, the authors should provide more analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed architectures.
