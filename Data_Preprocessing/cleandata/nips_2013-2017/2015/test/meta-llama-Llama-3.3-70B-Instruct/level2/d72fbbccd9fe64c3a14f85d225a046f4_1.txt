This paper proposes a new deep architecture for topic modeling based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. The main claims of the paper are: (i) a deep architecture for topic models based entirely on PFA modules, (ii) a model that combines the interpretability of DP-based specifications with deep hierarchies of hidden binary units, and (iii) a discriminative extension for the deep architecture. 
The support for these claims is provided through a detailed description of the model, including its components, such as the Poisson distribution, the Bernoulli-Poisson link, and the hierarchical structure. The paper also presents two inference methods: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and stochastic variational inference (SVI). The experimental results on several corpora, including 20 Newsgroups, Reuters, and Wikipedia, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over other state-of-the-art models, such as LDA, FTM, RSM, and DPFA. 
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The model is elegant, and the use of a single class of modules at each layer is a significant advantage. The computational benefits of scaling as a function of the number of non-zeros in the data and binary units are also noteworthy. 
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, particularly in the context of topic modeling and text analysis. The model has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks, including document classification, information retrieval, and natural language processing. 
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, including the relevant literature and the current state-of-the-art models. The references are comprehensive, and the authors have made a significant effort to compare their model with other existing models. 
The novelty of the paper lies in the combination of PFA modules with deep hierarchies of hidden binary units, which provides a new perspective on topic modeling. The use of the Bernoulli-Poisson link is also a significant contribution, as it allows for the repeated application of PFA modules at all layers of the deep architecture. 
The completeness of the paper is evident, with a detailed description of the model, the inference methods, and the experimental results. The authors have also provided a clear discussion of the limitations of the model and the potential future directions. 
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged, including the need for further research on scaling up inference algorithms and extending the use of PFA modules to more sophisticated discriminative models. 
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The model is elegant, and the experimental results demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art models. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of topic modeling and text analysis.
