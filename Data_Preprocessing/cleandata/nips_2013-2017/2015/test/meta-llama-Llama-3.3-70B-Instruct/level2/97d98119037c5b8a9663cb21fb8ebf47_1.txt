This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty, with a focus on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors derive a concentration-of-measure inequality to compute probabilistic bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation, which can be used to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety.
The main claim of the paper is that the proposed approach can provide probably-approximate bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation, which can be used to analyze the performance of existing iterative policy search algorithms and design new algorithms with built-in robustness. The authors support this claim through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including a simple robot control scenario and a more complex aerial vehicle navigation problem.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical development and practical applications. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the contributions of their approach. The numerical experiments are well-designed and provide useful insights into the behavior of the proposed bounds.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The derivation of a novel concentration-of-measure inequality that can handle possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratios, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The application of the proposed approach to a range of problems, including stochastic control and aerial vehicle navigation, which demonstrates the versatility and potential impact of the method.
* The use of a robust estimation technique to handle unbounded losses, which is a useful contribution to the field of robust statistics.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the theoretical analysis, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
* The limited number of numerical experiments, which may not be sufficient to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The lack of comparison with other methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach relative to existing methods.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robustness analysis and decision making under uncertainty, and I recommend it for publication. However, I suggest that the authors consider adding more numerical experiments and comparisons with other methods to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
