This paper proposes a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative models. The authors argue that generative models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), offer modularity and flexibility, but are often computationally expensive, while discriminative models provide efficiency but lack modularity. To address this trade-off, the authors propose a discriminatively trained gating network that predicts the latent variables in a GMM, reducing the computational cost of inference while maintaining the modularity of the generative approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work in image restoration. The proposed method is thoroughly explained, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The authors show that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image denoising and deblurring, while reducing the computational cost by two orders of magnitude.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach that combines the strengths of generative and discriminative models
* A thorough evaluation of the method on various image restoration tasks
* A clear and concise explanation of the background and related work
* The provision of code and results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method is limited to image restoration tasks and may not be applicable to other domains
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method
* The experimental results are mostly limited to small images, and it is unclear how the method would perform on larger images
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and effective. The authors demonstrate the potential of combining generative and discriminative models for image restoration, and the results show significant improvements in computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
