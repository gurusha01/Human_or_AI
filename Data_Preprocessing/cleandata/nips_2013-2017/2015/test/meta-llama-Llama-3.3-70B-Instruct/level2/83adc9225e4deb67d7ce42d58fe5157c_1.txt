This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of nonparametric graphical models without assuming a specific parametric form. The authors utilize a penalized score matching objective, which avoids the need to compute the normalization constant, making it applicable to a broad family of infinite-dimensional exponential families. The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, background, and related work.
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. A new procedure for learning the structure of nonparametric graphical models using a penalized score matching objective.
2. A representer theorem that reduces the optimization problem to a group lasso problem, allowing for efficient computation.
3. Statistical guarantees that the proposed estimator recovers the true underlying graphical structure with high probability under mild conditions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology, including the assumptions and theoretical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in comparison to existing methods like glasso.
Strengths:

Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of graphical models, and the authors have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical guarantees and experimental results. However, the authors should consider addressing the potential limitations of their approach, such as the assumption on the true probability density function and the computational complexity, in future work.
