This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of latent variable models and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The authors address the challenges of applying EM in high-dimensional settings, where the number of samples may be less than the dimensionality of the parameter space. They propose a regularized EM algorithm that incorporates a carefully chosen sequence of regularization parameters to balance optimization and statistical errors.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed regularized EM algorithm achieves linear convergence and provides statistical guarantees for high-dimensional estimation problems, and (2) the algorithm can be applied to various latent variable models, including sparse Gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with missing variables.
The support for these claims is provided through a rigorous theoretical analysis, which includes the development of a general framework for regularized EM and the derivation of conditions for convergence and statistical guarantees. The authors also provide simulations to validate their theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm in practice.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The use of mathematical notation is consistent, and the references to previous work are accurate and relevant.
