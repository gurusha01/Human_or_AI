This paper presents a novel approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes, aiming to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both training and testing. The authors propose a top-down tree construction approach, where each node in the tree consists of a binary classifier that partitions the data into two subsets. The key contribution is the introduction of a new objective function, which is optimized at each node to create dynamic partitions that are both pure and balanced.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, as well as a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed method. The experimental evaluation is also comprehensive, with results on several benchmark datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed LOMtree algorithm.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The proposal of a new objective function that balances purity and balancedness of the partitions, which is a key innovation in the paper.
* The provision of a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including a boosting statement that guarantees the reduction of the average entropy over the entire tree.
* The empirical evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the LOMtree algorithm in reducing training and testing time while maintaining competitive accuracy.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the number of classes is extremely large, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to see how the proposed method performs on datasets with a smaller number of classes.
* The LOMtree algorithm is compared to a limited set of baselines, including a balanced random tree and the Filter tree. It would be useful to compare the proposed method to other state-of-the-art approaches, such as sparse output coding or iterative least-squares-style algorithms.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, including a discussion of the trade-offs between training time, testing time, and accuracy.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multiclass classification, and the proposed LOMtree algorithm has the potential to be a useful tool for practitioners working with large-scale datasets.
