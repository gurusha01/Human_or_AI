This paper presents a novel approach to trace regression when the underlying matrix is symmetric positive semidefinite (spd). The authors argue that, under certain conditions on the design, constrained least squares estimation can perform similarly to nuclear norm regularization-based approaches, even without the need for regularization. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the constrained least squares estimator, including bounds on the prediction error and estimation error.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) constrained least squares estimation can achieve similar performance to nuclear norm regularization-based approaches under certain conditions on the design, and (2) the spd constraint can be beneficial in reducing the estimation error. The authors support these claims through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-organized, and the numerical experiments are thorough and well-designed. The paper also provides a good review of related work and clearly discusses the contributions and limitations of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the novelty of the approach, which challenges the conventional wisdom that regularization is necessary in small sample settings, (2) the thoroughness of the theoretical analysis, which provides a clear understanding of the statistical properties of the constrained least squares estimator, and (3) the effectiveness of the numerical experiments, which demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the conditions on the design required for the constrained least squares estimator to perform well are not always easy to verify, and (2) the paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the results for practice and the potential limitations of the approach.
Overall, I would rate the paper as strong, and I believe it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their approach and results. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the numerical experiments are thorough and well-designed.
