This paper studies contextual bandits with budget and time constraints, referred to as constrained contextual bandits. The authors propose an Adaptive Linear Programming (ALP) algorithm that achieves near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards. They then combine ALP with the upper-confidence-bound (UCB) method to develop a UCB-ALP algorithm for the general case where the expected rewards are unknown. The UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except for certain boundary cases.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem and the proposed solution. The authors relate their work to previous research in the field, including [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. The technical content is sound, and the authors provide a rigorous analysis of the regret of the proposed algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel ALP algorithm that achieves near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards.
* The development of a UCB-ALP algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret except for certain boundary cases.
* A rigorous analysis of the regret of the proposed algorithms.
* The provision of a clear overview of the problem and the proposed solution.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of finite discrete contexts, fixed costs, and a single budget constraint, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The lack of experimental results to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
* The complexity of the analysis, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of contextual bandits. The proposal of the ALP and UCB-ALP algorithms is novel and interesting, and the rigorous analysis of the regret provides a strong foundation for the results.
