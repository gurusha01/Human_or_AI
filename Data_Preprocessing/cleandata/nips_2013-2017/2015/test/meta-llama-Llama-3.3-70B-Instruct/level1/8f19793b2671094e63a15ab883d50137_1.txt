This paper presents a novel approach to trace regression when the underlying matrix is symmetric positive semidefinite (spd). The authors argue that, under certain conditions on the design, constrained least squares estimation can perform similarly to regularization-based approaches, such as nuclear norm regularization, without the need for tuning parameters. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the constrained least squares estimator, including bounds on the prediction error and estimation error.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The analysis is rigorous and well-structured, with a clear separation between the negative results (showing the limitations of the approach) and the positive results (showing the potential benefits of the approach). The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the related work and the implications of their results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and the approach
* A rigorous and well-structured analysis of the statistical properties of the constrained least squares estimator
* A detailed discussion of the related work and the implications of the results
* A thorough evaluation of the approach through numerical experiments and real-data examples
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The conditions on the design required for the approach to work are not always easy to verify in practice
* The approach may not be applicable to all types of data, and the authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of the approach
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are relegated to the supplement, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the paper
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to trace regression, and the analysis is rigorous and well-structured. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach, and the numerical experiments and real-data examples demonstrate the potential benefits of the approach.
