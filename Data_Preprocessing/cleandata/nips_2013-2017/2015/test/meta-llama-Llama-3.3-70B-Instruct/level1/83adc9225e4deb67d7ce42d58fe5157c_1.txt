This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of a probabilistic graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. The authors consider probabilities that are members of an infinite-dimensional exponential family, parametrized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its kernel. To avoid the issue of evaluating the normalizing constant, the authors propose to use score matching as a divergence measure, which does not require computing the log partition function.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of their results. The paper includes a comprehensive review of related work, including Gaussian graphical models, exponential family graphical models, and non-parametric approaches.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to learning the structure of a non-parametric graphical model, which does not require assuming a particular parametric model.
* The use of score matching as a divergence measure, which avoids the issue of evaluating the normalizing constant.
* The provision of a comprehensive review of related work and a clear introduction to the problem and proposed approach.
* The inclusion of detailed proofs of the results and a thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the proposed estimator.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the true probability density function is in the infinite-dimensional exponential family, which may not be the case in practice.
* The proposed approach requires a large sample size to achieve good performance, which may not be feasible in some applications.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other non-parametric approaches to learning graphical models.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of a non-parametric graphical model, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The use of score matching as a divergence measure is a clever idea that avoids the issue of evaluating the normalizing constant.
* The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work and a clear introduction to the problem and proposed approach.
* The inclusion of detailed proofs of the results and a thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the proposed estimator demonstrates the rigor and care with which the authors have approached the problem.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the true probability density function is in the infinite-dimensional exponential family, which may not be the case in practice.
* The proposed approach requires a large sample size to achieve good performance, which may not be feasible in some applications.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other non-parametric approaches to learning graphical models.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field. However, I also believe that the paper has some limitations, and the authors could have provided a more comprehensive comparison with other non-parametric approaches to learning graphical models. Therefore, I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions.
