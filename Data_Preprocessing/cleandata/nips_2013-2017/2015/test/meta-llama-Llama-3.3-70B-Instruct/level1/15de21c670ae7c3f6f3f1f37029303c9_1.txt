This paper explores an alternative notion of tractability in exponential family models, specifically the concept of "fast-mixing parameters" where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the stationary distribution. The authors prove that for any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics, when parameters are constrained to a fast-mixing set, gradient descent with gradients approximated by sampling will approximate the maximum likelihood solution inside the set with high-probability.
The paper relates to previous work on tractable models, such as tree-structured distributions, and highlights the limitations of existing methods, including pseudolikelihood, score matching, and composite likelihoods. The authors also discuss the challenges of maximum likelihood learning in high-treewidth undirected graphical models and the need for alternative approaches.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new notion of tractability, which provides a theoretical guarantee for MCMC convergence
* The provision of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme for maximum likelihood learning
* The analysis of the convergence of gradient descent with errors in estimated gradients, which is a common strategy in practice
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the parameter set is constrained to a fast-mixing set, which may not always be the case in practice
* The lack of discussion on the computational complexity of projection onto the fast-mixing set
* The limitation of the analysis to exponential family models with bounded sufficient statistics
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper provides a new and interesting perspective on tractability in exponential family models
* The theoretical guarantees provided are strong and well-supported by the analysis
* The paper has the potential to inspire new approaches to maximum likelihood learning in complex models
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumptions made in the paper may not be realistic in practice, limiting the applicability of the results
* The analysis is limited to a specific class of models, which may not be representative of the broader range of models used in practice
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its potential limitations in practice.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the analysis is thorough and well-supported. The introduction of a new notion of tractability and the provision of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme are significant contributions to the field. However, the limitations of the analysis and the assumptions made in the paper should be carefully considered when evaluating its potential impact and applicability.
