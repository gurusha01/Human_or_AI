This paper proposes a new deep architecture for topic modeling based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. The model combines the interpretability of Dirichlet Process (DP)-based specifications with deep hierarchies of hidden binary units, allowing for the learning of high-order statistics and structured correlations. The authors also describe a discriminative extension for the deep architecture and two inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI).
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed model, its components, and the inference methods. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the connections between their model and other DP-based topic models, as well as non-DP-based deep models. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model on several corpora and a medical records database.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new deep architecture for topic modeling that combines the strengths of DP-based and non-DP-based models.
* The development of efficient inference methods, including MCMC and SVI, that scale with the number of non-zeros in the data and binary units.
* The demonstration of the model's effectiveness on several corpora and a medical records database.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model's complexity, which may make it challenging to implement and tune for some users.
* The lack of comparison with other deep models, such as those using convolutional or recurrent neural networks.
* The limited exploration of the model's hyperparameters and their impact on performance.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated deep architecture for topic modeling.
* The experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness on several corpora and a medical records database.
* The paper provides a thorough review of related work and clearly explains the proposed model and its components.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model's complexity may make it challenging to implement and tune for some users.
* The lack of comparison with other deep models may limit the paper's impact and relevance.
* The limited exploration of the model's hyperparameters and their impact on performance may raise questions about the model's robustness and generalizability.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of topic modeling and deep learning, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing more comparisons with other deep models and exploring the model's hyperparameters, to further strengthen the paper.
