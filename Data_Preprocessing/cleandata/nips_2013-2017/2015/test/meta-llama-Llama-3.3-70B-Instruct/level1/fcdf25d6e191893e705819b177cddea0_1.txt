This paper proposes a new local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), which identifies the direct causes and effects of a target variable in a causal network. The algorithm is based on Markov Blanket discovery and is designed to be more efficient than global causal discovery methods. The authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm, including its three major steps: initial identification, resolving idT = 4, and resolving idT = 3. They also provide theoretical guarantees for the soundness and completeness of the algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on benchmark datasets.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its underlying assumptions. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work in causal discovery and discuss the advantages and limitations of their approach. The experimental results show that CMB achieves comparable accuracy to global causal discovery methods while being significantly more efficient.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new and efficient local causal discovery algorithm
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the soundness and completeness of the algorithm
* The demonstration of the algorithm's effectiveness through experiments on benchmark datasets
* The clear and well-organized writing style
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of causal sufficiency, which may not always hold in practice
* The potential for errors in independence tests and MB discovery algorithms to propagate to later steps of CMB
* The exponential complexity of the algorithm in the worst case, which could be improved with further optimization
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and efficient algorithm for local causal discovery
* The algorithm has been thoroughly tested and demonstrated to be effective on benchmark datasets
* The paper provides a clear and well-organized explanation of the algorithm and its underlying assumptions
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption of causal sufficiency may limit the applicability of the algorithm in practice
* The potential for errors in independence tests and MB discovery algorithms could affect the accuracy of the algorithm
* The exponential complexity of the algorithm in the worst case could be a limitation for very large datasets.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and efficient algorithm for local causal discovery and provides a thorough evaluation of its effectiveness. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the limitations of the algorithm, such as the assumption of causal sufficiency and the potential for errors in independence tests and MB discovery algorithms.
