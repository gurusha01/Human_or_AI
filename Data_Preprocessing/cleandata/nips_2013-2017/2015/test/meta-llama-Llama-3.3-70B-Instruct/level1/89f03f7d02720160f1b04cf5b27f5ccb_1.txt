This paper proposes a new algorithm, PEGI (pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to use a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite "inner product") space, which resolves technical issues common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA.
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the context of ICA and blind signal separation. The authors discuss the limitations of existing algorithms, such as the need for quasi-orthogonalization and the assumption of positive definite matrices. The proposed PEGI algorithm addresses these limitations and provides a simple, efficient, and accurate method for recovering the mixing matrix A in noisy ICA.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new algorithm that resolves technical issues in existing methods
* The provision of a complete and provably optimal recovery algorithm for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise
* The demonstration of improved performance over existing algorithms in experimental results
* The clarity and organization of the paper, making it easy to follow and understand
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of Gaussian noise, which may not always be the case in practice
* The need for further experimentation to fully evaluate the performance of the algorithm in different scenarios
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as deep learning-based approaches
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and innovative algorithm that addresses significant technical challenges in ICA
* The algorithm has been thoroughly evaluated and demonstrated to outperform existing methods
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption of Gaussian noise may limit the applicability of the algorithm in practice
* The paper could benefit from further experimentation and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of ICA and blind signal separation, and the proposed PEGI algorithm has the potential to be a valuable tool in a variety of applications. With some further experimentation and evaluation, the algorithm could be even more effective and widely applicable.
