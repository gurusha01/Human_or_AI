This paper proposes a novel approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes, aiming to achieve logarithmic time complexity for both training and testing. The authors develop a top-down tree construction approach, formulating a new objective function that creates dynamic partitions of the data, which are both pure and balanced. Theoretical analysis shows that under favorable conditions, the approach can construct logarithmic depth trees with low label entropy. However, the objective function is challenging to optimize computationally, leading to the development of a new online decision tree construction procedure, called LOMtree.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering various benchmark datasets. The results show that LOMtree significantly outperforms other logarithmic time methods and is competitive with the one-against-all approach, which is intractable for large-scale problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated approach to multiclass classification with a large number of classes
* A thorough theoretical analysis, including a boosting statement and a proof of the logarithmic time complexity
* A comprehensive experimental evaluation, covering various benchmark datasets and comparing with state-of-the-art methods
* A well-written and clear presentation of the ideas and results
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The objective function is challenging to optimize computationally, which may limit the applicability of the approach
* The LOMtree algorithm requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, which may be time-consuming and require significant expertise
* The approach may not be suitable for problems with a small number of classes, where other methods may be more effective
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multiclass classification, and the LOMtree algorithm has the potential to be a valuable tool for large-scale problems. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the approach and to explore its applicability to a wider range of problems.
