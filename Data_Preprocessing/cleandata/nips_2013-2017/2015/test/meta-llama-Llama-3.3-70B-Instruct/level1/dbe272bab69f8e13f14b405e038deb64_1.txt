This paper proposes a novel approach to parameter estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) using Riemannian manifold optimization, which is shown to outperform the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm in many settings. The authors introduce a reformulation of the GMM log-likelihood function that makes it geodesically convex, allowing for efficient optimization on the manifold of positive definite matrices.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and problem setup. The key idea of reformulating the likelihood function to make it geodesically convex is well-motivated and explained. The development of a Riemannian LBFGS solver is also a significant contribution, and the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation.
The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real data. The authors compare their method to EM, unconstrained Euclidean optimization, and other manifold optimization methods, showing that their approach is competitive and often outperforms the others.
The paper has several strengths:
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and problem setup.
* The key idea of reformulating the likelihood function to make it geodesically convex is well-motivated and explained.
* The development of a Riemannian LBFGS solver is a significant contribution.
* The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in manifold optimization and GMMs, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in differential geometry and optimization.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper. The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and problem setup.
