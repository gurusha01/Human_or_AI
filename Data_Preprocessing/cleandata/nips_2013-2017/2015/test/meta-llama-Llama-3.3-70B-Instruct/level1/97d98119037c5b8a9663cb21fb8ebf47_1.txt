This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty, with a focus on iterative stochastic policy optimization problems. The authors derive a concentration-of-measure inequality to compute probabilistic bounds on the expected cost and probability of constraint violation, which can be used to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety. The approach is illustrated with a simple robot control scenario and applied to a more complex aerial vehicle navigation problem.
The paper builds on previous work in stochastic optimization, reinforcement learning, and robust control, and makes significant contributions to the field. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their approach, including a detailed description of the problem formulation, the derivation of the bounds, and the application to the aerial vehicle navigation problem.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The derivation of a novel inequality bound that accounts for the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation.
* The application of the approach to a complex aerial vehicle navigation problem, which demonstrates the potential of the method for real-world applications.
* The provision of a clear and well-structured presentation of the approach, including a detailed description of the problem formulation and the derivation of the bounds.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the system dynamics are known or can be sampled from, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The use of a simple Gaussian density to model the control policy, which may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of the system.
* The lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the approach, including a comparison with other methods and a discussion of the limitations of the approach.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of stochastic optimization and robust control.
* The approach has the potential to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety, which is critical in many applications.
* The paper is well-written and provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the approach.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption that the system dynamics are known or can be sampled from may not always be valid in practice.
* The use of a simple Gaussian density to model the control policy may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of the system.
* The lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the approach may limit the impact of the paper.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to provide high-confidence guarantees for future performance and safety. However, the authors should address the limitations of the approach and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method.
