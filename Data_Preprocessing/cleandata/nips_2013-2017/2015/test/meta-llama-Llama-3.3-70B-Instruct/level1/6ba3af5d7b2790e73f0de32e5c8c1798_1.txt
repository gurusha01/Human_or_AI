This paper proposes two novel deep neural network architectures for spatio-temporal prediction problems, where future image-frames depend on control variables or actions as well as previous frames. The authors evaluate their architectures on Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and demonstrate that they can generate visually-realistic frames that are also useful for control over approximately 100-step action-conditional futures in some games.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed architectures, which consist of encoding, action-conditional transformation, and decoding layers based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their architectures, including a qualitative evaluation of the predicted frames, a quantitative evaluation of the squared prediction error, and an analysis of the learned representations.
The results show that the proposed architectures outperform two baselines, a multi-layer perceptron and a no-action feedforward model, in terms of squared prediction error and usefulness for control. The authors also demonstrate that their architectures can be used to improve exploration in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and that they can learn to distinguish between controlled and uncontrolled objects in the environment.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposal of two novel architectures for spatio-temporal prediction problems, which can be applied to a wide range of vision-based reinforcement learning problems.
* A thorough evaluation of the architectures, including qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the predicted frames and an analysis of the learned representations.
* The demonstration of the usefulness of the architectures for control and exploration in DQN.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The architectures are computationally expensive and require a large amount of training data.
* The evaluation is limited to Atari games, and it is unclear how well the architectures will generalize to other environments.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for spatio-temporal prediction problems.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a strong contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and computer vision, and it has the potential to be a high-impact publication. The proposed architectures are novel and well-evaluated, and the results demonstrate their usefulness for control and exploration in DQN.

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including providing a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and evaluating the architectures on a wider range of environments. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more details on the computational cost and training time of the architectures.
