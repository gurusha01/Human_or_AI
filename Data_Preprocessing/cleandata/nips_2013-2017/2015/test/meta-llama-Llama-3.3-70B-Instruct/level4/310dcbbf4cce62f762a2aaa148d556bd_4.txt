This review poses a single inquiry: what justification exists for treating boundary cases with distinct analysis, as the instance of rho = q_j does not appear to possess unique characteristics, particularly when j exceeds 1. The paper presents an examination of contextual bandits in comparison to a more robust baseline, which utilizes adaptive linear programming to selectively opt out of a specified percentage of suboptimal rounds, referred to by the authors as the budget. The setup is intriguing and the solutions proposed are novel.
