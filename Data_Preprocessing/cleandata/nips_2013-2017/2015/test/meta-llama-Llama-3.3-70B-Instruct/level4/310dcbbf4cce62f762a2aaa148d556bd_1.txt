Review after rebuttal: 
I still maintain that the setting presented is sufficiently similar to existing budgeted bandit problems with action constraints, where the horizon's size renders the context coupling negligible, thus potentially allowing each context occurrence to be treated as a separate bandit instance. 
To significantly enhance this paper, I recommend deriving a clean, reworked upper bound in terms of arm gaps for the problem-dependent scenario, ideally complemented by matching lower bounds for both problem-dependent and independent cases.
The authors' exploration of the budgeted and time-constrained contextual bandit problem yields the key finding that, given finite contexts and actions, and a sufficiently large time constraint T relative to the problem, a regret of order log(T) can be achieved, a novel result in the realm of contextual bandits.
The thoroughness and precision of the results and writing are commendable, although the findings, while interesting, are not particularly surprising. The finite nature of contexts J and arms K allows this bandit problem to be viewed as a time-constrained and budgeted bandit problem with JK arms, which is also action-constrained. Given the finiteness of the arms, for sufficiently large T, the regret is log(T), akin to action-constrained bandit problems. This raises questions about the paper's innovativeness, a concern that the authors could address in their rebuttal.
Several questions arise from this paper: 
- Theorem 2's regret in case 2) is stated as O(√T + ...), but should it not be at least O(√(KT) + ...)? 
- The regret in Theorem 2 is either O(KJ log(T)) or O(√T + KJ log(T)), depending on the arm configuration. Typically, problem-dependent bounds are expressed more refinedly, using the sum of inverse arm gaps. Is a similar approach feasible here? Although the proof relies on events characterizing the correct UCB orders rather than concentration bounds on gaps, resulting in KJ instead of a sum of gaps, it is unclear if this is optimal.
- Obtaining lower bounds, ideally both problem-dependent and problem-independent, would be valuable. While trivial lower bounds exist, corresponding to classical bandits with zero cost and constant context, refining these to account for contextual complexity would be beneficial. The originality of the setting remains unconvincing, leaving me neutral about the paper.
The setting presented bears a strong resemblance to a budgeted bandit problem with action constraints, which raises questions about its innovativeness, a point the authors could clarify in their rebuttal.
