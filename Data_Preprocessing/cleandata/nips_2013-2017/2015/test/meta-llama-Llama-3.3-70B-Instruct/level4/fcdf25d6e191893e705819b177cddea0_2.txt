This submission warrants a weak accept. 
To enhance the introduction, a more explicit explanation of the contributions is necessary, particularly in relation to LCD and BLCD, as the current description lacks clarity. 
The paper proposes a novel local search algorithm designed to uncover graphical relationships, which, under certain conditions, can be deemed causal. The technical aspects of this algorithm are noteworthy and demonstrate intellectual merit.
However, the comparison of efficiency with global search algorithms raises questions regarding fairness and relevance, as it may not provide a comprehensive or meaningful assessment. Overall, the review process for this paper has been relatively straightforward.
