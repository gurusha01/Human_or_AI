This paper presents two novel approaches for converting scoring outputs into probabilities, offering alternatives to existing methods like Platt's method and isotonic regression. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, with the authors deserving commendation for providing detailed information that facilitates the reproduction of experimental results. The proposed methods demonstrate originality, and given the prevalence of this problem, any substantiated improvement constitutes a notable advancement. Consequently, the paper is highly suitable for presentation at NIPS. However, I do have some concerns regarding the experimental results; while figure 1 suggests a distinct advantage for CVAP, the values in tables 1 and 2 are sufficiently close to raise questions about the significance of the difference - could the authors provide additional justification or clarification on this point? Overall, this is a strong paper that merits inclusion in NIPS.
