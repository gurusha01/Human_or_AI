Review - Clarity: The manuscript is generally well-written, but there is room for improvement, particularly in the organization of Section 3, as discussed below. Quality and originality: This paper contributes to the field by extending previous findings on sparse recovery [15,20] and trace regression [4,10], presenting novel progress in these areas.
Detailed comments: (1) Figure 1 illustrates that a higher rank of the underlying matrix necessitates more measurements for effective recovery when compared to regularization-based methods. This appears to be a limitation of the proposed approach, given that the rank may be unknown in practice and the number of measurements is often fixed. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a method to predict the applicability of the proposed approach in such scenarios. (2) Equation (17) outlines an extension to the spiked case with a diagonal noise term, but it requires prior knowledge of sigma^2. The experiments assume sigma^2 = 0, without providing a detailed discussion on its estimation. Furthermore, it is essential to explore whether this approach can be generalized beyond the diagonal noise case. (3) Section 3 presents several experiments along with their discussions, but the structure could be enhanced through the use of subsections. The paper explores a regularization-free estimation approach for trace regression involving symmetric positive semidefinite (SPD) matrices, revealing that under certain conditions, a simple least squares solution can perform equally well as a trace-regularized solution. By building upon recent advancements in sparse recovery and trace regression, the paper offers new insights and generalizations.
