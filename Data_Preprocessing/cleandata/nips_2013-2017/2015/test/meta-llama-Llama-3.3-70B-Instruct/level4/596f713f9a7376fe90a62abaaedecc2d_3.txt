What is the relative speed of denoising using the MLP compared to other methods? If the MLP is indeed faster, the primary benefit of utilizing GMMs for denoising would lie in their modular design. However, in practical, real-world scenarios, the modularity of generative models may not be a significant advantage, as the noise model is often predetermined or limited to a few options, and not typically specified by the user. If this assumption is incorrect, it would be beneficial to include a relevant example in the paper highlighting the practical significance of modularity. The paper's narrative is clear and well-structured, focusing on the use of discriminative training to accelerate denoising with generative models, specifically GMMs, and the writing is generally of high quality. Although the approach may be straightforward, the results presented are compelling and effective.
