This paper presents an investigation into the problem of estimating a positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix from linear measurements, with the authors employing ordinary least squares regression with a PSD constraint to achieve favorable statistical properties under specific design constraints.
The authors' approach involves recovering a d x d PSD matrix from n linear measurements using an ordinary least squares estimator with a PSD constraint, distinguishing their work from previous regularized approaches. They initially demonstrate that without design assumptions, the estimation error becomes unbounded when the number of measurements n is insufficient, even for low-rank matrices.
The authors then establish that a slow rate of prediction error can be attained if the design satisfies a particular condition, which requires the existence of a matrix M within the unit ball of the design's span, possessing a smallest eigenvalue bounded away from zero and a condition number bounded from above. Notably, this rate coincides with that of nuclear norm regularized estimators but necessitates an additional design condition.
Furthermore, the authors derive a bound on the estimation error for low-rank matrices, which depends on three design-related quantities: the restricted eigenvalue, separability constant, and correlation constant. However, the scaling of the latter two constants with respect to n, d, and r remains unclear, as the authors have not provided a theoretical analysis, instead proposing numerical study in the supplementary material. This omission hinders comparison with existing work and understanding of the estimator's behavior.
The paper's readability and writing quality are also concerns, with certain equations and definitions requiring clarification or rephrasing. In light of these issues, it appears that the work is still in its preliminary stages, and significant improvements are necessary before consideration for acceptance at NIPS. The investigation into unregularized matrix estimation is promising, but the primary bound on low-rank matrix estimation error relies on unexamined quantities, and their scaling with n, d, and r remains unknown, undermining the paper's overall impact.
