This manuscript examines contextual bandits under budget and time constraints, focusing on finite discrete contexts, fixed costs, and a single budget constraint. Although the setting is simplified, these assumptions remain practical and yield algorithms achieving O(log T) regret through the introduction of adaptive linear programming approximation of the oracle.
The paper is well-structured and clearly documented, with relevant citations and explicit motivation, making it a solid theoretical contribution. However, the practical implications are only briefly touched upon in Sections 5 and 6, and the absence of experimental results is notable. Nonetheless, the authors' achievement of logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits is significant and, to my knowledge, unprecedented. The provided proofs are convincing, although a detailed examination of each was not conducted. Overall, this is a strong paper that makes appropriate simplifying assumptions to derive O(log T) regret algorithms, although a more in-depth discussion of practical aspects would be beneficial.
