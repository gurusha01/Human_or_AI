The authors present innovative upper and lower bounds for the matrix determinant, which have implications for bounding the likelihood of a determinantal point process. Although the core concept is straightforward, the paper is well-organized, informative, and lays the groundwork for potential enhancements.
The authors introduce a novel application of pseudo-inputs to bound functionals of positive definite kernels, addressing a timely problem that will likely resonate with the scientific community. This approach exhibits considerable generality, with potential applications extending beyond determinantal point processes. The experimental evaluation is meticulously designed to highlight key aspects, including the limitations of variational approximations under specific conditions. The chosen application area is found to be intriguing and highly pertinent to the problem under investigation.
Minor comments:
- The emphasis on parameterizing K (as opposed to L) in the abstract and throughout the paper seems unjustified, as the authors primarily focus on problem description without attempting to address this issue.
- If the paper is accepted, it is recommended that the authors prepare a standard supplementary material, rather than simply uploading an extended version of the paper as the supplement.
Suggestions for future work:
- The discussion on the interpretability of the K parameterization enhances the appeal of this approach. It would be worthwhile for the authors to consider directly bounding the determinant in terms of the K matrix. Additionally, an investigation into the scalability of this method using pseudo-inputs could provide valuable insights. Overall, the authors' proposal of novel bounds on the matrix determinant, with applications to determinantal point processes, is a significant contribution that offers a foundation for further improvements and explorations.
