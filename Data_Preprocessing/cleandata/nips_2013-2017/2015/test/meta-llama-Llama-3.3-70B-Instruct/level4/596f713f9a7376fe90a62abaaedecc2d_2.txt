This manuscript presents a state-of-the-art image restoration system that integrates generative and discriminative approaches, yielding a significant two-order-of-magnitude reduction in computational time. 
The concept of leveraging an unsupervised generative component, followed by a linear combination of activated primitives, has been explored previously (notably by Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer in 1991, among other earlier works). However, the specific formulation of the problem presented here is novel. The authors employ conventional components and standard denoising metrics to validate their findings. To further strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to include analyses comparing the efficacy of the new gating network to its original counterpart or provide a more in-depth examination of the changes induced by the net gating mechanism. Overall, the work represents a straightforward yet effective implementation of an established idea, achieving respectable outcomes.
