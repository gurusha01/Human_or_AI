This paper tackles the challenge of blind signal extraction in the presence of Gaussian noise. The authors propose a solution to the noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem by utilizing a fixed-point iteration method to maximize directional kurtosis. This fixed-point iteration is performed within a pseudo-Euclidean space, giving rise to the "pseudo-Euclidean gradient iteration (PEGI)" approach. Two algorithms are derived from this method: one for estimating a single column of the mixing matrix and another that employs a deflation technique to estimate the full mixing matrix, ensuring that no component is extracted more than once.
The paper is well-written and enjoyable to read, although it lacks some key references to related work. The approach bears similarities to the well-known fastICA method and the GI-ICA approach, but it differs significantly in that it does not rely on pre-whitening or quasi-whitening steps. The main contributions of the paper, including the use of gradient-based fixed-point iterations for kurtosis maximization in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the analysis of how to optimally choose this space for the noisy ICA case, are technically sound and novel.
Performing ICA in noisy settings is a significant problem with potential interest to the community. The proposed method's inherent robustness to Gaussian noise, a common feature of higher-order cumulant-based approaches, is well-known. However, the integration of this robustness into a fixed-point algorithm is elegantly done, making the contribution significant. An additional advantage is the straightforward extension to the complex case, as shown in the supplemental material.
The experimental section is somewhat weak, focusing only on synthetic data and omitting comparisons with other robust ICA methods. While the results do indicate an improvement over GI-ICA, demonstrating that quasi-orthogonalization is not necessary, a comparison with other methods like "RobustICA" would be more meaningful. The relative Newton method for minimizing a quasi-ML cost function could also provide a useful baseline. Furthermore, estimating 4th-order cumulants or kurtosis generally requires a large amount of data, and the practical usefulness of the method for real-world data remains to be demonstrated.
Additional suggestions include comparing fastICA with pow3 nonlinearity instead of tanh in Figure 1 and clarifying why the iteration index k is omitted in Algorithm 2. The paper could also benefit from references to works such as "The Minimum Entropy and Cumulant Based Contrast Functions for Blind Source Extraction" and "Robust Independent Component Analysis by Iterative Maximization of the Kurtosis Contrast With Algebraic Optimal Step Size."
In summary, the authors present an elegant modification of the fixed-point iteration for robust ICA within a kurtosis-maximization framework. While the insights provided are of interest to the ICA community, further demonstration of the method's practical usefulness for real-world data is necessary. The paper offers a valuable contribution to the field, with its novel approach and potential for significant impact, despite the need for additional experimental validation and comparison with existing methods.
