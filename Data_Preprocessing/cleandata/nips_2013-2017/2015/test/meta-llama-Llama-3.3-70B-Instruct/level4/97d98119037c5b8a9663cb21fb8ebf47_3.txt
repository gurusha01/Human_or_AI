This paper establishes PAC bounds for control policies and presents a learning algorithm to optimize policies based on these bounds, addressing a crucial problem in robotics where worst-case performance can have severe consequences, as exemplified by UAV obstacle avoidance.
The authors tackle an intriguing and valuable issue, given the significant penalties associated with worst-case outcomes in many robotics tasks. The paper's mathematical formalism is robust, and its readability is excellent. Furthermore, the experiments are noteworthy, as they successfully bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and simulated real-world applications.
However, a key limitation of this paper is the absence of a comparative analysis with other approaches. For instance, while the authors demonstrate a substantial improvement in obstacle avoidance rates with a few iterations of their algorithm in the UAV scenario, a comparison with standard policy learning methods that optimize for expected reward rather than probabilistic bounds would be enlightening. Additionally, evaluating the mean performance of a specific metric could reveal an interesting tradeoff, potentially providing direct evidence to support the authors' claim that optimizing PAC bounds is beneficial in avoiding adverse outcomes like collisions.
In conclusion, this is a solid paper with a strong theoretical foundation that addresses a compelling problem in robotics and control applications. Nevertheless, the inclusion of more comprehensive evaluations, particularly in comparison to existing methods, would substantially enhance the paper's impact and validity, making it even more convincing and robust.
