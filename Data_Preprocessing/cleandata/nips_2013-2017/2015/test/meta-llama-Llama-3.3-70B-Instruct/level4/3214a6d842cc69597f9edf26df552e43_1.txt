The paper introduces a generalized approach to non-conjugate variational inference, leveraging the proximal method and linearization of non-conjugate models. This approach is demonstrated to simplify to natural gradient optimization for conjugate exponential models. The method yields marginally improved predictive accuracy compared to standard approximate inference techniques across a limited set of problems and datasets.
Quality:
The methodology relies on linearization to address non-conjugate models, which may be problematic given that prior research has identified linearization as unreliable in variational inference for non-conjugate models (as seen in Honkela and Valpola, NIPS 2004). Empirical evaluation on several datasets shows generally favorable performance, although the paper predominantly highlights the method's positive aspects without discussing its weaknesses or limitations.
Clarity:
The paper is well-organized and clearly written for the most part, but lacks specific details, notably the definition of $f_n$.
Originality:
The proposed approach is novel, combining existing techniques from various fields. However, the use of references is somewhat inconsistent, missing fundamental references on proximal algorithms and failing to discuss previous approaches using linearization in non-conjugate variational inference.
Significance:
Given the questionable reliability of the proposed method, its importance is difficult to assess until these concerns are addressed.
Other comments:
1. The abstract's final sentence contains unsubstantiated claims and should be clarified or removed.
2. The variable $\eta$ in Eqs. (2)-(3) is not defined.
3. The use of arg min in Eq. (3) instead of arg max, as in Eq. (2), requires explanation.
4. The method appears to be a batch algorithm, making the frequent citation and linkage to SVI methods unclear; classic batch VB seems more relevant.
5. The definition of $f_n$ should be clarified, especially in the context of the studied examples. Additionally, the accuracy of the linearization procedure needs verification to avoid issues similar to those illustrated in Honkela and Valpola (NIPS 2004).

The paper presents a novel, generic framework for non-conjugate variational inference with promising results, but the reliability of a key approximation is questionable due to previous work, necessitating further scrutiny.
