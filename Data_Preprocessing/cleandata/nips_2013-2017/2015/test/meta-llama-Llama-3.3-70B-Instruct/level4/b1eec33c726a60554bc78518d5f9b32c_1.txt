SUMMARY:
This manuscript examines the impact of noise correlation on multi-output regression models, demonstrating that methods leveraging correlation, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), can significantly outperform those that do not, like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). For specific linear models, including the Pooled model and Seemingly Unrelated Regression, MLE requires joint optimization of covariance and regression weights, a non-convex problem. The Alternative Minimization (AltMin) algorithm addresses this by iteratively optimizing covariance and weights, although it may not guarantee a global optimum.
The paper's primary contribution is a finite-sample analysis of AltMin and MLE, highlighting the benefits of correlation. The results show that both MLE and AltMin can exploit correlation, unlike OLS, with notable differences in certain examples. Additionally, the paper establishes a lower bound for OLS and MLE (for the Pooled model) that, up to a logarithmic factor in the number of samples, matches the upper bound, indicating the tightness of AltMin's upper bound.
The manuscript also includes empirical studies to support its theoretical findings.
EVALUATION:
In my opinion, this is a solid paper that offers valuable insights, theoretical foundations, and experimental validation. However, I have several suggestions for improvement:
- The experimental setup uses a very small epsilon value, implying highly correlated outputs. It would be beneficial to investigate whether the performance gap between MLE/AltMin and OLS persists with larger epsilon values (e.g., 0.1-0.5). While the theory predicts an O(epsilon) behavior, the impact of other constants, which may differ between OLS and AltMin/MLE, is unclear.
- The paper assumes a Gaussian noise model. I question the necessity of this assumption for the conclusions drawn. It appears that only Lemma 11 relies on this assumption, citing Corollary 5.35 of [28]. Could the results be extended to non-Gaussian noise models by utilizing Section 5.3.2 of [28]?
- There are several typos in the proof of Theorem 15 (p13):
  * L650: The summation over i is missing on the right-hand side.
  * L656: The variable zeta_1 is mentioned above the inequality symbol but not referenced elsewhere.
  * L663: A log n term seems to be missing after the equality.
- In the proof of Lemma 3 (L710), the inequality associated with zeta_1 holds with a probability of at least 1 - exp(-cn), but this is not explicitly stated or accounted for.
===== UPDATE: The authors have addressed my concerns, and I believe this is a reasonably good paper, providing intuition, theory, and simple experiments that validate the theory.
