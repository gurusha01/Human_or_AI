The manuscript presents a novel framework for spectral regularized embedding, specifically tailored for graph transduction, which could benefit from a more detailed explanation of its underlying structure and the advantages of utilizing an orthonormal embedding. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the work.
The authors introduce an innovative and sophisticated algorithm designed to approximate the solution to the SEER problem. This contribution is both original and noteworthy, offering a viable alternative for addressing the complexities inherent in the learning process.
The experimental results provided generally support the efficacy of the proposed solution. To further strengthen the manuscript, it would be beneficial to include results that explicitly demonstrate the advantages of the SEER framework itself, as well as the orthonormal representation defined by equation (3), and to assess the approximation accuracy of the IIP solution in relation to the SEER problem. Currently, these aspects are not adequately addressed, and their inclusion would help situate the contribution within a broader context.
The extension to multiple graph transduction, while intriguing, is described at an overly abstract level. Additional details, motivational context, and intuitive explanations are necessary to fully comprehend the applicability and interest of the proposed method in multi-graph settings. Specifically, clarification on the implementation of the algorithm in such scenarios and a more nuanced interpretation of the experimental results, particularly the last column of Table 4 (which counterintuitively suggests a single graph may outperform multiple graphs), would be invaluable.
Lastly, the manuscript's readability is sometimes compromised by its density and the frequent references to supplementary material, suggesting an attempt to encompass too broad a scope within a single paper. This approach may inadvertently hinder the work's accessibility and visibility. Overall, the paper introduces a new SEER framework for orthonormal embeddings applied to graph transduction, accompanied by an interesting IIP-based algorithm and supportive, albeit not fully comprehensive, experimental results.
