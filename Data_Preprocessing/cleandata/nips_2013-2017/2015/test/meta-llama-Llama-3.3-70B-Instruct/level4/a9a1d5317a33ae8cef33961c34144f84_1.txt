This manuscript addresses the crucial issue of transforming arbitrary class membership scores into reliable, calibrated probabilities, presenting a highly effective method. The approach demonstrates strong performance, making it a valuable contribution. The paper provides a comprehensive treatment of both theoretical foundations and algorithmic aspects. The writing is clear and accessible, facilitating easy comprehension. Notably, the work builds upon isotonic regression by incorporating cross-validation to produce multiple scoring sets, which are then combined to generate the final scores.
