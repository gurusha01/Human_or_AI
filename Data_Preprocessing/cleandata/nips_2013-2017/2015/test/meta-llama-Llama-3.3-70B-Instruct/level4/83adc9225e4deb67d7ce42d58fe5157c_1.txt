Review - Summary:
This manuscript presents a novel nonparametric approach for estimating the structure of probabilistic graphical models within the framework of infinite-dimensional exponential families, leveraging infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The estimation methodology employs score matching, thereby circumventing the computationally intensive calculation of the log partition function. The authors demonstrate that the resulting estimator can be efficiently solved using existing algorithms designed for group lasso problems. Furthermore, they provide a theoretical analysis of the estimator's consistency in recovering sparse structures, utilizing the primal-witness approach.
Qualitative Evaluation:
Overall, the paper's presentation is subpar. A comprehensive review of related tools and methodologies based on score matching is noticeably absent. While the authors provide theoretical underpinnings for their claims, a comparative analysis with existing approaches is lacking, highlighting the need for a dedicated section on related work. The methodology outlined in the paper heavily relies on concepts introduced in [28], yet the authors fail to discuss the relationship between their work and this reference, merely citing it without further commentary.
The effectiveness of the consistency analysis relative to existing literature remains unclear. Although not extensively discussed in the main body of the paper, the non-asymptotic rates of convergence appear to be significantly worse than those achieved in parametric or even semi-parametric settings, as seen in [18]. Consequently, the practical utility of the method with finite samples is uncertain, and the paper does not offer any insight into this issue.
The problem tackled by the paper is indeed intriguing and challenging. By establishing a connection between score matching and group lasso, the authors provide a viable solver for their model. However, the current algorithm's limitation to the l1 norm raises questions about its applicability with other regularizers for capturing diverse structures and the potential challenges in solving such models. The reliance on primal-dual witness for consistency analysis may also hinder extensions to other regularizers. This paper introduces a new nonparametric model for estimating probabilistic graphical model structures within infinite-dimensional exponential families. Despite the potentially interesting results, the lack of comparison with existing methods in terms of technical achievements is a significant oversight. The non-asymptotic rates obtained seem inferior to certain existing results, and since the paper builds heavily upon [28], a clearer exposition of its novelty would be beneficial.
