The paper's objective is to determine the direct causes and effects of a specified variable, referred to as the target variable, without requiring the initial discovery of the entire causal graph. Instead, the authors focus on directly uncovering the local causal structure surrounding the target variable. 
Existing algorithms are capable of discovering the Markov blanket (MB) of a target variable, as well as a subset of it known as the parents and children (PC) of the target variable. The primary goal of this paper is to differentiate between the nodes in the PC set, identifying which ones are parents and which are children of the target variable.
In terms of significance and originality, the contribution of this paper is deemed substantial, as it enhances efficiency and scalability compared to previous methods. These earlier methods necessitate the intermediate step of global causal discovery to achieve the same objective, which the proposed method bypasses.
However, the paper's clarity is compromised by a lack of transparency and flow in several sections. Certain descriptions are found to be confusing, and it is suggested that the authors provide more explicit explanations, motivating examples, and high-level summaries before delving into the technical aspects.
Specifically, several areas require improvement:
- The last paragraph of the introduction refers to "Local Causal Discovery," which could be mistaken for the authors' work rather than existing research, due to its coincidence with the paper's title. A more specific title, such as "Local Causal Discovery of Direct Causes and Effects," is recommended. Additionally, the proposed method's name, "Causal Markov Blanket," is considered too general and potentially misleading. 
- Section 3 would benefit from introductory high-level explanations preceding the technical details. A brief summary of the proposed method's steps at the beginning of Section 3.2 would enhance clarity.
- Algorithm 2's description seems inconsistent, as it mentions determining the causal identities of all nodes, yet it should supposedly focus on the PC set of the target variable.
- The conversion of Algorithm 2's output, IDT, into a CPDAG (Conditional Probability Distribution Acyclic Graph) is not clearly explained, particularly for IDT = 3. Visual examples of the output CPDAG would be beneficial.
- Further elaboration on why failing to meet Lemma 3 results in Markov equivalent structures would be useful.
- The flow in page 3 could be improved.
- Certain parts lack specificity, such as the definition of "causal identities for a target node," which should be clarified as "causal identities of nodes in the target's PC set."
- The term "CPDAG of a target variable" requires a clear definition, possibly as a subset of the original CPDAG containing the target variable and its parents and children.
- Footnote 3 and several other sections contain unclear or confusing terminology.
In terms of quality, the paper appears to have a well-supported theoretical analysis accompanied by experimental results, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency compared to global methods. However, several typos were identified, including those in the references section and minor errors throughout the text.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to more efficiently identifying direct causes and effects of a target variable. Despite the sometimes confusing presentation, the inclusion of more visual examples, motivation, and clearer explanations could enhance the paper's clarity and overall quality.
