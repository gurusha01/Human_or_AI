The primary concern with the manuscript is its apparent lack of familiarity with existing literature on the subject. The proposed algorithm bears a strong resemblance to the Monte Carlo EM algorithm, as well as the broader class of stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian dynamics designed to optimize intractable likelihood functions. A substantial body of work already addresses this topic, and the authors should situate their contributions within this context. Notably, established theories encompass some of the authors' findings and extend to more general scenarios. For instance, Markov chains are not required to be uniformly ergodic, and reinitializing the chain at a fixed distribution at each iteration is unnecessary. Although the authors acknowledge simplifying their analysis by doing so, this justification is insufficient; alternatively, reinitializing with the previous sample, as touched upon in the manuscript's conclusion, has been extensively analyzed in prior research. The presentation of results could be improved, particularly for Theorems 1 and 2, where the assumptions are not clearly stated, forcing the reader to consult preceding and following text. Furthermore, the stringent assumptions underlying results like Theorem 6 are unnecessary, as more general results can be found in the work of authors such as Benveniste, Metivier, and Priouret. Overall, the manuscript's novelty is limited, suggesting that the authors could benefit from a more thorough engagement with the existing literature.
