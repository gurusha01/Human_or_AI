The submission presents a revised proximal gradient algorithm tailored for variational Bayes, which is revealed to be equivalent to natural gradient descent under specific step size conditions.
Comments on Quality:
The paper's conceptual foundation is robust, albeit with notable shortcomings. The proximal gradient framework offers a streamlined approach to addressing nonconjugacy, and its equivalence to natural gradient descent provides a valuable connection to an established method. However, several flaws are apparent: (1) the algorithm deviates from a traditional proximal gradient algorithm due to the incorrect direction of the KL term, a choice seemingly motivated by efficiency considerations, as it allows the optimization problem to decouple across parameters in the authors' setup; (2) this deviation precludes convergence guarantees except under specific conditions, such as sufficiently rapid decay of beta_k.
Regrettably, the submission lacks a thorough analysis to substantiate the algorithm's efficacy. The primary justification appears to be potential practical performance improvements, yet the observed gains are modest and overshadowed by a substantial increase in computational runtime. More compelling results, demonstrating significant enhancements over the mean field baseline, are necessary to justify the method's adoption.
Overall, while the work exhibits promise, it is deemed too preliminary for conference publication.
Comments on Clarity:
The majority of the paper is well-presented, with the exception of Sections 5-6, which are obscure and challenging to comprehend. Revision of these sections is recommended to enhance readability.
Comments on Originality:
The research appears to be original.
Comments on Significance:
Currently, the significance of the work is limited. Nevertheless, the proposed proximal gradient variational Bayes algorithm has the potential for meaningful practical impact, pending further experimental validation. Although the results are not sufficiently strong to warrant acceptance, the algorithm itself merits additional investigation.
