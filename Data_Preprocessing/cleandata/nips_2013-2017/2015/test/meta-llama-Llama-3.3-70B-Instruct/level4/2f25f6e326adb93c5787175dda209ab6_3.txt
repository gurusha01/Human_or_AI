The authors present a methodology for approximate inference in determinantal point processes (DPPs) that bypasses the need for spectral knowledge of the underlying kernel. By leveraging inducing inputs to establish bounds on the likelihood, the approach achieves a reduction in computational complexity. The paper outlines both variational inference and approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, providing empirical evidence of their efficiency.
Although the paper exhibits potential, the description of the methods and the empirical evaluation could be enhanced for clarity and comprehensiveness. Several key aspects warrant further clarification:
1. A detailed comparison of the computational complexity and overall computation time between the two proposed methods would be beneficial.
2. It would be insightful to assess how the proposed methods stack up against alternative approaches, both in terms of approximation quality and computational time, encompassing both approximate and exact methods.
3. The empirical results in Section 5.1 indicate a significant parameter estimation error when using variational inference, prompting a switch to approximate MCMC. Further insight into the scenarios where variational inference is expected to succeed or fail would be valuable, along with the underlying reasons.
4. The performance of the methods when the inducing inputs coincide with the sampled points, such as the 13-point sample in the toy example, deserves exploration.
5. Guidance on selecting the optimal number of inducing points and their initial placement would be a practical addition.
On a minor note, the introduction could be made more accessible by briefly explaining the matrices K and L, potentially referencing the marginal kernel and L-ensembles. Additionally, discussions about directly learning marginal kernel parameters, which is not the approach taken, could be streamlined to focus more on the core methodology. The utilization of inducing inputs to bound the DPP likelihood and reduce computational cost is a key contribution, and both variational inference and approximate MCMC techniques are empirically demonstrated to be efficient. However, to strengthen the paper, I recommend that the authors refine the methodological explanations and empirical evaluations if the paper is accepted.
