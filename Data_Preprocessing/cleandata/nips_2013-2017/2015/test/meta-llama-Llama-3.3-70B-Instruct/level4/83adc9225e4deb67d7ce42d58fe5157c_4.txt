I have examined the authors' rebuttal, and my assessment of the paper remains unchanged. 
1. Summary of the paper:
This manuscript presents a method for learning the structure of a kernel-based graphical model that encodes a joint probability distribution, specifically one belonging to an infinite-dimensional exponential family. The approach utilizes score-matching as its learning objective, thereby eliminating the need to estimate the normalization constant, which enhances scalability and suffices for learning the structure. Furthermore, the kernel-based parameterization reduces the optimization problem to an instance of the group lasso. The algorithm's recovered structure is asymptotically consistent. The proposed method is compared against the graphical lasso for estimating a Gaussian distribution and against both glasso and an algorithm aware of the model family on a non-Gaussian distribution.
2. Summary of the review:
Although I did not thoroughly verify the theoretical analysis in the paper, and the experiments could benefit from clearer explanations, I find the paper to be well-organized, with reasonably clear contributions, an interesting idea, and significant potential impact.
3. Qualitative evaluation
Quality: The paper offers a medium level of quality, bolstered by extensive theoretical analysis (which, although not fully verified, appears sound) but is somewhat diminished by a small-scale empirical evaluation. Notably, there is no discussion or empirical evaluation regarding the choice of kernel parameters, leaving questions about the feasibility and sufficiency of grid-search plus cross-validation, as well as the sensitivity of the results to the chosen parameters. Additionally, the absence of provided code is a drawback.
Clarity: The clarity of the paper is rated as low. While it is well-organized and uses clear language, the mathematical developments are often difficult to follow, particularly due to notations that are not introduced in the main paper. Furthermore, the parameters of the second model learned in the experiments are not provided, which hampers understanding.
Originality: The originality of the paper is considered good. Although I am not familiar with kernel-based methods or kernel-based graphical models, and while similar works exist (such as "Nonparametric Tree Graphical Models via Kernel Embeddings," "Kernel Conditional Random Fields: Representation and Clique Selection," and "Learning Graphical Models with Mercer Kernels"), the paper presents a significant development relative to previously published works cited within it.
Significance: The significance of the paper is deemed good, as structure learning for non-Gaussian variables is an important open problem, and the proposed idea is found to be very interesting.
Impact: The impact of the paper is rated as 2.
4. Other Comments:
Details: It would be beneficial to explore whether the normalization constant can be easily estimated once the model has been learned, especially if the goal is to obtain the density. Investigating restricted families of kernels that might facilitate this estimation could be valuable. Additionally, suggestions for improvement include using mixed case for section headers, deriving certain equations in the supplementary material for clarity (e.g., the step from line 204 to line 207), and including a table of notations in the supplementary material to enhance readability. Specific questions and corrections are also raised, such as the rationale behind Omega(f)^2 in line 319, the dimensionality and parameter values in experiment 2, and the expression for D, E, and F in Theorem 3.2. Typos and minor errors, such as missing articles and undefined notations (e.g., S^c and Omega*_{S^c}), are noted and should be corrected.
In conclusion, while the paper has its strengths, including a well-organized structure, clear contributions, and an interesting idea with potential impact, it also faces challenges related to the clarity of mathematical developments, the choice of kernel parameters, and the provision of detailed experimental results. Addressing these aspects could significantly enhance the paper's quality and readability.
