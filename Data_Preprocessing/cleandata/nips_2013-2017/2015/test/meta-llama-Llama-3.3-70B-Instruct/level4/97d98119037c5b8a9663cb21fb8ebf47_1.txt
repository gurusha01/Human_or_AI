This paper has some notable strengths, including: 
1) The investigation of iterative stochastic policy optimization, which poses an intriguing problem. 
2) The experimental design is adequately thorough.
However, several weaknesses are also present: 
1) The current analysis primarily focuses on establishing an upper bound for policy evaluation but fails to propose an algorithm that leverages this bound, leaving the analysis incomplete as it neglects the integration of these steps.
2) The theoretical analysis, while competent, does not offer a substantial contribution on its own due to its largely standard approach. 
3) The practical utility of the derived oracle-like upper bound remains unclear, particularly in terms of its tightness. Questions arise regarding the magnitude of \hat{J}_alpha for various choices of alpha and whether the resultant upper bound retains meaningfulness, as elaborated in the comments.
