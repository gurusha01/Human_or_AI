This manuscript examines a relatively straightforward budget-constrained contextual bandit problem, characterized by discrete contexts and actions. The primary contribution lies in the algorithm's computational efficiency, achieved through LP approximation, and its ability to attain a log(T) regret bound.
The paper is exceptionally well-structured and clear, making it easily comprehensible.
For future research directions, incorporating a parametric model for the reward function could be beneficial, particularly when dealing with a large number of contexts. In Section 4.1, the rationale behind combining UCB with ALP in the UCB-ALP algorithm warrants further clarification. It appears to align with the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty, potentially equivalent to the policy update mechanism in UCRL2. The inclusion of numerical experiments in an extended version of the paper would be valuable.

This manuscript deserves acceptance due to its provision of an efficient algorithm for constrained contextual bandits with optimal regret in most scenarios, presenting an interesting and notable improvement over existing research.
