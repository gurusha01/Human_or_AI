This paper explores the regression problem with multiple vector-valued outputs that are interconnected through a common noise vector, shared coefficient vectors, or other attributes, posing an intriguing theoretical and practical question. 
The authors examine two prominent models for addressing such problems: the pooled model, which assumes a shared coefficient vector across outcomes, and the SUR model, which assumes a shared noise vector across dimensions. In both cases, it is possible to disregard the additional information and perform ordinary least squares regression (OLS), but it has been demonstrated that Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) outperforms this approach. However, MLE requires solving a non-convex problem, prompting the authors to investigate alternating minimization. Under these models, they show that alternating minimization's performance is within universal constant factors of MLE.
Several aspects warrant further clarification or exploration:
1. The introduction of an additional logarithmic factor in theorem 1, potentially stemming from the repeated use of fresh samples (lines 190-200), deserves a more detailed explanation, as the lower bounds do not exhibit this factor.
2. Applying these findings to real-world data would provide valuable insights into their practical implications.
3. The restrictive nature of the two considered models raises questions about the broader applicability of the results. Specifically, it would be beneficial for the authors to discuss the conditions under which Alternating Minimization can be expected to perform within universal constant factors of MLE for regression problems, and whether there are generic conditions that guarantee this performance.
Ultimately, the paper demonstrates that Alternating Minimization can achieve performance comparable to MLE estimation, up to universal constants, under two popular models for regression problems with vector-valued outputs, yielding an interesting and noteworthy result.
