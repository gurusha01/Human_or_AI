This paper presents a manifold optimization approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which appears to be a high-quality contribution with good clarity and significance. The originality of the work seems promising, although a more in-depth understanding of the manifold optimization literature is necessary to fully appreciate its novelty.
The paper is well-structured, and the author's efforts are commendable. However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the use of tables and the presentation of only mean and standard error values, particularly for complex optimization problems, are not sufficient. Additionally, reporting only performance times without providing insight into the algorithms' objective performance is inadequate.
To strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to include the UCI benchmarks in the main text and compare the results with other implementations, such as the gmmdist functions in MATLAB or the mclust package in R. The current benchmarking against the "EM algorithm" is unclear, as the specific implementation and convergence criteria used can significantly impact the results.
To address these concerns, the following additions would be valuable:
(a) Two-dimensional contour plots illustrating both time and performance for each numerical example, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithms' behavior.
(b) Similar plots for a set of benchmarks, enabling a more detailed comparison of the proposed approach with existing methods.
(c) Plots showing the likelihood or surrogate objective as a function of iteration, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of the algorithms' performance and convergence.
A significant issue with the EM algorithm is that the loss function often becomes nearly flat, leading to unnecessary iterations and potentially poor performance. The termination criteria used can substantially impact the results, and a more detailed analysis of this aspect would be beneficial.
While the paper presents a modern approach to a classic problem with promising results, the lack of accuracy results, benchmark algorithm details, and performance vs iteration plots hinders a thorough assessment. Providing more detailed results and comparisons would help to substantiate the claims made in the paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
