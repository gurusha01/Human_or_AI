This paper examines the multi-variable regression problem, providing an in-depth analysis of ordinary least squares (OLS) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods. It characterizes the conditions under which the MLE estimate outperforms the OLS estimator. Additionally, the paper presents a finite sample analysis for the alternating minimization method, which can be efficiently implemented for pooled models and seemingly unrelated regression problems. The analysis yields matching upper and lower bounds for OLS and MLE, as well as upper bounds for the alternating minimization approach, clearly highlighting the scenarios where the MLE or alternating minimization approach offers improvements.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with straightforward and simple proofs that appear to be correct upon review. The comparison between MLE and OLS is straightforward, and the theorems proved for the alternating minimization-based approach are a significant strength of the work.
However, several concerns arise. Firstly, the models considered are well-specified, whereas the motivating applications are more aligned with machine learning problems, where well-specified assumptions are rarely met. The analysis heavily relies on the well-specifiedness of the models.
Secondly, the significance of the results is unclear. The experiments utilize synthetic data, and while the theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of alternative minimization (and MLE) in terms of performance, the practical implications and significance of these results in real-world applications are not evident. Concrete examples of applications where the gain is substantial would be beneficial.
It appears that a large dimensionality is required for the difference between MLE and OLS to be substantial. 
Lastly, the results seem slightly out of scope for NIPS, as they appear to be more classical statistics and econometrics-oriented.
Overall, while the results are intriguing, their significance, particularly in relation to the NIPS scope, is unclear. If space permits, I would recommend accepting the paper, but the authors should address the concerns regarding the practical implications and significance of their findings.
