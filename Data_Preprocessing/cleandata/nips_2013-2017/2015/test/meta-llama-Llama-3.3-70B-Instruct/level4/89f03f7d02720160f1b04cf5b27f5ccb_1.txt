This paper presents a novel approach to noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by utilizing solely fourth-order cumulants, thereby facilitating asymptotically unbiased estimation in the presence of Gaussian noise. The manuscript is well-grounded and motivated, exhibiting a high level of technical sophistication.
A potential limitation of the work lies in the relatively modest novelty and performance enhancement compared to existing methods, such as those outlined in [21]. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the resulting algorithm is noteworthy and may offer practical advantages.
Furthermore, the methodology requires a substantial number of data points to demonstrate its efficacy, with tens of thousands of samples needed in a 14-dimensional context. This significant data requirement may restrict the algorithm's practical applicability. Overall, the paper introduces an innovative algorithm for noisy ICA, supported by robust theoretical foundations, although its novelty and simulated performance improvements may be somewhat limited.
