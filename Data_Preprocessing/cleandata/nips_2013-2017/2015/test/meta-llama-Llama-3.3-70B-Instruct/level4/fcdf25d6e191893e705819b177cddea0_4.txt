This paper explores the concept of learning direct causes and effects of a target variable using local learning methods, building upon existing approaches by considering larger neighborhoods, thereby enabling the inference of additional causal relationships. The problem addressed is relevant, and the contributions made are noteworthy.
However, the overall technical presentation is lacking in clarity and rigor. Several key terms, such as "unshielded parent," "set of three-fork parents," and "sound and complete MB discovery algorithm," are not explicitly defined, which could hinder understanding.
Theoretical foundations, as presented in Theorems 2 and 3, are incomplete, as they do not include all necessary assumptions. For instance, the proof of Theorem 2 invokes causal sufficiency without stating it as an assumption. Furthermore, it is essential to assume that conditional independence tests yield accurate results or to consider scenarios with infinite data or similar assumptions. The necessity of the distribution being faithful to any DAG is also not clearly justified.
Technical inaccuracies and ambiguities are present throughout the manuscript. For example, the distinction between the Markov condition and the Causal Markov condition is not accurately represented. The Markov condition states that a node is independent of its non-descendants given its parents, whereas the Causal Markov condition posits that a node is independent of its non-effects given its direct causes.
Notational inconsistencies, such as the lack of parentheses in set differences (e.g., R\(S\T) vs. (R\S)\T), may lead to misinterpretations. The rationale behind certain beliefs, such as the assumption that structures can be identified beyond Markov equivalence classes using conditional independence tests alone, is not convincingly argued.
The experimental section could be enhanced by including a standard Markov blanket discovery algorithm as a baseline to assess the efficacy of the new rules. The evaluation methodology, which measures efficiency in terms of conditional tests and MB discovery algorithm invocations, may unfairly favor the CMB algorithm, as it does not account for conditional independence tests performed within MB discovery algorithms. Incorporating actual running times of different algorithms could provide a more balanced comparison.
In conclusion, while the topic is interesting and the contributions are valuable, the technical presentation requires significant improvement to enhance clarity, accuracy, and overall quality.
