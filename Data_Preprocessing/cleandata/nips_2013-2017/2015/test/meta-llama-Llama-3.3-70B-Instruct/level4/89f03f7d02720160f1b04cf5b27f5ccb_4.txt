This manuscript addresses the issue of noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by presenting an enhanced version of the Gradient-Iteration (GI) ICA algorithm initially proposed by Voss et al. A significant limitation of the traditional GI-ICA algorithm is its reliance on the assumption that the columns of matrix A are orthogonal, necessitating a complex preprocessing step known as quasi-orthogonalization to transform the data into a form where the columns of A are orthogonal. The proposed method innovatively circumvents this requirement by reframing the signal recovery problem as a fixed-point method within a pseudo-Euclidean space, characterized by an indefinite inner product.
While the introduction in Section 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the ICA research landscape, it would be beneficial to also briefly discuss the research pertaining to underdetermined blind signal separation (BSS). The noisy ICA model, expressed as X = AS + n, can be transformed into an equivalent form, X = A'S', by appending a column to A and a row to S, denoted as A' and S', respectively. This transformation allows existing underdetermined BSS methods to be applied to the signal recovery problem, with the noise being treated as an additional source. Therefore, literature on underdetermined BSS is also relevant and should not be overlooked.
The manuscript appears to contain sentences identical to those found in a publicly available manuscript: J. Voss, M. Belkin, L. Rademacher, "Optimal Recovery in Noisy ICA," 2015. To avoid potential accusations of plagiarism or self-plagiarism, it is advisable for the authors to rephrase these sentences to ensure originality. Additionally, it would be helpful to explicitly define the notation $^\dagger$ as denoting the pseudo-inverse at its first occurrence.
A notable omission is the lack of a concluding section, which should be included in the revised submission to provide a comprehensive summary of the findings and implications.
Overall, the quality of the manuscript is very good, with excellent clarity, good originality, and good significance. The proposal of an extension to the GI ICA algorithm by formulating the signal recovery problem in a pseudo-Euclidean space is a key innovation, offering a novel approach to addressing the challenges of noisy ICA.
