Summary: This paper introduces a novel nonparametric approach to estimate the structure of sparse undirected probabilistic graphical models from data, leveraging kernels to approximate the resulting distribution as an infinite-dimensional member of the exponential family. The method utilizes the RKHS representer theorem to reduce the optimization problem, making it solvable using existing group lasso solvers. The paper is well-written, clearly explained, and employs complex mathematics to achieve an elegant solution. The concepts and techniques developed are of significant interest to researchers in structure learning. However, the evaluation section is a notable weakness, as it should have included more complex graph structures with weaker edges to provide a better indication of real-world performance.
Quality: The idea is good and well-executed, with logical steps in reducing the penalized score matching objective to a quadratic minimization problem. Although the detailed proofs in the supplementary material were not thoroughly checked, the abstract parameterization is challenging to follow. A significant weakness is the evaluation, which uses a very sparse chain graph with strong edges, resulting in exceptionally good performance even with limited data points. It would be beneficial to evaluate the method on more realistic models to assess its actual performance.
Clarity: The paper is very clear, with a well-described problem and main idea, carefully defined concepts and formulas, and a good attempt to make the argument accessible to most readers. Section 2.3 is particularly helpful for those less familiar with score matching. However, some steps in Section 3 could be improved with additional hints for easier comprehension.
Originality: While the paper builds upon existing results, the crucial contribution leading to Theorem 3.2 appears to be new, elegant, and potentially very useful.
Significance: This paper makes a significant addition to state-of-the-art methods in structure inference, likely to inspire new ideas and applications.
Details: Several minor errors and suggestions for improvement were noted, including typos, unclear sentences, and formatting issues. For instance, the sentence "we focus... models" (line 53) should be checked, and the typo "integrable" (line 76) should be corrected. Additionally, the definition of D as diagonal in Theorem 3.2 is unclear, and the evaluation should consider more realistic models by sampling Î©s from a range (e.g., [0.05-0.8]). The NPN ROC-curve in Fig 2b should be explained in more detail, including the optimized objective. Overall, the paper is highly relevant, well-written, and deserves to be included in the conference.
