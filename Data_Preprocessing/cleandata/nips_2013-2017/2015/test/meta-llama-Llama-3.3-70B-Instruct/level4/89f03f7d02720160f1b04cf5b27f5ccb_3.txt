This paper introduces the PEGI algorithm, a novel approach to addressing the noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem. By leveraging a gradient iteration within a pseudo-Euclidean space, where the inner product is defined by the Hessian of the contrast function (specifically, kurtosis), the authors demonstrate that their algorithm can extract the normalized columns of the mixing matrix with probability 1. Furthermore, they show that this extracted estimate can be utilized to achieve an SINR-optimal recovery of the sources.
However, a significant drawback of this method is its requirement for a substantial number of samples (N) to surpass the performance of standard ICA techniques such as JADE, FastICA, and 1FICA, as evidenced by the example in Fig 1a, which necessitates over 50,000 samples.
Additionally, when compared to the existing GI-ICA method [21], the proposed algorithm does not exhibit substantial superiority for large datasets, with Fig 2 indicating only marginal improvements over GI-ICA for N > 50,000.
The paper's presentation is commendable, and the proposed method showcases originality. The theoretical convergence results and the optimal SINR reconstruction theorem are notable strengths. Nevertheless, the aforementioned limitations detract from the method's significance. To bolster their approach, the authors might investigate specific signal or noise scenarios where PEGI decisively outperforms standard methods like FastICA or JADE. Without such differentiation, the method risks being perceived as another incremental addition to the plethora of ICA techniques.
In essence, the PEGI algorithm represents a pseudo-Euclidean space approach to noisy ICA, distinguished by its clarity and originality. However, the modest performance gains relative to existing methods raise concerns that it may not significantly contribute to the field beyond being another ICA method.
