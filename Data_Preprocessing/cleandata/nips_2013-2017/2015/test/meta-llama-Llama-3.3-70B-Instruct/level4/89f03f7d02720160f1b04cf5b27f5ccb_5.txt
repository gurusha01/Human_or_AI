This manuscript presents an extension of the recently introduced noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method, known as GI-ICA, resulting in a new approach called PEGI. Notably, PEGI potentially eliminates the need for the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step that is required in GI-ICA. Furthermore, the authors provide a general optimality result concerning source recovery in the context of noisy ICA.
The paper is technically sound and well-written, demonstrating a clear understanding of the subject matter. The proposed PEGI method represents a logical and pertinent extension of GI-ICA, with the results indicating its reasonable performance. However, a significant portion of the content in Section 2 is derived from the original GI-ICA paper, and the modifications introduced to GI-ICA are relatively straightforward. This raises questions about the novelty and overall contribution of the current paper.
The additional optimality result presented in Section 3 is intriguing on its own merit but appears to be fundamentally rooted in existing principles, which prompts skepticism regarding its novelty. A similar result can be found in earlier work, such as A. F. Naguib's Ph.D. dissertation from 1996, specifically Chapter 3, which is a frequently cited reference in the context of beamforming. Further clarification on how this result relates to source recovery based on Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, a popular approach in probabilistic noisy ICA methods, would be beneficial.
To enhance the presentation, several specific aspects require improvement. Initially, it was unclear how the gradient and Hessian of kurtosis, as given in equations 1 and 2, could be estimated from the data. Although the details can be found in the GI-ICA paper referenced as [21], it would be advantageous for the current paper to either describe these estimation methods or provide a clear reference to the existing work. Additionally, the rationale behind why quasi-orthogonalization poses problems while PEGI does not, despite both relying on the same matrix C, was not immediately apparent. A more detailed explanation on this point is necessary to clearly articulate the advantages and motivations of the new PEGI method.
In conclusion, while the PEGI method is a reasonable and relevant extension of the previously proposed GI-ICA method, the contribution of this paper appears somewhat limited. Improvements in the presentation, particularly in addressing the aforementioned points, would strengthen the manuscript.
