This paper proposes a nonparametric graphical model learned through score matching, effectively eliminating the requirement for normalizing constant estimation. Theoretical foundations and simulation results are provided to support this approach.
Quality: Although the nonparametric graphical model and neighborhood estimation method are not entirely novel, the paper's contribution lies in bypassing the need to compute the normalizing constant using score matching. The formulation in equation (8), parameterized by RKHS, demonstrates neighborhood selection consistency.
Clarity: The presentation of the paper is clear and well-organized.
Originality and significance: The paper's originality stems from its use of score matching to obviate the need for normalizing constant evaluation. The score matching objective function introduced for learning nonparametric graphical models is notable for being independent of normalizing constants, making it a compelling concept.
