This manuscript focuses on identifying the immediate causes and effects of a specified target variable T, rather than attempting to elucidate the complete causal structure. The proposed algorithm diverges from the traditional Markov blanket approach, leveraging a set of rules applied to the neighborhood of T to determine the directionality of causal relationships. The paper presents a clear and intriguing methodology, demonstrating that the introduced algorithm is equivalent to established methods, thereby not omitting any crucial information. Although the algorithm does not uncover novel causal relationships beyond existing knowledge, it enhances scalability by concentrating on a subset of variables relevant to the target analysis, a common scenario in real-world applications where examining the entire graph is unnecessary.
