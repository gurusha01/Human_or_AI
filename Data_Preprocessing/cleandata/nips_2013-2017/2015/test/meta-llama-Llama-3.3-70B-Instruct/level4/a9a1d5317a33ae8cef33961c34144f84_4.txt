This manuscript presents two novel algorithms, IVAP and CVAP, for probabilistic predictions. Although I am not a specialist in this area, I find the concept intriguing. The methods are straightforward to comprehend and implement. Theoretical analyses are provided to demonstrate the validity of IVAP, while experimental results support the performance of both proposed methods.
One of my primary concerns is the distinction and superiority of the proposed method over the Venn-Abers predictors. To strengthen the comparison, the authors should provide a more comprehensive introduction to the Venn-Abers predictors, including their validity, predictive efficiency, and computational efficiency. This would facilitate a more effective comparison between the original algorithm and the proposed ones.
Another concern is the limited experimental evaluation, which relies on a single UCI dataset. To solidify the results, the authors should test their method on multiple datasets, including more challenging ones beyond the UCI repository. Additionally, since CVAP generally yields the best performance, the authors should investigate the sensitivity of the results by varying the value of k used in CVAP.
If the authors can adequately address these concerns in their rebuttal, I would be inclined to accept this paper.
After reviewing the author feedback, I appreciate the inclusion of additional datasets in the supplementary materials. However, the explanation for the infeasibility of the original Venn-Aber method on the current dataset scale remains unclear. I recommend reorganizing the introduction and incorporating more experimental results into the main text. Overall, the paper exhibits interesting ideas and promising results, but the novelty and experimental design require further clarification and improvement.
