This paper examines the estimation of low-rank semidefinite matrices from noisy inner products using measurement matrices $X1, ..., Xn$. The dominant approach to estimation in this setting is nuclear norm regularized least squares. However, when $\Sigma$ is constrained to be positive semidefinite, the nuclear norm simplifies to the trace, which is a single linear function.
The authors demonstrate that under certain conditions, it is possible to accurately estimate $\Sigma$ by solving a constrained least squares problem without the need for linear regularization. This is achievable when the measurements do not have semidefinite matrices in their nullspace, such as when the $X_i$ are full-rank semidefinite matrices. Simulation results verify these claims, and a real-data experiment, although somewhat artificial, supports the theoretical findings.
The paper's primary objective is to argue that regularization may not be necessary for specific sampling models. A comparison with the best-known theoretical results for the regularized problem would be beneficial, particularly in terms of the restricted eigenvalue condition, which is necessary for both formulations. Additionally, evaluating $\mu$, $\tau$, and $\phi$ for a random measurement ensemble, such as $Xi = zi zi^*$ or $Xi$ being a Wishart matrix, and comparing the bound in Theorem 2 to the corresponding result for the nuclear norm regularized variant would provide valuable insights.
It would be helpful to recover the rates of the special case as a consequence of the general theory introduced in this paper, allowing for a comparison with existing results, such as those in [4] and [10]. The main practical implication of this work is that, in some situations, choosing a regularization parameter is unnecessary. However, from a computational perspective, there are no obvious reasons to prefer the proposed approach over the regularized variant.
The paper presents solid results, but they seem somewhat under-interpreted. Further clarification on the comparison to nuclear norm minimization and the motivations for the sampling model would be appreciated. Smaller issues, such as controlling $\mu(T)$ in terms of $\phi(T)$ and $\tau(T)$, and the practical motivations for the sampling model, require additional attention.
The real-data experiment demonstrates the estimation of the best rank-r approximation of data covariance using inner products with random Wishart matrices. While the observations conform to the theoretical claims, the motivation for this experiment is unclear, and the paper would benefit from demonstrating the performance of the proposed method in a more practical application. The results rely on special measurements that do not have semidefinite matrices in their nullspace, which is not satisfied by "generic" Gaussian measurements but is met by Wishart measurements. Exploring other practical scenarios where trace sampling with semidefinite $X_i$ applies, beyond phase retrieval, would strengthen the paper's message. Overall, the paper presents solid, albeit under-interpreted, results, showing that semidefinite constrained least squares can produce accurate estimates of low-rank semidefinite matrices without the need for trace regularization, albeit for specific sampling models.
