The paper is well-structured and effectively conveys its core ideas and message, making it easily comprehensible at a high level. However, the authors occasionally omit specific details, potentially to enhance readability, which complicates the reproducibility of the results. The significance of these omitted details is unclear, but their absence hinders a straightforward replication of the findings.
Several aspects require further clarification from the authors:
* A more detailed specification of the model is necessary, particularly regarding the symmetry between the decoder and encoder, and the upsampling process.
* The learning procedure used to train the generative model should be explicitly stated, including the optimization algorithm employed (e.g., SGD, SGD with momentum, RMSprop, Adam, Ada-delta, Adagrad).
* For the LSTM, it is essential to disclose whether gradient clipping was utilized to ensure stability, as this is a common practice in most LSTM models.
* The learning rate, momentum, and other hyperparameters should be specified, along with the method used to determine these values (e.g., intuition, grid search, or random sampling).
* A more precise description of the data construction process is needed, including any pruning techniques used to ensure a balanced representation of frames from each game stage, given the potentially significant differences in image statistics between early and late stages.
* The average episode length should be compared to the average length of the generated movies.
* The necessity and effectiveness of curriculum learning (progressing from 1, 3, to 5 frames in the future) should be experimentally validated, and its impact on generation stability assessed.
* While the assumption of multiplicative interaction between actions seems reasonable, experimental verification of this claim is necessary, especially given the novelty of the task.
Although the paper is generally well-written, the lack of detailed experimental procedures may render the results unreproducible. Nonetheless, the authors present impressive results, offer intriguing observations, and provide insightful analysis of their model's behavior.
