How fast is denoising with the MLP? If it is faster, the only advantage of denoising with GMMs would be its modularity. But I imagine that in real-world applications, the modularity of generative models is rarely a decisive advantage since the noise model will be known or will be one of a handful of choices (and not specified by a user, for example). Should I be wrong about this, it might be nice to include an example in the paper where modularity is of practical importance. The story of the paper is very clear (using discriminative training to speed up denoising with generative models, in this case a GMM) and it is for the most part very well written. The approach is simple but the results are convincing.
