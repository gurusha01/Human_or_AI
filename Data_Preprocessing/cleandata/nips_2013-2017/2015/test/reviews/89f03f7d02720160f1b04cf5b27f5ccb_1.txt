The paper proposes a new algorithm for noisy ICA. It uses only fourth-order cumulant, thus achieving (asymptotically) unbiased estimation for Gaussian noise.
The paper is well positioned and motivated and seems to be of high technical quality.
 One drawback is that the novelty as well as improvement in performance w.r.t. previous work in [21] may be limited. But perhaps the improvement is useful, at least the ensuing algorithm is surprisingly simple.
Another drawback is that the number of data points needed to demonstrate any utility of the method is large: tens of thousands in a 14-dimensional setting. This may mean that the method is not likely to be very useful in practice. An interesting new algorithm for noisy ICA, with theory that looks sound. But perhaps limited novelty, and modest improvement performance in simulations.
