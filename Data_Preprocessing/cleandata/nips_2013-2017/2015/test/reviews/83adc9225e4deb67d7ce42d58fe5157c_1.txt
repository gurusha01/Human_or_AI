Summary:
The paper provide a new nonparametric model for estimating the structure of a probabilistic graphical models considering infinite dimensional exponential family (based on infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space). Their estimation is based on score matching which avoids intractable/expensive computation of of the log partition. They show that the estimator can be solved using any current algorithm for solving group lasso. They also show the theoretical consistent analysis of the estimated sparse structure using primal-witness approach.
 Qualitative Evaluation
Overall, not a well written paper. This paper does not provide a good review of other related tools based on score matching. Authors provide the theoretical analysis for the claims in the paper but they do not compare their results with existing approaches - a section on related work would have been helpful. The analysis/method in the paper is mainly based on [28] but authors do not discuss the relationship of their work with [28], they just cite this paper as they directly used some of their results without any comments.
It is not clear how good/bad is their consistency analysis against existing papers in the literature. Although not discussed in detail in the main paper, the non-asymptotic rates of convergence seem much worse than the parametric setting, or even the semi-parametric setting as in [18]. So, with finite samples, it is unclear when/why the method should be used. Again, there was no discussion in the paper to illuminate this or any other point.
The problem addressed in the paper is an interesting problem and a challenging problem. The model is based on score matching which is already addressed in [28], but they provide the connection with group lasso which provides a good solver for their model. However, currently algorithm only works with l1 norm and it is not clear if this model can be applied with other regularizers to capture different structure and if it can be done, how challenging is the solver. The consistency analysis is based on primal-dual witness which can be difficult to be extended to other regularizers.  The paper provide a new nonparametric model for estimating the structure of a probabilistic graphical models considering infinite dimensional exponential family. The paper is not well written - while the results look potentially interesting, no comparison is done with existing methods in terms of the technical results. It seems the non-asymptotic rates obtained are worse than certain existing results. The paper is mainly based on [28], so a more clear exposition on the novelty will be helpful.
