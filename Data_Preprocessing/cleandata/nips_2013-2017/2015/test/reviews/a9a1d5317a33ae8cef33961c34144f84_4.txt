This paper proposed two algorithms for probabilistic predictions, IVAP and CVAP. At the very beginning, I need to say I am not an expert on this topic. But as for me, the idea in this paper is interesting. The methods are easy to understand and use. Theoretical results are provided to show the validity of the proposed IVAP. Experimental results justify the performance of the proposed methods.
My first concern is how this proposed method is different from and better than the Venn-Abers predictors. The authors should add some more introduction about the Venn-Abers predictors by showing its validity,predictive efficiency and computational efficiency first, then make the comparison between the original algorithm and the proposed ones.
My second concern is that the experiment used only one UCI dataset to justify the performance, which may not be very solid. The authors should try on more datasets and more challenging datasets other than UCI datasets to better confirm the superiority of the proposed method. Also, as CVAP generally obtains the best performance. The authors should try to show the sensitivity results by vary different k used in CVAP.
If the authors can well address the above concerns in the rebuttal, I would like to accept this paper.
I have read the author feedback. I am happy to see some more datasets reported in the supplementary. But it is still not clearly clarified why the original Venn-Aber is not feasible on the current used dataset with this scale. So I urge the authors to reorganize the content in the introduction and move some more experimental results back into the main text. Overall, this paper shows some interesting ideas and promising results. But the novelty of this paper needs to be clarified and the experimental design needs to be improved.
