A nice work proposing to learn logarithmic online multiclass trees for efficient multiclass prediction. The authors introduce the principle behind LOMTree and its advantage wrt OAA classifiers. Then they propose a simple objective value for finding a partition on a given node that will promote maximally pure and balanced partition. Then the global quality of the tree is expressed as an entropy function. The proposed algorithm converges provably to a tree with log(k) complexity. Numerical experiments are performed on several datasets from 26 to 105k classes and show reasonable training and testing time.
 This is a good paper well written but pretty dense. The proposed approach is novel and compares favorably to other tree-based classifiers while being close to OAA performances. I just have a few comments in the remaining.
- First the example for the construction of a node in the supplementary material is particularly clear. It would be nice in the paper instead of supplementary material (in parallel to algorithm?).
- The linear classifiers h at each nodes are estimated online. Is the update a stochastic gradient wrt J()? A few more detail would go a long way to reproducible research.
- The numerical experiments are a bit short. It would be interesting to add in table 4 the performance of OAA classification to help for the comparison (for the small datasets at least). They are given in the text but should appear in the table.
 Interesting paper with a novel algorithm for constructing an efficient tree based classifier. Theoretical study and numerical experiments are convincing.
