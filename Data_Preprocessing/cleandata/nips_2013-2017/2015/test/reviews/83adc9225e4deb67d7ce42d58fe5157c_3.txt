Summary: The paper presents a novel nonparametric procedure to estimate the structure of a sparse undirected probabilistic graphical model from data. It is based on using kernels to approximate the resulting distribution by an infinite dimensional member of the exponential family, and uses the RKHS representer theorem to reduce the corresponding optimization problem to one that can be efficiently tackled using existing group lasso solvers. It is well written, clearly explained, and utilises at times quite challenging maths to arrive at an elegant solution. The ideas and techniques developed in this paper should be of interest to many researchers in the field of structure learning. Only weakness is evaluation section, which should have included more complex graph structures with weaker edges to give a better indication of performance in practice.
 Quality: Good idea, well executed. All steps in the reduction of the (penalised) score matching objective to the quadratic minimization problem make sense, although I did not check the detailed proofs in the supplementary material, and the abstract parameterisation in (12) is quite difficult to follow.
As stated above, only weakness is the evaluation: the (very sparse) chain graph used in the examples in combination with edge strength \Omega_s = 0.4 (line 359) makes for rather easy structures. As a result the performance in FIg.1 is already very good at N=60 data points to nearly perfect at N=100 ... something that is very a-typical for real-world structure inference problems. I would have preferred to see the method evaluated on more realistic models to get a better impression of the actual performance obtained by the method.
Clarity: Very good: problem + main idea is well described, concepts and formulas are carefully defined, and the paper does in good job in trying to make the overall argument accessible to most readers. For example, section 2.3 was compact but very helpful being less familiar with score matching. However, some of the steps in 3 could still do with a few hints to make it easier to follow.
Originality: The paper obviously builds on many existing results, but as far as I can tell the crucial contribution culminating in Theorem 3.2 is new, elegant, and hopefully very useful.
Significance: Significant addition to state-of-the-art methods in structure inference. I expect it to lead to various new ideas and applications.

The paper presents a kernel based nonparametric procedure to efficiently estimate the structure of sparse undirected probabilistic graphical models from data using existing group lasso solvers.It is highly relevant, well written, and utilises at times quite challenging maths to arrive at an elegant solution: clearly belongs in the conference.
