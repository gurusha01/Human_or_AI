The paper proposes two methods for turning scoring outputs into probabilities as alternatives to methods such as Platt's method and isotonic regression. It is clear and well written, and the authores are in particular applauded for giving information relevant to reproducing the experimental results. The methods proposed are original, and this is a sufficiently widespread problem that any demonstrably improved method is a significant advance. The paper is therefore very suitable for NIPS. I have some reservation regarding the experimental results in that, whereas in figure 1 CVAP seems to attain a clear advantage, the numbers presented in tables 1 and 2 are close enough to be less convincing --- can the authors provide any further justification here? A nice paper, suitable for NIPS.
