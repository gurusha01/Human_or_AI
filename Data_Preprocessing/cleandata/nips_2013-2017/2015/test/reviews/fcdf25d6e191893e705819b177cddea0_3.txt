This paper considers the task of learning the direct causes and effects of a predefined target variable T, instead of the entire causal structure. The algorithm introduced in the paper departs from the Markov blanket, and builds on a few rules that apply over the neighborhood of T so as to discover the directionality of the arrows. It is a clean and interesting paper, and the algorithm is shown to be equivalent to previously established ones (i.e., doesn't miss anything). In fact, the algorithm does not discover any additional arrow than already known results, but it improves on the scalability since only a subset of the variables is the target of the analysis in many real-world scenarios, not the whole graph. This paper considers the problem of learning the direct causes and effects of a predefined target variable T, instead of the entire causal structure.
