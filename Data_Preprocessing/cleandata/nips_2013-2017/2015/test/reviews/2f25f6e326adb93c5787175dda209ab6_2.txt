The authors propose novel upper and lower bounds on the matrix determinant, with applications to bounding the likelihood of a determinantal point process. The main idea is simple, but the paper is well executed and enlightening, and paves the way for several potential improvements.
The authors propose a creative use of the pseudo-inputs to bound functionals of a positive definite kernels. The proposed problem is timely, and will be of interest to several in the community.
Such an approach is quite general with potential applications beyond determinantal point processes. The experimental evaluation is well constructed to elucidate several key points, including failures of a variational approximation under certain conditions. I found the selected application area interesting and highly relevant to the studied problem.
 Minor comments:
- It is unclear why the issue of parameterizing K (instead of L) features so prominently in the abstract and the rest of the paper, as the authors mainly focus on describing the problem, and make no efforts to address it.
 - If accepted, I suggest that the authors prepare a standard supplement, and not just upload an extended version of the paper as the supplement.
Suggestions for future work:
- On the other hand, the discussion of the interpretability of the K parameterization makes such an approach even more appealing. Could the authors consider bounding the determinant directly in terms of the K matrix? What is the scalability of such an approach if using the pseudo-input method?
