Clarity: The paper is overall well written but can be improved. For example, the structure of Section 3 can be improved. See below. Quality and originality : this paper presents some new progress by generalizing some previous results both on sparse recovery[15,20] and trace regression[4,10].
Detailed comments: (1) It is observed in Figure 1 that when the rank of the underlying matrix is high, more measurements are required for achieving good recovery compared with the regularization based approach. This seems to be a limitation of the proposed method, as in practice the rank may not known a priori and the number of measurements is fixed. In this case, how to predict whether the proposed approach is applicable or not? (2) Eqn.(17) presents extensions to the spiked case with diagonal noise term. However, t sigma^2 is required to be known in advance. In the experiments, sigma^2 = 0 is used. No detailed discussion is provided on its estimation. Another related question is whether it can be generalized beyond diagonal noise case? (3) Section 3 presents several experiments and their associated discussions. Subsection can be used to make the structure of this section better.  A regualrization free estimation approach is investigated for trace regression with respect to symmetric positive semidefinite (spd) matrices. The finding is that if the underlying matrix is spd and the measurement matrix satisfies certain conditions, simple least square solution may perform as well as trace regularized solution. The paper presents some new results by generalizing some recent progress on sparse recovery and trace regression.
