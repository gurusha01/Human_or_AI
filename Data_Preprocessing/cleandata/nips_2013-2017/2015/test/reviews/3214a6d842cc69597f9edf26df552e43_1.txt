The paper presents a general method for non-conjugate variational inference based on proximal method and linearisation of the non-conjugate model. This is shown to reduce to natural gradient optimisation for conjugate exponential models. The method is shown to lead to slightly better predictive accuracy than standard approximate inference methods in a few selected problems and data sets.
 Quality
 The method relies on linearisation to handle non-conjugate models. The seems potentially problematic, as previous works have found linearisation to be unreliable in variational inference with non-conjugate models (see e.g. Honkela and Valpola, NIPS 2004). The method is evaluated empirically on a few data sets, and mostly found to perform well. The paper focuses a lot on the positive aspects of the method, and its weaknesses and limitations are not mentioned at all.
 Clarity
 The paper is mostly clearly written and well-organised, but some key details are missing (specifically: what exactly is f_n).
 Originality
 The proposed approach is novel, although it is based on combination of existing techniques from various fields. Use of references is a bit shaky: the good fundamental reference from proximal algorithms seems to be missing and furthermore previous approaches using linearisation with non-conjugate variational inference are not discussed.
 Significance
 As the reliability of the proposed method is questionable, it is difficult to judge the paper's importance until this is resolved.
 Other comments
 1. The last sentence of the abstract contains unsubstantiated advertising: you method is not the best in every way. This must be clarified or deleted.
 2. In Eqs. (2)-(3), what is eta?
 3. In Eq. (3), why is it arg min and not arg max as in Eq. (2)?
 4. As the proposed method seems to be a purely batch algorithm, it is unclear why it cites and links to SVI methods so much. Classic batch VB would seem much more relevant here.
 5. You should clarify what f_n is precisely in the examples you study. Also, the accuracy of the linearisation procedure needs to be checked to make sure you do not suffer from similar problems as illustrated in Fig. 1 of Honkela and Valpola (NIPS 2004) for the Taylor series linearisation.
