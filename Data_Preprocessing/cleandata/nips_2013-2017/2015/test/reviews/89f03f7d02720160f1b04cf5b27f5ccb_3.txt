The paper proposes an algorithm called PEGI which is suitable for the noisy ICA problem. The algorithm is based on a gradient iteration in a pseudo-Euclidian space where the inner product is based on the Hessian of the contrast function (ie. the kurtosis). The authors show that with probability 1 the algorithm extracts the normalized columns of the mixing matrix. Then they show that the extracted mixing matrix estimate can be used to make an SINR-optimal recovery of the sources.
 The disadvantage of the method is that it needs a large number of samples N (in the example of Fig 1a, over 50,000 samples) in order to outperform standard ICA methods such as JADE, FastICA, or 1FICA.
 Moreover, compared to the existing GI-ICA method [21] it is not siginificantly superior for large data sets (Fig 2 shows marginal improvement over GI-ICA for N>50,000).
 The presentation of the paper is quite clear and the proposed method includes originality. Moreover the theoretical results regarding convergence and the optimal SINR reconstruction theorem count towards the positive points of the paper. However, the limitations mentioned above weaken the significance of the method. Perhaps the authors could strengthen it by identifying specific signal or noise settings where PEGI clearly outperforms standard methods like FastICA or JADE. Otherwise it can be yet another run-of-the-mill method within the multitude of methods performing ICA.
  A pseudo-Euclidian space algorithm suitable for noisy ICA. Clearly presented and original. However the performance improvements with respect to existing methods is not very convincing raising the risk of this being yet another ICA method.
