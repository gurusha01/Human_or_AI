In this paper, the authors propose to study the problem of matrix estimation from linear measurements, where the estimated matrix is assumed to be positive semidefinite (PSD). Under certain constraints on the design, the authors show that ordinary least squares regression, with a PSD constraint, achieves good statistical properties.
More precisely, the authors study the problem of recovering a d x d positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix from n linear measurements. They propose to solve this problem by using an ordinary least squares estimator, and by constraining the estimated matrix to be PSD. Contrary to most previous work, this problem is not regularized.
They start by showing that without any assumptions on the design, the estimation error is unbounded if the number of linear measurements n is too small, even if the matrix to recover has low rank.
They then show that a slow rate on the prediction error can be obtained if the design satisfies a condition introduced in the paper. This condition boils down to having a matrix M in the unit ball of the span of the design (M = sum_i ai Xi, |a| < 1), such that M has its smaller eigenvalue bounded away from zero and its condition number bounded from above. It should be noted that this slow rate coincides with the one for nuclear norm regularized estimators, but it requires an additional condition on the design (while the rate for regularized estimators does not require any conditions).
Finally, the authors introduce a bound on the estimation error, in the case where the matrix to be recovered has low rank r. Three quantities, depending on the design, appear in that bound: the restricted eigenvalue, the separability constant and the correlation constant. My biggest concern is that it is not clear how these two last constants scale with n, d and r. In particular, the authors have not shown how these constants scale for any designs, making it hard to compare this bound with previous work. They have only proposed to study those constants numerically, in the supplementary material. It is thus hard for me to understand how the estimation error behaves, and to know for which designs this estimator would be useful.
I also found the paper hard to read and not particularly well written (e.g. I believe that equations corresponding to lines 267, 272 and 284 should be integrated in sentences. Or the lower blocks in the definition of matrix U line 255 do not make sense).
Overall, I think that this paper could be greatly improved. It seems to me that this work is still a bit too preliminary to be accepted to NIPS. In this paper, the authors study the problem of unregularized matrix estimation, where the estimated matrix is positive semidefinite. I believe that this paper is hard to read, and the main bound on the estimation error of low rank matrix depends on quantities which are not studied by the authors (in particular, the scaling of those constants with n, d and r is unknown).
