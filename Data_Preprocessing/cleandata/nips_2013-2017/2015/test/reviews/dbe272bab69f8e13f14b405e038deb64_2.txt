summary: manifold optimization of GMMs
Quality: high (i think, to be determined)
Clarity: high
Originality: seems so to me (though i'm unfamiliar with the manifold optimization literature)
Significance: good good.
i like this paper. my comments are as follows:
1) i don't like tables, and i don't like only seeing means & standard errors, especially for hard optimization problems.
i also don't like seeing only performance times, because i can't tell how well the algorithms performed in terms of the objective.
2) i'd like the benchmarks from UCI to be in the main text. i'd also like to see comparisons with other implementations, eg, if you are using matlab, perhaps the gmmdist set of functions or mixmod, or in R, perhaps mclust.
 3) in general, saying "EM algorithm" as your benchmark it is unclear what implementation you are using, which matters a lot.
for example, setting the convergence criteria differently can make the run time quite different, but the estimates quite similar.
therefore, i'd like to see the following:
(a) two-dimensional contour plots (or some such), showing both time and performance for each of the numerical examples.
 (b) same thing for a set of benchmarks.
(c) some plots showing likelihood (or the surrogate objective) and time as a function of iteration.
one big problem with EM is that often, the loss gets nearly flat, so the last bunch of iterations are useless, and the termination criteria could be set differently to obtain vastly superior performance.
i don't think it matters much what the results are, as long as they are qualitatively consistent with the text. but currently, the manuscript does not provide any evidence that the algorithms actually work.
  developed a modern algorithm for a classic problem, with promising results, however, no accuracy results are provided,nor details of the benchmark algorithms, nor performance vs iteration, so more details are required for proper assessment.
