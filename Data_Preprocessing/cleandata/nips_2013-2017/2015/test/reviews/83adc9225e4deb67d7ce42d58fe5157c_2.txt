This paper learns a nonparametric graphical model via score matching, which effectively bypasses the need to estimate the normalizing constant. Theory and simulations were provided.
Quality: The nonparametric graphical model and the neighborhood estimation method are not entirely new. However,
what is interesting is that the need for computing the normalizing constant is bypassed by using score matching. Parametrized by RKHS, the formulation in (8) is shown to achieve neighborhood selection consistency.
Clarity: The paper is well presented.
Originality and significance: The paper is original in that using score matching, one does not need to evaluate the normalizing constant.  The score matching objective proposed in the paper for learning nonparametric graphical models is free of normalizing constants. This is an interesting idea.
