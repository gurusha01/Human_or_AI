The paper proposes a new framework for spectral regularized embedding, applied to graph transduction. The framework itself, and in particular the benefits for having an orthonormal embedding might be described more convincingly, but this is not a serious issue.
The authors then propose an interesting and elegant algorithm to solve the SEER problem approximately. This is an original contribution and it seems to provide a good alternative to solve the complex learning problem.
 Experimental results tend to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed solution. It would be great to show results that demonstrate the benefits of the SEER framework, or of the orthonormal representation defined by (3) at first, and also to show the approximation accuracy of the IIP solution to the SEER problem. This is not visible in the current results, and it would be of high interest to position the actual contribution in a more global context.
 The multiple graph transduction is unfortunately described at a very high level. It is definitely an interesting extension, but more details, motivation and intuitions are necessary to understand clearly how and why the proposed method is also interesting for multiple graph, and especially to understand how that algorithm is implement in such settings. In the current form, it is difficult to grasp the main ideas in the multiple graph case, and especially to really appreciate the experimental results in this case. In that respect, the last column of Table 4 (noisy case) is not very intuitive - it seems that one graph is better than multiple ones, which would contradict the motivation for dealing with multiple graphs.
 Finally, the paper is not always easy to read and pretty dense at places. It also refers at too many places to the supplementary material. It is probably a sign that the authors wants to give too much information in a single paper, which actually penalises the accessibility and probably visibility of the work.  The paper proposes a new framework, SEER for orthonormal embeddings that is applied to graph transduction. An interesting algorithm based on IIP is proposed to solve the learning problem in SEER, and relatively convincing results are proposed.
