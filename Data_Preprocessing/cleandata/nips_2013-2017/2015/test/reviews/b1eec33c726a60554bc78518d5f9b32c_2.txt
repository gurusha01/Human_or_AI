The paper considers the problem of multi-variable regression. The paper provides analysis of ordinary least squares and the MLE estimators for the problem and provides a characterization of when the MLE estimate is better than the OLS estimator. Further since the MLE estimator is solution to a non-convex optimization problem, for pooled model and the seemingly unrelated regression problems the paper gives finite sample analysis for alternating minimization method that can be efficiently implemented. For these problems matching upper and lower bounds are provided for OSL, MLE and upper bounds for alternative minimization approach. The analysis clearly
points out when the MLE/alternative minimization approach provides improvements for these problems.
Overall the paper is well written and easy to follow. The proofs are straightforward and simple. As far as I checked the proofs seem fine. The analysis for MLE VS that for OSL seems straightforward. What really sells this work is that the theorems are proved for the AM based approach.
 However I do have a few concerns. 1.
The models considered are all well specified models but the applications listed as motivation are more machine learning type problems where well specified assumption is almost never true. The analysis is very heavily dependent on the well specifiedness.
2. The significance of the results is not clear. On the experiments side, synthetic data is used. On the theory side, that alternative minimization (and MLE) yields better performance is clear but how significant is this in terms of applications is not clear. Can you provide concrete examples of applications where the gain is significant.
Seems like for the difference between MLE and OSL to be large enough one needs the dimensionality to be large enough at the very least.
3. Finally the results seem (although only a bit) out of scope for NIPS seems more classical stats econometrics type work.
Overall I would like to see the paper accepted if there is space at NIPS. The results are certainly interesting but the significance of the results especially w.r.t. scope of NIPS is not clear.
