This paper concerns learning direct causes and effects of a target variables using local learning. This paper extends existing local learning methods by taking account larger neighbourhoods and the presented method is therefore able to infer more causal relations than the previous methods. The problem is relevant and the contributions are worthwhile.
 Overall, technical presentation is sloppy.
What is the definition of an "unshielded parent"? What is the definition of a "set of three-fork parents"? What is the definition of a "sound and complete MB discovery algorithm"?
Theorems 2 and 3 do not contain all necessary assumptions. In the proof of Theorem 2, causal sufficiency is used. However, it was not assumed in the theorem. One also need to
assume that conditional independence tests return always correct results (or infinite data or some other similar assumption). Also it is unclear to me why it isn't necessary that the distribution is faithful to any DAG?
099: Markov condition tells that a node is independent of its non-descendants given its parents, Causal Markov condition tells that a node is independent of its non-effects given its direct causes.
125, 227: R\(S\T) is usually different than (R\S)\T, so if you have two set differences in a row it is good to use parenthesis to avoid any misinterpretations.
133-135: Why is this a reasonable belief? We know that, if one uses only conditional independence tests, structures can be identified only up to a Markov equivalence class.
293: the PC set of a MB -> the PC set of a target
The experiments could be strengthened by adding a standard Markov blanket discovery algorithm (where you learn only the directions of arcs which are part of v-structures) as a baseline to see how much the new rules help.
The evaluation of the efficiency of different algorithms seems to give an unfair advantage to the CMB algorithm. The efficiency is measured in terms of the number of conditional tests and the number of MB discovery algorithms are invoked. The problem is that MB discovery algorithms typically use conditional independence tests to find MBs and not counting the conditional independence tests inside a call of an MB discovery algorithm favours algorithms that use such subroutines. One thing that could make evaluation more fair would be to add also the actual running times of different algorithms. An interesting topic and a worthy contribution. However, technical representation should be improved.
