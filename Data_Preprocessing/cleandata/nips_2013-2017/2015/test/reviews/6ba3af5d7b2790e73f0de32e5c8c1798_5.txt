This paper is nice to read.
The idea is clear, the implementation looks sound, and the results are good.
I also appreciate that the authors take a moment to highlight limitations (Section 4.1), and that they give both quantitative and qualitative analyses, as well as suggesting hypotheses.
Clearly a lot of work went into this paper, and the analysis seems good and fair.
The authors do not just consider how to do something (generative model), but also why (exploration), and then test this.
The main drawback is that the results on usefulness are a bit inconclusive, and the ultimate general impact of this line of work is a bit unclear. This is a nice empirical paper about using generative models to hallucinate futures in Atari games. The (empirical, quantitative and qualitative) analyses of the results are nice and comprehensive.
