This paper combines a generative and a discriminative approach to achieve state-of-the-art image restoration system with two orders of magnitude faster computation.
 The idea of combining an unsupervised generative front panel, and then to use a linear combinations of the activated "primitives" is very old (a citation of Hertz, Krogh & Palmer 1991 or some earlier reference would be nice), but the particular formulation of the problem is new. The paper uses straightforward components and standard denoising measures to validate the results. I would have liked to see some analyses that show the extent to which the
new gating network is inferior to the original one or some deeper analysis of what has changed due to the net gating. A straightforward implementation of an old idea with respectable results.
