I think that the main issue of the manuscript is a lack of awareness of the literature on the topic. The authors' algorithm is strongly related to the Monte Carlo EM algorithm (and in fact the general class of stochastic approximation algorithms with markovian dynamic which have been proposed in various forms to optimize intractable likelihood functions). There is a well developed literature on the topic and the authors should compare what they have been doing to existing work. A theory which includes some of the authors' results already exists and covers much more general scenarios. For example the Markov chains are not required to be uniformly ergodic and there is no need to reinitialise the Markov chain at a fixed distribution r at each iteration (the authors acknowledge that they do this in order to simplify their analysis, but this is not sufficient--in addition reinitializing with the previous sample may be a better idea, as discussed at the end of the manuscript, and these algorithms have also been extensively analysed previously). The presentation of the results is far from optimal : for example for Theorem 1 and 2 it is not clear what the assumptions are? One can refer to the text before and after, but the reader should not have to do that. Note also that there is no need for the strong assumptions used in order to develop results such as those of Theorem 6 (see for example Benveniste, Metivier and Priouret for more general results). I think that the authors lack awareness of the literature and the results are only marginally novel.
