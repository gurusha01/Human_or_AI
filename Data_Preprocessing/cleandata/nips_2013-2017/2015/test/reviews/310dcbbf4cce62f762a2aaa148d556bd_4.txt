Since this is a short review, I only ask one question: what is the reason that boundary cases have to be analyzed differently? It doesn't seem that rho = q_j appears anyhow special, especially for j > 1. This paper analyzes contextual bandits against a stronger baseline: one that uses adaptive linear programming to decide to pass on certain percent of suboptimal rounds (what the authors call budget). It has interesting setup and unique solutions.
