This paper tackles the very significant problem of converting arbitrary class membership scores into well-calibrated probabilities.
 It appears to provide a very useful technique that works well.
 The paper covers both theory and algorithmic issues.
 It is well written and easy to follow. Extends isotonic regression by using cross validation to generate multiple scoring sets and combining the scores generated on each.
