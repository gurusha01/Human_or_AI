This paper extends a recently proposed noisy ICA method called GI-ICA. The new method called PEGI may avoid the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step necessary in GI-ICA. The authors also give a general optimality result related to source recovery in noisy ICA.
 Overall, the paper is well written with high technical quality. The method (PEGI) is a reasonable and relevant extension of GI-ICA, and the result shows the method works reasonably. However most materials in Section 2 are from the GI-ICA paper and the modification to GI-ICA is relatively straightforward. In this regard, the contribution of this paper itself may be limited.
The additional optimality result (Section 3) is interesting in its own right but it looks quite fundamental so I'm skeptical about the novelty. At least a similar result can be found in: A. F. Naguib, "Adaptive Antennas for CDMA Wireless Network," Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA, 1996. (Chap.3), which seems to be an oft-cited reference related to beamforming. I'm also wondering how it could be related to source recovery based on MAP estimation, which is popularly used in probabilistic noisy ICA methods.
The presentation of the method needs some improvements in some specific points. First, at the first reading it was unclear to me how the gradient and hessian of kurtosis (eqs. 1 and 2) could be estimated from data. I found the detail in the GI-ICA paper [21] but the present paper should also describe or appropriately refer to the existing result. Second, it was difficult to figure out why the quasi-orthogonalization is problematic while PEGI is not, even though they both rely on the same matrix C. Some more detailed explanation on this point should be necessary to show the advantage (and motivation) of the new method more clearly.
 The method is reasonable and relevant extension of previously proposed GI-ICA method while the contribution of this paper itself seems relatively limited. The presentation should be improved in some specific points.
