This paper considers a contextual bandit problem with budget constraint B and known time horizon T. For each trial, the agent observes a context j chosen according to a fixed probability distribution \pi over a context set {1,..,J} and takes an action k from {0} \cup {1,..,K}, where 0 means "skip". If k = 0, then the agents gets no reward and incurs no cost. If k > 0, then the agent gets reward y and incurs cost c{j,k}, where y is chosen according to a fixed probability distribution over [0,1] which depends on j and k, and c{j,k} > 0 is a parameter known to the agent. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward under the condition that the cumulative cost never exceeds the budget B.
The main body of the paper is devoted to a special case where \pi is known and c{j,k} = 1 for all j and k, and the paper gives an algorithm whose regret bound is O(log T) under a mild condition. The paper extends the algorithm to the general case where \pi is unknown and c{j,k}'s are arbitrary.
A more general setting is considered in [16], but it gives an algorithm with O(\sqrt T) regret. So the paper is possibly the first work with O(log T) regret, although the mild condition should be satisfied. The algorithm is based on an approximation algorithm for computing the optimal action sequence when all the statistics are known. The algorithm is simple but very interesting.
The paper is well motivated and very clearly written. It would be more interesting and significant if O(log T) regret always holds, otherwise \Omega(\sqrt T) lower bound is proved in the boundary cases.
All the results seems to be based on Lemma 1, but I'm not convinced of its correctness. I do not think the optimal action sequence always satisfies (2) for all trials, and so I do not understand why the average constraint is a relaxed version of the hard constraint. Please give a brief explanation. ==> Now I'm convinced of Lemma 1 by the rebuttal. Thanks
Minor comments: Is it NP-hard to exactly obtain the optimal action sequence? Can the results be generalized to the case where T is unknown? Can we assume u^1 > u^2 > ... > u^*_J
without loss of generality even for the unknown context distribution case?  I strongly recommend this paper for acceptance.
