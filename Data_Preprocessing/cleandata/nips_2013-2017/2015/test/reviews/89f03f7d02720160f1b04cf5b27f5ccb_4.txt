This paper deals with the problem of noisy ICA and proposes an extension of the Gradient-Iteration (GI) ICA algorithm proposed by Voss et al. Since the conventional GI-ICA algorithm is based on an assumption that the columns of A are orthogonal, it requires a rather complicated preprocessing step called the quasi-orthogonalization to linearly transform the data to make columns of A orthogonal. The key innovation of the proposed method is to sidestep this process by formulating the signal recovery problem as a fixed point method in an indefinite inner product (pseudo-Euclidean) space.
Although a line of the ICA research is well introduced in Section 1, the research on underdetermined blind signal separation (BSS) should also be briefly mentioned. By appending one column and one row in A and S, the noisy ICA model X = AS + n can be equivalently rewritten in the form X = A'S' where A' and S' denote the appended matrices. Practically, existing methods for underdetermined BSS can also be used to solve the signal recovery problem under this setting where the noise is treated as a source. In this regard, literature on underdetermined BSS are also somewhat relevant to this work, which I think should not be completely disregarded.
This paper seems to reuse many sentences from the following manuscript, which can downloaded from the internet: J. Voss, M. Belkin, L. Rademacher, "Optimal Recovery in Noisy ICA," 2015. To avoid any risk of being accused of plagiarism or self-plagiarism, I suggest the authors avoid using exactly the same sentences as much as possible.
It should be mentioned somewhere that $^\dagger$ denotes the pseudo-inverse.
A concluding section is missing. Please include it in the resubmitted version.
