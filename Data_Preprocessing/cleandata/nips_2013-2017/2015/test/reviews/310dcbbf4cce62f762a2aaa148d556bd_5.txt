This paper considers a fairly simple budget constrained cb problem with discrete contexts and actions. The main contribution is the computational efficiency of the algorithm (via LP approximation) and the log(T) regret bound it achieves.
 This paper is very well written and easy to follow.
 Suggestions: in future work, consider using a parametric model for the reward. This is useful when the number of contexts is large. In section 4.1, when combining UCB with ALP, be more clear about the rationale using in the UCB-ALP algorithm. For example, I think you are following the optimism in the face of uncertainty. It's probably equivalent to the policy update in UCRL2. It'll be great to include some numerical experiments in extended version of the paper.
