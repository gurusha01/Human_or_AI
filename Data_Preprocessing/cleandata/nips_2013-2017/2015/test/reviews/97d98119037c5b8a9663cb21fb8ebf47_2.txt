The authors derive a theorem that can be used to evaluate with high probability a bound on either the cost of a particular policy, or the degree to which it will violate given constraints. The authors suggest that this might serve as a useful way to determine convergence of policy search methods, and present experiments on simulated robot navigation using RWR as the policy optimization methods.
Overall, I found the idea of deriving such a bound to be quite intriguing, and the experimental results seem moderately realistic and quite convincing. I think this work has potential for interesting followup and will be interesting to many people. An interesting analysis of policy search that shows bounds on cost or on violation of specific constraints, providing a practical way for determining convergence. Beyond the theoretical elegance, this idea could be quite useful in practice, as demonstrated by the experiments.
