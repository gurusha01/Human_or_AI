The paper proposes approximate inference techniques for determinantal point process (DPP) that do not require spectral knowledge of the kernel defining the DPP. Instead, inducing inputs are utilized to bound the likelihood, which reduces the computational cost. Both variational inference and approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are described and their efficiency is demonstrated empirically.
 I believe there is merit to this paper, however I found the method description rather rough and empirical evaluation not thorough enough. A few points that may help clarify:
 1) How does the computational complexity and overall compute time of the two proposed methods compare?
2) How do the proposed methods compare to other alternatives, both approximate and exact, in terms of quality of approximation and computation time?
3) Empirical results on the toy data in Section 5.1 show that parameter estimation error using variational inference is too large, and resorts to approximate MCMC instead. In what settings does the proposed variational inference expected to work and when is it expected to fail? Why?
4) A 13-point sample is generated for the toy example. How do the methods perform when the inducing inputs are actually these sampled points?
5) Is there a rule of thumb to follow when selecting a) the number of inducing points, b) placing the initial inducing points?
Minor comments:
The matrices K and L are referred to throughout the introduction without explaining what they are. Briefly mentioning the marginal kernel and L-ensembles may make it easier to follow for an uninformed reader.
 There is discussion about the advantages of directly learning the marginal kernel parameters throughout the paper, but this is not the approach taken. I believe some of it could be cut back since it does not contribute to the rest of the paper.

If accepted, I strongly encourage the authors to improve the write-up.
