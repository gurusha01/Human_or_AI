(Light Review)
The paper considers contextual bandits with budget and time constraints. The analysis is restricted to finite discrete contexts, fixed costs and a single budget constraint. While the setting is simplified, these assumptions are still reasonable in practice. Importantly, it results in algorithms that achieve O(log T) regret by introducing the adaptive linear programming approximation of the oracle.
The paper is clear and well documented. Relevant work is cited and motivation is explicit. This is a solid theoretical paper. The practical aspects are only briefly discussed in Section 5 and 6 and no experimental results are provided. This being said, the contributions are significant: as far as I know, the authors are the first to obtain logarithmic regret in the case of constrained contextual bandits. The proofs are convincing (although I did not check them all in full detail). This is a good paper, making appropriate simplified assumptions to obtain O(log T) regret algorithms. The practical aspects might be discussed into more detail.
