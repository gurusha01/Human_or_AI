Pros: 1) Analyzing iterative stochastic policy optimization is an interesting problem. 2) The experiments are reasonably fine.
Cons: 1) The current analysis is limited to providing an upper bound for the policy evaluation. The paper does not provide an algorithm that actually uses this upper bound. The analysis is half-complete as it does not consider how the combination of both steps should work together.
2) The analysis is more or less standard and is not a significant theoretical contribution on its own. 3) The tightness of the oracle-like upper bound is not very clear. Is \hat{J}_alpha small enough, for any choice of alpha, that the upper bound based on it is meaningful? See comments.
