A framework for regularized EM algorithms is proposed and analyzed. The motivation of the regularization is to allow for estimation in high dimensional settings under structural assumptions, where unconstrained estimation is statistically impossible and where ordinary EM may not even be well defined. Key is a regularized EM algorithm, where the ordinary M step is replaced by maximizing the Q function minus a regularizer on the model parameter, scaled by a regularization coefficient.
This is a refinement of previous work along similar lines. The novel contributions are as follows. First, the previous work only considered sparsity as the structural assumption, whereas the present paper allows for more general regularizers, which in particular apply to sparse and low rank structures. The assumptions on the statistical properties of the estimator of the Q function are changed in accordance to this more general regularization framework. Second, a specific choice of the regularization coefficient is given, which is updated at each iteration, and which properly controls the optimization error in relation to the statistical estimation error.
It would be helpful to provide some discussion or examples of the decomposability condition, the subspace compatibility constant, the norm ||_{R^*} (which is used in the key statistical condition 5), and the set C(S,\bar S, R). This contribution generalizes and refines previous work on EM algorithms in high dimensions under structural assumptions. The novel results are significant for practical applicability of the theory.
