Sample Complexity Bounds for Iterative Stochastic Policy Optimization presents a method to provide bounds for the excution cost of a policy given the excution costs of a previous policy. The bounds are computed and compared to the empirical estimate for a simple robot domain and an arial robot domain. The bounds were found for estimated costs of a policy and the probability of a crash and these bounds were found to be close to the emperical results.
 The quality of the paper was nice, and the explanations clear. It would have been nice to see the effect of changing starting policies for the convergence of expected costs. The work seems original. Testing on more standard problems like grid world or cart pole would have been more helpful to compare against. The work would be significant if PAC like bounds can be directly achieved.
 This work looks at computing bounds on robustness of descision making specifically for trajectory learning. This allows to compare performance of policy learning algorithms or the policy currently learned with respect to costs of the policy. The idea seems important for domains where emperical testing of policies can be expensive.
