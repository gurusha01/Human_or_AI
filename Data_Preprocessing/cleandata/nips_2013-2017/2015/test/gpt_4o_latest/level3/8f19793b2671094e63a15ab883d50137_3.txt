This paper explores trace regression models with a focus on symmetric positive semidefinite (spd) matrices, challenging the conventional reliance on nuclear norm regularization. The authors argue that, under specific design conditions, constrained least squares estimation can achieve comparable performance to regularization-based methods without requiring tuning parameters. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it simplifies estimation in scenarios where the spd constraint is applicable. The paper builds on prior work in sparse recovery, matrix completion, and compressed sensing, generalizing results to the spd setting and providing theoretical and empirical evidence for its claims.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Quality: The paper generalizes existing results on sparse recovery and trace regression, offering a novel perspective on regularization-free estimation for spd matrices. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the authors provide bounds on prediction and estimation errors, which are well-supported by mathematical derivations.
2. Significance: The work addresses a relevant problem in high-dimensional statistical inference and machine learning. The findings could inspire further research on regularization-free methods and their applicability in practical scenarios, particularly for spd matrices in covariance estimation and kernel-based learning.
3. Experimental Findings: The empirical results are thorough, comparing the proposed method to regularization-based approaches under various settings. The experiments demonstrate that constrained least squares can perform competitively, particularly for low-rank spd matrices, and highlight its simplicity in avoiding parameter tuning.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, the structure of Section 3 (Numerical Results) could be improved by introducing subsections to separate experimental setups, results, and discussions. This would enhance readability and help the reader navigate the dense content.
2. Limitations of the Method: The requirement for more measurements when dealing with high-rank matrices raises concerns about the method's applicability in scenarios where the rank is unknown or measurements are fixed. This limitation is acknowledged but not thoroughly addressed.
3. Noise Term Estimation: The method assumes prior knowledge of the noise variance (σ²), but the paper does not discuss how this parameter could be estimated in practice or generalized beyond diagonal noise. This omission limits the method's practical utility.
4. Experimental Observations: The authors note that simple least squares solutions can perform as well as trace-regularized solutions under specific conditions for spd matrices. However, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of these conditions and their practical implications.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a novel and technically sound contribution to trace regression and spd matrix estimation.
- The theoretical and experimental results are compelling and advance the state of the art in regularization-free methods.
- The work is relevant to the NIPS community, addressing topics in high-dimensional inference and optimization.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The practical applicability of the method is limited by its dependence on prior knowledge of σ² and the number of measurements required for high-rank matrices.
- The clarity of certain sections, particularly the experimental results, could be improved.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a valuable contribution to the field, but addressing the clarity issues and practical limitations would strengthen its impact.
