This paper addresses the computational challenges of weight learning in high-treewidth Markov networks by proposing a theoretical framework that guarantees convergence under specific conditions. The authors focus on the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for approximating gradients during maximum likelihood learning and demonstrate that if MCMC mixes rapidly, the learning algorithm becomes a Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS). Separate bounds are derived for unregularized (convex) and ridge-regularized (non-convex) cases, providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by formalizing conditions under which MCMC-based weight learning can be computationally efficient. The distinction between convex and strongly convex cases is well-articulated, and the results are supported by rigorous proofs.
2. Novelty: The concept of constraining parameters to a "fast-mixing set" is a novel approach that extends beyond traditional tree-structured or variational methods. This generalization to exponential families with bounded sufficient statistics is an important advancement.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically organized, with clear definitions and proof sketches that provide intuition behind the results. The inclusion of an example (Ising model) helps illustrate the theoretical findings.
4. Broader Applicability: While motivated by graphical models, the results apply to any exponential family, broadening the scope of the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Relevance: The theoretical results rely on assumptions (e.g., fast mixing and parameter constraints) that are difficult to verify or enforce in practice. This limits the immediate applicability of the proposed framework to real-world problems.
2. Parameter Constraints: The paper does not explore whether the fast-mixing constraints can be enforced artificially without over-regularizing the model. This is a critical gap, as combining these constraints with ridge regularization may lead to suboptimal solutions.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks substantial empirical validation to demonstrate the practical utility of the theoretical results. The single example provided is illustrative but insufficient to assess the broader impact.
4. Projection Complexity: While the paper acknowledges that projection onto the fast-mixing set may be computationally expensive, this aspect is not analyzed in detail. For large-scale models, this could become a bottleneck.
Recommendation:
While the paper provides valuable theoretical insights, its practical relevance is limited by the difficulty of satisfying the required assumptions in real-world scenarios. The authors should consider exploring methods to enforce fast-mixing constraints and provide empirical evidence to support their claims. Additionally, a deeper analysis of projection complexity would strengthen the work. Overall, the paper is a solid theoretical contribution but requires further development to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical foundation with rigorous proofs.
- Novel approach to addressing intractability in high-treewidth models.
- Clear and well-organized presentation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited practical applicability due to restrictive assumptions.
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Insufficient exploration of projection complexity and its impact.
Final Decision: Weak Accept (assuming the conference prioritizes theoretical contributions).
