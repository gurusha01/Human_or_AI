The paper presents a novel framework for regularized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms tailored for high-dimensional settings, addressing a critical gap in the literature. By replacing the traditional M-step with a regularized variant, the proposed approach ensures stability and convergence when the number of parameters exceeds the sample size, under structural assumptions such as sparsity or low-rank constraints. The authors generalize previous work by incorporating a broader class of regularizers and introduce an iterative update mechanism for the regularization coefficient to balance optimization and statistical estimation errors. The framework is validated through applications to sparse Gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with missing covariates, achieving min-max optimal rates of convergence.
Strengths
1. Technical Innovation: The paper introduces a unified and theoretically grounded approach to regularizing EM algorithms in high-dimensional settings. The iterative update for the regularization coefficient is particularly novel and addresses a key challenge in balancing optimization and statistical errors.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The authors provide rigorous statistical guarantees for their method, including conditions for convergence and bounds on the estimation error. The results are supported by a detailed analysis of decomposable regularizers and statistical error characterizations.
3. Generality and Applicability: The framework is versatile, accommodating various structural assumptions (e.g., sparsity, low-rank matrices) and extending to multiple latent variable models. This broad applicability enhances its practical relevance.
4. Comparison to Prior Work: The paper clearly differentiates itself from existing methods, such as truncated M-steps and low-dimensional EM approaches, by addressing their limitations in high-dimensional regimes.
5. Empirical Validation: Simulations demonstrate the convergence and statistical rates of the proposed algorithm, aligning well with the theoretical results.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with high-dimensional statistics or regularization techniques. Key concepts like the decomposability condition and subspace compatibility constant could benefit from additional explanation or illustrative examples.
2. Practical Implementation: The requirement for resampling in the theoretical analysis may limit the practical applicability of the method. Although the authors suggest this is unnecessary in practice, further empirical evidence or discussion on this point would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Discussion of Trade-offs: The paper could better address the trade-offs between computational complexity and statistical performance, particularly in large-scale applications.
4. Examples and Intuition: While the theoretical framework is applied to specific models, the examples lack intuitive explanations or real-world scenarios that would make the results more accessible to practitioners.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending the EM algorithm to high-dimensional settings with structural assumptions.
