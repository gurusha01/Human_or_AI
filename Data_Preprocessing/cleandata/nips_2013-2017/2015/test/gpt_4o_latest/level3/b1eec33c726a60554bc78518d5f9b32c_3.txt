This paper addresses regression problems with multiple vector-valued outputs that are related by shared attributes, such as noise or coefficient vectors. The authors study two specific models: the pooled model, which assumes a shared coefficient vector, and the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model, which assumes a shared noise vector. The paper demonstrates that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) outperforms ordinary least squares (OLS) in these settings, but solving the MLE involves a challenging non-convex optimization problem. To address this, the authors analyze the performance of Alternating Minimization (Alt-Min) and show that it achieves results within universal constant factors of MLE under these models. 
Strengths:  
The paper provides a compelling theoretical analysis of Alt-Min, a widely used optimization technique, in the context of regression problems with vector-valued outputs. The result that Alt-Min performs within constant factors of MLE is both theoretically interesting and practically relevant, as it offers a computationally feasible alternative to solving the non-convex MLE problem. The authors also highlight the limitations of OLS in these settings, which is an important contribution to understanding regression methods for complex output structures. The theoretical results are rigorous and well-supported, and the paper raises an interesting question about the logarithmic factor in Theorem 1 and its connection to fresh sample usage, which could inspire further research.
Weaknesses:  
The models considered in the paper, while mathematically elegant, are somewhat restrictive. The pooled model and SUR model assume specific shared attributes (coefficient or noise vectors), which may not generalize well to more complex or realistic scenarios. The paper would benefit from a discussion of how Alt-Min performs under more generic conditions or less restrictive assumptions. Additionally, while the theoretical contributions are strong, the lack of application to real-world data limits the practical significance of the work. Empirical validation on real datasets would strengthen the paper and demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods in practice. 
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of Alt-Min in a novel context, advancing our understanding of optimization techniques for regression problems with vector-valued outputs.  
- Con: The restrictive nature of the models and the absence of empirical validation reduce the practical impact of the work.  
Conclusion:  
This paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution to the study of regression problems with vector-valued outputs and the performance of Alt-Min. However, its practical relevance would be enhanced by exploring more general models and applying the results to real-world data. I recommend acceptance with the suggestion to address these limitations in future work.
