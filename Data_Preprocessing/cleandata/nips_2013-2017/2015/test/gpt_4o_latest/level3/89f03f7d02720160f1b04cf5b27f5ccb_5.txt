The paper introduces PEGI, a novel algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise, which eliminates the need for the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step required by GI-ICA. PEGI operates in a pseudo-Euclidean space, leveraging a fixed-point iteration approach for source recovery. Additionally, the paper presents an analysis of SINR-optimal demixing, demonstrating that SINR-optimal recovery is invariant to signal/noise decomposition and can be achieved using PEGI. Experimental results show that PEGI outperforms existing noisy ICA algorithms, particularly in sample efficiency and SINR-optimal recovery.
Strengths
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound and well-written, with clear explanations of the PEGI algorithm and its theoretical underpinnings. The authors provide rigorous mathematical formulations and convergence guarantees for PEGI.
2. Efficiency and Practicality: By avoiding quasi-orthogonalization, PEGI addresses a significant limitation of GI-ICA, improving numerical stability and reducing computational complexity.
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate PEGI's superiority over existing methods, particularly in achieving SINR-optimal recovery with fewer samples.
4. Relevance: The problem of noisy ICA is important in applications such as signal processing and neuroscience, making the method relevant to the community.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Novelty: While PEGI simplifies GI-ICA, the modifications are relatively straightforward, and much of Section 2 relies heavily on prior work. This reduces the originality of the contribution.
2. Questionable Novelty of Optimality Result: The SINR-optimal recovery result, while fundamental, appears similar to prior work in the array sensor systems literature. The authors do not adequately differentiate their contribution from existing results.
3. Clarity Issues: The estimation of the gradient and Hessian of kurtosis is not clearly explained, and the reasoning behind PEGI's ability to avoid quasi-orthogonalization issues is insufficiently detailed.
4. Connection to MAP Methods: The relationship between the SINR-optimal recovery result and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)-based noisy ICA methods is unclear, leaving a gap in the theoretical narrative.
5. Dependence on GI-ICA: The heavy reliance on GI-ICA for the foundational material in Section 2 reduces the paper's standalone value.
Recommendation
While PEGI is a relevant and technically solid contribution, the limited novelty and clarity issues weaken its impact. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the novelty of the SINR-optimal recovery result and a clearer explanation of PEGI's technical innovations. Additionally, the connection to MAP-based methods should be clarified to strengthen the theoretical contribution.
Arguments for Acceptance
- PEGI addresses a practical limitation of GI-ICA, improving computational efficiency and stability.
- The experimental results are strong and demonstrate PEGI's utility in noisy ICA scenarios.
- The SINR-optimal recovery result is fundamental and could inspire further research.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The modifications to GI-ICA are incremental, and the paper relies heavily on prior work, reducing its originality.
- The novelty of the SINR-optimal recovery result is questionable, given its similarity to existing literature.
- Clarity issues in key sections hinder the paper's accessibility and reproducibility.
Final Decision
Weak Accept: The paper makes a meaningful contribution to noisy ICA, but its impact is limited by incremental novelty and presentation issues. Improvements in clarity and a stronger emphasis on originality would enhance its value.
