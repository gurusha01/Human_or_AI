The paper addresses the important problem of learning the structure of probabilistic graphical models without restrictive parametric assumptions, proposing a novel nonparametric approach based on infinite-dimensional exponential families and score matching. This is a significant contribution as it expands the applicability of graphical model learning to broader settings where parametric assumptions may not hold.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its innovative estimation approach, which avoids the computationally expensive log partition function by leveraging score matching. The use of group lasso solvers for optimization is practical and aligns well with existing tools in the field. Furthermore, the authors provide a theoretical consistency analysis of the sparse structure recovery using the primal-witness approach, which is a strong point of the paper. The empirical results, particularly the comparison with glasso and nonparanormal methods, demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in both parametric and nonparametric settings.
However, the paper has several weaknesses that limit its impact. First, the writing quality is poor, with insufficient clarity and organization, making it difficult for readers to follow the technical details and reproduce the results. The paper also lacks a comprehensive review of related work on score matching and its applications, which would help contextualize the contribution. Furthermore, the relationship with prior work, particularly [28], is not adequately discussed, raising concerns about the novelty of the contribution. The heavy reliance on [28] without clearly articulating what is new in this work further exacerbates these concerns.
Another significant limitation is the lack of comparisons with existing approaches. While the authors compare their method with glasso and nonparanormal methods in simulations, they do not provide a broader technical comparison with other nonparametric or semi-parametric methods. Additionally, the non-asymptotic rates of convergence appear worse than those in parametric or semi-parametric settings, which raises questions about the method's utility in finite-sample scenarios. The algorithm is also restricted to the l1 norm, and the feasibility of extending it to other regularizers is unclear.
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an interesting and challenging problem and proposes a novel approach, its poor writing, lack of comprehensive comparisons, and unclear novelty significantly detract from its impact. Strengths include the theoretical guarantees and practical optimization strategy, but weaknesses such as limited empirical evaluation and unclear practical utility must be addressed. I recommend major revisions before considering acceptance. 
Pros: Novel nonparametric approach, avoids log partition computation, theoretical guarantees, practical optimization.  
Cons: Poor writing, unclear novelty, limited comparisons, worse non-asymptotic rates, restricted algorithm flexibility.
