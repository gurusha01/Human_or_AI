The paper introduces PEGI (pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), a novel algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. It addresses limitations in existing noisy ICA algorithms, particularly the Gradient-Iteration (GI) ICA by Voss et al., by eliminating the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step. PEGI reformulates the signal recovery problem in a pseudo-Euclidean space, simplifying the algorithm and improving its robustness. The paper also combines PEGI with SINR-optimal demixing, providing a complete framework for optimal signal recovery in noisy ICA. Experimental results demonstrate that PEGI outperforms existing algorithms in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing a key limitation of GI-ICA. Reformulating the problem in a pseudo-Euclidean space is both elegant and practical, resolving numerical issues associated with quasi-orthogonalization.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the PEGI algorithm, its theoretical guarantees, and its experimental validation. The use of pseudo-Euclidean inner products is well-motivated and effectively explained.
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results convincingly show that PEGI achieves superior performance compared to existing algorithms, particularly in the medium sample regime. The SINR-optimal recovery results are especially compelling.
4. Significance: The work advances the state of the art in noisy ICA, a challenging and important problem in signal processing. The proposed method has potential applications in fields like speech separation and biomedical signal analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Underdetermined BSS: While the paper focuses on fully determined noisy ICA, it does not sufficiently acknowledge the connection to underdetermined blind signal separation (BSS) methods. This omission weakens the broader context of the work.
2. Plagiarism Concerns: The reuse of sentences from a 2015 manuscript by Voss et al. raises ethical concerns. The authors should clarify whether this constitutes self-plagiarism and, if so, appropriately cite and rephrase the reused content.
3. Notation and Clarity: The notation for the pseudo-inverse ($^\dagger$) is not explicitly explained, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the concept. This should be addressed in a revision.
4. Missing Conclusion: The paper lacks a concluding section, which would help summarize the contributions, limitations, and future directions.
Recommendations:
- Pro Acceptance: The paper is technically sound, introduces a novel and impactful algorithm, and demonstrates strong experimental results. It is a valuable contribution to the field of noisy ICA.
- Con Acceptance: Ethical concerns regarding potential plagiarism and the lack of discussion on underdetermined BSS should be addressed before publication.
Final Rating:
- Quality: Very Good. The technical content is rigorous and well-supported by theory and experiments.
- Clarity: Excellent. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, though minor improvements in notation and structure are needed.
- Originality: Good. While the problem is not new, the proposed approach is innovative and addresses key limitations of prior work.
- Significance: Good. The results are important and likely to influence future research in noisy ICA.
In summary, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses, particularly the plagiarism concerns and the lack of a concluding section.
