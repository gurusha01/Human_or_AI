This paper addresses the challenge of performing maximum likelihood learning in high-treewidth undirected graphical models by introducing a novel framework that leverages "fast-mixing parameters" to ensure efficient convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for gradient descent optimization within this framework, demonstrating that the algorithm achieves Îµ-accurate solutions with polynomial computational effort. The results are presented for both regularized (strongly convex) and unregularized (convex) cases, offering convergence rate bounds in terms of mixing times. This work fills a gap in the literature by providing a rigorous analysis of learning intractable models using MCMC under fast-mixing constraints.
Strengths
1. Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical analysis supporting its claims. The convergence rate bounds are meaningful and provide valuable insights into the computational complexity of learning under fast-mixing constraints. The distinction between regularized and unregularized cases is well-articulated, and the analysis is thorough.
2. Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with detailed explanations of key concepts such as mixing times, fast-mixing parameter sets, and the relationship between gradient descent and MCMC. The inclusion of proof sketches enhances accessibility for readers.
3. Originality: The problem framing and theoretical contributions are original. Unlike prior work that focuses on tree-structured models or heuristic penalties for fast mixing, this paper introduces a new tractable set based on mixing times and provides formal guarantees for learning within this set.
4. Significance: The paper addresses an important problem in the field of probabilistic modeling and inference, offering a framework that could inspire future research on learning intractable models. The theoretical guarantees provided are likely to influence both theoretical and practical advancements in the use of MCMC for learning.
Weaknesses
1. Interpretability of Theorem 7: While the lower bound in Theorem 7 is an important theoretical result, it is difficult to interpret and lacks sufficient discussion. The authors should elaborate on its implications and provide more intuition for its practical relevance.
2. Significance and Impact: Although the paper fills a gap in the literature, its broader significance could be better articulated. For instance, the authors could discuss potential applications, extensions to hidden variable models, or integration with existing MCMC-based learning methods like contrastive divergence.
3. Practical Considerations: The paper acknowledges that the theoretical bounds are conservative, as demonstrated in the example. However, it does not sufficiently explore how these bounds translate to real-world scenarios or how the framework compares to heuristic approaches in practice.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and inference. However, the authors should address the interpretability of Theorem 7 and expand the discussion on the potential impact and practical implications of their work.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees for an important and challenging problem.
- The framework is novel and fills a clear gap in the literature.
- The results are general and applicable to a wide range of exponential family models.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Theorem 7's lower bound is hard to interpret and requires further discussion.
- The practical significance of the theoretical results is not fully explored.
In summary, this paper is a strong theoretical contribution that is well-suited for the conference, but it would benefit from additional discussion on interpretability and practical impact.
