This paper addresses the problem of robustness analysis in iterative stochastic policy optimization, focusing on deriving probabilistic bounds for expected cost and constraint violations. By leveraging concentration-of-measure inequalities, the authors propose a novel inequality bound that accounts for unbounded likelihood ratios arising from iterative policy adaptation. The paper illustrates its approach with a simple robot control scenario and extends it to an aerial vehicle navigation problem, providing insights into practical applications.
Strengths:
1. Interesting Problem: The paper tackles an important and challenging problem in decision-making under uncertainty, particularly relevant to reinforcement learning and robotics. The focus on deriving high-confidence bounds for iterative policy optimization is both timely and impactful.
2. Satisfactory Experiments: The experimental evaluation, though limited in scope, demonstrates the applicability of the proposed bounds to practical problems, such as robot navigation and aerial vehicle control. The results provide a reasonable level of validation for the theoretical claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Incomplete Contribution: While the paper derives an upper bound for policy evaluation, it does not propose an algorithm that directly utilizes this bound for policy optimization. This omission leaves the work incomplete, as the practical utility of the bound remains unexplored.
2. Limited Novelty: The theoretical analysis, while rigorous, is largely standard and builds on existing techniques like concentration-of-measure inequalities and PAC-Bayesian approaches. The novelty of the derived bounds is incremental rather than groundbreaking.
3. Unclear Tightness of Bounds: The practical significance of the proposed bounds is undermined by the lack of clarity regarding their tightness and meaningfulness for any choice of the parameter Î±. This raises concerns about the bounds' utility in real-world scenarios.
Evaluation:
- Quality: The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear derivation of bounds. However, the lack of a complete algorithm limits its contribution as a standalone piece of work.
- Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, providing sufficient detail for an expert reader to reproduce its results. However, the explanation of the tightness of the bounds could be improved.
- Originality: The work builds on established methods and does not introduce fundamentally new concepts. While the application to iterative policy optimization is interesting, the contribution is incremental.
- Significance: The results are relevant to the field, but their practical impact is limited by the absence of an algorithm and the unclear tightness of the bounds. The work provides a foundation for future research but does not significantly advance the state of the art.
Recommendation:
While the paper addresses an interesting problem and provides a solid theoretical foundation, its incomplete nature and limited novelty make it less suitable for acceptance at a top-tier conference like NeurIPS. The authors are encouraged to extend their work by developing and evaluating algorithms that directly utilize the derived bounds, as well as providing clearer insights into the tightness and practical utility of the bounds.
