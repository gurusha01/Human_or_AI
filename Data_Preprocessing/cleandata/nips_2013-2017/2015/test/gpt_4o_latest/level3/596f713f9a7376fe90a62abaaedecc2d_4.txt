The paper presents a novel approach to image restoration by combining the strengths of generative and discriminative methods. Specifically, it proposes a discriminatively trained feed-forward architecture, termed a "gating network," to approximate the computationally expensive latent variable inference in generative models, with a focus on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to exact inference in the EPLL framework while offering a significant speedup, making it feasible for large-scale image restoration tasks.
Strengths:
The paper addresses a specific yet important bottleneck in generative image restoration methods, namely the computational cost of latent variable inference in EPLL. The idea of using discriminative training to approximate this step is innovative and well-motivated. The proposed method achieves a remarkable two orders of magnitude speedup while maintaining competitive performance, as evidenced by both quantitative results (PSNR values) and qualitative visual comparisons. This contribution is significant for practical applications, as it bridges the gap between the modularity of generative models and the efficiency of discriminative approaches. Additionally, the modularity of the proposed method is preserved, enabling it to be applied to diverse restoration tasks, such as deblurring, without retraining.
The competitive performance of EPLL with discriminative methods is intriguing and opens avenues for further exploration. The paper also highlights the trade-offs between accuracy and runtime, providing insights into practical optimization strategies, such as reducing patch overlap ("stride").
Weaknesses:
Despite its strengths, the paper has several limitations. The introduction overstates the generality of the proposed method, which is specifically tailored to EPLL and may not generalize to other generative models that do not face similar computational bottlenecks. The integration of generative and discriminative approaches is relatively shallow, as the method relies on standard generative training rather than a deeper fusion of the two paradigms. Furthermore, the discussion on generative versus discriminative approaches is overly simplistic, neglecting key aspects such as loss flexibility and principled marginalization.
The clarity of the paper could be improved. The explanation of the gating network in Section 3 is unclear, and Table 1 lacks details about the test data used for denoising. Additionally, there are several typos and unclear figure elements (e.g., Eq. 7, l. 102, Figure 2) that need correction. The title and phrasing are somewhat misleading, as they suggest a generic method while the approach is specific to EPLL.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of image restoration by addressing a critical computational bottleneck, its scope and generality are limited. The technical soundness and practical significance of the work are strong, but the clarity and framing need improvement. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity issues and temper the claims of generality.
