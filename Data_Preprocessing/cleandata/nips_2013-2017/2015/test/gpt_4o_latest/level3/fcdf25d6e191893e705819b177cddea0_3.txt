The paper presents a novel local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), which focuses on identifying the direct causes and effects of a predefined target variable rather than reconstructing the entire causal structure. This approach addresses the inefficiency of global causal discovery methods, which often require learning the complete causal structure to identify local relationships. By leveraging Markov Blanket discovery and neighborhood-based rules, the proposed algorithm achieves comparable accuracy to global methods while significantly improving scalability, making it particularly suited for real-world scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Focused Causal Discovery: The paper introduces a practical approach by targeting the causal relationships of a single variable, which is often sufficient for many applications. This focus reduces computational overhead compared to global methods.
2. Scalability: The algorithm demonstrates significant efficiency improvements, achieving up to two orders of magnitude speedup over global methods in benchmark datasets. This makes it highly applicable to large-scale causal networks.
3. Soundness and Completeness: Theoretical guarantees are provided, ensuring that the algorithm identifies the same causal relationships as global methods under standard assumptions.
4. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency. The results are consistent with theoretical claims, and the algorithm outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational cost.
5. Clarity in Contributions: The paper clearly delineates how CMB differs from and improves upon existing local-to-global methods, such as Growth and Shrink (GS) and Collider Sets (CS).
Weaknesses:
1. Dependency on Assumptions: The algorithm relies on standard causal discovery assumptions, such as causal sufficiency and faithfulness, which may not hold in real-world scenarios with latent confounders or selection bias. While this is common in causal discovery, the paper could have discussed potential extensions to relax these assumptions.
2. Markov Blanket Discovery: The efficiency of CMB is heavily dependent on the accuracy and performance of the Markov Blanket discovery step. Errors in this step can propagate, affecting the final results. This limitation is acknowledged but not deeply explored in the experiments.
3. Limited Novelty in Edge Discovery: While the algorithm improves efficiency, it does not discover additional causal arrows beyond existing methods. This limits its contribution to advancing the state of the art in causal inference.
4. Complexity in Special Cases: Although the algorithm is more efficient in general, its worst-case complexity remains exponential, similar to local-to-global methods, for certain graph structures.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a practical and important problem in causal discovery, offering a scalable solution with strong theoretical and empirical support.
- The focus on direct causes and effects aligns well with real-world applications, where global causal structures are often unnecessary.
- The algorithm's efficiency improvements are significant and could inspire further research in scalable causal discovery.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on strong assumptions and the lack of exploration into handling latent variables may limit the algorithm's applicability in more complex scenarios.
- The novelty lies primarily in efficiency improvements rather than advancing causal discovery capabilities, which may not be sufficient for a high-impact contribution.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field of causal discovery by addressing scalability challenges in local causal analysis. While it does not advance the theoretical boundaries of causal inference, its practical utility and efficiency gains are compelling. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion to include a discussion on potential extensions to handle latent variables and relax the causal sufficiency assumption.
