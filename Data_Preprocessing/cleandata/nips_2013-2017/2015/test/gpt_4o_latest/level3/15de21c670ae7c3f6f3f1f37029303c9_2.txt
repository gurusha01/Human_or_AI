The paper presents a novel approach to computationally efficient maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in exponential families, utilizing a fully-polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). The core idea is to constrain parameters to a "fast-mixing" set, where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can efficiently approximate the likelihood gradient. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for both convex and strongly convex cases, analyzing likelihood and parameter errors, respectively. The work builds on existing techniques, including MCMC mixing assumptions, concentration inequalities, and prior results from Schmidt et al. (2011), offering a nontrivial synthesis of these methods.
Strengths:
The paper is technically sound and provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including proofs for convergence guarantees in both convex and strongly convex scenarios. The authors address a significant challenge in MLE for high-treewidth graphical models by proposing a tractable alternative to tree-structured parameter sets. The introduction is well-written and situates the work within the broader context of MLE and inference in exponential families. The discussion of limitations, such as the difficulty of proving fast-mixing MCMC, is thoughtful and transparent. Additionally, the paper outlines future directions, such as exploring initialization strategies and extending the analysis to more practical settings, which could inspire further research.
Weaknesses:
While the theoretical contributions are substantial, the practical applicability of the results is limited. The assumption of fast-mixing MCMC for all parameters is strong and challenging to verify in real-world scenarios. The paper does not provide experimental validation beyond a toy example, which limits its appeal to practitioners. Furthermore, some technical aspects, such as the convexity of the log-likelihood and the parameter set, are not explicitly stated, which could hinder reproducibility. Minor typographical errors and unclear sentences in certain sections detract from the overall clarity of the manuscript.
Pro and Con Arguments:
- Pro: The paper makes an original and significant theoretical contribution by establishing FPRAS for MLE in exponential families, a challenging problem in machine learning. The theoretical guarantees are rigorous and extend the state of the art.
- Con: The practical utility of the approach is constrained by the strong assumptions on MCMC mixing and the lack of empirical validation. The paper's technical exposition could be improved for better clarity.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, particularly for its theoretical contributions and potential to inspire further research. However, the authors should address the clarity issues and provide more practical insights, either through experiments or a deeper discussion of real-world applicability. This would enhance the paper's impact and relevance to a broader audience.
