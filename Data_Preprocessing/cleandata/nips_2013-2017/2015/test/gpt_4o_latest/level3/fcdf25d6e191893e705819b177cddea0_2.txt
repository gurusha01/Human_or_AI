The paper introduces a novel local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), aimed at identifying direct causes and effects of a target variable without requiring global causal structure discovery. This approach is motivated by the inefficiency of global methods when only local causal relationships are of interest. The authors demonstrate that CMB achieves comparable accuracy to global methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, often by more than an order of magnitude. The paper also provides theoretical guarantees of soundness and completeness under standard assumptions and evaluates the algorithm on benchmark datasets, showing its practical advantages.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The proposed CMB algorithm is technically interesting and addresses a relevant problem in causal discovery. By focusing on local causal relationships, it avoids the computational overhead of global methods, making it more scalable for large datasets.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide clear theoretical guarantees, including proofs of soundness, completeness, and consistency with global methods under standard assumptions. This strengthens the credibility of the proposed approach.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, comparing CMB against both global and local-to-global methods on multiple benchmark datasets. The reported efficiency gains and comparable accuracy are compelling.
4. Clarity in Algorithm Description: The step-by-step explanation of the CMB algorithm, supported by pseudocode, is well-structured and facilitates understanding.
Weaknesses:
1. Introduction and Contributions: The introduction does not clearly articulate the contributions of the paper, particularly in relation to existing local causal discovery methods like LCD and BLCD. A more explicit comparison of how CMB advances the state of the art would strengthen the narrative.
2. Efficiency Comparison: While the efficiency gains of CMB are highlighted, the comparison to global methods may be less meaningful, as these methods inherently solve a broader problem. A more focused comparison with local-to-global methods and other local approaches (e.g., LCD, BLCD) would be more relevant.
3. Assumption Limitations: The algorithm relies on strong assumptions, such as causal sufficiency and correct independence tests. While the authors acknowledge this, a discussion of how these assumptions limit applicability or how they might be relaxed in future work would be valuable.
4. Clarity of Results: The experimental results, while detailed, could benefit from additional discussion on the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, especially in cases where CMB makes slightly more errors than other methods (e.g., on ALARM datasets).
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in causal discovery with a novel and efficient approach.
- Theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed method.
- The work is technically sound and well-suited for the conference audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The contributions are not clearly distinguished from prior work, particularly LCD and BLCD.
- The reliance on strong assumptions may limit the practical applicability of the method.
- Some comparisons (e.g., to global methods) may not be entirely fair or relevant.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to local causal discovery, but the introduction and experimental comparisons could be improved for clarity and relevance.
