The paper presents a novel local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), aimed at identifying direct causes and effects of a target variable without requiring the global structure of a causal network. This approach is built on Markov Blanket (MB) discovery and introduces a method to infer causal identities of MB nodes with respect to a target variable. The authors claim that CMB achieves comparable accuracy to global methods while significantly improving efficiency, often by more than an order of magnitude. The paper is positioned as a contribution to the field of local causal discovery, addressing the inefficiencies of global and local-to-global methods.
Strengths:
1. Relevance and Contribution: The problem of efficiently identifying direct causes and effects of a target variable is highly relevant. The proposed CMB algorithm offers a valuable contribution by reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, as demonstrated through theoretical proofs and experimental results.
2. Theoretical Soundness: The authors provide proofs of the soundness and completeness of CMB under standard assumptions, ensuring that the method is theoretically robust.
3. Efficiency Gains: Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that CMB achieves significant speedups compared to global and local-to-global methods, making it a practical alternative for large-scale causal discovery tasks.
4. Focus on Local Discovery: By targeting only the causal relationships of a specific target variable, the paper addresses a practical need in applications where global structure learning is unnecessary.
Weaknesses:
1. Technical Presentation: The paper suffers from a lack of clarity in its technical presentation. Key terms such as "unshielded parent," "set of three-fork parents," and "sound and complete MB discovery algorithm" are not defined, leaving readers unfamiliar with these concepts at a disadvantage.
2. Missing Assumptions in Theorems: Theorems 2 and 3 omit critical assumptions like causal sufficiency and the correctness of conditional independence tests, which are essential for their validity.
3. Faithfulness Assumption: The paper does not adequately explain why the faithfulness of the distribution to any Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is unnecessary, which could raise concerns about the generalizability of the method.
4. Notation Issues: Ambiguous notation, such as unclear set differences and inconsistent parenthesis usage, could lead to misinterpretations and hinder reproducibility.
5. Experimental Evaluation: The experimental setup could be improved by including a standard MB discovery algorithm as a baseline. Additionally, the efficiency evaluation appears biased, as it does not account for the cost of conditional independence tests within MB discovery subroutines. Reporting actual running times would provide a more transparent comparison.
6. Assumption Limitations: The paper assumes that causal structures can only be identified up to a Markov equivalence class using conditional independence tests, which is a restrictive and debatable premise.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in causal discovery.
- The proposed method demonstrates significant efficiency improvements, which could have practical implications for large-scale applications.
- The theoretical contributions, including proofs of soundness and completeness, are valuable.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The technical presentation requires significant improvement to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
- Missing assumptions in key theorems and insufficient discussion of the faithfulness assumption weaken the theoretical rigor.
- Experimental evaluation lacks fairness and transparency, limiting the credibility of the results.
Recommendation:
While the topic is interesting and the contributions are worthwhile, the paper requires substantial revisions to address its technical and presentation flaws. I recommend a weak reject, encouraging the authors to improve clarity, rigor, and experimental evaluation for future submissions.
