The paper addresses the problem of recovering a positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix from linear measurements using an unregularized ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator with a PSD constraint. This is a significant deviation from the widely used nuclear norm regularization methods, which require careful parameter tuning. The authors argue that under specific design conditions, the PSD-constrained OLS estimator can achieve comparable performance to regularized methods, particularly for low-rank matrices. However, the work is preliminary and raises several concerns regarding clarity, completeness, and practical utility.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper explores an interesting and under-explored ideaâ€”whether regularization is necessary when the target matrix is PSD and the design satisfies certain conditions. This challenges the conventional wisdom in matrix recovery literature.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide theoretical bounds on the prediction and estimation errors under specific design conditions. The results suggest that the PSD-constrained estimator can achieve a slow prediction error rate comparable to nuclear norm regularization, albeit with additional design constraints.
3. Practical Implications: The absence of a tuning parameter in the PSD-constrained OLS estimator simplifies implementation, which could be appealing in practical scenarios.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is difficult to read, with unclear writing and poorly integrated equations. Key terms and conditions (e.g., separability constant, correlation constant) are not intuitively explained, making the theoretical results hard to interpret. The notation is dense and inconsistent, further hindering comprehension.
2. Incomplete Exploration: The paper does not sufficiently explore the scaling behavior of critical quantities like the separability and correlation constants with respect to the number of measurements (\(n\)), matrix dimensions (\(d\)), and rank (\(r\)). This makes it challenging to compare the proposed method with prior work or assess its practical utility.
3. Limited Practical Validation: While numerical experiments are presented, they are limited in scope and do not convincingly demonstrate the practical advantages of the PSD-constrained estimator over regularization-based methods. The experiments lack diversity in datasets and real-world applications.
4. Preliminary Nature: The work appears incomplete, with many open questions left unexplored. For instance, the authors do not address the case of unknown noise levels or general diagonal perturbations, which are common in real-world scenarios.
Recommendation:
The paper introduces an intriguing idea and provides some theoretical insights, but it falls short in clarity, completeness, and practical validation. The lack of clear explanations and the preliminary nature of the work make it unsuitable for acceptance at NeurIPS in its current form. However, the idea has potential, and with significant revisions and additional exploration, it could make a valuable contribution to the field.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel exploration of PSD-constrained OLS without regularization.
- Theoretical results that challenge conventional assumptions in matrix recovery.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poor clarity and organization, making the paper inaccessible to readers.
- Insufficient exploration of key quantities and their scaling behavior.
- Limited practical validation and lack of compelling experimental results.
- Preliminary nature of the work, with many open questions.
Final Recommendation: Reject. The paper requires substantial revisions to improve clarity, theoretical completeness, and practical validation before it can be considered for publication.
