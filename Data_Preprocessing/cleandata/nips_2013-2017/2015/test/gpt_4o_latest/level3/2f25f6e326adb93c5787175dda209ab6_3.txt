The paper introduces novel approximate inference methods for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) that avoid the computationally expensive spectral decomposition of the kernel. By leveraging inducing inputs, the authors derive bounds on the likelihood of DPPs, enabling efficient variational inference and approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. These contributions are significant as they address key computational bottlenecks in DPP inference, particularly for large datasets or continuous domains. The proposed methods are empirically validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating their potential utility.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a critical challenge in DPP inference by avoiding spectral decomposition, which is computationally prohibitive. The use of inducing inputs to derive nonspectral bounds is a creative and impactful contribution.
2. Dual Inference Approaches: The combination of variational inference and approximate MCMC methods provides flexibility, catering to different computational and accuracy requirements.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic data and the diabetic neuropathy dataset demonstrate the applicability of the methods. The convergence of overdispersion measures in the real-world dataset highlights the practical utility of the approach.
4. Potential for Broader Impact: The methods could inspire further research in scalable inference for DPPs and related probabilistic models.
Weaknesses:
1. Methodological Clarity: The description of the methods is rough and lacks sufficient detail for full reproducibility. For instance, matrices \(K\) and \(L\) are introduced without adequate explanation, and a brief discussion of marginal kernels and L-ensembles would improve clarity.
2. Empirical Evaluation: The experiments are not thorough enough. Key aspects, such as runtime comparisons between the variational and MCMC methods, are missing. Additionally, the performance of the methods when inducing inputs are the sampled points in the toy example is not evaluated.
3. Comparison with Existing Methods: The paper does not compare the proposed methods with other approximate or exact inference techniques in terms of approximation quality and computational efficiency. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative advantages of the proposed approach.
4. Parameter Sensitivity: The variational inference method exhibits large parameter estimation errors in the toy data, raising concerns about its reliability. The paper does not provide guidelines for selecting the number and placement of inducing points, which are critical for practical implementation.
5. Clarity and Presentation: The write-up requires significant improvement. The discussion on learning marginal kernel parameters seems unnecessary and could be trimmed. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear explanation of computational complexity for the proposed methods.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to scalable DPP inference, the weaknesses in methodological clarity, empirical evaluation, and comparison with existing methods limit its impact. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors address the following:
1. Improve the clarity of the method description, including detailed explanations of \(K\), \(L\), and their roles.
2. Provide runtime comparisons and a more thorough empirical evaluation, including the performance of inducing inputs as sampled points.
3. Compare the proposed methods with existing approaches in terms of computational cost and approximation quality.
4. Offer practical guidelines for selecting and placing inducing inputs.
5. Revise the write-up for better organization and focus.
