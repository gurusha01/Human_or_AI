The paper introduces a novel variational inference method based on a proximal framework, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the proximal term. The authors establish a connection between their proposed KL proximal-point algorithm and natural gradient descent, demonstrating equivalence in conditionally conjugate exponential-family models. Additionally, they propose a proximal-gradient algorithm for non-conjugate models, employing a splitting and linearization approach to simplify optimization. The method is applied to Bayesian logistic regression, Gaussian process classification, and regression, showing comparable performance to existing methods.
Strengths:  
The paper presents high-quality ideas and a clean framework for addressing non-conjugacy in variational inference. The equivalence established between the KL proximal-point algorithm and natural gradient descent is insightful, providing a theoretical foundation that links optimization geometry with variational inference. The splitting and linearization approach for non-conjugate models is practical and well-motivated, enabling closed-form solutions for subproblems. The method's ability to handle large-scale problems efficiently, particularly through computationally efficient updates, is a notable contribution. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs comparably to state-of-the-art alternatives, with some advantages in numerical robustness and ease of implementation.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its theoretical appeal, the proposed algorithm deviates from true proximal gradient methods due to the direction of the KL term, prioritizing efficiency over strict adherence to proximal principles. This deviation raises questions about the generalizability of the approach. Furthermore, convergence guarantees are limited to special cases, which undermines the robustness of the method. The experimental results, while promising, show only marginal performance gains over existing methods, which may not justify the increased runtime. The analysis of computational trade-offs is insufficient, and the lack of significant empirical improvements weakens the paper's practical impact. Additionally, Sections 5 and 6 require substantial revision for clarity, as the derivations and experimental details are difficult to follow.
Utility and Significance:  
The paper's utility is currently limited by its modest performance gains and lack of rigorous convergence guarantees. While the algorithm has potential practical significance, stronger experimental results and a more comprehensive analysis of its computational benefits are necessary to justify its adoption. The method's originality is commendable, but its significance remains low without further validation.
Clarity:  
The paper is generally well-written, but the organization of Sections 5 and 6 needs improvement. The derivations are dense and could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids. The experimental setup and results should be presented more clearly to enhance reproducibility and comprehension.
Recommendation:  
While the paper introduces an original and theoretically interesting approach, its practical impact is limited by insufficient empirical gains and weak convergence guarantees. I recommend acceptance only if the authors can address the clarity issues and provide stronger experimental results or a more compelling analysis of the method's computational advantages.
