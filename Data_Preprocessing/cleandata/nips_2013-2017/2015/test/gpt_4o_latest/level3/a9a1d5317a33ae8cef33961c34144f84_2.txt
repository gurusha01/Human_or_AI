This paper introduces two novel methods, Inductive Venn–Abers Predictors (IVAPs) and Cross Venn–Abers Predictors (CVAPs), for converting scoring outputs into probabilistic predictions. These methods aim to address the limitations of existing calibration techniques, such as Platt's method and isotonic regression, by achieving perfect calibration (validity) and computational efficiency. The authors position their work as a significant improvement over prior methods, particularly in their ability to resist overfitting and produce consistently more accurate predictions in empirical studies. The paper builds on the theoretical foundation of Venn predictors and isotonic regression, while proposing regularization and cross-validation techniques to enhance predictive performance.
The paper is well-written and demonstrates commendable attention to reproducibility, with detailed experimental setups and publicly available code. The theoretical contributions are sound, with clear proofs and justifications for the computational efficiency and validity of the proposed methods. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with existing calibration methods, supported by empirical results on standard datasets.
Strengths of the paper include its originality and relevance to a widespread problem in machine learning—calibrating probabilistic predictions. The introduction of CVAPs, which leverage cross-validation to improve empirical performance, is particularly noteworthy. The experimental results in Figure 1 suggest that CVAPs consistently outperform existing methods in terms of log loss and Brier loss, demonstrating their practical utility. The paper also highlights the limitations of isotonic regression and Platt's method, providing a compelling case for the adoption of the proposed techniques.
However, there are some weaknesses that warrant further discussion. While the results for CVAPs in Figure 1 are promising, the evidence presented in Tables 1 and 2 is less convincing, particularly for smaller datasets. The authors should provide additional justification or analysis to explain these discrepancies. Furthermore, while the paper focuses on binary classification, it would be valuable to discuss the potential extension of IVAPs and CVAPs to multi-class problems. Finally, the paper does not explore the utility of the upper and lower probabilities produced by IVAPs and CVAPs, which could provide additional insights into prediction reliability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. The paper addresses a significant and well-recognized problem in machine learning.
2. The proposed methods are novel, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.
3. Empirical results demonstrate advantages over existing calibration methods.
4. The paper is well-organized, clear, and reproducible.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. Experimental results in Tables 1 and 2 are less compelling and require further justification.
2. The paper does not explore the potential applications of the upper and lower probabilities produced by the methods.
3. Limited discussion on extending the methods to multi-class problems.
In conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of probabilistic prediction and calibration. While some areas could benefit from further exploration, the strengths of the work outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance at NIPS.
