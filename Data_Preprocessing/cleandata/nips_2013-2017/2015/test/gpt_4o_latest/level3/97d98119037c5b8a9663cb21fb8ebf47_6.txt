The paper presents a novel method for computing high-confidence bounds on the execution costs of iterative stochastic policies, leveraging concentration-of-measure inequalities. This approach is particularly valuable for cost-sensitive domains like robotics, where empirical testing is expensive. The derived bounds provide robustness guarantees for future policy performance and safety, offering a probabilistic framework to predict expected costs and constraint violations. The method is validated in simple robot and aerial robot domains, showing close agreement between the theoretical bounds and empirical estimates. The paper also demonstrates the utility of the bounds in analyzing existing policy optimization algorithms and highlights their potential for designing new algorithms with built-in robustness.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, deriving novel bounds that account for unbounded likelihood ratios in policy adaptation. The use of robust statistical techniques, such as moment truncation, is well-justified and effectively addresses challenges in stochastic optimization.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the methodology and its applications. The derivation of bounds is detailed, and the illustrations in robot and aerial robot domains are intuitive.
3. Significance: The work addresses a critical problem in decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in robotics, where safety and performance guarantees are essential. The proposed bounds are practical for domains where empirical testing is costly or infeasible, making the contribution impactful.
4. Originality: The paper introduces a novel inequality bound that extends existing work on robustness analysis in stochastic control. The focus on unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratios and the use of Renyi divergence for bounding second moments are innovative.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Exploration of Starting Policies: The paper does not explore the impact of initial policies on cost convergence, which could provide deeper insights into the practical applicability of the bounds.
2. Comparability: Testing on standard benchmarks like grid world or cart pole would enhance the paper's comparability with existing work and help situate its contributions within the broader literature.
3. PAC-like Bounds: While the paper mentions the potential for PAC-like bounds, it does not directly achieve them. Extending the work to include PAC bounds would significantly enhance its theoretical and practical significance.
4. Empirical Validation Scope: The validation is limited to simple robot and aerial robot domains. Broader testing across diverse environments would strengthen the generalizability of the results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a novel and technically sound method for robustness analysis, with clear applications in cost-sensitive domains.
- The theoretical contributions are significant and could inspire future work in policy optimization and safety-critical decision-making.
- The clarity and organization of the paper make it accessible to a broad audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of testing on standard benchmarks limits the ability to compare the work with existing methods.
- The omission of PAC-like bounds, despite their mention, leaves a gap in the theoretical contribution.
- The empirical validation is somewhat narrow in scope, reducing confidence in the generalizability of the approach.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of stochastic policy optimization and robustness analysis. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in empirical validation and theoretical extensions, the work is of high quality and addresses an important problem. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on expanding empirical validation and discussing the impact of starting policies on cost convergence.
