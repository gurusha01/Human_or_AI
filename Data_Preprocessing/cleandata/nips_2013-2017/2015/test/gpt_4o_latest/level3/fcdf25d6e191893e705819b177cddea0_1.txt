This paper introduces the Causal Markov Blanket (CMB) algorithm, a novel approach to local causal discovery that identifies the direct causes and effects of a target variable without requiring a global causal graph. By focusing on the local causal structure, the authors aim to improve efficiency and scalability compared to traditional global methods. The paper builds on existing techniques for Markov Blanket (MB) and parent-child (PC) set discovery, proposing a method to distinguish parents from children within the PC set. The theoretical soundness and completeness of the algorithm are rigorously demonstrated, and experimental results show significant efficiency gains—often by one or two orders of magnitude—while maintaining comparable accuracy to global methods.
Strengths:
1. Significance and Originality: The paper addresses an important problem in causal discovery by focusing on local structures, which is both computationally efficient and practically relevant. The proposed CMB algorithm is novel in its ability to identify causal relationships without global graph construction, advancing the state of the art in local causal discovery.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees, including proofs of soundness, completeness, and consistency with global methods under standard assumptions.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy, with significant speedups compared to global and local-to-global methods.
4. Practical Implications: The reduction in computational complexity and MB discovery calls makes CMB a promising tool for large-scale causal analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper suffers from a lack of clarity in several sections. For instance, Section 3 dives into technical details without providing a high-level summary of the algorithm's steps, making it difficult for readers to follow. Similarly, Algorithm 2's description is confusing, particularly regarding the scope and size of `ID_T` and its conversion to a CPDAG. Visual examples would greatly aid comprehension.
2. Terminology and Naming: The title and method name ("Causal Markov Blanket") are overly general and potentially misleading, as they do not convey the algorithm's focus on distinguishing parents from children. More specific naming would improve clarity.
3. Lemma 3 and Markov Equivalence: The explanation of why failing Lemma 3 leads to Markov equivalent structures is insufficiently detailed. Expanding on this point would help readers understand the limitations of the algorithm.
4. Flow and Specificity: The flow on page 3 and sections like 3.1 and 4 could be improved with clearer definitions and explanations. For example, the priority system for causal identification is introduced abruptly without sufficient context.
5. Presentation Quality: Multiple typos and grammatical errors detract from the paper's readability. These issues are particularly noticeable in the references and technical sections.
Recommendations:
1. Improve the paper's clarity by adding high-level summaries before technical details, especially in Section 3. Use diagrams or visual examples to illustrate key concepts, such as the conversion of `ID_T` to a CPDAG.
2. Revise the title and method name to better reflect the algorithm's focus and contributions.
3. Provide a more detailed explanation of Lemma 3 and its implications for Markov equivalence.
4. Address terminology inconsistencies and improve the flow of the manuscript, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 4.
5. Proofread the paper thoroughly to eliminate typos and grammatical errors.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant contribution to local causal discovery, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to global methods.
- Theoretical guarantees and empirical results support the validity and utility of the proposed approach.
- The work is likely to inspire further research and practical applications in causal discovery.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's lack of clarity and organization may hinder comprehension and reproducibility.
- The title and method name are misleading, which could confuse readers about the scope of the contribution.
- Presentation issues, including typos and inconsistent terminology, detract from the overall quality.
Overall Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field, its clarity and presentation need significant improvement. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on improving the paper's readability, organization, and presentation quality.
