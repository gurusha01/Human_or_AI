The paper introduces PEGI, a novel algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise, leveraging fourth-order cumulants and a pseudo-Euclidean inner product space for unbiased estimation. Unlike prior methods, PEGI eliminates the need for complex quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing, addressing numerical instability issues in existing approaches like GI-ICA. The authors also propose a SINR-optimal demixing strategy that is invariant to signal/noise decomposition ambiguities, providing a theoretically grounded and practical solution for noisy ICA.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality and Theoretical Rigor: The paper is well-grounded in theory, with clear derivations and proofs supporting the PEGI algorithm and its SINR-optimal demixing approach. The use of pseudo-Euclidean spaces to simplify the recovery process is innovative and addresses limitations in prior work.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written, with a logical flow from problem motivation to algorithm development and experimental validation. The authors provide sufficient background and related work to position their contributions effectively.
3. Simplicity of the Algorithm: PEGI's conceptual simplicity is a notable strength, as it avoids the computational overhead and numerical issues of quasi-orthogonalization while maintaining competitive performance.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments demonstrate PEGI's superior performance in SINR-optimal demixing compared to traditional ICA algorithms like JADE and FastICA, particularly in the medium sample regime. The results are compelling and align with the theoretical claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: While PEGI addresses practical issues in GI-ICA and simplifies the algorithmic framework, the core ideas build upon existing methods (e.g., GI-ICA and cumulant-based approaches). The performance improvement over prior work [21] appears incremental rather than groundbreaking.
2. Data Requirements: The algorithm requires tens of thousands of samples to achieve reliable performance in a 14-dimensional setting. This high sample complexity may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios where data is scarce or expensive to collect.
3. Practical Utility: Despite its theoretical soundness, the algorithm's reliance on large datasets and its focus on Gaussian noise may restrict its use in diverse ICA applications, such as those involving non-Gaussian noise or lower-dimensional data.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a sound theoretical contribution to noisy ICA, addressing key limitations of prior methods.
- The simplicity and efficiency of PEGI make it an attractive alternative for researchers working on high-dimensional ICA problems.
- The SINR-optimal demixing framework is a valuable addition to the literature, with potential applications beyond the scope of this paper.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The incremental nature of the improvements over prior work may not justify publication in a high-impact venue like NeurIPS.
- The high sample complexity reduces the algorithm's practical relevance, particularly for low-data regimes.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is a solid contribution to the field of noisy ICA, offering a theoretically sound and computationally efficient algorithm. However, its limited novelty and practical applicability temper its impact. I recommend acceptance with the caveat that the authors should address the practical limitations and clarify the performance gains over prior work in more detail.
