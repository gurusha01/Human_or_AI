This paper addresses a critical challenge in applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to high-dimensional latent variable models, where the M-step becomes problematic due to the dimensionality. The authors propose a principled approach to regularizing the EM algorithm using decomposable regularizers and an iterative method for tuning them. The paper demonstrates local linear convergence under specific conditions and applies the framework to three well-known models: sparse Gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with missing covariates. The theoretical contributions are supported by statistical guarantees and simulation results.
Strengths:
1. Significance: The paper tackles a well-recognized limitation of the EM algorithm in high-dimensional settings, offering a systematic and theoretically grounded solution. The proposed method is relevant for a broad range of applications, including sparse recovery and low-rank matrix estimation.
2. Technical Novelty: The iterative tuning of regularization parameters during the EM process is a novel contribution. The authors provide a rigorous analysis linking optimization and statistical errors, achieving min-max optimal rates in the examples considered.
3. Theoretical Guarantees: The paper establishes local linear convergence and derives statistical error bounds for the proposed algorithm. The use of decomposable regularizers and conditions like RSC and gradient stability are well-justified and extend existing work in a meaningful way.
4. Practical Relevance: The application to three distinct models demonstrates the versatility of the framework. The simulations further validate the theoretical findings, showing convergence and statistical rates consistent with the analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, some sections are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with high-dimensional statistics or EM algorithms. For instance, the discussion of decomposable regularizers and subspace compatibility constants could benefit from additional intuition or examples.
2. Empirical Validation: Although the simulations support the theory, they are somewhat limited in scope. More diverse datasets or real-world applications would strengthen the practical impact of the work.
3. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: The claim that state-of-the-art regularizers (e.g., [19]) are insufficient is noted but not convincingly illustrated. A more detailed empirical comparison with these methods would bolster the argument.
4. Condition 5: The importance of Condition 5 for statistical error characterization is emphasized, but its practical implications and limitations are not fully explored. This could leave readers uncertain about its general applicability.
Minor Issues:
- Formatting inconsistencies, such as missing boldface for variables and the missing "f" in Eqn 2.2, should be corrected.
- Undefined notation on line 122 should be clarified for completeness.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional latent variable modeling, addressing a critical gap in the literature. Its principled approach to regularizing the EM algorithm is novel, well-supported by theory, and practically relevant. However, improving clarity, expanding empirical validation, and providing a more detailed comparison with existing methods would enhance the paper's accessibility and impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Tackles an important and challenging problem in high-dimensional statistics.
- Provides a novel and theoretically grounded solution with strong guarantees.
- Demonstrates practical relevance through applications to multiple models.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense presentation may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
- Limited empirical validation and insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing machine learning theory and practice.
