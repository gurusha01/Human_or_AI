The paper investigates the estimation of low-rank symmetric positive semidefinite (spd) matrices in trace regression models, proposing that regularization may not always be necessary under specific sampling conditions. The authors argue that constrained least squares estimation, which does not require tuning parameters, can achieve comparable performance to nuclear norm-regularized methods when the measurement matrices satisfy certain properties. The theoretical results are supported by simulations and a real data experiment, although the latter appears somewhat artificial.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper challenges the prevailing assumption that regularization is essential in low-rank matrix estimation. It provides a rigorous theoretical framework showing that spd constraints can substitute for regularization under specific conditions. This is a meaningful contribution to the literature on trace regression and matrix estimation.
2. Clarity of Analysis: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions of key quantities (e.g., restricted eigenvalue, separability, and correlation constants) and their roles in the theoretical results. The proofs and derivations are detailed and appear technically sound.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their theoretical claims through simulations and experiments on real-world data, demonstrating the feasibility of their approach in practice. The comparison with regularization-based methods is thorough and highlights the competitive performance of the proposed method.
4. Practical Implications: The finding that regularization parameters may not be necessary in certain scenarios simplifies implementation and reduces computational overhead associated with parameter tuning.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Applicability of Sampling Model: The results rely on specific measurement matrices (e.g., Wishart matrices), which are not satisfied by generic Gaussian measurements. This limits the practical applicability of the method in broader settings.
2. Artificial Real Data Experiment: While the real data experiment supports the theoretical claims, it appears somewhat contrived. The experimental setup could be more practically motivated to better demonstrate the method's utility in real-world applications.
3. Computational Considerations: The paper does not adequately address the computational advantages or disadvantages of the unregularized method compared to regularized approaches. This is an important consideration for practitioners.
4. Comparison to Prior Work: While the paper references related work ([4], [10]), a more explicit comparison of theoretical results and recovery rates would clarify the strength of the proposed approach relative to existing methods.
5. Interpretability of Results: The theoretical results, while solid, are under-interpreted. The authors could provide more intuition about the conditions (e.g., restricted eigenvalue and separability) and their practical implications.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include a detailed comparison of the theoretical results with the best-known results for regularized problems, particularly for random measurement ensembles.
2. Clarify the practical motivations for the sampling model and explore more realistic real-world applications.
3. Provide additional discussion on controlling quantities such as \(\mu(T)\), \(\phi(T)\), and \(\tau(T)\), and their connection to classical compressed sensing proofs.
4. Address computational trade-offs between the constrained least squares and regularized methods.
5. Expand the discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding its reliance on specific measurement matrices.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a solid theoretical contribution with promising empirical results but has limitations in practical applicability and interpretability. After considering the authors' clarifications, I recommend a score of 6 (weak accept). The paper is a valuable addition to the field, but addressing the above concerns would significantly strengthen its impact.
