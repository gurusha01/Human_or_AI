The paper addresses the challenging problem of blind signal extraction in the presence of Gaussian noise, proposing a novel algorithm, PEGI (pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), to recover the mixing matrix in noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The key innovation lies in using fixed-point iterations in a pseudo-Euclidean space to maximize directional kurtosis, bypassing the need for pre-whitening or quasi-whitening steps required by existing methods like GI-ICA. The authors also contribute an SINR-optimal demixing strategy, which is invariant to signal/noise decomposition, providing a theoretically sound and practical solution for noisy ICA.
The proposed algorithms are elegant and technically sound. The use of pseudo-Euclidean space eliminates the numerical instability associated with quasi-orthogonalization, which is a significant improvement over prior methods. The fixed-point iteration converges rapidly, and the SINR-optimal demixing approach is well-justified theoretically. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed derivations and algorithmic descriptions. However, it lacks references to some key related works, such as RobustICA and the relative Newton method, which would provide better context for the contributions.
The originality of the work is notable. While the approach shares similarities with fastICA and GI-ICA, it avoids pre-whitening, making it a novel extension of existing techniques. The optimal selection of pseudo-Euclidean space for noisy ICA is a unique contribution, advancing the state of the art in this domain. However, the experimental evaluation is limited to synthetic data, and comparisons to robust ICA methods like RobustICA are absent. This omission weakens the empirical validation of the proposed method. Additionally, the reliance on large datasets (1e+5â€“1e+6 samples) for kurtosis estimation raises concerns about the method's practicality for real-world applications, where data may be limited.
In terms of significance, the proposed method is theoretically robust and has potential for applications in noise-corrupted ICA scenarios. However, its practical utility remains unproven due to the lack of real-world data experiments. The authors should consider extending their evaluation to include real-world datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art robust ICA methods. Clarifying algorithmic details and including additional references would also strengthen the paper.
Pros:
1. Novel use of pseudo-Euclidean space for noisy ICA.
2. Avoids pre-whitening, simplifying the algorithm.
3. SINR-optimal demixing approach is theoretically sound.
Cons:
1. Limited experiments on synthetic data only.
2. No comparisons with robust ICA methods like RobustICA.
3. High data requirements may limit practical applicability.
In summary, the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to noisy ICA but requires further empirical validation to establish its practical significance.
