The paper investigates the local convergence properties of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in high-dimensional settings, where the dimensionality exceeds the sample size. Building on prior work that established linear convergence for EM in low-dimensional settings, the authors propose a novel iterative regularization scheme to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data. The key contribution lies in dynamically adapting the regularization parameter during iterations, ensuring a balance between optimization and statistical errors. The algorithm achieves linear convergence within a local neighborhood of the optimum under strong assumptions about the objective function. Theoretical guarantees are provided for specific applications, such as sparse Gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with missing covariates. The results are validated through simulations, demonstrating convergence rates and statistical efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Advancement: The paper makes a meaningful contribution by extending the theoretical understanding of EM to high-dimensional settings, a challenging and underexplored area. The iterative regularization scheme is novel and well-motivated.
2. Generality: The proposed framework is adaptable to various high-dimensional problems, including sparse and low-rank structures, making it broadly applicable.
3. Statistical Guarantees: The authors rigorously derive statistical and computational guarantees, achieving near-optimal rates for specific models. This is a significant step forward compared to prior work.
4. Clarity of Assumptions: The paper clearly outlines the assumptions required for the theoretical results, such as decomposable regularizers and strong concavity conditions.
5. Simulations: The empirical results support the theoretical claims, demonstrating both linear convergence and statistical efficiency.
Weaknesses:
1. Strong Assumptions: The results rely on stringent assumptions about the objective function, such as gradient stability and restricted strong concavity. These may limit the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where such conditions are not met.
2. Resampling Requirement: The theoretical analysis assumes fresh samples at each iteration, which may be impractical in many applications. While the authors suggest this requirement is an artifact of the analysis, its necessity remains unclear.
3. Technical Complexity: The paper is highly technical and assumes a deep understanding of high-dimensional statistics, making it accessible only to a niche audience.
4. Limited Empirical Scope: While the simulations validate the theoretical claims, they are limited in scope. Real-world datasets and comparisons with alternative high-dimensional EM variants would strengthen the paper.
5. Novelty of Applications: The specific applications discussed (e.g., sparse Gaussian mixture models, mixed regression) are standard in the literature. While the theoretical guarantees are novel, the practical impact could be better demonstrated with more diverse or novel use cases.

Overall, this paper represents a valuable theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional latent variable modeling and EM algorithms. While it may not have immediate practical impact due to its assumptions, it lays a strong foundation for future work. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the practicality of resampling and expand the empirical evaluation in the final version.
