The paper presents a novel approach to parameter estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) by leveraging Riemannian manifold optimization, challenging the long-standing dominance of Expectation Maximization (EM). The authors identify a key limitation of directly applying manifold optimization to GMMs—its inefficiency compared to EM—and propose a reformulation of the GMM log-likelihood based on geodesic convexity. This reformulation enables manifold optimization to not only match but often outperform EM in terms of convergence speed and robustness. The authors further develop a Riemannian LBFGS solver with a carefully designed line-search procedure, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods like Riemannian conjugate gradient and Euclidean approaches using Cholesky decomposition. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the claims, showing that manifold optimization is less sensitive to overlapping data and exhibits more consistent runtime performance than EM.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a fresh perspective by incorporating Riemannian manifold optimization into GMM parameter estimation, a domain traditionally dominated by EM. The reformulation based on geodesic convexity is particularly innovative and addresses a critical bottleneck in applying manifold optimization to GMMs.
2. Technical Depth: The theoretical contributions, including proofs of geodesic convexity and the equivalence of reformulated and original optimization problems, are rigorous and well-grounded. The development of a robust Riemannian LBFGS solver with Wolfe condition-based line-search is a significant technical achievement.
3. Empirical Validation: The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets convincingly demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed approach. The comparison with EM and other optimization methods is thorough, highlighting the strengths of manifold optimization in terms of convergence speed and robustness.
4. Reproducibility: The authors provide MATLAB implementations of their methods, enhancing the reproducibility of their results and encouraging further exploration of manifold optimization in the community.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, some sections, particularly those involving mathematical details (e.g., geodesic convexity and line-search), could benefit from clearer explanations or illustrative examples. This would make the work more accessible to a broader audience.
2. Scope of Experiments: Although the experiments are comprehensive, the paper could explore larger-scale datasets or higher-dimensional GMMs to better evaluate the scalability of the proposed methods.
3. Comparison to Other State-of-the-Art Methods: While the paper compares manifold optimization to EM and Cholesky-based methods, it does not benchmark against other recent advancements in GMM optimization, such as variational inference or stochastic optimization techniques.
