Review
This paper introduces a novel approach to maximum likelihood learning in high-treewidth undirected graphical models by constraining parameters to a set of "fast-mixing" parameters, where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is guaranteed to converge quickly. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for gradient descent optimization using MCMC-approximated gradients, demonstrating that the method converges to the maximum likelihood solution with high probability. The paper further analyzes the computational complexity of this approach, showing that the total effort scales polynomially with the desired accuracy. The results are applicable to any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics, making the contribution generalizable beyond graphical models. The authors also compare their method to existing strategies like pseudolikelihood and score matching, highlighting its advantages in terms of theoretical guarantees and tractability.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees for maximum likelihood learning using MCMC, addressing a key limitation of existing methods that lack such assurances. The derivation of fully polynomial-time randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS) is a significant contribution.
2. Generality: The results are framed within the exponential family, making them broadly applicable to a wide range of models beyond graphical models.
3. Clarity of Analysis: The paper clearly distinguishes between the convex and strongly convex cases, providing detailed bounds on convergence rates and computational effort.
4. Novelty: The concept of restricting parameters to a fast-mixing set is a fresh perspective on tractability, differing fundamentally from traditional approaches like tree-structured parameters.
5. Practical Example: The inclusion of a numerical example with an Ising model helps ground the theoretical results and demonstrates their practical feasibility.
Weaknesses
1. Practical Limitations: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper explicitly states that it does not claim significant practical contributions. The proposed method may be overly conservative in practice, as evidenced by the example where the algorithm outperforms the specified theoretical bounds.
2. Projection Complexity: The paper assumes that the projection onto the fast-mixing set is computationally negligible compared to sampling. However, this assumption may not hold for larger or more complex models, as acknowledged by the authors.
3. Initialization and Sampling Strategies: The analysis does not encompass practical strategies like maintaining a sample pool or using contrastive divergence, which are common in real-world applications. This limits the immediate applicability of the results to existing workflows.
4. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks extensive empirical validation beyond the single Ising model example. A broader set of experiments would strengthen the case for the practical utility of the method.
5. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical results are well-structured, the dense mathematical notation and detailed proofs may make the paper difficult to follow for non-experts.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and inference, addressing a long-standing challenge in maximum likelihood learning for high-treewidth models.
- The results are general and applicable to a wide range of exponential family models, advancing the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
- The novel focus on fast-mixing parameters introduces a fresh perspective on tractability, which could inspire future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of practical contributions and limited empirical validation may reduce the immediate impact of the work.
- The assumptions regarding projection complexity and initialization strategies may limit the scalability and applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.
- The dense presentation could hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper represents a strong theoretical contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing the state of the art in machine learning and inference. While the practical limitations and lack of empirical validation are notable weaknesses, the novelty and rigor of the theoretical results justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to improve clarity and include a discussion on potential extensions to practical settings.
