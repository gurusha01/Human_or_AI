This paper addresses the robustness analysis of decision-making under uncertainty, particularly focusing on iterative stochastic policy optimization. The authors propose a novel probabilistic bound based on concentration-of-measure inequalities, which accounts for the unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio arising from iterative policy adaptation. The derived bound provides high-confidence guarantees for expected performance and safety, making it a valuable tool for applications in robotics and autonomous systems. The paper illustrates the approach with a simple robot control scenario and extends it to aerial vehicle navigation, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed method.
The work builds on existing literature in reinforcement learning, robust model-predictive control, and randomized methods in control theory. It extends prior work on probabilistic bounds for control systems by introducing a robust estimation technique to handle unbounded likelihood ratios, inspired by Catoni's moment-truncation method. The authors also leverage concepts from Renyi divergence to compute tighter bounds. While related to prior work on PAC bounds and policy optimization (e.g., reward-weighted regression and cross-entropy methods), the paper makes a novel contribution by integrating these tools into a unified framework for robustness analysis.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is rigorous in its theoretical derivations, and the proposed bound is well-supported by mathematical analysis. The use of robust statistics to address unbounded likelihood ratios is particularly innovative.
2. Practical Relevance: The application to robot control and aerial vehicle navigation demonstrates the potential impact of the method in real-world scenarios. The ability to provide high-confidence guarantees for safety and performance is critical for deploying autonomous systems in uncertain environments.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with a clear progression from theoretical foundations to practical applications. The inclusion of illustrative examples, such as the robot navigation scenario, aids in understanding the approach.
4. Originality: The integration of PAC bounds with iterative policy optimization and the novel use of Renyi divergence for bounding likelihood ratios represent a significant advancement over prior work.
Weaknesses:
1. Empirical Evaluation: While the paper provides illustrative examples, the experimental evaluation is somewhat limited. For instance, the aerial vehicle navigation example achieves only modest improvements in collision probability (e.g., reducing it to ~15%), which may not be sufficient for practical deployment.
2. Scalability: The computational cost of the proposed method, particularly for high-dimensional systems or large-scale problems, is not thoroughly discussed. The reliance on sampling (e.g., 200 samples per iteration) may pose challenges for real-time applications.
3. Generality of Results: The bounds are derived for specific classes of cost functions and policy representations (e.g., Gaussian densities). It is unclear how well the approach generalizes to more complex or non-parametric policy spaces.
4. Limited Novelty in Applications: The applications, while relevant, are relatively standard (robot navigation and quadrotor control). Exploring more diverse or challenging domains could strengthen the paper's impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by addressing a challenging problem in stochastic decision-making.
- The proposed method is innovative and has the potential to influence future research in robust policy optimization.
- The clarity and rigor of the paper make it accessible to the broader NeurIPS audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The empirical results, while illustrative, are not sufficiently compelling to demonstrate the practical utility of the method.
- The scalability and generality of the approach remain open questions, limiting its immediate applicability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper presents a strong theoretical contribution with promising applications. While the empirical evaluation could be more robust, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to strengthen the experimental results and address scalability concerns.
