Review of the Paper
This paper introduces a novel local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), which focuses on identifying the direct causes and effects of a target variable without requiring the global structure of the causal network. The authors argue that existing global and local-to-global methods are computationally inefficient when only the local structure of a target variable is of interest. CMB leverages Markov Blanket discovery and a series of independence tests to efficiently infer causal relationships. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the soundness and completeness of CMB under standard assumptions and demonstrate its scalability and accuracy through experiments on benchmark datasets.
The paper builds on prior work in causal discovery, particularly global methods like the Peter-Clark (P-C) algorithm and local-to-global methods such as Growth and Shrink (GS) and Collider Sets (CS). It also draws inspiration from topology-based Markov Blanket discovery techniques. The authors position CMB as a significant improvement over these methods in terms of efficiency, achieving comparable accuracy while reducing computational costs by more than an order of magnitude in many cases. This is a meaningful contribution, as it addresses the inefficiency of global methods when local causal discovery suffices.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The proposed CMB algorithm introduces a unique approach to local causal discovery by focusing solely on the target variable's causal neighborhood, avoiding the need to compute the global causal structure. This is a novel contribution to the field.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides sound theoretical guarantees, including proofs of soundness, completeness, and consistency with global methods. The identifiability condition is clearly articulated and well-supported.
3. Efficiency: Experimental results demonstrate that CMB is significantly faster than global and local-to-global methods, achieving up to two orders of magnitude speedup in some cases.
4. Clarity of Results: The experimental evaluation is thorough, with comparisons across multiple datasets and metrics. The authors also highlight the practical limitations of CMB, such as its dependency on the accuracy of independence tests and Markov Blanket discovery.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions: The algorithm relies on strong assumptions, including causal sufficiency, faithfulness, and no selection bias. While these are standard in causal discovery, relaxing these assumptions (e.g., handling latent confounders) would enhance the algorithm's applicability.
2. Complexity of Markov Blanket Discovery: Although CMB is more efficient than global methods, its worst-case complexity remains exponential due to the Markov Blanket discovery step. This limitation is acknowledged but not fully addressed.
3. Limited Discussion of Practical Applications: While the theoretical and experimental contributions are strong, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential real-world applications and scenarios where CMB would be particularly advantageous.
4. Reproducibility: The implementation details of CMB are not fully disclosed, and while existing tools are used for comparison, the lack of open-source code for CMB may hinder reproducibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in causal discovery and provides a novel, theoretically sound, and efficient solution.
- The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of CMB in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
- The work is well-positioned within the existing literature, with clear connections to prior methods and a strong theoretical foundation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on strong assumptions limits the generalizability of the proposed method.
- The worst-case complexity remains exponential, which could be problematic for certain large-scale datasets.
- The lack of open-source implementation may reduce the impact and accessibility of the work.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of causal discovery by proposing an efficient and theoretically grounded local causal discovery algorithm. While there are some limitations, they do not detract from the overall quality and importance of the work. Future iterations could focus on relaxing assumptions and improving scalability.
