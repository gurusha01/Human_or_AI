This paper integrates a generative and a discriminative approach to develop a state-of-the-art image restoration system, achieving computational speeds that are two orders of magnitude faster.
The concept of employing an unsupervised generative front-end and subsequently utilizing a linear combination of activated "primitives" is quite old (a reference to Hertz, Krogh & Palmer 1991 or an earlier source would be appropriate), but the specific problem formulation presented here is novel. The study employs standard components and conventional denoising metrics to validate its findings. However, I would have appreciated additional analyses exploring the extent to which the new gating network underperforms compared to the original or a more in-depth examination of the changes introduced by the network gating. Overall, this is a straightforward implementation of an established idea, yielding commendable results.
