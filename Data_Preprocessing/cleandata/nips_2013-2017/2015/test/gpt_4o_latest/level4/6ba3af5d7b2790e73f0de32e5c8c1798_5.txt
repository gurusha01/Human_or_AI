This paper is enjoyable to read.
The central idea is well-articulated, the implementation appears robust, and the results are promising.
I particularly value that the authors take the time to discuss limitations (Section 4.1) and provide both quantitative and qualitative analyses, along with offering hypotheses.
It is evident that significant effort went into this work, and the analysis appears thorough and balanced.
The authors not only focus on the "how" (generative model) but also address the "why" (exploration) and proceed to evaluate this.
The primary limitation is that the findings on usefulness are somewhat inconclusive, and the broader impact of this research direction remains uncertain. Overall, this is a solid empirical study on employing generative models to simulate potential futures in Atari games. The analyses—spanning empirical, quantitative, and qualitative dimensions—are thorough and well-executed.
