The primary concern with the manuscript lies in its insufficient engagement with the existing literature on the topic. The proposed algorithm is closely related to the Monte Carlo EM algorithm and, more broadly, to the class of stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian dynamics, which have been extensively studied for optimizing intractable likelihood functions. A substantial body of work already exists in this area, and the authors need to position their contributions in relation to prior research. In fact, a theoretical framework that encompasses several of the authors' results is already well-established and applies to more general settings. For instance, it is not necessary for the Markov chains to be uniformly ergodic, nor is it required to reinitialize the Markov chain at a fixed distribution \( r \) at each iteration. While the authors acknowledge that this reinitialization is done to simplify their analysis, this justification is insufficient. Moreover, reinitializing with the previous sample, as mentioned toward the end of the manuscript, may be a more effective approach, and such methods have been thoroughly analyzed in prior studies.
The presentation of the results also leaves room for improvement. For example, the assumptions underlying Theorems 1 and 2 are not explicitly stated, forcing the reader to infer them from surrounding text, which is not ideal. Additionally, the strong assumptions employed to derive results such as those in Theorem 6 are unnecessary, as more general results are available in the literature (e.g., the work of Benveniste, MÃ©tivier, and Priouret). Overall, the authors appear to lack sufficient awareness of the relevant literature, and the manuscript's contributions are only marginally novel.
