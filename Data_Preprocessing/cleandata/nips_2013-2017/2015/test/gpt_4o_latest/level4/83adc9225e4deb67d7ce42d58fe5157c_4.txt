I have reviewed the authors' rebuttal, but it did not alter my assessment of the paper.

1 Summary of the paper:
This work introduces a method to learn the structure of a kernel-based graphical model that encodes a joint probability distribution, where the probabilities belong to an infinite-dimensional exponential family [1]. By employing score-matching as the learning objective, the need to estimate the normalization constant is circumvented, making the approach both scalable and sufficient for structure learning. Additionally, the kernel-based parameterization transforms the optimization problem into a group lasso instance. The proposed algorithm is shown to recover the structure in an asymptotically consistent manner. The method is compared against graphical lasso for estimating a Gaussian distribution and against both graphical lasso and a model-aware algorithm for a paranormal distribution.

2 Summary of the review:
Although I did not independently verify the theoretical analysis presented in the paper and believe the experimental section could be better explained, I find the paper well-structured, the contributions reasonably clear, and the underlying idea both intriguing and potentially impactful.

3 Qualitative evaluation:
Quality: Medium  
+ Extensive theoretical analysis (not fully verified but appears sound)  
+- Limited empirical evaluation on small-scale experiments  
- Lacks discussion or empirical evaluation on selecting kernel parameters. Is grid-search with cross-validation feasible and sufficient? How sensitive are the results to the chosen parameters?  
- No code provided  
Clarity: Low  
+ The paper is well-organized and uses clear language.  
+- The mathematical developments are dense and difficult to follow, especially as some notations are not introduced in the main paper.  
- The parameter values for the second model used in the experiments are not provided.  
Originality: Good  
+ While I am not deeply familiar with kernel-based methods or kernel-based graphical models, I could not identify closely related works beyond those cited.  
+ The paper represents a significant advancement compared to the cited prior works.  
- However, other works leveraging kernels in probabilistic graphical models exist. For instance, it would benefit the informed reader to relate this paper to works such as "Nonparametric Tree Graphical Models via Kernel Embeddings," "Kernel Conditional Random Fields: Representation and Clique Selection," and "Learning Graphical Models with Mercer Kernels," which I found through a quick search.  
Significance: Good  
+ Structure learning for non-Gaussian variables is an important and open problem.  
+ The proposed idea is highly interesting.  
Impact: 2

4 Other Comments:
Details:  
- While the focus is on structure estimation, can the normalization constant be estimated efficiently once the model is learned, for those who also need the density? Are there specific kernel families that make this feasible?  
- Section headers should not be fully capitalized.  
- As someone unfamiliar with RKHS, I found the transition from l204 to l207 unclear. A derivation in the supplementary material would help.  
- A table summarizing all notations in the supplementary material would improve readability.  
- l319: Why is it Ω(f)^2 here, whereas it was Ω(f) in Equation 8?  
- Experiment 2: What is the dimensionality of the problem? What parameter values were used?  
- It would be helpful to include the expressions for D, E, and F in Theorem 3.2, perhaps in the appendix.  
Typos:  
- l25: "evaluation of" → "the evaluation of"  
- l53: Add "the" before "structure" (similar missing articles throughout the paper, though I am not a native speaker).  
- l76: "integrable"  
- l86: H_2?  
- l233: S^c is not defined.  
- l323: Ω*_{S^c} is not defined.
