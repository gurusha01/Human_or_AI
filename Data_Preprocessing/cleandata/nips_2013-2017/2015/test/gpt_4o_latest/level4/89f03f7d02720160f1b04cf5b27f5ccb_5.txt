This paper builds upon a recently introduced noisy ICA method known as GI-ICA by proposing a new approach called PEGI. The PEGI method potentially eliminates the need for the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step required in GI-ICA. Additionally, the authors present a general optimality result concerning source recovery in noisy ICA.
Overall, the paper is well-written and demonstrates a high level of technical quality. The proposed method (PEGI) represents a reasonable and relevant extension of GI-ICA, and the results indicate that the method performs adequately. However, a significant portion of Section 2 is derived from the GI-ICA paper, and the modifications to GI-ICA appear relatively straightforward. Consequently, the paper's contribution may be somewhat limited.
The additional optimality result presented in Section 3 is intriguing in its own right, but its novelty is questionable. A similar result seems to appear in A. F. Naguib's Ph.D. dissertation, "Adaptive Antennas for CDMA Wireless Network," Stanford University, 1996 (Chapter 3), which is a frequently cited reference in the context of beamforming. Furthermore, it would be helpful to clarify how this result might relate to source recovery based on MAP estimation, which is a widely used approach in probabilistic noisy ICA methods.
The presentation of the method could benefit from improvements in certain areas. First, it was not immediately clear how the gradient and Hessian of kurtosis (Equations 1 and 2) are estimated from the data. While this detail is available in the GI-ICA paper [21], the current paper should either describe it explicitly or provide a more appropriate reference to the prior work. Second, the paper does not sufficiently explain why quasi-orthogonalization poses challenges for GI-ICA while PEGI avoids these issues, even though both methods rely on the same matrix \( C \). A more detailed discussion on this point is necessary to better highlight the advantages and motivation behind the new method.
In summary, the proposed method is a reasonable and relevant extension of the previously introduced GI-ICA method, but the contribution of this paper appears somewhat limited. Additionally, certain aspects of the presentation require further clarification and improvement.
