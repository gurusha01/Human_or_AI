Summary: Manifold optimization of GMMs
Quality: High (to be determined)
Clarity: High
Originality: Appears to be original (though I am not deeply familiar with the manifold optimization literature)
Significance: Good.
I find this paper interesting and promising. My comments are as follows:
1) I am not a fan of tables that only report means and standard errors, especially for challenging optimization problems. Additionally, I find it insufficient to report only performance times without showing how well the algorithms performed with respect to the objective function.
2) I would prefer to see the UCI benchmarks included in the main text. Furthermore, comparisons with other implementations would be valuable. For instance, if the authors are using MATLAB, they could consider comparing against the gmmdist function set or Mixmod, or in R, against mclust.
3) Referring to the "EM algorithm" as the benchmark is ambiguous because the specific implementation details are not provided, and these details can significantly affect the results. For example, differences in convergence criteria can lead to substantial variations in runtime while producing similar estimates.
To address these concerns, I recommend the following:
(a) Include two-dimensional contour plots (or similar visualizations) that depict both runtime and performance for each numerical example.
(b) Provide similar visualizations for a set of benchmarks.
(c) Add plots that show the likelihood (or surrogate objective) and runtime as functions of the number of iterations.
One common issue with the EM algorithm is that the loss function often becomes nearly flat in later iterations, making the final iterations largely unnecessary. Adjusting the termination criteria could lead to significantly better performance. 
While I do not believe the specific results are critical as long as they are qualitatively consistent with the claims in the text, the current manuscript does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective. 
The authors have developed a modern algorithm for a classic problem with promising results. However, the paper lacks accuracy metrics, details of the benchmark algorithms, and performance-versus-iteration analyses. These additions are necessary for a thorough evaluation of the work.
