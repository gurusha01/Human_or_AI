This paper addresses the task of identifying the direct causes and effects of a target variable through local learning. It builds upon existing local learning methods by incorporating larger neighborhoods, thereby enabling the proposed approach to infer a greater number of causal relationships compared to prior methods. The problem tackled is significant, and the contributions are valuable.
However, the technical presentation is lacking in rigor.
What is the precise definition of an "unshielded parent"? What is meant by a "set of three-fork parents"? How is a "sound and complete MB discovery algorithm" formally defined?
Theorems 2 and 3 are missing critical assumptions. For instance, the proof of Theorem 2 relies on causal sufficiency, yet this assumption is not explicitly stated in the theorem. Additionally, it is necessary to assume that conditional independence tests always yield correct results (e.g., under the assumption of infinite data or similar conditions). Furthermore, it is unclear why the distribution does not need to be faithful to any DAG.
099: The Markov condition states that a node is independent of its non-descendants given its parents, while the Causal Markov condition asserts that a node is independent of its non-effects given its direct causes.
125, 227: The expression R\(S\T) is generally distinct from (R\S)\T. To avoid ambiguity, parentheses should be used when there are consecutive set differences.
133-135: Why is this assumption reasonable? It is well-known that when relying solely on conditional independence tests, structures can only be identified up to a Markov equivalence class.
293: "the PC set of a MB" should be revised to "the PC set of a target."
The experimental evaluation could be improved by including a standard Markov blanket discovery algorithm as a baseline. Such an algorithm would learn only the directions of arcs that are part of v-structures, allowing for a clearer assessment of the added value provided by the new rules.
The efficiency evaluation of the algorithms appears to unfairly favor the CMB algorithm. Efficiency is assessed based on the number of conditional independence tests and the number of MB discovery algorithm invocations. However, MB discovery algorithms typically rely on conditional independence tests to identify Markov blankets, and excluding the conditional independence tests performed within these subroutine calls biases the evaluation. A more equitable approach would be to include the actual runtime of the algorithms in the evaluation.
In summary, this paper addresses an interesting and important topic, and its contributions are meaningful. However, the technical presentation requires significant improvement.
