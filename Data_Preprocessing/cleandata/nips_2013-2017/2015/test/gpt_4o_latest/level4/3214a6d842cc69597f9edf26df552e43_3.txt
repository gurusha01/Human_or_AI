The submission proposes a modified proximal gradient algorithm for variational Bayes, which is shown to be equivalent to natural gradient descent under a specific choice of step sizes.
Comments on Quality:
The paper presents high-quality ideas, albeit with some notable shortcomings. The proximal gradient framework offers an elegant approach to addressing nonconjugacy, and its equivalence to natural gradient descent provides both theoretical justification and a valuable connection to a well-established method.
However, the paper has the following conceptual flaws: (1) As acknowledged by the authors, the algorithm is not strictly a proximal gradient algorithm because the KL divergence term is reversed. The rationale for this modification seems to be computational efficiency, as the authors' approach allows the optimization problem to decouple across parameters, unlike the true proximal gradient formulation. (2) Due to the issue in point 1, the algorithm's convergence can only be guaranteed in special cases (e.g., when β_k → 0 sufficiently quickly, which appears to be both necessary and sufficient).
The submission falls short in analyzing the algorithm's utility. The primary justification for the method seems to be the potential for improved practical performance. However, the observed performance gains are too modest to offset the significant increase in runtime required by the proposed approach. To make the paper compelling for acceptance, much stronger results demonstrating substantial improvements over the mean-field baseline would be necessary.
Overall, while the work shows promise, it is currently too preliminary for publication at the conference.
Comments on Clarity:
The paper is mostly clear, except for Sections 5 and 6, which are extremely difficult to follow. The reviewer recommends revising these sections to improve their readability.
Comments on Originality:
The work appears to be original.
Comments on Significance:
At present, the significance of the work is limited. However, the proposed proximal gradient variational Bayes algorithm has the potential for meaningful practical impact, provided further experiments are conducted to substantiate its utility. While the algorithm is intriguing and merits additional exploration, the results presented in the submission are insufficiently strong to warrant acceptance.
