This paper addresses the problem of identifying the direct causes and effects of a predefined target variable T, rather than uncovering the entire causal structure. The proposed algorithm diverges from the traditional Markov blanket approach and leverages a set of rules applied to the neighborhood of T to infer the directionality of causal relationships. The paper is well-written and engaging, and the algorithm is demonstrated to be equivalent to previously established methods (i.e., it does not overlook any causal relationships). While the algorithm does not identify any new causal links beyond those found by existing approaches, it offers improved scalability by focusing the analysis on a subset of variables, which is particularly relevant in many practical scenarios where analyzing the entire graph is unnecessary. This work specifically tackles the task of learning the direct causes and effects of a predefined target variable T, as opposed to the full causal structure.
