Review - SUMMARY:
This paper investigates the impact of noise correlation in certain multi-output regression models. It demonstrates that methods unable to leverage this correlation, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), can perform significantly worse compared to methods that do, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). For specific linear models (Pooled model and Seemingly Unrelated Regression) analyzed in the paper, the MLE estimator involves jointly optimizing the covariance and regression weights, which results in a non-convex problem. The Alternative Minimization (AltMin) algorithm is proposed as a solution to this problem by iteratively optimizing the covariance and weights, though it does not guarantee finding the global optimum.
The paper's contribution lies in a finite-sample analysis of AltMin and MLE, highlighting the role of correlation. The findings show that both MLE and AltMin can effectively utilize correlation, while OLS cannot. In some cases, the performance gap is substantial. The paper also derives lower bounds for OLS and MLE (in the Pooled model), which match the upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor in the sample size. This suggests that the upper bound for AltMin, which aligns with MLE's, is indeed tight.
Additionally, the paper includes empirical studies to support its theoretical claims.
EVALUATION:
I find this to be a solid paper. It provides clear intuition, rigorous theoretical analysis, and simple experiments that corroborate the theory. However, I have a few comments:
- The experiments use a very small value of eps, indicating highly correlated outputs. Would the performance gap between MLE/AltMin and OLS remain significant if eps were larger (e.g., in the range of 0.1-0.5)? While the theory suggests the behavior scales with O(eps), could other constants—potentially differing between OLS and AltMin/MLE—affect the results?
- The paper assumes a Gaussian noise model. How critical is this assumption for the conclusions? It seems the Gaussian assumption is primarily used in Lemma 11, which corresponds to Corollary 5.35 of [28]. Could the results of Section 5.3.2 in [28] be applied to generalize the findings to non-Gaussian noise models? Is this interpretation correct?
- There are minor typos in the proof of Theorem 15 (p. 13):  
  + Line 650: The summation over i is missing on the right-hand side.  
  + Line 656: ζ₁ appears above the inequality symbol but is never referenced.  
  + Line 663: A missing log n term seems to be required after the equality.
- In the proof of Lemma 3 (Line 710), the inequality involving ζ₁ holds with probability at least 1 - exp(-cn), but this is neither stated explicitly nor accounted for.
===== UPDATE: Thank you for addressing my concerns. I maintain that this is a solid paper, offering valuable intuition, theoretical insights, and experimental validation of its claims.
