The paper introduces a novel framework for spectral regularized embedding, specifically applied to graph transduction. While the framework itself, and particularly the advantages of employing an orthonormal embedding, could be articulated more persuasively, this does not pose a significant concern.
The authors present an intriguing and sophisticated algorithm to approximately solve the SEER problem. This constitutes an original contribution and appears to offer a promising alternative for addressing the challenging learning problem.
The experimental results generally highlight the advantages of the proposed solution. However, it would be valuable to include results that explicitly demonstrate the benefits of the SEER framework or the orthonormal representation defined in equation (3) as a starting point. Additionally, showcasing the approximation accuracy of the IIP solution to the SEER problem would enhance the clarity of the contribution. These aspects are not evident in the current results, and addressing them would help contextualize the contribution within a broader framework.
The discussion on multiple graph transduction is unfortunately presented at a very high level. While this extension is undoubtedly interesting, it requires more detailed explanations, motivations, and intuitions to clearly convey its significance and the reasoning behind its application to multiple graphs. Furthermore, it is essential to clarify how the proposed method is implemented in such scenarios. In its current form, the main ideas for the multiple graph case are difficult to grasp, making it challenging to fully appreciate the corresponding experimental results. For instance, the last column of Table 4 (noisy case) is not particularly intuitive, as it suggests that using a single graph outperforms multiple graphs, which seems to contradict the rationale for addressing multiple graphs.
Lastly, the paper is somewhat dense and not always easy to follow. It frequently references supplementary material, which may indicate an attempt to include excessive information in a single paper. This approach detracts from the accessibility and potentially the visibility of the work. Overall, the paper introduces the SEER framework for orthonormal embeddings in graph transduction, proposes an interesting IIP-based algorithm to address the learning problem in SEER, and provides relatively convincing results.
