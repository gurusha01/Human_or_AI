Review - Summary:
The paper introduces a novel nonparametric model for estimating the structure of probabilistic graphical models within the framework of the infinite-dimensional exponential family (leveraging an infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space). The estimation procedure employs score matching, which circumvents the computational challenges associated with the intractable or expensive computation of the log partition function. The authors demonstrate that the proposed estimator can be solved using existing algorithms for group lasso. Additionally, they provide a theoretical consistency analysis of the estimated sparse structure using the primal-witness approach.
Qualitative Evaluation:
Overall, the paper is not well-written. It lacks a comprehensive review of related methodologies that also utilize score matching. While the authors provide theoretical analysis to support their claims, they fail to compare their results with existing approaches. A dedicated section on related work would have significantly improved the paper. The analysis and method heavily rely on [28], but the authors do not sufficiently discuss their work's relationship with [28]. Instead, they merely cite this reference, as they directly adopt some of its results without providing any commentary or discussion.
The quality of the consistency analysis relative to existing literature is unclear. For instance, the non-asymptotic rates of convergence, though briefly mentioned, appear to be much worse than those in the parametric setting or even the semi-parametric setting, as discussed in [18]. This raises questions about the practical utility of the method for finite sample sizes, which the authors fail to address. The paper does not provide any discussion to clarify this or other related concerns.
The problem tackled in the paper is both interesting and challenging. The model leverages score matching, which has already been explored in [28], but the authors establish a connection with group lasso, offering an efficient solver for their model. However, the current algorithm is restricted to the \( l_1 \)-norm, and it is unclear whether the model can accommodate other regularizers to capture alternative structures. If such extensions are possible, the paper does not discuss how challenging it would be to adapt the solver. Furthermore, the consistency analysis relies on the primal-dual witness approach, which may be difficult to generalize to other regularizers.
In summary, the paper presents a new nonparametric model for estimating the structure of probabilistic graphical models within the infinite-dimensional exponential family. However, the paper is poorly written. While the results seem potentially interesting, the authors fail to compare their technical findings with existing methods. Additionally, the non-asymptotic rates derived in the paper appear to be worse than certain existing results. Given the heavy reliance on [28], a clearer exposition of the novelty and contributions of the work would be highly beneficial.
