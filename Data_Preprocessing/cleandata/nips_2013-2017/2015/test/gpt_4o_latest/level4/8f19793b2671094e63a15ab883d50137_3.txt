Clarity: The paper is generally well-written, but there is room for improvement. For instance, the organization of Section 3 could be enhanced. See the detailed comments below.  
Quality and originality: This paper introduces novel contributions by extending prior findings in both sparse recovery [15,20] and trace regression [4,10].
Detailed comments:  
(1) Figure 1 reveals that when the rank of the underlying matrix is high, the proposed method requires more measurements to achieve effective recovery compared to regularization-based approaches. This appears to be a limitation, as in practical scenarios, the rank may not be known beforehand, and the number of measurements is typically fixed. In such cases, how can one determine whether the proposed method is suitable or not?  
(2) Equation (17) discusses extensions to the spiked case with a diagonal noise term. However, the parameter σ² is assumed to be known in advance. In the experiments, σ² = 0 is used, but no detailed explanation is provided regarding its estimation. Additionally, can this approach be extended to cases beyond diagonal noise?  
(3) Section 3 includes multiple experiments and their corresponding discussions. Introducing subsections could improve the structure and readability of this section. The paper investigates a regularization-free estimation method for trace regression involving symmetric positive semidefinite (SPD) matrices. The key finding is that when the underlying matrix is SPD and the measurement matrix satisfies specific conditions, a simple least-squares solution can perform comparably to a trace-regularized solution. Overall, the paper contributes new insights by extending recent advancements in sparse recovery and trace regression.
