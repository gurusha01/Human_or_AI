The paper introduces a general framework for non-conjugate variational inference, leveraging the proximal method and linearisation of the non-conjugate model. For conjugate exponential models, this approach simplifies to natural gradient optimisation. Empirical results demonstrate that the method achieves slightly improved predictive accuracy compared to standard approximate inference techniques on a limited set of problems and datasets.
Quality
The proposed method addresses non-conjugate models through linearisation. However, this approach may be problematic, as prior studies (e.g., Honkela and Valpola, NIPS 2004) have highlighted the unreliability of linearisation in variational inference for non-conjugate models. While the method is empirically evaluated on several datasets and generally performs well, the paper heavily emphasises its strengths while neglecting to discuss its potential limitations and weaknesses.
Clarity
The paper is mostly well-written and well-structured, but it omits certain critical details, such as a precise definition of \( f_n \).
Originality
The approach is innovative, though it builds on a combination of established techniques from different domains. However, the references are incomplete: a key foundational citation for proximal algorithms is missing, and prior work on linearisation in non-conjugate variational inference is not adequately discussed.
Significance
The reliability of the proposed method remains uncertain, which makes it challenging to assess the broader impact of the work until this issue is addressed.
Other Comments
1. The final sentence of the abstract contains unsubstantiated claims, suggesting that the method is universally superior. This statement should either be clarified or removed.
2. In Eqs. (2)-(3), the variable \( \eta \) is not clearly defined.
3. In Eq. (3), it is unclear why the optimisation is expressed as \( \text{arg min} \) rather than \( \text{arg max} \), as in Eq. (2).
4. The proposed method appears to be a batch algorithm, yet it frequently references and links to stochastic variational inference (SVI) methods. Classical batch variational Bayes (VB) approaches seem more relevant in this context.
5. The precise definition of \( f_n \) should be clarified in the examples provided. Additionally, the accuracy of the linearisation procedure must be evaluated to ensure that it does not encounter the same issues as those illustrated in Fig. 1 of Honkela and Valpola (NIPS 2004) for Taylor series linearisation.

Summary
The paper proposes a novel and general framework for non-conjugate variational inference. While the results appear promising, prior research raises concerns about the reliability of the linearisation-based approximation, which warrants further investigation.
