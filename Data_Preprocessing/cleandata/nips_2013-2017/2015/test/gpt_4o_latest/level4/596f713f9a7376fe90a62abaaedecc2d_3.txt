How efficient is the denoising process using the MLP? If it proves to be faster, the primary benefit of employing GMMs for denoising would lie in their modularity. However, in practical scenarios, the modularity of generative models seems unlikely to be a critical advantage, as the noise model is typically predefined or limited to a small set of options (and not user-specified, for instance). If this assumption is incorrect, it might be helpful to include an example in the paper where modularity plays a significant practical role. The narrative of the paper is very clear—leveraging discriminative training to accelerate denoising with generative models, specifically a GMM—and the manuscript is, for the most part, well-written. While the approach is straightforward, the results are compelling.
