This paper introduces two algorithms for probabilistic predictions, IVAP and CVAP. At the outset, I would like to note that I am not a specialist in this area. However, in my view, the ideas presented in this paper are intriguing. The proposed methods are straightforward to comprehend and implement. Theoretical analyses are provided to validate the proposed IVAP, and experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
My primary concern is the distinction between the proposed methods and the Venn-Abers predictors. The authors should include a more detailed introduction to the Venn-Abers predictors, highlighting their validity, predictive efficiency, and computational efficiency. Following this, a comparison between the original algorithm and the proposed methods should be presented to clarify the advantages of the latter.
My secondary concern pertains to the experimental evaluation, which relies on a single UCI dataset to demonstrate performance. This may not provide a robust justification for the methods. The authors are encouraged to test their approach on a broader range of datasets, including more challenging ones beyond the UCI datasets, to better establish the superiority of their methods. Additionally, since CVAP generally achieves the best performance, the authors should provide sensitivity analyses by varying the parameter \( k \) used in CVAP.
If the authors adequately address these concerns in their rebuttal, I would be inclined to recommend acceptance of this paper.
Having reviewed the author feedback, I appreciate the inclusion of additional datasets in the supplementary material. However, it remains unclear why the original Venn-Abers predictors are not applicable to the datasets used in this study, given their scale. I strongly recommend that the authors reorganize the introduction to better address this point and consider moving some of the supplementary experimental results into the main text. Overall, this paper presents interesting ideas and promising results. However, the novelty of the work requires further clarification, and the experimental design needs to be strengthened.
