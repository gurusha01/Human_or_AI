The paper introduces a novel algorithm for noisy ICA, relying solely on fourth-order cumulants, which enables (asymptotically) unbiased estimation in the presence of Gaussian noise.
The work is well-motivated, well-positioned within the literature, and appears to be of high technical quality.
One limitation is that the degree of novelty and the performance improvement over prior work, such as [21], may be modest. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the resulting algorithm is noteworthy and could be of practical interest.
Another limitation is the large number of data points required to demonstrate the method's utilityâ€”on the order of tens of thousands for a 14-dimensional problem. This suggests that the method may have limited applicability in practice. Overall, this is an interesting new algorithm for noisy ICA with seemingly sound theoretical foundations, though its novelty and performance gains in simulations appear modest.
