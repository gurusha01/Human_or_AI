This manuscript addresses the challenge of noisy ICA and introduces an enhancement to the Gradient-Iteration (GI) ICA algorithm originally proposed by Voss et al. The conventional GI-ICA algorithm relies on the assumption that the columns of A are orthogonal, necessitating a complex preprocessing step known as quasi-orthogonalization to linearly transform the data and ensure orthogonality of A's columns. The primary contribution of the proposed approach lies in bypassing this preprocessing step by reformulating the signal recovery problem as a fixed-point method within an indefinite inner product (pseudo-Euclidean) space.
While Section 1 provides a well-structured overview of a specific line of ICA research, it would benefit from a brief discussion of research on underdetermined blind signal separation (BSS). By augmenting one column and one row in A and S, the noisy ICA model X = AS + n can be equivalently expressed as X = A'S', where A' and S' represent the augmented matrices. In practice, existing underdetermined BSS techniques could also be applied to address the signal recovery problem in this formulation, treating noise as an additional source. Consequently, the literature on underdetermined BSS is tangentially relevant to this work and should not be entirely overlooked.
It appears that several sentences in this paper are directly reused from the following publicly available manuscript: J. Voss, M. Belkin, L. Rademacher, "Optimal Recovery in Noisy ICA," 2015. To mitigate potential concerns regarding plagiarism or self-plagiarism, I recommend that the authors rephrase these sentences wherever possible.
Additionally, the notation $^\dagger$ should be explicitly clarified as representing the pseudo-inverse.
The paper lacks a concluding section, which should be included in the revised submission.

This manuscript addresses the problem of noisy ICA and proposes an extension of the Gradient-Iteration (GI) ICA algorithm by Voss et al. The key contribution is the elimination of the quasi-orthogonalization step by framing the signal recovery problem as a fixed-point method in an indefinite inner product (pseudo-Euclidean) space.
