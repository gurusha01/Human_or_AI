The paper introduces two novel methods for converting scoring outputs into probabilities, serving as alternatives to established approaches like Platt's method and isotonic regression. The manuscript is well-written and clear, with the authors particularly commended for including details that facilitate the reproduction of experimental results. The proposed methods are innovative, and given the broad relevance of this problem, any demonstrably improved approach represents a meaningful contribution. As such, the paper is highly appropriate for NIPS. However, I have some concerns regarding the experimental results: while Figure 1 shows a clear advantage for CVAP, the numerical results in Tables 1 and 2 are close enough to be less persuasive. Could the authors provide additional justification or clarification on this point? Overall, this is a strong paper and a good fit for NIPS.
