Summary: This paper introduces a novel nonparametric approach for estimating the structure of sparse undirected probabilistic graphical models from data. The method leverages kernels to approximate the target distribution as an infinite-dimensional member of the exponential family and employs the RKHS representer theorem to simplify the optimization problem into one that can be efficiently solved using existing group lasso solvers. The paper is well-written, clearly articulated, and employs sophisticated mathematical techniques to derive an elegant solution. The proposed ideas and techniques are likely to attract significant interest from researchers in the field of structure learning. The primary limitation lies in the evaluation section, which would have benefited from experiments on more complex graph structures with weaker edges to better assess the method's practical performance.
Quality: The paper presents a strong idea that is well executed. The reduction of the penalized score matching objective to a quadratic minimization problem is logically sound, though I did not verify the detailed proofs in the supplementary material. The abstract parameterization in equation (12) is somewhat difficult to follow.
As noted earlier, the main weakness is the evaluation. The experiments rely on a very sparse chain graph with edge strength \(\Omega_s = 0.4\) (line 359), which results in relatively simple structures. Consequently, the performance shown in Fig. 1 is already excellent with \(N = 60\) data points and nearly perfect at \(N = 100\)—a scenario that is uncharacteristic of real-world structure inference problems. It would have been more informative to evaluate the method on more realistic models to better understand its practical performance.
Clarity: The paper is very clear overall. The problem and main idea are well described, with concepts and formulas carefully defined. The authors make commendable efforts to make the argument accessible to a broad audience. For instance, section 2.3 is concise yet helpful for readers less familiar with score matching. However, certain steps in section 3 could benefit from additional hints to improve readability.
Originality: While the paper builds on a range of existing results, the key contribution encapsulated in Theorem 3.2 appears to be novel, elegant, and potentially impactful.
Significance: This work represents a significant advancement in state-of-the-art methods for structure inference. It is likely to inspire further research and applications in the field.
