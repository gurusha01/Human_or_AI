Review:  
The paper investigates iterative stochastic policy optimization and, irrespective of the specific method used to update the policy, derives a bound on the expected cost associated with executing a new stochastic policy, leveraging observed samples from a prior policy. This bound is demonstrated through an example involving aerial vehicle navigation.
Quality  
The results indicate that the original policy can be improved to achieve a predicted collision rate of just 10% (reduced from 50%). While this represents a notable improvement, it would be valuable to understand how the original policy was selected, as a 50% collision probability seems unusually high. Specifically, could the authors provide evidence that a well-chosen set of hand-tuned control parameters would not achieve a better starting collision probability than 50%?  
Additionally, the impact of the choice of alpha in Line 245 on the tightness of the bound warrants further exploration. While the closed-form expression is appreciated, it does not appear to represent the optimal choice.  
Clarity  
Section 2.1 appears somewhat disconnected from the remainder of the paper. Given the detailed treatment of discrete-time dynamics, the concepts introduced in this section are not well integrated with subsequent discussions. For example, Line 105 refers to "an equivalent stochastic optimization"â€”are these problems truly equivalent? If so, in what sense? If not, why is the discrete form included in the discussion?  
Furthermore, the stochastic problem described on Lines 107 and 110 bears similarities to chance-constrained control (e.g., model predictive control). The authors should explicitly discuss these similarities and cite relevant literature. A good starting point could be:  
@article{schwarm1999chance, title={Chance-constrained model predictive control},  
author={Schwarm, Alexander T and Nikolaou, Michael},  
journal={AIChE Journal}, volume={45},  
number={8},  
pages={1743--1752},  
year={1999} }  
However, many more recent papers on this topic are available.  
The figure text is too small to be legible. For example, the legends in Figures 2(b), 2(c), 3(b), and 3(c) span three lines, but the blue line is not visible.  
The discussion of results at the end of Section 4 could be significantly enhanced. There is minimal interpretation of the plots in the subsequent pages, and the existing discussion does not provide much insight into the results. While the graphs suggest that interesting phenomena are occurring, the exact nature of these findings remains unclear.  
Originality  
The authors highlight the challenge of obtaining bounds for the cost due to the unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio, which renders approaches based on Hoeffding's inequality impractical. They propose an alternative approach based on Catoni [25]. However, statements such as "The key step is to use the moment truncation map \psi proposed by Catoni [25]..." [Line 232] somewhat diminish the perceived originality of this work, as they suggest that Catoni's contribution plays a substantial role in the proposed method.  
Significance  
The results are significant in that the derived bounds can facilitate the development of algorithms that produce policies robust to uncertainty, ensuring that the resulting cost does not exceed a pre-specified threshold (with high probability).  
Minor Points  
- Reference [7] seems like an unusual choice for robust MPC. A more appropriate reference might be: http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~maapc/static/files/CACSD/survey-robust-mpc.pdf  
- The authors address an important problem and propose an algorithm that appears to perform well. However, improving the presentation of the figures and expanding the discussion of the results would greatly enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
