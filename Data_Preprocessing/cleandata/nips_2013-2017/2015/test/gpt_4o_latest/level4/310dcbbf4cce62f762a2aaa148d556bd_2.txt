The paper addresses contextual bandits under budget and time constraints. The analysis is confined to finite discrete contexts, fixed costs, and a single budget constraint. Although the setting is simplified, these assumptions remain practical and reasonable. Notably, the proposed approach introduces an adaptive linear programming approximation of the oracle, leading to algorithms that achieve O(log T) regret.
The paper is well-written and thoroughly documented. It cites relevant prior work and provides clear motivation. This is a strong theoretical contribution. However, practical considerations are only briefly touched upon in Sections 5 and 6, and no experimental results are included. Despite this, the contributions are noteworthy: to the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandit settings. The proofs are sound (though I did not verify all of them in full detail). Overall, this is a solid paper that makes reasonable simplifying assumptions to derive O(log T) regret algorithms. Further discussion of practical aspects would enhance the work.
