This paper introduces an innovative probabilistic deep architecture designed for modeling count data. Additionally, the authors extend the proposed framework to address multi-class classification tasks (i.e., discriminative modeling). They present two inference methods—one based on sampling and the other on variational inference—and demonstrate empirical improvements over unsupervised approaches across several large-scale datasets.
Questions/Comments:  
- The model is well-articulated and motivated. I particularly appreciated Section 2.3, which was a pleasure to read. Including a figure to visually represent Equations 3 would enhance clarity.  
- It might be slightly misleading to suggest that [23] does not scale with respect to the number of zeros. My understanding is that employing a Poisson likelihood enables all methods to effectively disregard the zeros. Moreover, the computational efficiency seems to stem primarily from this aspect rather than the higher layers (which are typically much smaller). Additionally, [23] does support non-linear activation functions.  
- Computation: Your model appears to scale effectively. It would be valuable to provide insights into how computational requirements grow and the time required for training on larger datasets. Including a rough comparison of training times with competing models (e.g., docNADE, LDA, and replicated softmax) would also be informative.  
- Regarding the classification experiments, it seems that comparisons are only made against unsupervised methods. This makes the evaluation somewhat unfair. Including at least one straightforward supervised baseline (e.g., a small neural network with a softmax output layer and word frequencies as inputs) would strengthen the comparison.  
Other Comments:  
- Line 165: The sparsity of the Dirichlet distribution depends on the choice of parameters (eta). It would be helpful to make this explicit.  
- Overall, this is a strong paper. The proposed model scales effectively and advances our understanding of deep generative models. The discriminative extension is a noteworthy contribution, and the empirical results are relatively strong as well.
