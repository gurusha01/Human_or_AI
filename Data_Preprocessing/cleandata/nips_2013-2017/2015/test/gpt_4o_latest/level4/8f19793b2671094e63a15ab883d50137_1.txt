In this paper, the authors address the problem of matrix estimation from linear measurements, where the matrix to be estimated is constrained to be positive semidefinite (PSD). They demonstrate that, under certain design constraints, ordinary least squares regression with a PSD constraint exhibits favorable statistical properties.
Specifically, the paper investigates the recovery of a d x d PSD matrix from n linear measurements. The authors propose solving this problem using an ordinary least squares estimator, while enforcing a PSD constraint on the estimated matrix. Unlike much of the prior work in this area, the proposed approach is unregularized.
The authors begin by showing that without any assumptions on the design, the estimation error becomes unbounded when the number of linear measurements n is too small, even if the target matrix has low rank.
Next, they establish that a slow rate for the prediction error can be achieved if the design satisfies a specific condition introduced in the paper. This condition requires the existence of a matrix M, lying in the unit ball of the span of the design (M = sum_i ai Xi, |a| < 1), such that M has its smallest eigenvalue bounded away from zero and its condition number bounded from above. It is worth noting that this slow rate matches the rate achieved by nuclear norm regularized estimators, but the proposed approach imposes an additional condition on the design (whereas regularized estimators do not require such a condition).
Finally, the authors derive a bound on the estimation error in the case where the target matrix has low rank r. This bound depends on three design-dependent quantities: the restricted eigenvalue, the separability constant, and the correlation constant. However, a major concern is that the scaling of the latter two constants with n, d, and r is not analyzed in the paper. The authors have not provided theoretical insights into how these constants behave for specific designs, which makes it difficult to compare their results with prior work. Instead, they propose to study these constants numerically in the supplementary material. As a result, it is challenging to fully understand the behavior of the estimation error or to identify the designs for which this estimator would be practically useful.
Additionally, I found the paper difficult to follow and not particularly well written. For example, equations corresponding to lines 267, 272, and 284 should be incorporated into the text for clarity. Furthermore, the lower blocks in the definition of matrix U on line 255 appear to be nonsensical.
Overall, I believe this paper has significant room for improvement. The work appears to be somewhat preliminary for acceptance at NIPS. While the authors tackle the problem of unregularized matrix estimation with a PSD constraint, the paper is difficult to read, and the main bound on the estimation error for low-rank matrices relies on quantities whose scaling with n, d, and r remains unexplored.
