The authors introduce innovative upper and lower bounds on the matrix determinant, with applications to estimating the likelihood of a determinantal point process. While the core idea is straightforward, the paper is thoughtfully executed, insightful, and lays the groundwork for numerous potential advancements.
The authors present a novel application of pseudo-inputs to bound functionals of positive definite kernels. The problem addressed is timely and will likely attract significant interest within the research community.
This approach is notably general and holds promise for applications beyond determinantal point processes. The experimental evaluation is well designed, effectively highlighting key insights, including the limitations of a variational approximation under specific conditions. The chosen application area is both compelling and highly pertinent to the problem under investigation.
Minor Comments:
- The emphasis on parameterizing \( K \) (as opposed to \( L \)) in the abstract and throughout the paper is somewhat unclear, as the authors primarily describe the problem without making direct attempts to resolve it.
- If the paper is accepted, I recommend that the authors prepare a standard supplementary document rather than simply uploading an extended version of the paper as the supplement.
Suggestions for Future Work:
- The discussion on the interpretability of the \( K \)-parameterization adds to the appeal of this approach. Could the authors explore the possibility of directly bounding the determinant in terms of the \( K \) matrix? Additionally, what would be the scalability of such an approach when employing the pseudo-input method?
