The introduction would benefit from a clearer articulation of the contributions. Specifically, the distinction between your contributions and those of LCD and BLCD needs to be more explicitly defined.
This paper introduces a novel local search algorithm tailored for graphical relationships, which, under appropriate assumptions, can be interpreted as causal. The technical aspects of the proposed local search algorithm are intriguing.
However, I remain unconvinced that comparing its efficiency to global search algorithms is either fair or particularly insightful.
