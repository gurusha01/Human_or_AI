Comments on Quality:  
The results provide convergence rates for learning algorithms in terms of mixing times, and the derived bounds seem both meaningful and practical.  
The primary concern lies with the lower bound (Theorem 7), which is challenging to interpret. A more detailed discussion of this theorem, as well as the broader implications of the lower bounds relevant to the problem, would be beneficial.  
Comments on Clarity:  
The paper is presented in a clear and comprehensible manner.  
Comments on Originality:  
The problem's framing, specifically through the "fast mixing" model class, and the theoretical results appear to be original contributions.  
Comments on Significance:  
The significance of the work is somewhat ambiguous to the reviewer. However, it appears to address a gap in the literature on learning intractable models via MCMC, which suggests it holds importance.  
The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of its potential impact, including possible future extensions and opportunities for further exploration. By introducing a novel class of tractable models grounded in MCMC-based approximability of expectations, and providing theoretical results on convergence rates for learning these models, the submission presents novel and compelling contributions. As such, it merits acceptance.
