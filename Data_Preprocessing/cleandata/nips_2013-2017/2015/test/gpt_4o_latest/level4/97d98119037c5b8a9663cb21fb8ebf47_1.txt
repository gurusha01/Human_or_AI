Pros:  
1) Investigating iterative stochastic policy optimization addresses an intriguing and relevant problem.  
2) The experimental results are adequately satisfactory.  
Cons:  
1) The presented analysis is restricted to deriving an upper bound for policy evaluation but does not propose an algorithm that leverages this bound. As a result, the analysis feels incomplete, as it does not examine how the two steps—evaluation and optimization—should be integrated.  
2) The theoretical analysis is fairly standard and does not constitute a major novel contribution.  
3) The clarity regarding the tightness of the oracle-like upper bound is lacking. Specifically, it is unclear whether \(\hat{J}_\alpha\) is sufficiently small, for any given \(\alpha\), to make the derived upper bound practically meaningful. Please refer to the comments for further details.
