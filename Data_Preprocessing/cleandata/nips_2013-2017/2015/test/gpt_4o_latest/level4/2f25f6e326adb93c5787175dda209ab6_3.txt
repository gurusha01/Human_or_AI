The paper introduces approximate inference methods for determinantal point processes (DPPs) that bypass the need for spectral knowledge of the kernel defining the DPP. Instead, the authors employ inducing inputs to bound the likelihood, leading to reduced computational costs. Both variational inference and approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches are presented, and their computational efficiency is validated through empirical experiments.
While the paper has potential, I found the methodological exposition somewhat underdeveloped and the empirical evaluation insufficiently comprehensive. Below are some suggestions for clarification:
1) How do the computational complexity and runtime of the two proposed methods compare?
2) How do the proposed approaches perform relative to other existing methods, both approximate and exact, in terms of approximation quality and computational efficiency?
3) The empirical results on the toy dataset in Section 5.1 indicate that the parameter estimation error for variational inference is significant, necessitating reliance on approximate MCMC instead. Under what conditions is the proposed variational inference method expected to succeed, and when might it fail? What are the underlying reasons?
4) For the toy example, a 13-point sample is generated. How do the methods perform when the inducing inputs are chosen to be these sampled points?
5) Is there a heuristic or guideline for determining a) the number of inducing points and b) the placement of the initial inducing points?
Minor comments:
The matrices \( K \) and \( L \) are referenced throughout the introduction without any explanation of their roles. A brief mention of the marginal kernel and L-ensembles would make the paper more accessible to readers unfamiliar with this context.
The paper discusses the benefits of directly learning the marginal kernel parameters, but this approach is not pursued in the proposed methods. Some of this discussion could be reduced, as it does not directly contribute to the main content of the paper.
Inducing inputs are used to bound the DPP likelihood, reducing computational costs. Both variational inference and approximate MCMC methods are described, with their efficiency demonstrated empirically. While the paper has merit, I found the method description somewhat rough and the empirical evaluation lacking in depth. If accepted, I strongly recommend that the authors improve the clarity and presentation of the manuscript.
