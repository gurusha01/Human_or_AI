The authors establish a theorem that enables the high-probability evaluation of a bound on either the cost of a specific policy or the extent to which it might breach predefined constraints. They propose that this approach could serve as a practical method for assessing the convergence of policy search algorithms and validate their framework through experiments on simulated robot navigation, employing RWR as the policy optimization technique.
In general, I found the concept of deriving such a bound to be highly compelling, and the experimental outcomes appear reasonably realistic and fairly persuasive. This work holds promise for stimulating valuable follow-up research and is likely to capture the interest of a broad audience. It offers a noteworthy analysis of policy search by providing bounds on cost or constraint violations, thereby presenting a practical mechanism for evaluating convergence. Beyond its theoretical sophistication, the proposed approach demonstrates significant practical utility, as evidenced by the experimental results.
