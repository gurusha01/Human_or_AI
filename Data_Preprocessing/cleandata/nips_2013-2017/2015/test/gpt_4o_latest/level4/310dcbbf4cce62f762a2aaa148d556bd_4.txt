Since this is a concise review, I will limit myself to a single question: why must boundary cases be treated differently? The condition ρ = q_j does not appear particularly distinct, especially for j > 1. This paper evaluates contextual bandits against a more robust baseline—one that employs adaptive linear programming to strategically skip a specified percentage of suboptimal rounds (referred to as the budget by the authors). The study presents an intriguing framework and innovative solutions.
