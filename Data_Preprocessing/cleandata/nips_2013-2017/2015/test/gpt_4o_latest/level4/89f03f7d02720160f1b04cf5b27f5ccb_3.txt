The paper introduces an algorithm named PEGI, designed to address the noisy ICA problem. This algorithm operates through gradient iteration within a pseudo-Euclidean space, where the inner product is derived from the Hessian of the contrast function (specifically, the kurtosis). The authors demonstrate that the algorithm, with probability 1, successfully extracts the normalized columns of the mixing matrix. Furthermore, they establish that the estimated mixing matrix can be utilized to achieve an SINR-optimal recovery of the sources.
A notable drawback of the proposed method is its reliance on a large number of samples, N, to surpass the performance of standard ICA techniques such as JADE, FastICA, or 1FICA. For instance, in the example presented in Fig. 1a, more than 50,000 samples are required for PEGI to outperform these established methods.
Additionally, when compared to the existing GI-ICA method [21], PEGI does not exhibit significant advantages for large datasets. As shown in Fig. 2, the improvement over GI-ICA for N > 50,000 is marginal at best.
The paper is well-written, and the proposed method demonstrates originality. The theoretical contributions, including the convergence analysis and the optimal SINR reconstruction theorem, are commendable and add to the paper's strengths. However, the aforementioned limitations diminish the overall impact of the method. The authors could enhance the significance of their work by identifying specific signal or noise conditions under which PEGI clearly outperforms standard methods like FastICA or JADE. Without such evidence, the method risks being perceived as yet another addition to the already extensive pool of ICA techniques.
In summary, PEGI is a pseudo-Euclidean space algorithm tailored for noisy ICA. While the paper is clearly presented and offers originality, the performance gains over existing methods are unconvincing, raising concerns that it may simply be another incremental ICA method.
