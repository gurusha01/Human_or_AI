The objective of the paper is to determine the direct causes and effects of a specified variable (target variable). The primary contribution lies in the fact that the authors achieve this without first requiring the discovery of the entire causal graph before narrowing the focus to the neighborhood of the target variable. Instead, their approach directly targets uncovering the local causal structure.
Existing methods are capable of identifying the Markov blanket (MB) of a target variable, as well as a subset of it comprising the set of parents and children (PC) of the target variable. The aim of this paper is to distinguish which nodes in the PC set are parents and which are children of the target.
Significance & Originality:
The contribution of the paper is, in my view, significant. It enhances efficiency and scalability compared to prior approaches, which rely on the intermediate step of global causal discovery to achieve the same objective.
Clarity:
The paper's lack of clarity and flow in several sections is a notable drawback. Certain descriptions are confusing, and I recommend including more explicit explanations, motivating examples, and high-level overviews before delving into technical details.
Specific Comments:
- Introduction (last paragraph): The authors refer to "Local Causal Discovery," which initially led to confusion as it was unclear whether this term referred to prior work or their own method. Since this term overlaps with the paper's title, I suggest changing the title to something more specific, such as "Local Causal Discovery of Direct Causes and Effects." Additionally, the name of the proposed method, "Causal Markov Blanket," feels overly broad and potentially misleading. A unified name for both the title and method, incorporating "direct causes and effects," could be more appropriate.
- Section 3: High-level explanations are needed before diving into technical details. A concise summary of all steps in the proposed method at the beginning of Section 3.2 would improve readability.
- Algorithm 2: There appears to be a potential inconsistency. As I understand it, `IDT` should contain the causal identities of only the PC set of the target variable. However, in Step 1, it is stated that `IDT` includes the causal identities of all nodes, and the algorithm specifies the size of `ID_T` as |V|, where V is the entire variable space, not just the PC set. Clarification on this point is needed.
- Output of Algorithm 2: While the output is `IDT`, it is unclear how this is converted into a CPDAG. For `IDT = 1` and `IDT = 2`, the mapping is straightforward, but for `IDT = 3`, does this imply an indirect edge? Including visual examples of the resulting CPDAG from the algorithm would be helpful.
- Lemma 3: Expanding on why failing to satisfy Lemma 3 results in Markov equivalent structures would be beneficial.
- Page 3: The flow of the text could be improved for better readability.
- Specificity and Terminology: Some parts of the paper could benefit from greater precision:
  - Section 4, first paragraph: The phrase "causal identities for a target node" might be more accurately stated as "causal identities of nodes in the target's PC set."
  - While I understand what a CPDAG is, it would help to define what is meant by the "CPDAG of a target variable." Is this a subset of the original CPDAG containing the target and its parents and children?
  - In the proof of Theorem 3, the phrase "CMB will identify up to a graph's CPDAG" could be clarified. Does this refer to the subset of the CPDAG?
  - Footnote 3: The explanation is unclear and could be rephrased.
  - Section 3.1: The phrase "some V-structure children and spouses" is ambiguous and should be clarified.
  - Section 3.1: The term "PC set of a MB" might be better phrased as "PC set of a target's MB."
  - The terms "local causal discovery of the target" and "local causal nodes of the target" could be reworded for greater clarity.
Quality:
Although I have not verified all technical details, the paper appears to present a well-supported theoretical analysis, complemented by experimental results. The experiments demonstrate significant efficiency improvements over global methods.
Typos:
- Several typos are present in the references section.
- Introduction: "in term" → "in terms."
- Section 3.1: "... no selection bias, every..." → "... no selection bias, that every..."
- Experiments: "along its standard deviation" → "along with its standard deviation"; "As shown in in Table" → remove one "in."
Summary:
The paper makes a significant contribution by providing a more efficient approach to identifying the direct causes and effects of a target variable. However, the presentation could be improved with clearer explanations, better flow, and more visual examples.
