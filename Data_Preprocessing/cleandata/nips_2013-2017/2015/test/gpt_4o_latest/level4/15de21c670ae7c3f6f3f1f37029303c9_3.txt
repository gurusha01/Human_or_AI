A central challenge in Markov networks is weight learning, which involves determining a set of weights (associated with the features) that maximize the likelihood. Typically, gradient descent is employed for this task, with a critical sub-task being the computation of the gradient. As this computation is NP-hard in general, MCMC algorithms are frequently used as an alternative to exact methods.
This paper presents theoretical results demonstrating that if the weights (parameters) are such that MCMC rapidly converges to the stationary distribution, then the weight learning algorithm (which leverages MCMC for gradient computation) constitutes a Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS). The authors analyze two scenarios: the unregularized (convex) case and the ridge-regularized (non-convex) case, deriving distinct bounds for each.
The paper is generally well-written, though it contains a few minor typographical errors. While I was unable to verify all the proofs in detail, they appear plausible.
Although the theoretical results are impressive, their practical utility is minimal to nonexistent (I appreciate that the authors acknowledge this limitation). It seems highly impractical to ensure that the parameters satisfy the constraints required by the theorems. Have the authors considered this issue? Specifically, could this condition be enforced artificially? The condition itself could be interpreted as a form of regularization, but combining it with ridge regression might lead to over-regularized models. If this latter challenge can be addressed, these theoretical results, combined with a practical solution, could significantly strengthen the paper.
In summary, this is a reasonably well-written paper that formalizes the conditions under which MCMC-based weight learning (with and without regularization) constitutes a FPRAS. However, the practical relevance of these conditions is limited. Addressing non-trivial research challenges is necessary before the results in this paper can lead to a practical and accurate algorithm for weight learning.
