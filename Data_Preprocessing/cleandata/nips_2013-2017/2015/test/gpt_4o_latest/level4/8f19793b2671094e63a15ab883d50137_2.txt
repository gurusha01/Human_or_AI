The paper investigates the problem of estimating low-rank semidefinite matrices from noisy inner products with measurement matrices \( X1, \ldots, Xn \). In this context, nuclear norm regularized least squares is the standard approach. However, when \(\Sigma\) is constrained to be positive semidefinite, the nuclear norm simplifies to the trace (a single linear function).
The authors demonstrate that, under specific conditions, \(\Sigma\) can be accurately estimated by solving a constrained least squares problem without the need for this linear regularization. While this is not feasible for general Gaussian measurements, it becomes possible when the measurement matrices \( Xi \) do not have semidefinite matrices in their nullspace (e.g., when the \( Xi \) are full-rank semidefinite matrices), subject to certain conditions.
Theoretical claims are supported by simulations, and the paper also includes a real data experiment. Although the experiment appears somewhat artificial, it aligns with the theoretical results presented.
The primary aim of the paper is to argue that regularization may not be necessary for certain sampling models. A key question is how the theoretical results compare to the best-known results for the regularized problem. Both formulations require the restricted eigenvalue condition, but the separability and correlation conditions seem specific to the constrained least squares approach. Clarifications in the authors' response would be valuable.
For specific random measurement ensembles (e.g., \( Xi = zi zi^* \), where \( zi \) is a random vector, or \( X_i \) is a Wishart matrix), it would be helpful to evaluate \(\mu\), \(\tau\), and \(\phi\), and compare the bound in Theorem 2 to the corresponding result for the nuclear norm regularized variant (11). Comments on this comparison in the response would be useful.
Similarly, while the results in this paper are clearly more general than those in [4]/[10], it would be beneficial to recover the rates of the special case as a consequence of the general theory. Such a comparison would provide a clearer understanding of the strength of the results. The authors' response on this point would be appreciated.
The main practical takeaway of the paper is that, in certain scenarios, selecting a regularization parameter may not be necessary. However, from a computational perspective, there do not appear to be compelling reasons to prefer the constrained least squares formulation (7) over the nuclear norm regularized variant (11).
Overall, the paper presents solid theoretical results, though they feel somewhat under-interpreted. I look forward to the authors' responses to the points raised above, as well as to additional questions regarding the practical motivations for the sampling model.
EDIT: After reviewing the authors' responses regarding the comparison to nuclear norm minimization and the motivations for the sampling model, I have increased my score to a 6.
Smaller Issues:
1. Can \(\mu(T)\) be controlled in terms of \(\phi(T)\) and \(\tau(T)\)? A similar correlation quantity arises in intermediate steps of classical compressed sensing proofs, where it is bounded using restricted isometry constants.
2. The real data experiment involves estimating the best rank-\(r\) approximation of a data covariance matrix using inner products with random Wishart matrices. While the observations broadly support the theoretical claims, the practical motivation for this experiment is unclear. The impact of the paper would be stronger if the proposed method were demonstrated in an application where trace sampling is genuinely constrained.
3. The results rely on special measurements that quantitatively exclude semidefinite matrices from their nullspace. While generic Gaussian measurements do not satisfy this property, Wishart measurements do. Beyond phase retrieval (where this model is somewhat natural), are there other practical scenarios where trace sampling with semidefinite \( X_i \) is relevant?
In conclusion, the paper provides solid, albeit somewhat under-interpreted, results showing that semidefinite constrained least squares can accurately estimate low-rank semidefinite matrices without requiring trace regularization. These results are specific to certain sampling models, particularly those involving inner products with random semidefinite matrices.
