This paper proposes learning a nonparametric graphical model through score matching, which successfully circumvents the requirement to compute the normalizing constant. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided.
Quality: While the nonparametric graphical model and the neighborhood estimation approach are not entirely novel, the notable contribution lies in bypassing the computation of the normalizing constant via score matching. Using an RKHS parameterization, the formulation in Equation (8) is demonstrated to achieve consistency in neighborhood selection.
Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-structured.
Originality and significance: The originality of the paper lies in leveraging score matching to eliminate the need for evaluating the normalizing constant. The proposed score matching objective for learning nonparametric graphical models is independent of normalizing constants, which is an intriguing and valuable idea.
