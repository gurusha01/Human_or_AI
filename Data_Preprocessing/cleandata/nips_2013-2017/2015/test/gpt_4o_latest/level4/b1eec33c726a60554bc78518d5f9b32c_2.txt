The paper addresses the problem of multi-variable regression. It presents an analysis of the ordinary least squares (OLS) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for this problem, offering a characterization of conditions under which the MLE outperforms the OLS estimator. Furthermore, since the MLE estimator involves solving a non-convex optimization problem, the paper provides a finite-sample analysis of the alternating minimization (AM) method for pooled models and seemingly unrelated regression problems, which can be implemented efficiently. For these cases, the paper establishes matching upper and lower bounds for OLS and MLE, as well as upper bounds for the AM-based approach. The analysis effectively highlights scenarios where the MLE or AM approach offers improvements for these problems.
Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to comprehend. The proofs are straightforward and appear to be correct upon inspection. The comparison between MLE and OLS is relatively direct. What stands out in this work is the rigorous derivation of theorems for the AM-based approach.
However, I have a few concerns:  
1. The models analyzed in the paper are all well-specified, but the motivating applications mentioned are more aligned with machine learning problems, where the well-specified assumption rarely holds. The analysis heavily relies on this assumption, which may limit its practical applicability.  
2. The practical significance of the results is unclear. On the experimental side, the paper uses synthetic data. On the theoretical side, while it is evident that the AM and MLE approaches yield better performance, the real-world impact of these improvements is not well-demonstrated. Providing concrete examples of applications where these gains are substantial would strengthen the paper. Additionally, it seems that for the difference between MLE and OLS to be meaningful, the dimensionality of the problem needs to be sufficiently high.  
3. Lastly, the results, while interesting, appear to be slightly outside the typical scope of NeurIPS. The work feels more aligned with classical statistics or econometrics rather than the machine learning focus of the conference.
In conclusion, I would support the acceptance of this paper if space permits. The results are intriguing, but the significance of the findings, particularly in the context of NeurIPS, remains somewhat unclear.
