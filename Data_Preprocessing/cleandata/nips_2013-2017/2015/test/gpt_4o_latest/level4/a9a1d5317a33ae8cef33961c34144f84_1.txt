This paper addresses the important challenge of transforming arbitrary class membership scores into accurately calibrated probabilities.
It seems to present an effective and practical technique that performs well.
The work encompasses both theoretical foundations and algorithmic considerations.
The paper is clearly written and straightforward to understand. It builds upon isotonic regression by employing cross-validation to produce multiple scoring sets and integrating the scores derived from each.
