This paper addresses the challenges of extending the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to high-dimensional latent variable models by proposing a novel regularized EM framework. The authors focus on the critical issue of the M-step, which becomes unstable or undefined in high-dimensional settings, and introduce a method for iterative regularization to balance optimization and statistical errors. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its min-max optimal convergence rates for three applications: sparse Gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with missing covariates.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing the high-dimensional limitations of EM through a unified regularization framework. The iterative regularization strategy, which adapts the regularization sequence to the changing estimation error, is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including conditions for convergence and statistical guarantees. The results are supported by min-max optimal rates, which strengthen the paper's claims.
3. Generality: The framework is applied to three distinct high-dimensional problems, showcasing its versatility. The examples are well-chosen and relevant to the field.
4. Practical Relevance: The proposed method addresses real-world challenges in high-dimensional data analysis, such as sparsity and low-rank structures, making it potentially useful for practitioners.
5. Empirical Validation: The simulation results align with the theoretical findings, providing additional confidence in the proposed method.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the presentation is dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with high-dimensional statistics or regularized optimization. Simplifying some explanations or including more intuitive examples could improve accessibility.
2. Assumptions and Limitations: The paper assumes a well-initialized parameter close to the true value, which may not always be feasible in practice. While this is a common assumption in EM literature, a discussion on initialization strategies or robustness to poor initialization would strengthen the work.
3. Resampling Requirement: The theoretical guarantees rely on a resampling strategy, which is noted as unnecessary in practice. However, this discrepancy between theory and practice is not fully explored or justified.
4. Comparison to Alternatives: While the paper contrasts its approach with prior work (e.g., truncated EM), it would benefit from more empirical comparisons with state-of-the-art methods to highlight its practical advantages.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a novel and theoretically grounded solution to an important problem in high-dimensional statistics. However, the authors should consider revising the manuscript to improve clarity and address the noted limitations. Specifically, a more detailed discussion of initialization, practical implications of resampling, and empirical comparisons would enhance the paper's impact.
Pro and Con Arguments:
Pros:
- Novel and technically rigorous approach to high-dimensional EM.
- Comprehensive theoretical guarantees with min-max optimal rates.
- Applicability to multiple important problems in machine learning.
- Empirical results support theoretical claims.
Cons:
- Dense presentation limits accessibility.
- Assumes good initialization without practical guidance.
