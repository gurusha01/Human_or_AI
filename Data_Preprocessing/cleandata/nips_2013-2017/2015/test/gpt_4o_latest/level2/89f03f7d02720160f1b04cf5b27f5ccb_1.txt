The paper introduces PEGI (Pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), a novel algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of Gaussian noise. The authors address two key challenges in noisy ICA: (1) the limitations of existing algorithms that rely on quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing, and (2) the suboptimality of traditional demixing approaches in terms of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). PEGI operates in a pseudo-Euclidean space, eliminating the need for quasi-orthogonalization, and combines this with SINR-optimal demixing for robust signal recovery. The paper demonstrates PEGI's superior performance through theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, particularly in scenarios with limited samples and high noise.
Strengths:
1. Technical Innovation: The use of a pseudo-Euclidean inner product space is a significant conceptual advancement. It resolves the numerical instability and inefficiency of quasi-orthogonalization, a common bottleneck in existing noisy ICA algorithms.
2. Provable Guarantees: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for PEGI's convergence and SINR-optimality, ensuring the algorithm's reliability.
3. Practical Utility: The SINR-optimal demixing approach is well-motivated and practically relevant for applications like speech separation and EEG artifact removal. The invariance of SINR-optimal demixing to signal/noise decomposition is a particularly novel insight.
4. Experimental Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate PEGI's advantages over baseline algorithms (e.g., FastICA, JADE, GI-ICA) in terms of SINR and sample efficiency. The comparisons highlight PEGI's robustness in noisy settings and its ability to outperform traditional ICA methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the presentation is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the derivation of the pseudo-Euclidean gradient iteration and the SINR-optimal demixing framework. Non-expert readers may struggle to follow the mathematical details.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments focus primarily on synthetic data with specific noise conditions. It would strengthen the paper to include real-world datasets or applications to demonstrate PEGI's practical impact.
3. Complexity of Implementation: Although PEGI eliminates quasi-orthogonalization, the pseudo-Euclidean framework introduces its own complexity. A discussion of computational overhead compared to simpler methods like FastICA would be helpful.
