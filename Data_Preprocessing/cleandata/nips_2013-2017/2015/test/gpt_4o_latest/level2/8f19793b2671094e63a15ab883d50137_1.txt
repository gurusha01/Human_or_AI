This paper investigates the use of constrained least squares estimation for trace regression problems where the underlying matrix is symmetric positive semidefinite (spd). The authors argue that, under certain conditions on the design, this approach can achieve comparable performance to nuclear norm regularization without requiring a tuning parameter. The paper provides theoretical analysis, including bounds on prediction and estimation errors, and supports its claims with numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper challenges the conventional reliance on nuclear norm regularization in trace regression problems and presents a compelling case for constrained least squares estimation as a simpler alternative. This is a fresh perspective in the field.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors derive bounds on prediction and estimation errors, demonstrating that constrained least squares can achieve similar adaptivity properties to regularization-based methods under specific conditions. The theoretical results are rigorous and well-supported.
3. Practical Implications: The absence of a tuning parameter in constrained least squares makes it appealing for practitioners, especially in scenarios where noise levels are unknown or validation data is unavailable.
4. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments are comprehensive, comparing the proposed method to regularization-based approaches across various settings. The inclusion of real-world datasets (CBCL facial images and NASDAQ stock prices) enhances the practical relevance of the work.
5. Clarity in Related Work: The paper provides a thorough review of prior work, situating its contributions within the broader context of trace regression, compressed sensing, and covariance estimation.
Weaknesses:
1. Design Conditions: The paper's theoretical results hinge on specific conditions for the sampling operator \( X \), such as Condition 1 and the separability constant \( \tau^2(T) \). While these are discussed in detail, their practical feasibility and general applicability remain unclear. For instance, the reliance on random spd measurements may limit the method's usability in real-world scenarios.
2. Limited Scope of Noise Assumptions: The analysis assumes Gaussian noise, which, while simplifying the derivations, may not generalize to other noise distributions. This limits the applicability of the results to broader settings.
3. Performance for Larger Ranks: The empirical results suggest that the constrained least squares estimator requires more measurements to achieve competitive performance for higher-rank matrices. This limitation could be better addressed or discussed in the paper.
4. Complexity of Practical Verification: While the authors propose methods to verify conditions like \( \tau^2(T) > 0 \) in practice, these involve solving optimization problems that may not be computationally trivial, especially for large-scale problems.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper addresses an important problem in trace regression with a novel and potentially impactful approach.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-presented.
- The empirical results are thorough and validate the claims effectively.
Cons:
- The reliance on specific design conditions and Gaussian noise assumptions may limit the generalizability of the results.
- The method's performance for higher-rank matrices appears less competitive, which could reduce its practical appeal.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to the field of trace regression. While some limitations exist, the novelty and potential impact of the work outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the practical feasibility of the design conditions and to discuss the limitations regarding noise assumptions and performance for higher-rank matrices.
