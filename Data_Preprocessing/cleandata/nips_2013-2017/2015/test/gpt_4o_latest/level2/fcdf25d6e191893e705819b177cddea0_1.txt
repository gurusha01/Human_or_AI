The paper introduces a novel local causal discovery algorithm, Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), designed to identify the direct causes and effects of a target variable in a causal network. Unlike traditional global causal discovery methods, which aim to reconstruct the entire causal structure, CMB focuses solely on the local structure of a target variable, thereby improving computational efficiency. The authors claim that CMB achieves comparable accuracy to global methods while significantly reducing computational costs, often by more than an order of magnitude. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the soundness and completeness of CMB and demonstrates its performance on benchmark datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The focus on local causal discovery is a meaningful contribution, as it addresses the inefficiency of global methods when only local relationships are of interest. The proposed algorithm is particularly relevant for applications where computational resources are limited or where only specific causal relationships are needed.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed proofs of the soundness, completeness, and consistency of CMB under standard causal discovery assumptions. This theoretical foundation strengthens the validity of the proposed approach.
3. Efficiency Gains: Experimental results demonstrate that CMB achieves significant computational speedups compared to global and local-to-global methods, with comparable or better accuracy. The reduction in Markov Blanket (MB) discovery calls is particularly noteworthy.
4. Clarity of Algorithm: The step-by-step explanation of the CMB algorithm, supported by pseudocode, is clear and facilitates reproducibility. The inclusion of case studies further aids understanding.
5. Comprehensive Evaluation: The use of multiple benchmark datasets and detailed metrics (e.g., missing, extra, and reversed edges) provides a robust evaluation of the algorithm's performance.
Weaknesses:
1. Dependence on Assumptions: The algorithm relies heavily on standard causal discovery assumptions, such as causal sufficiency, faithfulness, and accurate independence tests. While these assumptions are common, their practical validity may limit the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios with latent confounders or noisy data.
2. Scalability Concerns: Although the algorithm is more efficient than global methods, its complexity remains exponential in the worst case, as acknowledged by the authors. This limitation could hinder its application to very large networks.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the authors briefly mention the impact of errors in independence tests and MB discovery, a more detailed analysis of how these errors propagate and affect the final results would be valuable.
4. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: The paper compares CMB with several established methods but omits some recent advancements in causal discovery, particularly those addressing latent variables or non-linear relationships. Including such comparisons would strengthen the evaluation.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Extend the algorithm to handle latent confounders and selection bias, potentially by integrating ideas from algorithms like FCI.
2. Provide a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance under varying data sample sizes and independence test inaccuracies.
3. Explore scalability improvements, such as approximate or heuristic-based methods for MB discovery.
4. Include comparisons with newer causal discovery methods to position CMB more clearly within the state of the art.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant contribution to local causal discovery and demonstrates its potential through theoretical and empirical analysis. While there are some limitations, particularly regarding assumptions and scalability, the work is well-executed and addresses an important problem in causal inference. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses and expand the discussion of limitations and future work.
