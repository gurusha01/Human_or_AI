This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic approach for active model selection, which is applied to the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework that selects the next observation to make based on the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The approach is demonstrated to be effective in diagnosing NIHL with fewer samples than existing approaches.
The paper is well-motivated, and the problem of NIHL diagnosis is clearly explained. The authors provide a thorough review of the related work and clearly distinguish their approach from existing methods. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the BAMS framework and its application to Gaussian process models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel approach for active model selection that does not require model retraining to evaluate candidate points.
* The provision of an effective and efficient analytic approximation to the BAMS criterion that can be used for automatically learning the model class of Gaussian processes with arbitrary observation likelihoods.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach in diagnosing NIHL with fewer samples than existing approaches.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a specific form for the observation likelihood, which may not be applicable in all scenarios.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other active learning approaches, such as uncertainty sampling and query by committee.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical contributions. The approach is significant, and the results are promising. However, further work is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in different scenarios and to compare it with other active learning methods.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel approach for active model selection that has significant technical contributions.
