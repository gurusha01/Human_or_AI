This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, and propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution. The paper is well-written, and the model choices and approximations are clear.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution, and the development of efficient algorithms for estimating the model parameters. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed model on several datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing dependencies between words.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. One potential issue is that the paper assumes a fixed length for the documents, which may not be realistic in many applications. The authors address this by proposing a weighting function to scale the dependencies for different document lengths, but it is not clear how effective this approach is in practice.
Another area for improvement is the evaluation of the model. While the paper provides perplexity results on several datasets, it would be useful to see more qualitative analysis of the dependencies captured by the model. For example, the authors could provide more examples of the positive and negative dependencies discovered by the model, and discuss their interpretation and relevance to the application domain.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new distribution and several new models that use this distribution as a base. The paper also develops new algorithms for estimating the model parameters, which is a significant contribution. However, the paper builds on existing work on topic models and Multinomial distributions, and the authors could provide more discussion of how their work relates to and advances the state of the art in these areas.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing. The proposed model and algorithms have the potential to be widely applicable and to advance the state of the art in topic modeling and text analysis.
