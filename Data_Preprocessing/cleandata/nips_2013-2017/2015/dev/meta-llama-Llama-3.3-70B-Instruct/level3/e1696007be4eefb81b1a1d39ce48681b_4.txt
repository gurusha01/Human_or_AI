This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, and propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution. The paper is well-written, and the proofs are clear and easy to follow.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution, and the development of efficient algorithms for estimating the parameters of the LPMRF model. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed model on several datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing dependencies between words.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The technique's generalizability to other instances of atomic norm analysis is questioned, and the paper's scope is narrow, only considering sparse linear regression with already available key results. Additionally, the paper's connection to previous work, such as the Admixture of Poisson MRFs model, could be further explored.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a new distribution and develops novel algorithms for estimating its parameters. The paper's significance is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
