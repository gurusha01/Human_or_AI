This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, providing sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions on discrete distributions. The authors achieve bounds on partial recovery of node labels with high probability for sparse and semi-sparse regimes, building upon previous work by Abbe and Sanders (2015) and removing the restriction of needing knowledge of model parameters.
The paper's strengths include its original algorithm with a mathematically rigorous proof, making it a state-of-the-art method for community recovery. The authors also provide significant contributions in terms of information-theoretic bounds and algorithms introduced. However, the paper lacks numerical comparison of performance with other methods of community detection and has poor clarity, with key algorithms and definitions buried in supplementary materials.
The technical subtlety of the paper makes it more suited for a journal publication. Despite this, the paper's contributions are substantial, and with clearer presentation and generalization to more complex network models, it has the potential to be even more impactful.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm for community recovery with strong theoretical guarantees.
* The authors provide significant contributions to the field of distribution testing, including information-theoretic bounds and algorithms.
* The paper builds upon previous work and removes restrictions, making it a substantial advancement in the field.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper lacks numerical comparison with other methods, making it difficult to evaluate its practical performance.
* The poor clarity and organization of the paper, with key algorithms and definitions in supplementary materials, may hinder understanding and reproduction of the results.
* The paper's technical subtlety may make it less accessible to a broader audience, potentially limiting its impact.
Overall, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and with revisions to address the clarity and comparison issues, it has the potential to be a highly impactful contribution to the field.
