This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors propose agnostic algorithms for partial and exact recovery of communities in SBMs, which do not require knowledge of the model parameters. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including their accuracy and complexity, and demonstrates their effectiveness through experiments on real data.
The paper's main strengths lie in its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors introduce a novel approach to community detection, which is based on a graph-splitting step and the use of sign-invariant statistics. The analysis of the algorithms is rigorous and well-supported by theoretical results, including a sharp characterization of the local procedure error. The paper also demonstrates the practical significance of the proposed algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art results on real data.
However, there are some areas for improvement in terms of clarity. The paper is densely written, and some sections require careful reading to understand the technical details. Additionally, the authors could provide more intuition and explanations for the key concepts and techniques used in the paper, such as the graph-splitting step and the sign-invariant statistics.
The paper's significance is high, both theoretically and practically. The proposed algorithms provide a new approach to community detection, which can be applied to a wide range of networks and datasets. The paper's results also have implications for other areas of research, such as network science and machine learning.
