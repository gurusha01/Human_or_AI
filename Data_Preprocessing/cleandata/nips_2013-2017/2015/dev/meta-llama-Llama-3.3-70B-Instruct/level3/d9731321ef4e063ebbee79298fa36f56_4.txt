This paper introduces a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, and propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution. The paper is well-written and clear, nicely outlining the steps for approximating model evidence, hyperparameter posterior, and predictive distributions.
The authors' work applies a novel technique to the problem of active model selection using symmetry of mutual information to simplify an intractable quantity. The problem of model selection is significant, and the proposed method shows promise in addressing this challenge. The application presented has some limitations, such as only selecting among prior means and not the covariance kernel, and may not be the most convincing example of the method's potential.
The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the background and related work, and their proposed method is well-motivated and clearly explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPMRF distribution in modeling dependencies between words in text data.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper could benefit from more extensive experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the method's robustness and applicability to different domains. Additionally, the authors may want to consider exploring other potential applications of the LPMRF distribution beyond topic modeling.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution. The paper is well-written, and the proposed method shows promise in addressing the challenge of model selection.
