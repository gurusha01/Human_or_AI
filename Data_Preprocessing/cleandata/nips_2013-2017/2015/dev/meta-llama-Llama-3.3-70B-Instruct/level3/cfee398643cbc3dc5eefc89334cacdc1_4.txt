This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, providing sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions on discrete distributions. The authors' approach is based on a novel use of the 2 statistic, which enables them to achieve optimal sample complexity.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of their approach and techniques. The writing is generally clear, although some of the proofs and technical details may require careful reading to fully understand.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide matching lower bounds for the sample complexity of the testers, which demonstrates the optimality of the authors' approach. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of their algorithms, which is essential for practical applications.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors assume knowledge of the relative sizes of communities, which can be difficult to determine beforehand, especially in social networks with long-tailed community structures. Additionally, the single real-world data test may not be sufficient to prove the concept, and more tests on various real networks would be necessary to demonstrate the algorithm's robustness.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and relate them to previous work in the field. They also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their approach and provide a list of arguments for and against acceptance.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more intuitive explanations for the theorems and technical results, which would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
* Consider adding more real-world data tests to demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and practical applicability.
* Discuss the potential limitations and challenges of the approach, such as the assumption of knowing the relative sizes of communities, and provide possible solutions or future directions for research.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, and with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance at the conference.
