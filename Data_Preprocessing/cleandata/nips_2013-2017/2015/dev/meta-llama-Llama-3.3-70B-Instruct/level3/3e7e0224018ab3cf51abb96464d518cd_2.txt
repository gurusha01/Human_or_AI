This paper presents a significant contribution to game theory by providing a bound on the price of anarchy for coarse correlated equilibria. The authors achieve this by reducing games to several full information games, which is a notable achievement. However, the paper is difficult to read and lacks generality, with an unclear setup and notation. For instance, the definition of empirical distributions of values in population P_i is not clearly explained.
The main issue with the paper lies in Lemma 10, where the hypothesis and convergence of a subsequence of D^T are not clearly explained, leading to questions about the validity of the proof. The rest of the paper appears to be correct, but the issues with Lemma 10 need to be addressed for the paper to be considered acceptable.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper's subject may not be of significant interest to the NIPS community, despite being an okay paper that extends price of anarchy results to Bayesian games. The paper's quality is good in terms of technical soundness, but it lacks clarity and originality. The authors provide a novel combination of familiar techniques, but the paper's significance is limited by its lack of generality and unclear notation.
Here are the arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a significant contribution to game theory by bounding the price of anarchy for coarse correlated equilibria.
* The authors provide a novel combination of familiar techniques.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper is difficult to read and lacks generality.
* The setup and notation are unclear, particularly in Lemma 10.
* The paper's subject may not be of significant interest to the NIPS community.
* The paper lacks originality and significance due to its limited scope and unclear notation.
Overall, I would recommend that the authors revise the paper to address the issues with Lemma 10 and improve the clarity and generality of the paper. With significant revisions, the paper could be considered for acceptance. However, in its current form, I would recommend rejection.
