This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, providing sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions on discrete distributions. The authors' approach is based on a novel use of the 2 statistic, which enables them to achieve optimal sample complexity for testing monotonicity, log-concavity, monotone hazard rate, and unimodality.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of their approach and techniques. The writing is generally clear, although some sections are dense and require careful reading. The use of notation is consistent, and the authors provide helpful definitions and explanations of key concepts.
One of the strengths of the paper is its thoroughness. The authors provide detailed proofs of their results, including lower bounds, which demonstrate the optimality of their testers. They also discuss related work and provide a clear comparison with existing results.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's claims. The authors dismiss the statistics literature as focusing on the large sample regime, but this is not entirely accurate. Many statistical tests can be made exact by simulating the null distribution, which can be done even in the small sample regime. Furthermore, the authors' claim that their test is a true finite sample test is not entirely convincing, as it still relies on assuming a large enough sample size to guarantee a certain type I error rate, similar to asymptotic tests.
Additionally, the use of a discrete cube as the sample space for testing monotonicity may not be the most practical or realistic choice. In practice, people often use monotonicity tests for continuous random variables, and it is not clear how the authors' results would extend to this setting.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, but it requires careful evaluation and consideration of its limitations. The authors' approach is innovative and well-executed, but it is essential to critically assess their claims and consider the broader implications of their results.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and innovative approach to distribution testing.
* The authors provide detailed proofs of their results, including lower bounds.
* The paper is well-organized, and the writing is generally clear.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The authors' dismissal of the statistics literature is not entirely accurate.
* The use of a discrete cube as the sample space for testing monotonicity may not be practical or realistic.
* The authors' claim that their test is a true finite sample test is not entirely convincing.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the concerns mentioned above, particularly regarding the limitations of their approach and the accuracy of their claims. Additionally, they should consider providing more discussion on the practical implications of their results and how they might be extended to continuous random variables.
