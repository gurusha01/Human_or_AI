This paper presents a novel approach to stochastic optimal control using a Gaussian process to model trajectories. The method is based on a probabilistic interpretation of the control problem, which allows for efficient computation of the optimal control policy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through a series of experiments, showing that it can compete with existing methods.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the proposed solution, while the technical sections provide a detailed explanation of the methodology. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach.
However, there are some areas that require clarification and improvement. The problem formulation section is confusing due to the two optimizations involved, and the authors need to clarify the relationship between the optimal control and the proposal control. Additionally, the organization of the paper could be improved by rearranging subsections to enhance readability and clarity.
The definition of the Gaussian process in section 3.1 is confusing and contradicts the definition in Eq (2), and the authors should clarify the initialization of the GP model. The formulation of the GP model update seems to ignore the cost of the current control sequence, and the authors should clarify if this is a generalization of PI control or another policy search method.
The use of belief propagation for forward inference may fail in non-Gaussian dynamics, and the authors should address this potential problem. The notation used in the paper is unclear, and the authors should use different notation to distinguish between model-based and model-free approaches.
The comparison with existing PI-related methods is good, but some remarks are needed to clarify the relationships between the proposed approach and other methods. Minor issues include unclear sentences, typos, and formatting errors that need to be addressed.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting idea with a working method that can compete with existing ones. However, there are some areas that require clarification and improvement to make the paper more readable and convincing.
