This paper presents a novel approach to learning an approximately revenue-maximizing auction from data, leveraging tools from statistical learning theory. The authors introduce the concept of t-level auctions, which interpolate between simple auctions and optimal auctions, allowing for a trade-off between expressivity and simplicity. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the pseudo-dimension of the set of t-level auctions, demonstrating that it is modest, and shows that this leads to small learning error. The authors also prove that the representation error of t-level auctions can be bounded, ensuring that they can approximate the optimal auction arbitrarily closely.
The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and easy to follow. The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the problem, including a review of related work, and carefully explain the technical concepts and notation used throughout the paper. The analysis is rigorous and well-supported by theoretical results, making a strong case for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical relevance. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their approach to various auction settings, including single-item auctions, matroid settings, and arbitrary single-parameter settings. The paper also provides a detailed discussion of the implications of the results, including the potential for significant improvements in auction design and revenue maximization.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more direct comparisons to similar approaches and practical examples to illustrate the propositions. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a running example to connect the technical material to specific problems, making it more accessible to a broader audience.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the literature on auction design and learning theory. The application of theoretical developments in sub-modular function optimization to the Adaptive Stochastic Optimization problem is novel and capitalizes on existing results. The paper also provides new insights into the trade-off between expressivity and simplicity in auction design, highlighting the importance of balancing these competing demands.
Overall, the paper has significant potential impact due to the generality of the setting and the relevance of the results to practical auction design. While the current presentation does not make a strong case for this potential, the paper provides a solid foundation for future research and has the potential to influence the development of more effective auction design methods.
