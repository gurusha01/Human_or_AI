This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), for solving adaptive stochastic optimization problems over both sets and paths. The algorithm is designed to work with pointwise monotone submodular functions and provides a polynomial-time approximation guarantee. The authors introduce two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximation of adaptive stochastic optimization problems.
The paper is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the problem, related work, and the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide several theorems that establish the performance guarantees of the RAC algorithm. The experimental evaluation is also comprehensive, with two case studies on noisy informative path planning tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm that can handle adaptive stochastic optimization problems over both sets and paths.
* The introduction of two conditions, MLRB and MLB, which provide a framework for understanding the performance of approximation algorithms for these problems.
* The thorough theoretical analysis and performance guarantees provided for the RAC algorithm.
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the RAC algorithm in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the objective function is pointwise monotone submodular, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires the computation of the marginal likelihood of each history, which can be computationally expensive.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing algorithms for adaptive stochastic optimization problems.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adaptive stochastic optimization and provides a valuable framework for solving these problems. The RAC algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including robotics, finance, and healthcare.
