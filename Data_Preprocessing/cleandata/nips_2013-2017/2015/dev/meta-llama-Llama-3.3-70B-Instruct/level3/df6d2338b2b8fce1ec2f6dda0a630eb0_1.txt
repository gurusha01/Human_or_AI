This paper proposes a novel recursive algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), for adaptive stochastic optimization on paths with near-optimal guarantee on expected cost. The algorithm leverages two conditions, Marginal Likelihood Rate Bound (MLRB) and Marginal Likelihood Bound (MLB), to characterize the relationship between the probability of a realization and its utility. The paper is well-written and well-structured, providing a clear introduction to the problem of adaptive stochastic optimization and the proposed solution.
The technical contribution of the paper is novel and provides interesting insights into developing tractable algorithms for adaptive stochastic optimization problems. The authors provide strong empirical evidence to support the proposed solution, demonstrating its effectiveness in two robot planning tasks under uncertainty. The algorithm's performance is compared to existing heuristic algorithms, including greedy algorithms that optimize information gain, and is shown to outperform them.
The paper's strengths include its ability to handle adaptive stochastic optimization problems on both sets and paths, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches that are limited to optimization over sets. The proposed algorithm is also shown to be robust to noisy observations, making it applicable to real-world scenarios.
However, the paper could be improved with more intuitive explanations of the MLRB and MLB conditions, which may be challenging for non-experts to understand. Additionally, more experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm to existing ones would be beneficial to further demonstrate its effectiveness.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, making it easy to follow. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The originality of the paper lies in its proposal of a novel algorithm for adaptive stochastic optimization on paths, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a unique combination of familiar techniques, including submodular optimization and recursive algorithms.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to impact various fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and operations research. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including planning and learning under uncertainty.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of adaptive stochastic optimization and provides a novel and effective solution to a challenging problem.
