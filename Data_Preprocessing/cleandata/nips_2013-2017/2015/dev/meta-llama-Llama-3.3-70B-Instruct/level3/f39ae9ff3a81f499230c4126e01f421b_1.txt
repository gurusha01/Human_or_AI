This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The LPMRF distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model but is restricted to a fixed-length vector, making it more suitable for modeling count-valued data such as text documents. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, which was not possible with the PMRF model.
The paper's idea of restricting the support of the partition function to vectors of the same total length/norm is interesting, but it lacks empirical illustration and comparison to other models. To strengthen the approach, the authors should explore connections to related work, such as factorizing the multinomial distribution into binary random variables with dependencies. Additionally, the paper's benefits over existing approaches are not clearly presented, and more comparisons, such as the one presented in Table 1, would be beneficial.
The proposal of a novel Poisson MRF with an application to LDA is refreshing, and revisiting the multinomial approach underlying most machine learning baselines is a positive aspect of the paper. However, the authors should compare their approach to a truncated Poisson LDA and the PMRF topic model to showcase its benefits and justify its novelty.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The authors provide a good introduction to the problem and related work, and the methodology is well-explained. The experimental results are promising, and the qualitative analysis of the LPMRF parameters is interesting. The timing and scalability results show that the algorithms are fast and have good scaling.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is original, and the problems or approaches are new. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper provides a unique contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way and provides unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the ideas are interesting and well-presented. With some additional comparisons and empirical illustrations, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
