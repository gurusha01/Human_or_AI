This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, providing sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions on discrete distributions. The authors achieve this by introducing a novel use of the 2 statistic, which enables them to obtain optimal sample complexity for testing monotonicity, log-concavity, monotone hazard rate, and unimodality.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of their approach and techniques. The testing algorithm is decomposed into three steps: near-proper learning in 2-distance, computation of distance to the class, and 2-testing. The authors demonstrate the separation in the means and variances of the test statistic in the two cases of interest, i.e., p belonging to the class C versus being far from it.
The paper's strengths include:
1. Sample-optimality: The authors provide matching lower bounds for most classes, demonstrating that their testers are sample-optimal.
2. Computational efficiency: The testers have a reasonable time complexity, making them practical for implementation.
3. Novel technique: The use of the 2 statistic is a new and innovative approach to distribution testing.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
1. Readability: The paper is dense and may be challenging for non-experts to follow. The authors could improve the clarity of their explanations and provide more intuitive examples to illustrate their techniques.
2. Lack of concrete examples: While the paper provides some theoretical examples, it would be beneficial to include more concrete examples or applications to demonstrate the practicality of their testers.
3. Comparison to previous work: The authors could provide a more detailed comparison of their results to previous work in the field, highlighting the improvements and advantages of their approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, originality, and significance. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the previous work in the field and provide a significant contribution to the area of distribution testing.
