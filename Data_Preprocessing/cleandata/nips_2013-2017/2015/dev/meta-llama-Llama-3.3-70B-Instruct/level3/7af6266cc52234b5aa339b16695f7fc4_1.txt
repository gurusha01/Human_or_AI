This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) over both sets and paths, leveraging ideas from machine learning literature. The authors introduce two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximation of ASO with pointwise submodular objective functions. The proposed algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over either a set or a path domain, if the objective function satisfies the MLRB or the MLB condition and is pointwise monotone submodular.
The paper's strengths include its ability to generalize previous results on adaptive submodular optimization to paths, and its application to two robot planning tasks under uncertainty, demonstrating promising results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations.
However, there are some limitations to the approach. The usefulness of the proposed algorithms relies on timely and available correct information, which may not be viable if true samples are only available in the distant future. Additionally, the proposed market algorithm requires a known loss function, which limits its practical applications if the object of prediction is not known. Furthermore, the system can be gamed if past true samples or prediction divergence measures are used to evaluate the worth of new training data, highlighting a fundamental catch-22 in setting up a cost function.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a significant contribution to the field of ASO, providing a novel approach to optimizing objective functions under uncertainty.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations.
* The paper generalizes previous results on adaptive submodular optimization to paths, expanding the scope of applicable problems.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The limitations of the approach, including the reliance on timely and available correct information and the requirement of a known loss function.
* The potential for the system to be gamed, highlighting a fundamental catch-22 in setting up a cost function.
* The need for further experimentation and evaluation to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a well-written and well-structured contribution to the field of ASO, with a clear and concise presentation of the proposed approach and its limitations. While there are some limitations to the approach, the paper's strengths and contributions make it a valuable addition to the field.
