This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs), introducing efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters. The authors develop agnostic algorithms for both partial and exact recovery in the constant and diverging node degrees regimes, achieving optimal accuracy and complexity scaling.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The technical sections are detailed and provide a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and their analysis. The authors also provide experimental results on real data, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The provision of a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including their complexity and accuracy.
* The experimental results on real data, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns:
* The paper's format is not suitable for a conference submission, as it is more fitting for a journal submission due to its length and level of detail.
* The authors have disclosed their names in the supplementary material, which may raise concerns about anonymity.
* The paper bears similarities to another existing paper, with the authors also claiming ownership of that paper, which may raise concerns about originality and novelty.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a significant contribution to the field. However, the concerns about format, anonymity, and originality need to be addressed.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in SBMs.
* The algorithms introduced in the paper achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms and experimental results on real data.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's format is not suitable for a conference submission.
* The authors have disclosed their names in the supplementary material, which may raise concerns about anonymity.
* The paper bears similarities to another existing paper, with the authors also claiming ownership of that paper, which may raise concerns about originality and novelty.
Overall, while the paper presents a significant contribution to the field, the concerns about format, anonymity, and originality need to be addressed before it can be considered for acceptance.
