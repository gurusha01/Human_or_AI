This paper presents a novel approach to active model selection, which is a crucial problem in machine learning and statistics. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework that selects the next data point to observe by maximizing the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The key idea is to choose the data point that maximizes the expected reduction in uncertainty about the model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of active model selection. The methodology is sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real-world application, namely, the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The results show that BAMS can diagnose NIHL with high accuracy and using significantly fewer samples than existing approaches.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective approach to active model selection
* The application of the approach to a real-world problem with significant practical implications
* The thorough evaluation of the approach using simulations and comparisons with baseline methods
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the relationship between the estimator variance and the error in the model selection problem
* The notation is generally clear, but there are some minor issues with consistency and formatting that need to be addressed
* The relevance of the paper to the NIPS audience is not entirely clear, and the authors could provide more context and motivation for why this work is important for the machine learning community
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of active model selection and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. With some revisions to address the minor issues mentioned above, the paper could be even stronger.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to active model selection
* The approach is thoroughly evaluated using simulations and comparisons with baseline methods
* The application to NIHL diagnosis has significant practical implications
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the relationship between the estimator variance and the error in the model selection problem
* The notation and formatting could be improved for clarity and consistency
* The relevance of the paper to the NIPS audience is not entirely clear.
