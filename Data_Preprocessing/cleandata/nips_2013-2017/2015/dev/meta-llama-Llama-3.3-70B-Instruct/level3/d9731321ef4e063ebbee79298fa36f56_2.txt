This paper presents a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The LPMRF distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model but is restricted to a fixed-length vector, making it a more suitable distribution for documents. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, which was not possible with the Poisson MRF model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for the need for a more flexible distribution than the Multinomial. The LPMRF distribution is shown to be effective in capturing positive dependencies between words, and the authors demonstrate its usefulness in topic modeling. The paper also presents a generalization of topic models using fixed-length distributions, which allows for the LPMRF distribution to be used as a base distribution.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and significance. The LPMRF distribution is a new and interesting contribution to the field, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of its properties and applications. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient background information and related work to make the paper accessible to a wide audience. The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve topic modeling and other applications where the Multinomial distribution is currently used.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One of the main limitations is the lack of experimental comparisons to other approaches, such as the Admixture of Poisson MRFs model. The authors mention that they could not compare to this model because it is not computationally tractable to calculate the likelihood of a test instance, but it would be useful to see some comparison to other models to evaluate the performance of the LPMRF distribution.
Another limitation is the simplicity of the experimental setup. The authors evaluate the perplexity of the LPMRF models on two datasets, but it would be useful to see more extensive experiments on a wider range of datasets and tasks. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis of the results, such as exploring the effect of different hyperparameters on the performance of the LPMRF models.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the LPMRF distribution and its properties. The claims made in the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved, such as providing more experimental comparisons and analysis of the results.
Overall, I would recommend this paper for acceptance, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of topic modeling and distributional semantics. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the LPMRF distribution and its properties. While there are some limitations to the paper, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
