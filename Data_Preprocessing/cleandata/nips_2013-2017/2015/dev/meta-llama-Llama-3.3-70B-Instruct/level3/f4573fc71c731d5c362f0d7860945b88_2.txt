This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), for adaptive stochastic optimization problems over both sets and paths. The authors introduce two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximation of adaptive stochastic optimization problems with pointwise submodular objective functions.
The paper is well-structured and well-written, with a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed algorithm, and its theoretical analysis. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through experiments on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm that can handle adaptive stochastic optimization problems over both sets and paths, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The introduction of two new conditions, MLRB and MLB, which provide a framework for understanding the performance of approximation algorithms for adaptive stochastic optimization problems.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RAC algorithm, which demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency.
* The experimental evaluation of the algorithm on two real-world tasks, which shows its potential for practical applications.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The experiment section could be improved by comparing the proposed method with more recent, state-of-the-art methods and running the algorithm on larger datasets to demonstrate scalability.
* The paper has some minor issues, including inconsistent formatting in figures and citations not being in NIPS format, but overall is well-written and clear.

Overall, I recommend accepting this paper because of its significant contribution to the field, its clear and well-structured presentation, and its potential for practical applications. However, I suggest that the authors address the minor issues and improve the experiment section to demonstrate the scalability of their algorithm.
