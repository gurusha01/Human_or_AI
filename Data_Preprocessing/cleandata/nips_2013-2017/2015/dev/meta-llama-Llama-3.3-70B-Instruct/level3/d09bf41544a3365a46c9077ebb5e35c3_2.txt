This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, providing sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions on discrete distributions. The authors' approach, which utilizes a novel application of the 2 statistic, enables them to achieve optimal sample complexity for several classes of distributions, including monotone, log-concave, monotone hazard rate, and unimodal distributions.
The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their testing algorithm, including a detailed examination of the 2 statistic and its concentration properties. The paper is well-organized, and the authors do an excellent job of explaining the intuition behind their approach.
One of the paper's main contributions is the development of a general framework for testing distribution classes, which can be applied to various shapes and properties. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to several distribution classes, including monotonicity, log-concavity, and monotone hazard rate.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more context and background information on the related work in the field, particularly in the introduction. Additionally, some of the technical proofs and lemmas could be clarified or simplified to improve the paper's readability.
