This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of auction theory and learning, extending the concept of price of anarchy bounds to Bayesian games through the lens of stochastic games with a large population of participants. The authors demonstrate two key results: the convergence to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium with no-regret learning and the smoothness of the stochastic game if the original game or mechanism is smooth.
The paper's main strength lies in its ability to balance the competing demands of expressivity and simplicity in auction design. The introduction of t-level auctions provides a novel approach to interpolating between simple auctions and optimal auctions, allowing for a tunable "sweet spot" that enables designers to trade off between near-optimality and learnability.
However, the paper's presentation and clarity could be improved. The writing appears to be geared more towards the game theory community, and some sections may be difficult for non-experts to follow. Additionally, the paper seems to be a "cut and paste" from an extended version, which may have resulted in a lack of specificity and clarity in certain sections.
Several questions and concerns arise from the paper. For instance, the choice of correlated equilibrium is not fully justified, and the lack of proof for certain theorems and lemmas may raise concerns about the paper's technical soundness. Furthermore, the realism of the approach using a central entity to learn the auction may be limited in practice.
Despite these concerns, the paper's main result – the extension of price of anarchy bounds to learning outcomes in Bayesian games – has significant implications for the quality of these outcomes. The paper's contribution to the literature on simple approximately revenue-maximizing auctions is also noteworthy, providing a principled way to trade off the simplicity of an auction with its approximation guarantee.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The approach is novel, and the results have important implications for the field. However, the paper's clarity and presentation could be improved to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
