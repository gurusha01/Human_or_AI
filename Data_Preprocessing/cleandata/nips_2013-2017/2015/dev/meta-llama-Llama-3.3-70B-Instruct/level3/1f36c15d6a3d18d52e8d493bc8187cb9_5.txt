This paper introduces a novel approach to active model selection, which is a crucial problem in machine learning and statistics. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework that selects the next data point to observe by maximizing the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The key insight of this approach is that it does not require retraining the models for each candidate point, making it more efficient than previous methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a real-world application, namely, the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The results show that BAMS can diagnose NIHL with high accuracy and using significantly fewer samples than existing approaches.
One of the strengths of this paper is that it addresses a significant problem in the field of machine learning and statistics. The authors provide a novel solution that is both theoretically sound and practically effective. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, making it easy to follow.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the practical relevance of the testing problems and potential extensions to non-discrete distributions. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons to existing methods and a more detailed analysis of the results.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
In terms of originality, the paper introduces a novel approach to active model selection, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide a unique combination of familiar techniques, making the paper a valuable addition to the existing literature.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a significant problem in the field of machine learning and statistics, and the results have the potential to impact the diagnosis of NIHL. The paper also provides a novel solution that is both theoretically sound and practically effective, making it a significant contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and statistics.
