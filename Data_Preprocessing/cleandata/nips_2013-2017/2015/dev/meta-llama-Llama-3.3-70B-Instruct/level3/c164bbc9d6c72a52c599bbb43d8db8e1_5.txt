This paper proposes a novel approach to community detection in the stochastic block model (SBM) without requiring knowledge of the model parameters. The authors develop agnostic algorithms that achieve optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and attain the CH-divergence limit for logarithmic node degrees. The paper makes significant contributions to the field, providing the first algorithms that afford efficiency, universality, and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the SBM.
The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithms, including proofs of their correctness and efficiency. The presentation is well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The paper also introduces new techniques, such as the use of sign-invariant statistics and the Agnostic-sphere-comparison algorithm, which are likely to be of interest to researchers in the field.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The experimental evaluation is limited, and the authors could have provided more comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other methods, such as Acc-FG, to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.
Some potential concerns and suggestions for improvement include:
* The authors assume that the number of communities, k, is independent of n. It would be interesting to explore how the algorithms perform when k grows with n.
* The paper focuses on the constant and logarithmic degree regimes. It would be useful to investigate the performance of the algorithms in other regimes, such as the power-law degree distribution.
* The authors mention that their approach can be extended to overlapping communities, but this is not explored in detail. A more thorough investigation of this extension would be valuable.
Overall, the paper makes significant contributions to the field of community detection and provides a solid foundation for future research. With some additional experimentation and analysis, the authors can further strengthen their results and demonstrate the practical impact of their algorithms.
