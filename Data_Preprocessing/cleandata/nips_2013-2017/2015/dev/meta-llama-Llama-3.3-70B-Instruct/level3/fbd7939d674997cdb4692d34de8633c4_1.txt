This paper proposes a novel approach to learning approximately revenue-maximizing auctions from data, leveraging concepts from statistical learning theory. The authors introduce t-level auctions, a simple and expressive family of auctions that interpolate between basic auctions and optimal auctions. They demonstrate that the empirical revenue-maximizing t-level auction achieves revenue that is (1 - ε)-optimal with a sample size in O(1/ε^3), providing a significant improvement over existing results.
The paper explores the connection between learning theory and auction theory, providing a thorough review of previous work in this area. The authors show that the pseudo-dimension of the set of t-level auctions is O(nt log nt), which leads to a sample complexity upper bound. They also prove that taking t = Ω(H/ε) yields low representation error, ensuring that the learned auction is close to the optimal auction.
The strengths of this paper include its novel approach to auction design, its thorough analysis of the sample complexity, and its connections to learning theory. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow their arguments. The paper also raises interesting open questions, such as the design of computationally efficient algorithms for learning near-optimal auctions and the extension of these results to multi-parameter settings.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The explanations of some technical concepts, such as the payment rule and the equivalence classes, could be simplified and clarified. Additionally, the authors could provide more intuition behind certain equations and proofs, making it easier for non-experts to understand the material.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of auction theory and learning theory, providing a new and promising approach to designing approximately revenue-maximizing auctions. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and have important implications for practice.
