This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors introduce efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters. The paper's results overlap with previous work, particularly [8], but its value lies in its ability to handle non-strongly convex functions and its provision of a generic acceleration method for first-order optimization.
The algorithm combines Nesterov's acceleration scheme with the proximal point operator, similar to [9], but with more realistic assumptions of approximate minimization. The method of proof for strongly convex and general convex cases seems similar, raising the question of whether a new idea is needed to extend the method of [8] to non-strongly convex functions.
The paper presents an accelerated version of Finito/MISO, which bears similarities to a variant of SDCA, but lacks a comparison with SDCA in the experimental results. However, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and its ability to handle various scenarios, including constant and diverging node degrees.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to provide optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and its achievement of the CH-divergence limit for logarithmic node degrees. The paper also provides a sharp characterization of the local procedure error, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of comparison with SDCA and the similarity in the method of proof for strongly convex and general convex cases. Additionally, the paper's assumptions on p and k being independent of n could be slightly relaxed, which is left for future work.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The paper's contributions are significant, and its results have the potential to impact the field of community detection in SBMs.
