This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors introduce a generic scheme to accelerate several optimization methods, extending the domain of applicability of some methods and making non-trivial contributions. The paper is well-written, with clear and convincing experimental results that are original and carefully contextualized within the state of the art.
The main strength of the paper lies in its ability to provide efficient algorithms for community detection in SBMs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters. The authors develop agnostic algorithms for the constant and diverging node degrees, achieving optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and the CH-divergence limit for logarithmic node degrees. The paper also provides a sharp characterization of the local procedure error, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The paper's technical soundness is evident in its rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The authors provide a detailed proof of their results, including the development of new techniques such as the Agnostic-sphere-comparison algorithm and the Agnostic-degree-profiling algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world data.
One potential weakness of the paper is the assumption of linear-sized communities, which may not always hold in practice. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential extensions to smaller sized or more communities, watching the complexity scaling.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, including the use of shortest path and graph-splitting steps. The authors also provide a unique perspective on the problem of community detection, highlighting the importance of developing benchmarks that do not depend sensitively on the knowledge of the model parameters.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of community detection and network analysis. The proposed algorithms have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, from social network analysis to biological network analysis. The paper's results also provide new insights into the fundamental limits of community detection, which can inform the development of new algorithms and techniques.
