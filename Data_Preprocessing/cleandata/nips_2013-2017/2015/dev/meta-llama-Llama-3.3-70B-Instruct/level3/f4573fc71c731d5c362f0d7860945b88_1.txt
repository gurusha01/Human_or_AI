This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) by introducing two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximate solution of ASO problems. The authors develop a polynomial-time algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over both sets and paths, leveraging these conditions. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty.
The paper's main strengths include:
1. Novel conditions: The introduction of MLRB and MLB conditions provides a new framework for understanding ASO problems and enables the development of efficient algorithms.
2. Polynomial-time algorithm: RAC is a significant contribution, as it provides a polynomial-time solution to ASO problems, which are generally computationally intractable.
3. Theoretical guarantees: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including approximation bounds and performance guarantees, which demonstrate the effectiveness of RAC.
4. Experimental evaluations: The experiments on two robot planning tasks demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of RAC in real-world scenarios.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Assumptions: The algorithm's performance relies on the satisfaction of MLRB and MLB conditions, which may not always hold in practice.
2. Computational complexity: While RAC is polynomial-time, its computational complexity may still be high for large-scale problems.
3. Limited applicability: The algorithm's applicability is currently limited to pointwise monotone submodular functions, which may not cover all ASO problems.
To improve the paper, the authors could:
1. Provide more examples: Including more examples of ASO problems that satisfy MLRB and MLB conditions would help illustrate the algorithm's applicability.
2. Investigate relaxations: Exploring relaxations of the MLRB and MLB conditions could lead to more widely applicable algorithms.
3. Compare to existing methods: A more comprehensive comparison to existing ASO algorithms would help establish the strengths and weaknesses of RAC.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of ASO, providing a novel framework and efficient algorithm for solving these problems. With some further refinements and extensions, the work has the potential to impact a wide range of applications in planning and learning under uncertainty.
