This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) by introducing two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximate solution of ASO problems. The authors develop a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over both sets and paths. The algorithm is evaluated on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice.
The paper's strengths include its ability to integrate various models and techniques competently, providing a comprehensive framework for ASO. The writing quality is reasonably good, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The results are modestly significant, proposing a new approach to learning with distributed data while ensuring differential privacy.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The motivation for the proposed approach could be stronger, and the narrative is somewhat untraditional. The tools used are not original, although some combinations appear to be novel. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the theoretical analysis and experimental results.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to ASO, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The algorithm developed, RAC, has been evaluated on two robot planning tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice.
* The paper provides a comprehensive framework for ASO, integrating various models and techniques.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The motivation for the proposed approach could be stronger.
* The narrative is somewhat untraditional, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
* The tools used are not original, although some combinations appear to be novel.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of ASO and provides a comprehensive framework for solving these problems. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing more detailed explanations of the theoretical analysis and experimental results, as well as strengthening the motivation for the proposed approach.
