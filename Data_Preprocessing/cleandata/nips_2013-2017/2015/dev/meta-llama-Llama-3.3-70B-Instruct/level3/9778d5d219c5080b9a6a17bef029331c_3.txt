This paper presents a novel approach to active model selection, which is a crucial problem in machine learning and has numerous applications in various fields, including medicine. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework, which is based on maximizing the mutual information between the response to a query and the posterior on the model class. The key idea is to select the next query that maximizes the expected information gain about the model, rather than the traditional approach of selecting the next query that minimizes the uncertainty about the model parameters.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of active model selection and its importance in real-world applications. The proposed BAMS framework is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the underlying mathematical framework. The paper also includes a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on a real-world application, namely, the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed BAMS framework is novel and has the potential to be a useful tool for active model selection in various applications.
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of active model selection and its importance in real-world applications.
* The paper includes a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on a real-world application, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing approaches to active model selection, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed BAMS framework.
* The evaluation of the proposed approach is limited to a single application, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the approach on multiple applications to demonstrate its generalizability.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to large datasets.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to active model selection, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and its importance in real-world applications. However, there are some areas for improvement, including a more detailed comparison with existing approaches and a more thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple applications.
