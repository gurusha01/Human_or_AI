This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) over both sets and paths, introducing two conditions - the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB) - that enable efficient approximation of ASO with pointwise submodular objective functions. The authors derive statistical consistency guarantees for low-rank matrix estimators and propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), which guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over either a set or a path domain.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to ASO, the introduction of new conditions that enable efficient approximation, and the proposal of a polynomial-time algorithm with theoretical performance guarantees. The experimental results on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty demonstrate the effectiveness of RAC in practice.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. Certain sections, such as 5 and 5.1, are difficult to follow due to undefined terms like "spikiness" that are crucial to understanding the main theoretical result. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on generating row/column graphs from the movielens dataset, with vague descriptions that need clarification. The absence of an RMSE table for three large datasets makes it unclear if the proposed method's RMSE is equal to or poorer than other methods.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of ASO, but could benefit from improvements in clarity and presentation. The results are important, and the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The writing is generally good, but some sections require careful reading and could be improved with additional explanations and definitions.
