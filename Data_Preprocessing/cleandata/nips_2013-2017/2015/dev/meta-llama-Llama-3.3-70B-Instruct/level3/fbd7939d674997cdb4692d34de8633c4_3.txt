This paper presents a novel approach to learning revenue-maximizing auctions from data, leveraging concepts from statistical learning theory. The authors introduce the concept of t-level auctions, which interpolate between simple auctions and optimal auctions, balancing expressivity and simplicity. The main contribution of the paper is the existence of a class of auctions that contains a nearly optimal auction as t grows.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their work, discussing the challenges of designing revenue-maximizing auctions in traditional economic approaches. They also provide a thorough overview of related work in the field, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing research.
The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a rigorous analysis of the pseudo-dimension of the set of t-level auctions, which is a key concept in learning theory. Theorem 3.3, which bounds the pseudo-dimension of the set of t-level single-item auctions, is a significant result, and the authors provide a clear and concise proof.
The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the representation error of single-item t-level auctions, showing that for every bounded product distribution, there exists a t-level auction with expected revenue close to that of the optimal single-item auction. Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.5 are important results, and the authors provide a clear and intuitive explanation of the underlying ideas.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's interest to the NIPS audience. While the paper presents a novel approach to learning revenue-maximizing auctions, it may not be directly applicable to the broader machine learning community. The paper assumes a strong background in auction theory and learning theory, which may limit its appeal to researchers without expertise in these areas.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more motivation and background on auction theory, as well as more examples and illustrations to help non-experts understand the concepts. Additionally, the authors could discuss potential applications of their approach to other areas of machine learning, such as mechanism design or game theory.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I evaluate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is technically sound, but could benefit from more examples and illustrations)
* Clarity: 8/10 (the paper is well-written, but assumes a strong background in auction theory and learning theory)
* Originality: 9/10 (the paper presents a novel approach to learning revenue-maximizing auctions)
* Significance: 8/10 (the paper has significant implications for auction theory and mechanism design, but may not be directly applicable to the broader machine learning community)
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, but suggest that the authors revise it to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
