This paper introduces a novel approach to active model selection, which is applied to the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The proposed method, Bayesian Active Model Selection (BAMS), selects the next point to query in order to better distinguish between a set of models without requiring retraining of the models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BAMS in a real-world application, showing that it can diagnose NIHL with drastically fewer samples than existing approaches.
The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and well-written explanation of their approach. The application to NIHL is well-motivated and interesting, and the results are impressive. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and the advantages of their approach over existing methods.
However, the paper lacks theoretical justification and discussion of the limitations of the approach. The authors rely heavily on simulated data and limited comparisons to other methods, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate the effectiveness of BAMS. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the pros and cons of the method, including its potential limitations and areas for future improvement.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, significance, and clarity. The authors propose a novel approach to active model selection, which has the potential to make a significant impact in the field. The application to NIHL is also significant, as it has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment of this widespread and preventable disability.
The weaknesses of the paper include its lack of theoretical justification, limited empirical evaluation, and lack of discussion of key issues such as selecting candidate points or models. The authors could also provide more details on the implementation of BAMS and its computational efficiency.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the limitations mentioned above. The authors should provide more theoretical justification for their approach, a more detailed analysis of the pros and cons of BAMS, and a more comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness.
