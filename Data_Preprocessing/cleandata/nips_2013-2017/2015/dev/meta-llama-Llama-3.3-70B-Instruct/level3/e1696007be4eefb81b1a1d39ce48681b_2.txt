This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The LPMRF distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model but is restricted to a domain with a fixed vector length, making it a more suitable distribution for documents. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, which was not possible with the Poisson MRF model.
The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the LPMRF distribution and its properties, as well as a description of the parameter estimation methods. The paper also includes a thorough evaluation of the LPMRF model on several datasets, including a comparison with Multinomial-based models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution
* The development of AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function
* A thorough evaluation of the LPMRF model on several datasets
* A clear and well-organized presentation of the material
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the LPMRF distribution and its parameter estimation methods, which may make it difficult to implement and use in practice
* The lack of comparison with other models that allow for dependencies between dimensions, such as the Admixture of Poisson MRFs model
* The limited exploration of the connections between the LPMRF topic model and Gibbs sampling, which could be an interesting area of future work
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of topic modeling and provides a promising new direction for research. The LPMRF distribution has the potential to be a useful tool for modeling count data with dependencies between dimensions, and the authors' evaluation of the model on several datasets demonstrates its effectiveness.
