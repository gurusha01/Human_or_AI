This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors introduce agnostic algorithms for partial and exact recovery of communities in SBMs, which do not require knowledge of the model parameters. The proposed algorithms, Agnostic-sphere-comparison and Agnostic-degree-profiling, achieve optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and attain the CH-divergence limit for logarithmic node degrees.
The paper extends previous work on SBMs by removing the assumption of known parameters, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of their correctness and efficiency. The use of sign-invariant statistics and graph-splitting steps is a novel approach that allows for the estimation of eigenvalues and community assignments without requiring knowledge of the parameters.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas, making it easy to follow their arguments. The paper also demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics and the ability to apply it to solve a complex problem.
One potential weakness of the paper is the requirement of a lower bound on the relative sizes of the communities in the constant degree regime. However, the authors show that this requirement can be removed when working with diverging degrees. Additionally, the paper assumes that the number of communities is fixed and independent of the number of nodes, which might not be the case in all real-world scenarios.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide efficient and universal algorithms for community detection in SBMs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters. This makes it a valuable contribution to the field, with potential applications in network analysis, machine learning, and data science.
