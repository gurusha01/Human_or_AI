This paper presents a novel approach to online F-measure optimization, a challenging problem due to the non-decomposable nature of the F-measure. The proposed algorithm, Online F-measure Optimizer (OFO), is a simple and efficient method that converges to the optimal F-score when the posterior estimates are provided by a sequence of classifiers with a certain convergence rate.
The paper is technically sound, with detailed proofs and extensive experiments in the supplemental file, demonstrating its strong technical foundation. The discussion in Session 6 is particularly interesting, highlighting the challenges of analyzing regret bounds in general online learning and the differences between the proposed approach and existing methods.
One potential area for improvement is the variance of the unbiased estimate of h(τ), which could be explored further to better understand its properties. Additionally, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of the assumptions required for the online learner and the role of the decomposition step in handling noisy estimation of h(.).
The paper is well-written and organized, but minor issues such as errors in equations and unclear notations need to be corrected for better readability. The idea of studying online optimization of the non-decomposable F-score metric is novel and contributes to the originality of the paper.
The paper has significant implications for the online learning community, as it raises further research interest in exploring properties of fundamental quantities and addressing challenging open problems in F-measure optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the OFO algorithm, and its ability to perform well in practice.
