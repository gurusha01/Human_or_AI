This paper introduces a novel approach to active model selection, specifically designed for Gaussian process models with arbitrary observation likelihoods. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework, which selects the next data point to query by maximizing the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The approach is demonstrated to be effective in a real-world application, namely, rapid screening for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of active model selection and its importance in machine learning. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the BAMS framework and its application to Gaussian process models.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical applications. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for the BAMS framework, including a detailed derivation of the mutual information criterion and its approximation using the Laplace method. At the same time, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a real-world application, using a clinical trial dataset to evaluate the performance of the BAMS algorithm in detecting NIHL.
The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, as it addresses a critical problem in model selection, which is the selection of the next data point to query. The authors show that the BAMS framework can be used to select the most informative data points, which can lead to faster and more accurate model selection.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for active model selection. While the authors compare their approach with random sampling and uncertainty sampling, it would be useful to see a more comprehensive comparison with other methods, such as query-by-committee or active learning using Bayesian neural networks.
Another potential area for improvement is the evaluation of the BAMS framework on more diverse datasets. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a clinical trial dataset, it would be useful to see how the approach performs on other types of datasets, such as image or text data.
