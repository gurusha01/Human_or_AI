This paper presents significant advancements in recovering cluster structure in the stochastic block model (SBM), particularly when the number of clusters is unknown. The authors introduce efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs, even without knowledge of the model parameters. The results are novel and deep, providing a substantial contribution to the field.
The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The algorithms proposed are innovative and efficient, achieving optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees. The authors also provide a sharp characterization of the local procedure error, which is a significant contribution to the field.
However, the paper's writing quality is poor, with notations introduced in later sections, making it difficult to understand the results. The paper has a large amount of supplementary material (47 pages), which suggests that it may be a summary of a full journal paper and may not be suitable for the NIPS format. The algorithm proposed in the paper is vaguely described, requiring reliance on the supplementary material to understand it, which is not ideal for a NIPS submission.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents novel and significant results in recovering cluster structure in the SBM, even with an unknown number of clusters.
* The algorithms proposed are efficient and achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs.
* The paper provides a sharp characterization of the local procedure error, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The writing quality is poor, making it difficult to understand the results.
* The paper has a large amount of supplementary material, which may not be suitable for the NIPS format.
* The algorithm proposed is vaguely described, requiring reliance on the supplementary material to understand it.
Overall, while the paper has some significant strengths, its poor writing quality and excessive supplementary material are notable weaknesses. With revisions to address these issues, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field. 
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on originality, significance, and quality, but poorly on clarity. The paper is well-organized, but the writing style and notation make it difficult to follow. The results are important and have the potential to impact the field, but the presentation needs significant improvement. 
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on clarifying the writing, introducing notations earlier, and providing a clear and concise description of the algorithm. Additionally, the authors should consider reducing the amount of supplementary material and ensuring that the paper is self-contained. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field and a good fit for the NIPS conference.
