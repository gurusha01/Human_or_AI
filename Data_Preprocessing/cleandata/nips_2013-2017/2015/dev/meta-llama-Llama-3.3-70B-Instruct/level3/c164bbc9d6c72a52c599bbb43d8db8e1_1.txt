This paper presents a novel approach to community detection in the stochastic block model (SBM) without requiring knowledge of the model parameters. The authors propose two algorithms, Agnostic-sphere-comparison and Agnostic-degree-profiling, which achieve optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and attain the CH-divergence limit for logarithmic node degrees.
The paper has some new technical contributions, but the main idea and theoretical results are not mature enough and have several limitations. The algorithm proposed has limitations, including the choice of kappa and the solution of the subproblem, which can affect its overall complexity and convergence guarantee. The convergence theorems provided have dependencies on unknown optimal values and do not precisely reflect the real number of iterations, making the overall complexity potentially worse than existing methods.
The authors' decision to fix kappa in Algorithm 1 is not a good idea, as adaptively updating kappa is crucial, especially in the accelerated scheme. Extending the algorithm to composite form has issues, particularly when the regularizer does not have a low-cost proximal operator, requiring such an operator at each iteration. The convergence analysis is not rigorous and can be improved by exploiting ideas from other methods, such as sliding gradient or conditional gradient methods.
The paper lacks strong technical contributions and rigorous backing for its extensions and modifications, despite some numerical experiments showing advantages of the method. The results are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results, and the authors are not careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
