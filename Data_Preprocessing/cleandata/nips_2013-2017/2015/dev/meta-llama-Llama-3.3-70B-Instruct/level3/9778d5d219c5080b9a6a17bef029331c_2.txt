This paper introduces a novel approach to active model selection, which is a crucial problem in machine learning and statistics. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) method that selects the next data point to observe by maximizing the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The key insight of this approach is to focus on the model selection problem directly, rather than trying to learn the underlying model parameters.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of active model selection. They also provide a thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the BAMS algorithm.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex models, such as Gaussian processes, and to provide an efficient and effective approximation to the model evidence and hyperparameter posterior. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a real-world problem, namely the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).
The results of the paper are impressive, and the authors show that their approach can diagnose NIHL with high accuracy and using significantly fewer samples than existing approaches. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the sampling strategy employed by the BAMS algorithm, which is logical and intuitive.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise derivation of the BAMS algorithm. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a crucial problem in machine learning and statistics, and provides a novel and effective approach to active model selection.
The originality of the paper is also high, as the authors propose a new approach to active model selection that is distinct from existing methods. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and related work.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the BAMS algorithm.
