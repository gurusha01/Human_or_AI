This paper introduces a novel approach to active model selection, which is a critical problem in machine learning and statistics. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework that selects the next data point to observe by maximizing the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The key insight is to avoid model retraining by using a Laplace approximation to the hyperparameter posterior and a marginal Gaussian process (MGP) approximation to the predictive distribution.
The paper makes significant contributions to the field of active learning and model selection. The proposed BAMS framework is general and can be applied to various models, including Gaussian processes with arbitrary observation likelihoods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a real-world application, namely, rapid screening for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The results show that BAMS can diagnose NIHL with drastically fewer samples than existing approaches, making it a promising tool for large-scale screenings.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The technical details are sound, and the experiments are well-designed and thoroughly evaluated. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the advantages of their approach over existing methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical applications. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their approach, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world setting. The paper also highlights the importance of model selection in machine learning and statistics, which is often overlooked in favor of more traditional problems like parameter estimation.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with other active learning and model selection methods, particularly in the context of NIHL diagnosis. Additionally, the authors could explore the application of their approach to other domains, such as image classification or natural language processing.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution.
