This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of adaptive stochastic optimization, introducing two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximate solution of adaptive stochastic optimization problems over both sets and paths. The proposed algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees near-optimal solution of adaptive stochastic optimization problems on paths and sets, under certain conditions.
The paper's strengths include its solid and robust theoretical foundation, building upon previous work in submodular optimization and adaptive stochastic optimization. The introduction of the MLRB and MLB conditions provides a new perspective on the problem, and the RAC algorithm is a novel and effective solution. The experimental evaluation on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty demonstrates the algorithm's performance and potential for real-world applications.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The text assumes a good understanding of previous work, particularly reference [9], and could benefit from more explanation of Rao-Blackwellisation. The experimental evaluation is limited, and the results do not demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy. The paper lacks clear definitions of key terms, such as "pseudotree", "schematic", and "MLN", which can cause confusion for readers. Additionally, the rules and algorithms presented in the paper are complex and could be simplified with minimal descriptions.
The paper's quality is good, but there are some errors, such as missing words and unclear statements, which can affect its overall clarity and validity. The conclusion drawn from the experimental results in Section 6 is not entirely valid, and the fixed time budget is not clearly explained as the reason for decreased accuracy.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the introduction of the MLRB and MLB conditions is a significant contribution to the field. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper clearly explains how it differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in adaptive stochastic optimization, providing a new perspective and effective solutions for real-world applications. The results are important, and other researchers and practitioners are likely to use these ideas or build upon them.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some refinements, it can be even more effective in conveying its message and demonstrating its impact.
