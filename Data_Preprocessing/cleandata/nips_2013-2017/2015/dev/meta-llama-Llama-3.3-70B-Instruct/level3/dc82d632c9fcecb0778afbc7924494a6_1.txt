This paper introduces a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) by proposing two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximate solutions for pointwise monotone submodular functions. The authors present a polynomial-time algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that guarantees near-optimal solutions for ASO problems on both sets and paths. The algorithm is evaluated on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to other heuristic algorithms.
The paper is well-written and clear, presenting sound ideas and a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance. The introduction of the MLRB and MLB conditions provides a new perspective on ASO problems, and the authors demonstrate their usefulness in deriving approximation bounds for RAC. The experimental results show that RAC outperforms other algorithms in terms of average cost, particularly when optimizing the Gibbs error function directly.
However, there are some limitations to the evaluation. The authors only compare RAC to a few heuristic algorithms, and it would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the evaluation is limited to two specific tasks, and it would be interesting to see how RAC performs on a wider range of ASO problems.
The paper's significance lies in its contribution to the field of ASO, providing a new algorithm and theoretical framework for solving these problems. The results have the potential to impact various applications, such as planning and learning under uncertainty, and the authors demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in two practical scenarios.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel approach to ASO, providing a new perspective on the problem and a polynomial-time algorithm with guaranteed near-optimal solutions.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RAC compared to other heuristic algorithms.
* The paper is well-written and clear, presenting a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and its significance to the field.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The evaluation is limited to two specific tasks and a few heuristic algorithms, which may not be representative of the broader range of ASO problems.
* The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and a wider range of experimental results.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of ASO, and its results have the potential to impact various applications. While there are some limitations to the evaluation, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a good candidate for acceptance.
