This paper introduces the concept of t-level auctions, which discretize each bidder's bid space into levels, and the bidder whose bid falls on the highest level wins and pays the lowest value that falls on its lowest level required to win. The authors provide bounds on the number of samples needed to find an approximately revenue-maximizing auction and the difference in revenue between the revenue-maximizing t-level auction and the optimal auction.
The paper's results are technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in single-item auctions and generalize their results to matroid settings and single-parameter settings, showcasing the technical quality and novelty of their work. The introduction of t-level auctions is a significant contribution to the literature on simple approximately revenue-maximizing auctions.
However, a potential issue with the t-level auction is that bidders may choose to report the lowest value on their interval instead of their true value, potentially losing information about subsequent bidder valuations. Additionally, the reviewer is skeptical about the practical importance of revenue-maximizing auctions, as they may not capture the fact that bidders make decisions over time and maximizing short-term revenue may not coincide with long-term revenue.
The paper's results are mentioned to hold for other tie-breaking rules, but the specific rules are not specified, leaving a minor question about whether results hold when ties are broken uniformly at random. Nevertheless, the paper's contributions to the literature on auction design and learning theory are significant, and the results have important implications for the design of simple and efficient auctions.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide sufficient background information and references to related work, demonstrating a good understanding of the field. The paper's originality and significance are also notable, as it introduces a new approach to learning revenue-maximizing auctions and provides bounds on the sample complexity of learning such auctions.
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of auction design and learning theory, and its results have the potential to impact the design of simple and efficient auctions in practice. The arguments for and against acceptance are:

* The paper contributes to the literature on simple approximately revenue-maximizing auctions.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The practical importance of revenue-maximizing auctions may be limited.
* The paper does not address the potential issue of bidders reporting the lowest value on their interval instead of their true value.
* The specific tie-breaking rules for which the results hold are not specified.
