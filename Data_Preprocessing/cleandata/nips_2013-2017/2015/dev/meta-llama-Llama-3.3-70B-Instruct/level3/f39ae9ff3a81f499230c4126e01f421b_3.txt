This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The LPMRF distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model but is restricted to a fixed-length vector, making it more suitable for modeling count-valued data such as text documents. The authors develop an efficient method to approximate the log partition function using sampling techniques, which is then applied to topic modeling.
The paper presents a clear and well-organized introduction to the problem of modeling dependencies between words in text documents, and the limitations of the Multinomial distribution in this regard. The proposed LPMRF distribution is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of its properties and advantages over existing models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPMRF model in capturing dependencies between words and improving perplexity performance compared to Multinomial-based models.
However, the paper lacks details on the estimation of the topic model, making it difficult to follow, and requires more analysis on the fit with actual word counts. Additionally, the experimental section is found to be insufficiently thorough, with some desired results, such as recovering the original 3-way partition of Classic3, not being presented.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is good, making it easy to follow. The novelty of the approach is significant, and the paper provides a unique contribution to the field of topic modeling.
The significance of the results is also high, as the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The proposed LPMRF model has the potential to advance the state of the art in topic modeling and provide a more accurate representation of word dependencies in text documents.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed LPMRF model is a significant contribution to the field of topic modeling. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the topic model estimation and more thorough experimental results.
