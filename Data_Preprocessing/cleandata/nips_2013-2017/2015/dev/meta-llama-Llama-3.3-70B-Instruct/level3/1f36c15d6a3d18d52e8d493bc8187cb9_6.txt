This paper presents a novel approach to active model selection, which is a crucial problem in machine learning and statistics. The authors propose a Bayesian active model selection (BAMS) framework, which selects the next data point to be observed by maximizing the mutual information between the observation and the model posterior. The key contribution of this paper is the development of an analytical approximation to the BAMS criterion, which allows for efficient computation and avoids the need for model retraining.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and background of the problem. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly distinguish their approach from existing methods. The technical sections of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the BAMS framework and its application to Gaussian process models.
The experimental results presented in the paper are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BAMS approach in diagnosing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) with a small number of observations. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the sampling strategy employed by BAMS, which is logical and intuitive.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The authors assume a discrete distribution with a support that grows with the number of observations, which is not commonly used in statistics. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the connections to statistics and the potential limitations of the approach. Additionally, the authors claim that any log-concave distribution is unimodal, which is incorrect, and the definition of log-concavity in Section 2 allows for counterexamples.
The paper also lacks a clear explanation of the distinction between the continuous and discrete cases, and the citation from Birges (1987) only deals with density estimation. The authors should provide a more accurate statement of the rate for testing log-concavity and clarify the relevance of the result.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of active model selection, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a real-world application. However, the paper could benefit from some revisions to address the areas mentioned above.
