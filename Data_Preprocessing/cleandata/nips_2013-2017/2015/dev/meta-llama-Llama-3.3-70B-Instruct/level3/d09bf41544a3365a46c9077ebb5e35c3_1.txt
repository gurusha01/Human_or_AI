This paper presents a novel approach to testing whether a given discrete distribution belongs to a specific class of distributions or is far from it. The authors provide a general framework for testing various shape restrictions, including monotonicity, independence, log-concavity, unimodality, and monotone hazard rate. The proposed algorithm is based on a robust 2-`1 identity test, which distinguishes between the cases where the distribution is close to the class in 2-distance or far from it in total variation distance.
The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to understand, with good performance on an interesting task. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of the related work and the challenges of testing shape restrictions. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, including the development of a novel testing algorithm and the provision of matching lower bounds for the sample complexity of the testers.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors introduce a new approach to testing shape restrictions, which is based on a robust 2-`1 identity test. The algorithm is shown to be sample-optimal and computationally efficient, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its performance. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion of the related work and the challenges of testing shape restrictions.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. One potential weakness is that the algorithm may not be applicable to all types of distributions, and the authors may need to develop additional techniques to handle more complex cases. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons to other testing algorithms and a more detailed discussion of the practical implications of the results.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing and provides a novel approach to testing shape restrictions.
