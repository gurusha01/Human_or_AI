This paper introduces a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) by proposing two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximate solution of ASO problems. The authors develop a polynomial-time algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over both sets and paths, leveraging these conditions. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty.
The paper's strengths include its contribution to the understanding of lifted inference algorithms, the introduction of a new algorithm that expands the set of problems that admit efficient approximate solutions, and the provision of theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RAC in practice, outperforming other algorithms in terms of average cost.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The proposed schematics are not simple enough to provide significant insights, and the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the framework relates to other similar techniques, such as dtrees, first-order NNF circuits, and first-order decomposition trees. Additionally, the experimental setup could be improved with more details, such as the choice of evidence predicates and their impact on symmetries. The theoretical analysis is also difficult to follow, and some typos and areas needing clarification were found.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and provides well-supported claims through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces new conditions and an algorithm that contributes to the state of the art in ASO. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides unique insights and conclusions.
