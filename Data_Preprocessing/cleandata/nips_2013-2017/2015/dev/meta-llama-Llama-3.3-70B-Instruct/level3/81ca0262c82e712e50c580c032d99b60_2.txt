This paper proposes a novel approach to testing whether a discrete distribution belongs to a specific class of distributions or is far from it. The authors provide sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions, including monotonicity, independence, log-concavity, unimodality, and monotone hazard rate. The technique is based on a robust 2-`1 identity test, which distinguishes between the cases where the 2-distance between two distributions is small or the total variation distance is large.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem and its related work. The technical correctness of the paper is high, and the results are significant, advancing the state of the art in this area. The use of a novel 2-statistic and the development of a forward-backward approach are notable contributions.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The authors could provide more clarity in some key steps, such as the derivation of the recursive form of Φ and the move from equation 7 to 8. Additionally, the paper would benefit from numbering all equations to make it easier to refer to them in reviews and discussions.
The results of the paper are significant, and the authors provide matching lower bounds for most classes, demonstrating the optimality of their testers. The paper also provides a useful building block for proper learning of discrete log-concave and monotone hazard rate distributions.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and concise abstract, introduction, and related work section, which helps to understand the context and significance of the paper. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper to the conference. The paper makes significant contributions to the field, and the results are well-presented and easy to follow. With some minor revisions to address the clarity issues, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
