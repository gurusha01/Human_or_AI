This paper proposes an online algorithm for optimizing the F-measure in binary classification tasks, which is a non-decomposable performance metric. The algorithm is based on a stochastic approximation approach and is shown to converge to the optimal F-score when the posterior estimates are provided by a sequence of classifiers with a certain convergence rate. The paper provides a formal analysis of the algorithm's consistency and presents experimental results on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in both one-pass learning and online learning scenarios.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to online F-measure optimization, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its extensive experimental evaluation. The algorithm is simple and efficient, and its consistency is established under reasonable assumptions on the classifier's convergence rate. The experimental results show that the algorithm performs on par with the 2-stage F-measure maximization approach, which requires a hold-out validation set, and that it can be applied in a pure one-pass learning scenario.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper's organization could be improved, with some sections feeling redundant or delayed in their presentation. The comparison to recent frameworks for optimizing non-decomposable measures is not fully clear, and the lack of experimental comparison is surprising. Additionally, the analysis of the algorithm's convergence rate is not fully developed, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning and performance metric optimization, and its results have the potential to be useful in a variety of applications. The arguments in favor of acceptance include the paper's novelty, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its extensive experimental evaluation. The arguments against acceptance include the paper's organization and the lack of comparison to recent frameworks.
