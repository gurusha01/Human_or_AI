This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors introduce efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters, making it a valuable addition to the existing literature. 
The paper is well-written, and the presentation is clear, indicating effective communication of the research. The work is original, offering new insights and perspectives on the topic, and the paper is significant to the community, addressing the problem of label order in classifier chain multi-label classification and proposing effective algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is superb, providing enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its ability to develop agnostic algorithms for the constant and diverging node degrees, achieving optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and the CH-divergence limit for logarithmic node degrees. The authors also provide a sharp characterization of the local procedure error, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper is evident in its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results are important, and other researchers are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing unique data, conclusions, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
