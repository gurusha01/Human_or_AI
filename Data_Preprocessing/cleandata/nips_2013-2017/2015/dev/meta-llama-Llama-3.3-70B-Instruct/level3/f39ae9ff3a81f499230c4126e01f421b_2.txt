This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson Markov Random Fields (LPMRF) distribution, which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The authors develop a tractable approximation to the LPMRF log partition function, allowing for likelihood-based hyperparameter estimation and model evaluation. They also propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution and demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPMRF distribution over Multinomial models through perplexity experiments on a dataset of abstracts and Wikipedia.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for the need for a more flexible distribution than the Multinomial. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the experiments demonstrate the potential of the LPMRF distribution. However, there are some concerns regarding the scalability of the model, as the number of parameters in the Poisson MRF scales in order O(L^2) with L being the number of words in the lexicon. This may limit the applicability of the model to large texts.
The assumption that document length obeys a Poisson or Normal distribution may not hold true for actual texts, which often follow a Gamma distribution. The model may be more suitable for domains with a lower number of dimensions, rather than natural languages, where indirect construction using word embeddings might be a more appropriate approach.
The authors need to conduct experiments on larger and more diverse datasets to demonstrate the model's usefulness and compare it with more suitable baselines, such as Gaussian LDA with word embeddings. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed analysis of the relationships between the LPMRF topic model and other topic models, such as the Admixture of Poisson MRFs.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution.
* The authors develop a tractable approximation to the LPMRF log partition function, allowing for likelihood-based hyperparameter estimation and model evaluation.
* The experiments demonstrate the potential of the LPMRF distribution over Multinomial models.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The scalability of the model is a concern, as the number of parameters in the Poisson MRF scales in order O(L^2) with L being the number of words in the lexicon.
* The assumption that document length obeys a Poisson or Normal distribution may not hold true for actual texts.
* The model may be more suitable for domains with a lower number of dimensions, rather than natural languages.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are sound. However, the concerns regarding scalability and the assumption of document length distribution need to be addressed. With additional experiments and analysis, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
