This manuscript seeks to determine the minimum number of observations required to differentiate an unknown distribution $p$ from a class of distributions $\mathcal{C}$, where the differentiation is based on a total variation distance of at least $\epsilon$. The classes of distributions $\mathcal{C}$ considered include monotone, log-concave, unimodal, and monotone hazard rate distributions.
Several questions and comments are raised to assist the authors in improving the manuscript:
A. Motivations: The rationale behind imposing shape-related constraints on discrete distributions needs further clarification. Discrete distributions are primarily used for modeling frequencies of observed objects and counting data. Applying monotone constraints to these distributions implies imposing an ordinal structure, which may not be naturally applicable to all objects.
B. Theory: 
B1. Theorem 1's proof requires independence between observations $X_i$ and the newly drawn distribution $q$, which should be explicitly stated, especially if the observations used to estimate $q$ are not discarded.
B2. The application of Lemma 5 in the monotone case has a gap, as it provides an expectation of $\chi^2(p,q)$ rather than the actual value required for Theorem 1.
B3. The distinction between the continuous and discrete cases, particularly in relation to Birges (1987), needs clarification, as Birges' work is cited but primarily deals with density estimation.
B4. The statement that any log-concave distribution is unimodal is incorrect based on the definition provided, and counterexamples can be constructed.
B5. The rate for testing log-concavity, stated as $O(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$, has conditions that are not precisely defined, especially when $\epsilon$ decreases.
C. Connections to Statistics: The manuscript assumes a discrete distribution $p$ with support $[n]$, a setting common in Computer Science but less so in Statistics. Relevant statistical literature, such as Jankowski and Wellner (2009) and Balabdaoui et al. (2013), focuses on estimating and testing discrete monotone and log-concave distributions, providing a more direct connection to the manuscript's themes.
The method builds upon Valiant and Valiant (2014) but with substantially different settings, leading to new theoretical developments. The main contribution lies in its theoretical aspects, which appear interesting but require rigorous proof verification to be fully convincing.
