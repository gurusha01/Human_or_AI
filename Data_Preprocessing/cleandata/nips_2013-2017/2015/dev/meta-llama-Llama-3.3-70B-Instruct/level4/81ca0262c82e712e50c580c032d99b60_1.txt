The paper introduces a novel approach to path integral control, leveraging the fact that the system control matrix G is often known and the uncontrolled dynamics can be learned using a Gaussian Process. This method allows for a more general reward function constraint than previous path integral approaches, enabling noise and controls to act in different subspaces. The authors demonstrate how their framework can be applied to generalize from known to new tasks and evaluate its performance on three simulated robotics problems, where it compares favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and control methods.
In terms of quality, the derivations appear to be correct and principled, although there are some concerns regarding the task generalization. The related work is sufficiently discussed, with the authors highlighting similarities and differences to related work and comparing their method to state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments are convincing, but some details are missing, such as the dynamics and reward functions used, and the length of sampled trajectories.
The task generalization seems to be specific to the case where the task is defined by a target, although other task variations may be possible with a suitable task similarity kernel. The experiments consider relevant and realistic tasks, comparing favorably to state-of-the-art methods. However, the technical details in the experimental section are sparse, and it would be beneficial to include more information, such as the dynamics and reward functions, to make the experiments reproducible.
The comparison plots in the paper should include error bars, and it would be more objective to report the average or cumulative reward instead of the exponent of the value function. The paper is generally well-written, but there are some grammatical and formatting errors, and a few points that require clarification, such as the notation used in Algorithm 1 and the hyperparameters of the Gaussian Process.
The originality and significance of the paper lie in its novel combination of existing ingredients, which appears to achieve very good performance. The evaluation on realistic problems against strong benchmarks demonstrates a significant improvement over prior work. However, some minor points, such as grammatical errors and formatting issues, should be addressed to improve the overall quality of the paper.
Overall, the paper presents a convincing and well-written introduction to a new method for path integral control, with some minor issues that require clarification and correction. The authors' response to the concerns regarding the task generalization and other points would be beneficial in further evaluating the paper's quality and significance.
