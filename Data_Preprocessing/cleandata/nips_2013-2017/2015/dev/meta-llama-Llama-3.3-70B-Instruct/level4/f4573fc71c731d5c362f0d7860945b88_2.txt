This review examines Paper 1260, which addresses the issue of matrix completion using side information represented as a graph, purportedly offering a general framework that can accommodate various sources of side information. The paper's primary contributions include a scalable learning algorithm for matrix completion with graph structures, establishing connections to existing matrix factorization literature, and providing both theoretical and experimental verification of the proposed method.
The problem tackled by this paper has broad applicability, such as in recommendation systems that incorporate social network information. Given the large size of such datasets, the development of a scalable algorithm, as proposed by the authors, is crucial.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, benefiting from both a theoretical analysis of consistency and experiments using real data. Furthermore, situating the proposed method within the context of broader convex optimization and noisy matrix approximation is beneficial.
Regarding the experiments outlined in Section 6, some of the baselines presented in Table 1 are overly simplistic, and comparisons to more recent, state-of-the-art methods would be more meaningful. Suggestions for additional comparisons include Salakhutdinov and Mnih's Probabilistic Matrix Factorization [NIPS 2008], Mackey et al.'s Divide-and-Conquer Matrix Factorization [NIPS 2011], and Lee et al.'s Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation [ICML 2013].
While the proposed method's execution time of O(10^3) seconds with the dataset in Table 2 is impressive, to substantiate claims of scalability, it is recommended that the algorithm be tested on larger datasets, such as those from Netflix or Yahoo Music. This would also facilitate comparisons of RMSE scores with other methods.
Minor observations include the inconsistency in the format of the x-axis in Figure 1 and Figure 2; adopting the format used in Figure 2 (10^1, 10^2, ...) is suggested, as plotting log(time) directly without specifying the base can be ambiguous. Additionally, the citations do not adhere to the NIPS format.
Overall, this paper introduces GRALS, an efficient approach to optimizing the graph-regularized matrix completion problem. Despite some minor issues with the experiments, the paper is generally well-written and clear.
