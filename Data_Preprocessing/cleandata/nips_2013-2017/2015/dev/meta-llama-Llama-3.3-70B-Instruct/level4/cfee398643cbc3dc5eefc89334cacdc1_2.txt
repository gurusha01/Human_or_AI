1) The manuscript's format is not suitable for presentation at this conference and would be more appropriate for submission to a journal.
2) Upon examination, it is noted that the authors' identities are revealed in the supplementary materials on page 13. Furthermore, this submission bears similarities to the existing work titled "Community detection in general stochastic block models: fundamental limits and efficient algorithms". Notably, the authors of the current submission also claim authorship of this prior work in the supplementary materials, raising concerns regarding potential overlap and disclosure.
