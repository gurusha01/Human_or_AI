This manuscript proposes an approach to active model selection based on a mutual information criterion, with the primary technical innovation being an approximation method that eliminates the need for re-fitting the model for each candidate. The proposed technique is applied to the task of identifying noise-induced hearing loss using a minimal number of sound queries.
In general, the paper presents a well-considered and promising solution to the active model selection problem. The writing is clear, and the rationale behind the design decisions is well-explained. The incorporation of the NIHL detection task as an application of active model selection is a valuable contribution, making the paper more engaging.
However, a notable omission in the paper is the lack of experimental comparisons with existing active model selection methods, either in the context of the NIHL task or using established benchmarks. The baseline method [8] exhibits a limitation, prioritizing the more likely model, which other active model selection approaches might address. Therefore, comparing the performance of different methods would provide valuable insights.
The NIHL task has some limitations, as the positive examples are simulated from the model, potentially leading to unrealistically favorable outcomes for model-based methods. Although this might be unavoidable in the medical domain, it is essential to acknowledge this limitation. Alternative experimental setups could be explored to mitigate this issue.
In conclusion, I recommend accepting the paper due to its clarity, novelty, and potential to address a real-world medical problem. The primary area for improvement is the inclusion of comparisons with other active model selection approaches. As I am not an expert in active learning, I cannot comprehensively assess the paper's relationship to prior work, but the proposed method appears to be well-motivated and innovative.
