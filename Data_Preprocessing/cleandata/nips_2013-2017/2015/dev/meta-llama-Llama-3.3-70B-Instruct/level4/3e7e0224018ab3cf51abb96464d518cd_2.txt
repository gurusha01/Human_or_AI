In the realm of game theory, it has been demonstrated that, under specific smoothness conditions, the price of anarchy in a full information game is bounded. This price of anarchy refers to the ratio of optimal social welfare to the worst achievable social welfare under a particular type of equilibrium. Although the literature on this topic is extensive, with established bounds on the price of anarchy for a broad class of coarse correlated equilibria, analogous results are lacking in the context of games with incomplete information, where only bounds for Bayes-Nash equilibria have been established.
The primary contribution of this manuscript is the derivation of a bound on the price of anarchy for coarse correlated equilibria by reducing these games to multiple full information games. However, the paper's readability is compromised, and its generality appears limited. The setup lacks clarity, as exemplified by the definition of "Fi as the empirical distributions of values in population Pi," which raises questions about the specific samples used to determine these empirical distributions.
A significant concern with the paper stems from Lemma 10, whose hypotheses are not entirely clear. The lemma mentions that D^T is an empirical distribution of plays and posits that if a subsequence of D^T converges in distribution to D, then certain conditions hold. Nonetheless, since D^T is a random measure, it is unclear whether the convergence in distribution is almost sure or if the subsequence must be uniform across all values of D^T. Similar ambiguities arise in equation (10) after taking the limit, where the authors seem to infer convergence of an expectation based on the almost sure convergence of a function and the convergence in distribution of D^T, without providing a convincing justification for this step.
While the remainder of the paper appears correct, addressing the concerns regarding Lemma 10 is crucial for its validity. If these issues can be resolved, consideration for acceptance would be warranted. Nonetheless, the paper's subject matter may not resonate significantly with the NIPS community. Overall, the manuscript represents an acceptable extension of price of anarchy results from full information games to Bayesian games, albeit with notable challenges in readability and a potential flaw in one of the proofs.
