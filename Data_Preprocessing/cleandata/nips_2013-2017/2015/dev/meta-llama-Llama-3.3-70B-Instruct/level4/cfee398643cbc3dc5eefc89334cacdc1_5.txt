This manuscript proposes two algorithms for recovering community assignments of nodes in graphs generated from stochastic block models (SBMs), considering both constant average degree and average degree of the order log(n) regimes. The algorithms, based on shortest path finding, yield bounds on partial and complete recovery of node labels with high probability, surpassing the information-theoretic threshold for both regimes. Notably, these results are achieved without requiring knowledge of model parameters, building upon and improving previous work (Abbe and Sanders, 2015).
The paper and its supplementary materials demonstrate mathematical rigor and technical quality, presenting strong results on almost exact and exact recovery of community labels. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more comprehensive numerical comparison with other community detection methods. A significant drawback is the lack of clarity in presenting the algorithms, with the main algorithmic statements relegated to the supplementary materials, making it challenging to follow the paper without consulting these additional resources. Specifically, the agnostic-sphere-comparison algorithm, central to the paper, requires clearer exposition, similar to its presentation in the supplementary materials. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the definition of SBM between Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, as well as the normalization of Q, detract from the manuscript's readability.
Despite these issues, the paper introduces an original, approximately linear-time algorithm, accompanied by a rigorous proof of its efficacy for community recovery in general SBMs, positioning it among the state-of-the-art methods. While algorithms based on shortest paths have been previously proposed (Bhattacharyya and Bickel, 2014), the current manuscript offers a more subtle approach with tighter results. The information-theoretic bounds and algorithms presented are significant, with potential for generalization to more complex network models, particularly those with a growing number of communities.
Given the technical subtlety and depth of the manuscript, it may be more suited for a journal publication, where its detailed analysis and results can be fully appreciated. As a conference publication, the paper's summarized nature and lack of clarity in presenting main methods may hinder its impact. Nonetheless, the manuscript is technically strong, offering interesting insights into community identity recovery for SBM-generated graphs, albeit requiring refinement in presentation to enhance readability and accessibility.
