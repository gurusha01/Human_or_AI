This manuscript presents an iterative methodology for tackling the Adaptive Stochastic Optimization problem, which is characterized by an objective function f. The authors establish specific conditions on this function that render the problem solvable using their proposed recursive adaptive convergence approach.
In terms of quality, the paper formulates the ASO problem as a generalized version of POMDP and validates the solution technique through simulation, with a sensible selection of baseline algorithms. However, a more direct comparison with similar approaches, such as prevalent POMDP solutions, would significantly enhance the paper's strength. Given the technical complexity of the content, incorporating more practical and concrete examples to illustrate the propositions would be beneficial.
The clarity of the paper is commendable, with an excellent layout, language, and flow, particularly considering the technical nature of the subject matter. Nevertheless, connecting the theoretical concepts to specific problems proves challenging. The inclusion of a running example throughout the paper could potentially improve its readability and facilitate easier comprehension.
Regarding originality, the manuscript appears to build upon theoretical advancements in sub-modular function optimization and applies these findings to the ASO problem. The innovative aspect stems from the specific application of these principles.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential impact, given the broad applicability of the setting. However, the current presentation falls short of effectively demonstrating this potential. A more compelling case could be made by comparing numerical results to alternative solution techniques or by providing a more direct argument for the applicability of the MLRB and MLB conditions, thus strengthening the argument for the paper's impact.
Ultimately, this manuscript provides a tractable solution algorithm and sufficient conditions for its applicability to a general and typically intractable planning problem, namely the ASO problem.
