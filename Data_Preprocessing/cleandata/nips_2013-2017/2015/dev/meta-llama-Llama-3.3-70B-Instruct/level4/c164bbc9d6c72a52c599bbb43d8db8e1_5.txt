The authors present a novel approach to enhancing the convergence of first-order gradient methods by incorporating an iteratively refined proximal term into the original objective function. This wrapping scheme is demonstrated to accelerate convergence for a generic first-order method, transitioning the dependence from \frac{L}{\mu} to \sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}.
Overall, the paper is well-structured, although it has a couple of notable deficiencies. Firstly, the experimental section could be more comprehensive. Secondly, given the existence of established algorithms, it is crucial to clarify the scenarios in which the proposed catalyst would be beneficial, particularly in the context of machine learning.
Notwithstanding these deficiencies, I recommend acceptance due to the paper's potential to inspire future research, such as the concept of performing multiple passes over the data with increasingly sharper proximal terms, akin to the approach outlined in [8].
Specific comments include:
- On page 2, line 57, the authors assert that all incremental methods incur a O(n) cost. However, it is essential to verify whether this applies to ProxSVRG as well.
- The authors should provide clear guidelines on when their contributions are most useful, such as when dual methods are inapplicable, when the objective function lacks strong convexity, and when data cannot be stored in memory.
- Line 314 contains a redundant 'do', and line 390 refers to 'default' parameters without specifying whether these are theoretically optimal or merely default values in a source code.
- The selection of 'L' and the learning rate \eta should be detailed, including any efforts to tune these parameters.
Suggestions for improvement include:
- Repositioning the contents of lines 256-257 to the theorem statement itself to avoid potential misinterpretation of Theorem 3.3.
- Emphasizing the caption of Table 1 to ensure readers are aware of the simplification made for the case where n <= L/\mu when \mu > 0.
In conclusion, while the paper has some shortcomings, its innovative ideas and potential for future research warrant its acceptance.
