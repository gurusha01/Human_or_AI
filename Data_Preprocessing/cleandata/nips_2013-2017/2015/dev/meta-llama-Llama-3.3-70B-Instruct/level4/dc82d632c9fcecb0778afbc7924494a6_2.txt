The paper presents an abstract representation of the PTP search space through lifted and/or schematics, enabling the quantification of the search space size. This concept holds both theoretical and practical significance, particularly in the context of Rao-Blackwellized importance sampling, despite the current theoretical framework not being fully developed to provide profound insights.
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to the understanding of lifted inference algorithms, an area where knowledge is still limited. Although the proposed schematics may not be straightforward enough to offer substantial insight, they represent a step in the right direction. The presentation is satisfactory, but the technical aspects are complex and challenging to verify within the given time frame.
As this is a theoretical paper, it raises questions about the framework's power in terms of liftability. Specifically, can these schematics capture all known classes of domain-liftable models? Furthermore, the paper overlooks the opportunity to establish connections with other similar techniques, such as the relationship between dtrees (used in recursive conditioning and knowledge compilation) and lifted and/or schematics.
Additionally, the connection between first-order NNF circuits and lifted and/or schematics warrants exploration, as they appear to share similarities. The complexity of evaluating partition functions from first-order NNF circuits, which is exponential in the number of nested counting operations, seems related to the analysis in Section 4. Another relevant comparison is with the first-order decomposition trees of Taghipour et al., which, according to the footnote on page 3, are less tight, but more details and examples illustrating the complexity differences would be beneficial.
The importance sampling algorithm that utilizes the theoretical framework in a meaningful way is convincing. However, more details on the experimental setup would be appreciated, such as the selection of evidence predicates and the potential exploitation of symmetries. For instance, it is unclear whether the 10% evidence on webkb would leave any symmetries to exploit, and clarification on this point would be helpful.
Several typos were noted, including the incorrect notation of theta_i on line 105, the reference to exchangeable variables on line 171, which should be exchangeable constants, and the missing word "depends" on line 212.
Overall, this is commendable work on a challenging problem. Although the theoretical analysis is demanding to follow, it makes sense at a high level, particularly for those familiar with the lifted inference literature. The application to sampling is noteworthy and renders the theory immediately useful.
