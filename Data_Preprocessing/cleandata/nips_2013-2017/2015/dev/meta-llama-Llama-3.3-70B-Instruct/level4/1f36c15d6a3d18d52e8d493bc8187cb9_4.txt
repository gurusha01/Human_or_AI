The issue of determining whether an unknown distribution belongs to specific sets, including monotone, log-concave, unimodal, and monotone hazard rate distributions, defined over [n] or [n]^d for monotonicity, is examined. A unified framework is employed to address each problem, wherein an initial estimate, q, of the unknown distribution p is obtained under the assumption that p is a member of the class in question, thereby reducing sample complexity. Subsequently, a modified chi-squared test is utilized to assess the closeness of p and q. The estimators required for the first step are innovative and tailored to each distribution class.
This two-step methodology circumvents the need for alternative approaches, such as testing equality between p and a net over the class, which would incur substantial computational and statistical costs. The proposed approach yields efficient algorithms with enhanced (and optimal) sample complexities.
Notably, the optimal rates for each of the four classes are identical (for d=1 in the case of monotone distributions), and the construction used in the matching lower bound for each problem is also identical.
To enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with the subject, incorporating definitions, such as the partial order in the definition of monotone distributions over the hypergrid, would be beneficial. Additionally, the appendix is referenced for definitions of distances (line 161), which appear to be missing. The paper makes substantial contributions to the field of testing shape-constrained discrete distributions.
