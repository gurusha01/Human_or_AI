This study presents a novel criterion for sequential experimental design, focusing on model selection, and demonstrates its application in an audiometric experiment aimed at detecting noise-induced hearing loss, yielding favorable results.
In terms of quality and clarity, the paper is exceptionally well-written and clear, effectively outlining the necessary steps for approximating model evidence, hyperparameter posterior, and predictive distributions. However, there are minor issues, such as the introduction of X* on line 134 without prior definition, and a typographical error on line 342, where "exes" should be replaced with "crosses."
The originality of the work lies in its application of a technique similar to that found in [12], leveraging the symmetry of mutual information to transform an intractable quantity into a one-dimensional, relatively easily approximated quantity. The novel application of this technique to active model selection is a significant contribution.
The significance of the study is underscored by the importance of model selection, with the specific application of selecting among different GP priors being a prime example. However, the provided example is somewhat simplistic, as it only considers selecting among prior means and not the covariance kernel, which can be more challenging to choose. Furthermore, the first model (healthy) is a special case of the NIHL model (as d approaches 0), raising questions about whether using the more complex model and inferring hyperparameters could be a viable alternative. While the potential applications of this method are substantial, the convincingness of the particular example presented is questionable.
Minor points to consider include the omission of a mention of hyperparameter marginalization via MCMC technique around equation (7) in Section 3. Overall, this is a well-crafted paper on a Bayesian method for active model selection, with techniques explained in sufficient detail and accompanied by useful references. Nevertheless, the application presented falls short of fully demonstrating the method's strengths due to the concerns raised under the significance heading.
