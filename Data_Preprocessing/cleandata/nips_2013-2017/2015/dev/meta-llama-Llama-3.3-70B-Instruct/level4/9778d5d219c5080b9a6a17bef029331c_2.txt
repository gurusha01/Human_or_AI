This study is well-executed, yielding impressive results that are effectively presented in a clearly written paper.
I recommend that the authors consider making their code publicly available online if the paper is accepted.
The proposed approach involves an illuminant estimation method that identifies the true chromaticity of a pixel from its luminance, leveraging the fact that natural illuminant chromaticities are limited to a specific range due to Planck's radiation law. The authors train a luminance-to-chromaticity classifier using a dataset of natural images and utilize this classifier to infer a distribution of illuminants consistent with the observed pixels. A global scene illuminant estimate is then obtained by aggregating the illuminant distributions across all pixels.
