This manuscript presents findings on hypothesis tests such as:
H0: P is monotone
versus
H1: P is not monotone
I find the paper to be engaging, with interesting results. However, several concerns warrant discussion:
1. The discrete cube sample space utilized in this study raises questions about its practical relevance. Typically, monotonicity tests are applied to continuous random variables in real-world data analysis. It would be beneficial to cite a specific example where this setting is of scientific interest, as the current context seems somewhat detached from common practice.
2. The authors' assertion that the statistics literature focuses predominantly on the large sample regime may be misleading. Many statistical tests can be made exact through simulation of the null distribution, and asymptotics are often employed to derive precise theoretical results regarding test power, including limits rather than bounds. Moreover, there are statistics papers that provide finite sample guarantees, such as the work by Dumbgen, Lutz, and Guenther Walther ("Multiscale inference about a density," The Annals of Statistics, 2008). The references to the statistical literature on this topic are sparse and should be expanded to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
3. I remain unconvinced that the proposed test truly constitutes a finite sample test. If one aims to ensure a type I error less than a specified alpha (e.g., 1/3), the results imply the existence of a sample size threshold (N0) beyond which the type I error is less than alpha. However, this seems analogous to asymptotic statistics tests, which assert that for sufficiently large sample sizes, the type I error approaches alpha. In practice, when applying this test to real data, there is no guarantee that the sample size exceeds N0, and one must assume that the sample size is sufficiently large. Therefore, the practical distinction between this test and an asymptotic test appears negligible.
While the paper is intriguing, I question the practical relevance of the problem and believe that the connections to statistical literature are dismissed too readily.
