=== Summary ===
This paper presents a method for bounding geometric quantities that appear in statistical error bounds for structured estimation problems using atomic norms. Previously, it was established that the estimation error of Dantzig-like estimators with random Gaussian design can be bounded using three key quantities: the Gaussian width of the unit ball of the regularizer, the Gaussian width of the spherical cap of the tangent cone, and the restricted norm compatibility constant. The authors' primary objective is to provide easily computable bounds for these quantities in the context of sign-invariant atomic norms.
In Section 3, the authors introduce upper bounds for the three geometric quantities, which constitute the main contribution of the paper. They demonstrate that the Gaussian width of the unit ball can be bounded by decomposing the set of atoms into simpler sets, whose Gaussian widths are readily computable. Although this result has been previously reported in [14], the authors' approach offers a novel perspective. Furthermore, they show that the Gaussian width of the spherical cap of the tangent cone can be bounded using a single subgradient of the regularizer evaluated at the true parameter vector $w^*$. The restricted norm compatibility constant can be bounded using two other norm compatibility constants that are simpler to compute, as they are defined on simpler sets. The authors illustrate the applicability of these results using two examples: the L1 and OWL norms.
In Section 4, the authors provide lower bounds for the last two quantities, which, although not matching the upper bounds, demonstrate that the upper bounds are relatively tight and thus useful.
In Section 5, the authors apply the bounds derived in this paper to the k-support norm, yielding improved results compared to previously known findings.
=== Significance ===
In my opinion, this paper addresses a crucial problem by providing innovative and useful tools for studying sparse estimation problems with atomic norms. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and effectively utilizes examples to facilitate understanding of the results and their practical applications. The bounds derived in the paper enable the attainment of new results for the k-support norm, underscoring the relevance of the findings. Overall, I believe this is a well-written and interesting paper that provides easily computable bounds for analyzing the statistical error of Dantzig-like estimators with atomic norms.
