This paper explores the problem of learning binary classifiers that optimize non-decomposable performance metrics, with a specific focus on the F-measure in an online learning setting. The authors propose an algorithm for optimizing F-measure and provide a formal consistency analysis for the online approach. Experimental results are presented using fairly large real-world datasets.
The core concept and online algorithm presented are straightforward and easy to comprehend, with relatively simple implementation, although estimating class-conditional probabilities in each round can be challenging. The consistency analysis is novel, but the presentation of the guarantee in Theorem 3 and 5 could be improved by explicitly stating the regret, which is the difference between the F-measure of the predicted and optimal labels. 
A recent framework for optimizing non-decomposable measures in the online setting, as seen in [9], provides an intuitive approach based on per-round non-decomposable loss and includes convergence rates for regret. However, the discussion in Section 6 does not convincingly demonstrate how the analysis of the proposed algorithm is stronger than that in [9]. Furthermore, the method in [9] is not compared experimentally, which is surprising and warrants justification.
The organization of the paper is a concern, as the main contribution, Algorithm 1 and its analysis, appear late in the paper. Sections 2 and 3 are largely redundant, with Section 3 being particularly unnecessary in the context of the paper's key contribution. Combining the essential ideas from Sections 2 and 3 into a Background section would allow readers to focus on the crucial parts of the paper, such as Sections 4 and 5, without unnecessary distractions. The inclusion of useful results on synthetic data, currently in the Appendix, would also enhance the main paper.
Despite these concerns, the responses provided are satisfactory, and the paper's contributions are sufficient to warrant acceptance, leading to an increased score. Overall, the paper proposes an online algorithm for optimizing F-measure, analyzes its consistency, and presents experimental results, but requires improvements in evaluation, presentation, and content development.
