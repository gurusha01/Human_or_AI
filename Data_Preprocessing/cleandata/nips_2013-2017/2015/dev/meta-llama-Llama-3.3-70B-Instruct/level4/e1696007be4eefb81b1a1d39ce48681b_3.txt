This manuscript explores the sample complexity and error bounds of Dantzig-type estimators within the framework of structured regression, relying heavily on geometric properties such as the Gaussian width of the norm ball. Notably, it derives novel, computationally feasible bounds for these geometric properties, specifically for atomic norms that remain unchanged under sign inversion. The paper also examines the tightness of these bounds by demonstrating their proximity to the corresponding lower bounds, thus validating their usefulness.
The subject matter of this research is undoubtedly pertinent and captivating to the Machine Learning community. The presentation is lucid and accessible, making the content easily understandable. In my assessment, the obtained bounds hold significant value for both theoretical and practical applications. However, certain technical aspects, such as the proof of Theorem 7, eluded my complete comprehension.
Overall, this is an intriguing theoretical contribution addressing a highly relevant topic, distinguished by its clarity of expression.
