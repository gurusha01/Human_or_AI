This manuscript explores the feasibility of predicting the temporal evolution of objects within a scene based on video stream observations. The concept of forming expectations about an object's trajectory, such as anticipating the path of a moving block, is rooted in our inherent cognitive physics model. Recent literature has investigated this topic, with the authors citing relevant studies.
The paper's primary contribution lies in its application of a deep learning framework, combined with a Bayesian generative formulation of object dynamics, to make predictions from visual features. The Bayesian equation (eq 1) provides a standard representation of how physical parameters translate into visual features, with the authors utilizing observed velocity as the primary observable. 
The core of the paper involves conducting experiments to demonstrate the system's capability to predict scene evolution based on partial video traces. Various experiment iterations showcase the system's ability to classify discrete labels, such as predicting whether an object will hit a specific point, as well as continuous variables like motion magnitude.
Upon closer examination, the underlying argument is not particularly surprising, as it parallels inverse problems commonly solved in fields like meteorology and oil industry, albeit with more complex dynamics. The use of equation 1 to estimate object mass, for instance, is not a novel concept. 
The comparison between the proposed system and human perception is intriguing, as it introduces a unique aspect not typically considered in statistical inverse problems. However, this aspect is not thoroughly elaborated upon, and the incorporation of cognitive hypotheses throughout the paper is cursory, lacking substantial claims and supporting arguments. For example, the assertion on page 2 regarding the necessity of a physics engine for a specific model type is presented without further discussion.
Ultimately, beyond the timely application of deep learning for visual feature extraction, the significance and novelty of this paper's contributions are uncertain. The manuscript employs a generative model formulation to infer physical object properties from video data, demonstrating the potential for making useful predictions about future scene evolution. Although the results appear valid, the generative model itself is based on a standard Bayesian formula, and the coupling with deep learning tools does not seem to advance the state-of-the-art significantly beyond existing work on the topic.
