This manuscript explores the challenge of determining reserve prices that approximate revenue maximization using sample valuations from an unknown bidder distribution. The authors propose t-level auctions, where each bidder's possible bids are divided into discrete levels, and the winner is the bidder with the highest level, paying the minimum value on that level necessary to win.
The authors establish bounds on the sample size required to identify a near-revenue-maximizing auction from a set of possible auctions, such as 10-level auctions, and quantify the revenue difference between the optimal t-level auction and the truly optimal auction. Although the primary focus is on single-item auctions, the results are extended to matroid and single-parameter environments.
The paper is well-structured, effectively comparing and contrasting its approach and findings with relevant literature, demonstrating novelty and interdisciplinary connections between auction theory and learning theory. The technical quality is exceptional, with notable results presented in the appendix.
However, a practical consideration is that implementing a t-level auction may result in lost information about subsequent bidder valuations. Since truth-telling is a dominant strategy, but so is reporting the lowest value within the same level as the true valuation, bidders might choose the latter to conceal information from the auctioneer, potentially complicating the re-learning of optimal reserves or understanding bidder responses to mechanism changes.
As an aside, while acknowledging the theoretical significance, the practical value of revenue-maximizing auctions in certain real-world domains is questionable due to their failure to account for bidders' dynamic decision-making, which may not align with long-term revenue maximization. The authors' perspective on the practical importance of optimal auctions or how to reconcile short-term and long-term revenue optimization would be valuable.
A minor inquiry concerns the footnote mentioning that results hold for alternative tie-breaking rules: specifically, which rules, and do the results apply when ties are broken uniformly at random? This paper presents a significant contribution by introducing t-level auctions, quantifying the data required to learn near-optimal auctions, and assessing the optimality gap, all while demonstrating strong technical quality and interdisciplinary novelty.
