The manuscript explores matrix completion in a graph-based setting, where row and column variables are defined on graphs, and presents a scalable alternating least squares algorithm. The authors demonstrate that the regularizer in the optimization problem can be viewed as a generalized weighted nuclear norm, and establish statistical consistency guarantees for low-rank matrix estimators. Experimental results on a movie ratings dataset show that their method achieves the lowest RMSE, and their ALS algorithm exhibits significantly better scalability than SGD.
a. The process of generating row and column graphs from the MovieLens dataset is not clearly described in the paper and requires clarification.
b. Sections 5 and 5.1 are challenging to understand, partly due to the lack of definition for terms like "spikiness", which is crucial for comprehending the main theoretical result and comparison to standard matrix completion methods.
c. The absence of an RMSE table for the three large datasets is notable; while Figure 2 suggests that GRALS scales better, it is unclear whether its RMSE is comparable to or worse than that of other methods. 
The optimization problem addressed in this paper, namely graph-structured matrix factorization with partial observations, appears to be novel and is likely to attract significant attention from the collaborative filtering community. The approach, based on weighted norm minimization, bears similarities to the work of Srebro and Salakhutdinov (2010). The authors' alternating least squares algorithm is convincingly shown to be more efficient than SGD and outperforms leading methods that incorporate side information. However, the writing in critical sections is difficult to follow, and the proofs have not been verified.
