Review- Quality:
This paper presents an elegant solution to a longstanding problem, with a well-motivated and transparent methodology, and thoroughly executed experiments. The analysis is comprehensive, particularly the insightful results in the rightmost columns of Figure 2. However, further examination of the relationship between estimator variance and location-specific error would be beneficial, as the expected high correlation is not immediately apparent from the figures.
Clarity:
The paper is well-structured, concise, and easy to follow, with effective notation usage. A minor suggestion is to utilize boldface characters for vector properties, such as chromaticity and pixels, to enhance the distinction between scalars and vectors. Additionally, certain key equations, including those on lines 158, 216, and 237, would benefit from being displayed as separate, numbered equations or being more clearly demarcated. Furthermore, a correction is needed in line 308, where "it's" should be replaced with "its".
Originality:
The paper offers a novel approach to a classic problem.
Significance:
Although the problem addressed is well-established and of interest to a significant portion of the vision community, its suitability for the NIPS audience is uncertain. Nonetheless, in terms of quality, the paper is certainly worthy of consideration. By learning the conditional chromaticity distribution based on pixel luminance, the proposed method achieves color constancy in images. This is accomplished through empirical histogram modeling in the training set and global optimization using gradient descent on a cost function. Notably, the luminance proves to be a useful predictor of illumination chromaticity, even when treating pixels as independent. The method is computationally efficient, yielding both visually pleasing and numerically impressive results.
