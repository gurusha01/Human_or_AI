This manuscript seeks to demonstrate that the price of anarchy bounds previously established through the smoothness property of games can be generalized to encompass the quality of learning outcomes in Bayesian games. To accomplish this, the authors model a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information with a large population of potential participants. Upon making this assumption, they derive two key findings: firstly, the outcome converges to a form of Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium when all players employ a no-regret learning strategy in the stochastic game; secondly, the stochastic game is smooth if the underlying game or mechanism is itself smooth. These results collectively indicate that the price of anarchy bounds obtained via smoothness techniques can be extended to the outcomes of no-regret learning in Bayesian games. However, the paper is challenging to follow and evaluate, appearing to be more tailored to the "Game Theory" community than the "NIPS" one, as evidenced by its references. Moreover, the manuscript seems to be a direct adaptation from an extended version rather than being specifically written for the NIPS conference, which is noticeable in the final section where the authors mention analyzing convergence without providing further specifics. Several questions and suggestions arise: (a) why do the supplementary materials only provide proofs for Theorems 10 and 13, omitting others? (b) what motivates the choice of Forges' correlated equilibrium? (c) Theorem 11 lacks clarity - does it imply convergence to BCCE? Further elaboration is needed. (d) Managing selfish players is notoriously difficult, except in scenarios where a central entity is introduced, such as through correlated equilibrium, which simplifies the problem but may not reflect realistic scenarios. The primary contribution of this paper lies in extending price of anarchy bounds to learning outcomes in Bayesian games, although its presentation is more aligned with the "Game Theory" community.
