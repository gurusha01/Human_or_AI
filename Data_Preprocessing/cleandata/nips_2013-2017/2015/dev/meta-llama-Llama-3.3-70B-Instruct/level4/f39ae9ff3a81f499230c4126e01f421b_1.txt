This paper introduces the fixed length PRMs distribution, which establishes dependencies between the dimensions of a multinomial distribution, a concept that warrants attention, particularly given the current interest in Poisson graphical models and their potential to enhance probabilistic topic models.
The manuscript is well-structured and engaging, tackling a compelling problem. The central objective is to maintain a finite partition function, achieved here by limiting the partition function's support to vectors of uniform total length or norm, an approach that holds merit.
However, the paper's impact would be significantly enhanced by a comparative analysis with a truncated Poisson LDA, such as the TPMRF presented in [6], to empirically illustrate the differences discussed theoretically. Additionally, a comparison with the PMRF topic model from [2] is necessary to highlight the advantages of the proposed method over more general approaches. Although evaluating perplexity in [2] is complex due to the partition function, a simple MCMC chain on the local Poisson distribution could provide insights.
Empirical comparisons, similar to those in Table 1, are essential to demonstrate the benefits of the discovered dependencies. Moreover, considering the aim to estimate a multinomial distribution with inter-state dependencies, the authors should discuss the feasibility of factorizing the multinomial into binary random variables with defined dependencies, such as tree-like or network dependencies.
In summary, while the idea is intriguing, its connection to related work needs further exploration for justification. The benefits over existing methods are not clearly articulated. The novelty of the Poisson MRF with its application to LDA, alongside the refreshing revisit of the multinomial approach underlying much of machine learning, suggests potential. Nonetheless, extending the baselines and providing empirical evidence to support the theoretical discussions is crucial.
