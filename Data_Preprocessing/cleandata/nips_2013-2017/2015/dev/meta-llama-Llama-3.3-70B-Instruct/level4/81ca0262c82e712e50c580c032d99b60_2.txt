The authors present a novel approach to path integral control by utilizing an exponential form of the value function, enabling analytical solutions to the path integrals of the cost and allowing for backward evaluation. This facilitates a forward-backward optimization strategy, where a Gaussian process (GP) models the paths forward in time, followed by backward integration to obtain path costs and derivatives, and ultimately, a numerical technique updates the controls.
The paper's technical correctness is relatively high, making for an enjoyable and informative read. However, the comparison to iterative path integral methods raises questions, as the outperformance of the proposed technique may be attributed to the relatively low number of samples used (10^3 for cart-pole and 10^4 for double pendulum). While the new technique appears more efficient, careful consideration of the baseline evaluation is necessary.
One major concern is the rapid progression through key steps in the paper. Specifically, the transition from equation 7 to 8 is non-trivial and crucial to the overall methodology. Similarly, the derivation from the initial integral of Ψt (mid-page 5) to the final recursive form of Φ{t+dt}Ψ_{t+dt} is even more challenging to follow.
The application of a GP for modeling is not novel, but the forward-backward approach and the ability to use the GP to infer the integral for a changed value function are innovative contributions. The proposed method represents a significant improvement to existing path integral techniques.
It would be beneficial to number all equations, as the current approach can create difficulties for referencing equations outside the text. The authors have proposed a novel method that advances the state of the art, resulting in a good paper, albeit with some challenging sections to read, largely due to page limitations. Overall, the paper's quality and significance make it a valuable contribution, despite some areas requiring clarification.
