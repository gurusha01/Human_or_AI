This manuscript presents a conditional variational auto-encoder, exploring a natural variation of stochastic conditional models, with a reasonable core idea and extensive experimental work. However, certain terminology used in the paper deviates from conventional interpretations, potentially causing confusion. For instance, predicting structured outputs that differ from the input data, such as segmentation labels, somewhat extends the traditional notion of auto-encoders. In contrast, predicting the other half of an image aligns more closely with the typical autoencoding framework.
The terminology 'conditional prior' may not align with the expectations of some NIPS community members, as it redefines the established concept of a prior. Instead, considering P(z|x) as the conditional distribution of the hidden variable or stochastic representation z might be more accurate and consistent with existing terminology. While the motivations behind this choice are understandable, more precise language would be beneficial in a publication to avoid potential misinterpretation.
Furthermore, additional details about the baseline CNN would be helpful to assess its strength and validity as a comparison. The manuscript also contains several minor language errors that require correction. Overall, the idea presented is sound, and the experimental efforts are substantial, but refining the terminology and providing more context would enhance the clarity and credibility of the paper.
