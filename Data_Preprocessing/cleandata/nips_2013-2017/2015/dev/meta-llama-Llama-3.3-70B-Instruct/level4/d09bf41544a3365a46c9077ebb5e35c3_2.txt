This paper is of exceptional quality, boasting clarity, originality, and significant potential impact.
In my assessment, the primary innovation and contribution of this work lie in the authors' successful integration of a symbolic physical model with an image-level recognition and tracking algorithm.
To further enhance the paper, I suggest that the authors allocate more space to discussing the image-level recognition and tracking model, including its capabilities and limitations, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their approach.
The experimental scenarios presented are somewhat limited, featuring impoverished images; it would be beneficial to investigate how the model performs with novel scene configurations, non-smooth surfaces, and objects that are not blocks.
If the algorithm is indeed as general as it initially appears, this should be clearly highlighted. Conversely, if it is restricted to simple scenes with known geometric configurations, this limitation should be explicitly stated.
In either case, this research represents valuable progress, although the former scenario would be more impressive.
Several additional points warrant consideration: 
- The introduction (lines ~96-98) mentions that a "computational solution asserts that the infant starts with a relatively reliable mental physics engine, or acquires it soon after birth". This statement seems to imply a nativist perspective that may not be entirely accurate. Research by Renee Baillargeon has demonstrated that physical reasoning abilities develop throughout the first year of life. The authors may wish to revisit this statement or provide a nod to this existing work.
- On line 198, the authors fix sigma (the velocity noise) to 0.05, but it is unclear how this value was determined or how sensitive the model is to changes in this parameter. Providing units for this value and demonstrating the model's robustness to variations in this parameter would be helpful.
- In the Outcome Prediction experiment (6.1), it is unclear whether the errors in Fig 5 are averaged across both target objects (cardboard and foam) or if each initial material is associated with only one target object.
- Estimating error correlations between people, the uniform model, and POM on the data in figure 5 could provide valuable insights, given the significant variation in errors across scenes.
- The analysis methods used in the Mass Prediction and "Will It Move" experiments are not entirely clear. It appears that human decisions are dichotomous, and the model samples from the posterior to obtain proportions of each choice. Further clarification on this analysis would facilitate understanding of the results.
- In the Mass Prediction experiment, Spearman's rho is used to calculate correlations between human and model data due to the claimed non-linear relationship. However, if the POM accurately captures human judgments, a linear relationship would be expected, making Pearson's correlation more suitable. Including scatterplots of these relationships by trial would also aid in understanding this relationship.
- The first sentence of the paper (line 37) contains a minor error, referring to a "Rube Goldberg machine" instead of a "Rube Goldberg machine". This work introduces a physical reasoning system that combines a physics engine and an image-level tracking algorithm to infer latent physical properties of objects and evaluate predictions against human data in several experiments. Overall, this research is a valuable contribution with the potential to significantly advance current physical reasoning models by operating directly on image-level data.
