This manuscript explores the integration of lifted and approximate inference, presenting two primary contributions: computational effort estimates and the application of Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling. The text is well-structured, yet it assumes a strong background in preceding work, frequently referencing [9]. Further clarification on Rao-Blackwellisation would be beneficial. However, the experimental evaluation falls short.
On pages 46-47, the concept of inference awareness is somewhat unclear, as it implies having foresight into computational demands, which is typically unpredictable. 
The description of a traditional and-or tree as a "compact" representation on page 54 is misleading, and the term "pseudotree" requires definition, possibly in the context of a folded tree.
The idea presented is understandable, but the terminology "schematic" on page 57 needs explanation.
Between pages 81-90, the introduction of an and/or tree as a spanning tree for the original graphical model, alongside a pseudotree and another final graph, necessitates precise definitions to avoid confusion.
On page 119, the reference to new MLNs (Markov Logic Networks) demands a clear definition of what constitutes an MLN in this context.
The rules outlined on pages 148-160 are complex and warrant a concise description. Moreover, the decomposer should be explained beyond a mere citation of [9].
The claim of optimality on page 176 requires substantiation, as it is unclear if an optimal solution exists.
Page 212 contains an incomplete statement regarding overall complexity.
The assertion on pages 346-348 that fewer generated samples decrease accuracy due to a fixed time budget could be clarified.
In Section 6, the claim that the method vastly improves estimation accuracy on real-world datasets is not adequately supported by the experimental results, contradicting the earlier statement. 
Overall, this paper appears to present robust work, focusing primarily on computational effort estimates, with the Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling being another interesting aspect. However, the experimental results do not convincingly support the claims made, which undermines the conclusions drawn.
