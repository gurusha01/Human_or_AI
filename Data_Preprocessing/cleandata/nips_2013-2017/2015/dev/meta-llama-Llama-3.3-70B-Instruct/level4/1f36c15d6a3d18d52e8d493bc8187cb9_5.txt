This manuscript presents a novel approach and establishes new bounds for determining whether a distribution falls within a specific class, such as monotone, log-concave, or uni-modal distributions. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis, including both upper and lower bounds for the considered classes, and demonstrate that their upper bounds are essentially tight. Additionally, they conduct simulations on synthetic data to validate their algorithm.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the results appearing to be correct. The authors also offer a thorough comparison with existing bounds and carefully discuss the regimes in which their results yield a better rate.
However, a key limitation of this work is its exclusive focus on discrete distributions. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a motivational discussion on the practical relevance of the testing problems they address. Furthermore, exploring the potential extendability of their results to non-discrete distributions, possibly under certain assumptions regarding the density, would be a valuable addition.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include making the manuscript more self-contained. For instance, on page 3, the authors refer readers to the appendix for fundamental definitions, but these definitions are not actually included in the appendix. Overall, the paper introduces a new method and bounds for testing distribution classes, with well-presented results.
