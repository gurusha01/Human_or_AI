This manuscript is generally well-written, with a few notable exceptions that are discussed below.
The paper presents a potentially valuable extension of existing research, although the experimental demonstrations of the proposed method are somewhat limited in scope and complexity.
The theoretical framework establishes connections to previous work (Proposition 2), showcases the method's applicability to a new domain (Propositions 1 and 3), and provides an analysis of the algorithm.
However, the usefulness of the algorithmic analysis is debatable, particularly with regards to Theorems 1 and 2.
The derived bound increases with the square of the logarithm of the number of actions, where the number of actions corresponds to the number of possible locations on a path, with each action representing a "visit to location x". In comparison to the optimal cost, this bound does not appear to be particularly tight, especially for reasonably sized problems.
Several clarity issues were identified, including: line 110, where the inequality may need to be reversed since A is a subset of B; line 125, which lacks clear conditions for policy termination and its practical determination; the line between 151 and 152, which contains notation errors; and line 216, which requires clarification on alignment assumptions. Additionally, the experiment section contains inconsistencies, such as mismatched labels on plots and text.
The captions could be improved by providing more informative descriptions and avoiding redundant information already presented in the plots, such as the Gibbs error. This paper proposes an extension of submodular optimization, enabling its application beyond sets. The key contributions include the development and analysis of two conditions that facilitate this extension, as well as the introduction of an algorithm for solving problems that meet these conditions. These contributions seem novel, well-justified, and relevant to the scientific community.
