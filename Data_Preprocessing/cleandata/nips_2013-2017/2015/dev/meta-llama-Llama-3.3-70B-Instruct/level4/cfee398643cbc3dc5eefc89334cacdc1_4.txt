Typically, Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) necessitate prior specification of the number of communities. 
In contrast, the proposed algorithms for SBM do not require this information and instead achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs. 
The authors provide proofs for the accuracies and conditions underlying both partial and exact recoveries. 
However, I must admit that I found it challenging to fully comprehend the meaning and implications of the theorems presented, which limits my understanding of the paper's contributions. 
As someone working on community clustering in a private company, my perspective is inclined towards practical applications for engineers. 
Regarding Theorems 3 and 4, it would be beneficial to clarify the improvements over existing results and provide intuitive explanations for readers unfamiliar with SBM theories, such as myself. 
On Line 228, it appears that knowledge of "the relative sizes of communities" is required, which seems to be a prerequisite. 
Determining "the relative sizes of communities" beforehand can be challenging, similar to specifying the number of clusters, especially in social networks characterized by long-tailed community structures where identifying the smallest or largest community size can be difficult. 
The single real-world data test (Lines 419-420) may not be sufficient to demonstrate the proof of concept, and I am more interested in the algorithm's robustness across various real networks that may not satisfy the assumed conditions. 
Furthermore, considerations regarding computational cost are essential; it is crucial to determine whether the proposed algorithm can operate within realistic computational time frames for large networks.
