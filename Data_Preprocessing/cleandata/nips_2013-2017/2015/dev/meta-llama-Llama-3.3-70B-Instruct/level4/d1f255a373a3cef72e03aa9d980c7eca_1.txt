This manuscript presents an online algorithm designed to optimize the F-Measure, leveraging an online learner to estimate the posterior at each update. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm's convergence to the optimal threshold, as determined by batch learning methods. Empirical assessments yield consistent outcomes, with experiments illustrating the algorithm's sensitivity to three distinct online learners. The paper's clarity and organization are notable, and the proposed algorithm exhibits potential for practical applications. Theoretical and empirical evaluations of the algorithm's effectiveness have been conducted, yielding promising results that underscore the viability of this online F-Measure optimization approach.
