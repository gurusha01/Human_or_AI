Summary: The authors propose a innovative method for estimating unseen physical attributes of objects, such as mass and friction, enabling the system to make subsequent predictions based on these attributes. They utilize a black-box generative model, specifically a physics simulator, to perform sampling-based inference and employ a tracking algorithm to transform the data into more suitable latent variables, reducing dimensionality, as well as a deep model to enhance the sampler. The authors assume prior distributions over the hidden physical attributes and make point estimates of object geometry and velocities using a tracking algorithm, which provides a complete specification of the scene that can be input into a physics engine to generate simulated velocities. These simulated velocities support inference of the hidden attributes within an MCMC sampler, where attribute values are proposed, and consequent simulated velocities are generated and scored against estimated velocities, similar to Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). A deep network can be trained as a recognition model from the inferences of the generative model and the Physics 101 dataset, with its predictions of mass and friction used to initialize the MCMC sampler. The authors compare the performance of their approach to a convolutional neural network (convnet) and various human judgments.
Quality: The approach is well-implemented, yielding good performance on an intriguing task.
Clarity: The writing is exceptionally clear, with minimal typos and easy-to-understand language.
Originality: This approach appears to be novel, with the authors implementing a convnet as an "oracle" model for comparison, highlighting the uniqueness of their method.
Significance: This work is substantial and should be of interest to both the machine learning and computer vision communities.
Suggestions: The outcome prediction analysis (pages 6-7) would benefit from an additional comparison, such as correlations between human, POM, and uniform predictions, to supplement the error bar graph, as the summary "Mean" bars in Figure 5 may give a misleading impression of similarity between human and POM predictions despite differing error patterns. Furthermore, Section 4 mentions applying the system to novel settings, such as predicting buoyancy, which is stated to be demonstrated in Section 6, but this is not pursued further; this statement should be removed to maintain consistency. The paper deserves acceptance due to its novel integration of deep learning and rich generative models to tackle a complex, real-world physical reasoning problem, clear writing, well-executed technical work, and thorough performance testing.
