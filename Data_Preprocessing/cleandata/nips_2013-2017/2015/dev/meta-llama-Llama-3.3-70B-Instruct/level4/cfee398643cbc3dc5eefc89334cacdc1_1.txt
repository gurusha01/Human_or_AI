This manuscript presents novel and significant findings on recovering cluster structures in the stochastic block model, even when the number of clusters is unknown. Nevertheless, the paper's potential is hindered by poor writing quality, which warrants a score of 7 for QS. A notable issue is the introduction of essential notations in Section 2.1 that are necessary to comprehend the results outlined in Section 1.1, which seems counterintuitive. Furthermore, the paper is accompanied by an extensive 47-page supplementary material, suggesting that the NIPS submission is an abbreviated version of a more comprehensive journal article. This raises concerns about the suitability of NIPS as the primary venue for this submission, particularly given that the algorithmic descriptions provided are too vague to be reproducible without relying on the supplementary material. Overall, while the paper likely has merit, its presentation and adherence to the NIPS format are subpar, largely due to the excessive supplementary material and inadequate writing.
