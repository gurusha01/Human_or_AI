This manuscript fundamentally builds upon Neterov's initial acceleration technique for proximal point algorithms by incorporating inexact solutions to subproblems, necessitating non-trivial adjustments to existing analytical frameworks to accommodate controlled inexactness. This modification enables the derivation of a global convergence rate that is contingent upon the degree of inexactness.
The presentation of technical concepts is characterized by exceptional clarity and quality. To the best of my knowledge, this research is novel, introducing a unified framework that enhances our understanding of accelerating first-order methods that utilize inexact inner solvers.
However, I found it somewhat disappointing that Theorem 3.3 indicates the need for the inexactness to diminish at a rapid pace as the global iterations progress, although this outcome is not entirely unexpected.
The paper delivers a comprehensive acceleration framework and analysis for first-order optimization methods, meticulously considering the inexactness of subproblem solutions and its implications on the convergence rate. While I have not verified every proof, the theoretical foundations appear robust, offering profound insights into acclaimed acceleration techniques.
