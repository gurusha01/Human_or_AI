The authors explore the estimation of sparse linear models using atomic norms, deriving bounds on Gaussian widths that emerge in their analysis, with specific attention to l1, ordered weighted l1, and k-support norms. The concept of atomic norms is notably versatile, as highlighted by Chandrasekaran et al (2012 FOCM), in encapsulating a wide range of linear inverse problems. However, this paper confines its scope to sparse linear models, where, aside from the novel analysis of k-support norms, the findings largely replicate existing knowledge. The methodologies employed for calculating Gaussian widths, while straightforward, do introduce a fresh approach in the dual norm calculation pertinent to k-support norm analysis.
A natural question arises regarding the potential for this technique to be extrapolated to other atomic norm analyses, such as the estimation of low-rank matrices via nuclear norm penalization. The clarity and coherence of the paper, along with the meticulousness of the proofs, are commendable. Nonetheless, the narrow focus of the paper, concentrating on sparse linear regression where key outcomes are already established, somewhat limits its broader impact. The mathematical rigor and absence of gaps in the proofs underscore the paper's technical soundness, yet the decision to delve into a specific case rather than contributing to the more general framework of atomic norm analysis [Chandrasekaran et al, 2012 FOCM], which could unify various linear inverse problems, restricts the scope of the contribution.
