This manuscript investigates the optimization of classifiers to maximize the F-measure in an online setting, a problem characterized by a non-decomposable loss function defined as the ratio of two linear functions. Unlike traditional approaches that operate in a batch setting and determine the optimal threshold for probabilistic classifiers using a validation set, this work presents an online learning algorithm designed to find the optimal threshold, accompanied by consistency results under various assumptions. The authors also provide extensive experimental results, including those in the appendix, to demonstrate the efficacy of their proposed method.
The paper is generally well-structured, with a clear and engaging presentation of the proof for Theorem 3. The theoretical foundations appear robust, and the experimental section is convincingly laid out. 
Although this area is not my specialty, making it challenging for me to fully assess the novelty of the technical contributions against the backdrop of existing literature on F-measure maximization, I appreciate the balanced integration of theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental components.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include expanding the comparison with reference [9] in the Discussion section (Section 6), particularly in relation to AUC maximization in the online setting. Relevant studies that could enhance this discussion include Wang et al.'s work on generalization bounds for online learning algorithms with pairwise loss functions (COLT 2012) and Kar et al.'s analysis on the generalization ability of online learning algorithms for pairwise loss functions (ICML 2013). Additionally, there is an extra space in the word "consistency" on Line 454.
Overall, the paper proposes a novel online learning algorithm for F-measure optimization, distinguished by its well-rounded approach that combines theoretical rigor, algorithmic innovation, and comprehensive experimentation.
