This manuscript presents a generative approach for structured output variables by conditioning the variational auto-encoder framework. The authors introduce multiple model variants and evaluate their performance on pixel labeling tasks using both synthetic MNIST data and real-world datasets, such as CUB and LFW, yielding promising outcomes.
The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with only a few minor typographical errors. However, the process of generating final pixel labels could be clarified further, potentially through an illustrative example that applies the methodology outlined in Section 3.1 to pixel labeling, which would enhance reader comprehension. Notably, the manuscript lacks citations to closely related works, including "Deep Structured Output Learning for Unconstrained Text Recognition" and "Learning Deep Structured Models," both presented at ICLR 2015. The exploration of the conditional variational autoencoder framework for pixel labeling is intriguing, and the inclusion of additional structured prediction tasks, along with a detailed explanation of the inference process, would further strengthen the paper.
