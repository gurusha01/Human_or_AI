This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the partition function in statistical relational models using lifted inference, introducing a lifted And/Or search space framework that appears to be a new contribution. The writing is clear and the overall presentation is well-organized. 
The concepts explored in the paper are theoretically valid and demonstrate potential. However, the evaluation section falls short, lacking a comprehensive comparison with existing approximations of the partition function. Additionally, the authors omit an examination of the approximation's bounds and its scalability, which are crucial for understanding its practical applicability.
While the proposed lifted And/Or framework may offer significant reductions in inference complexity, the limited scope of the evaluation makes it challenging to fully assess its impact. Despite this, the paper contributes a new algorithm that could be of interest to the NIPS community, particularly those focused on lifted inference. 
Overall, the paper's ideas are sound, but the brevity of the evaluation and the absence of a comparison with other partition function approximations are notable shortcomings.
