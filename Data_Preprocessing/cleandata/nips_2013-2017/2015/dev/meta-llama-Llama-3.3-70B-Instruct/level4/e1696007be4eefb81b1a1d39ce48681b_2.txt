This manuscript investigates the application of atomic norms in structured sparse regression, focusing on a given atomic set A that adheres to a sign-change invariance assumption. The authors establish bounds for the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, the tangent cone, and the L2-compatibility number, which collectively provide sufficient characterization for the convergence rate of the estimation problem under specific conditions.
The introduced technique exhibits generality and, when applied to both unweighted and weighted L1 norms, yields bounds that align with those obtained through existing methods. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the applicability of this technique to k-support norms, deriving novel bounds that suggest k should be under-specified in practical scenarios, presenting an intriguing implication.
Although the analysis of the unit norm ball relies on a lemma from a previous study [14] and may not constitute a substantially original contribution, the analyses of the tangent cone and compatibility appear non-trivial. These are grounded in a straightforward yet potent observation, as stated in Lemma 3, which enables the upper bounding of the tangent cone of an atomic norm by that of a weighted L1 norm.
A potential enhancement could involve the authors conducting numerical simulations using k-support norms to verify whether the derived bounds align with empirical behavior, particularly to investigate the impact of over-specifying k on recovery performance.
Overall, the paper is found to be engaging, with proofs that are relatively straightforward to comprehend. The manuscript is well-structured, and the results are clearly articulated and explained, contributing to the derivation of novel convergence rates for regressions involving k-support norms, as facilitated by the innovative method presented for bounding Gaussian widths in the context of structured sparsity.
