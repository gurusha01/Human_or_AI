Summary
The authors present a novel approach to actively selecting the most suitable model for a given dataset, which differs from traditional active learning methods that focus on estimating model hyperparameters. Instead, this method aims to distinguish between a set of models by selecting the most informative data points. Unlike existing active model selection techniques, this approach does not require retraining models for each new data point, making it more efficient. The authors demonstrate the potential of this method in detecting noise-induced hearing loss, which could significantly reduce the number of tests required for large-scale screenings.
Quality
The paper is technically sound, with derivations that are logical, although lacking in detail. However, the absence of theoretical justification and discussion is notable. The empirical evaluation is limited, comparing the proposed method only to a traditional active learning algorithm and a random baseline on simulated data generated from the authors' model, which may introduce bias. A more comprehensive evaluation should include real data with actual examples of noise-induced hearing loss and comparisons with other active model selection methods. Additionally, crucial aspects, such as defining candidate points and models, are not addressed.
Clarity
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively introducing the proposed method and its relevance. The application to noise-induced hearing loss is particularly well-explained, making the paper a pleasure to read.
Originality
The problem of active model selection is less explored than active learning, and the authors' method offers a unique variation of existing approaches. Although it builds upon established approximations, its application to noise-induced hearing loss is novel and contributes to an under-studied area.
Significance
The proposed method significantly improves upon existing active model selection techniques by eliminating the need for model retraining, enabling real-time applications and reducing the number of testing points required for noise-induced hearing loss screening. This could have a substantial impact on large-scale screenings by reducing costs.
Pros
* The paper is well-written and clear
* The proposed method is a new and efficient approach to active model selection
* It offers significant gains in reducing the number of samples required for an important practical application
Cons
* The lack of theoretical analysis and discussion of the new method is a significant drawback
* The empirical evaluation is weak and potentially biased
* The comparison with other active model selection techniques is absent
* The evaluation is based on simulated data from the authors' model, which may not accurately represent real-world scenarios
* Key issues, such as generating candidate points and models, are not discussed
The authors' novel active model selection approach shows promise, and its application to noise-induced hearing loss is useful. However, the evaluation falls short of being convincing due to its limitations, and the omission of discussions on critical aspects, such as candidate location and model selection, undermines the paper's overall impact.
