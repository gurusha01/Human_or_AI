The authors may find the papers "Achieving optimal misclassification proportion in the stochastic blockmodel" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03772) and "minimax rates of community detection in stochastic blockmodels" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05313) to be of interest. This work presents an efficient algorithm for achieving the optimal classification rate in stochastic blockmodels, a currently active and fruitful area of research. Nevertheless, the paper's readability is compromised, lacking a clear exposition of the algorithms, although potentially more details are provided in the supplementary materials. The overall impression is that the conversion of a longer paper into this shorter version was done with minimal effort, which hinders the clarity and effectiveness of the presentation.
