This paper focuses on the design of near-optimal auction mechanisms, where optimality is evaluated in terms of revenue. According to auction theory, such auctions assign the object to the bidder with the highest virtual valuation, but this requires knowledge of the distribution $Fi$ from which the valuation $vi$ is drawn. Furthermore, even with this knowledge, the payment rules for these auctions can be overly complex for practical use. As an alternative, the authors propose a simple family of auctions, known as t-level auctions, which have a straightforward payment rule. To address the issue of unknown $F_i$, the authors suggest empirical revenue maximization over this family of auctions.
The primary contribution of this work is demonstrating that by setting $t = O(\frac{1}{\eps})$ and using a sample size of $O(1/\eps^3)$, the empirical revenue-maximizing t-level auction achieves revenue that is $(1 - \eps)$-optimal. The paper establishes an intriguing connection between learning theory and auction theory, a link that has been explored by several researchers, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of prior work in this area. The paper is generally well-written, and although the concepts and proofs are fundamental to both machine learning and auction theory, the connection between the two fields is interesting and warrants further exploration by the learning community.
To improve the paper, several suggestions are offered: (1) The explanation of pseudo-dimension could be condensed, as it is a familiar concept in the learning community, and a simple reference to its definition would suffice. (2) The explanation of equivalence classes is unclear, particularly the reason why most levels induce the same permutation; it seems that the second condition is sufficient. (3) In the proof of Lemma 3.5, it appears that $\phi \in [0, \alpha]$ is intended. (4) Including the reasoning behind equation (3) in the appendix would be beneficial, as the equivalence between expected revenue and expected allocation of virtual valuations may not be a standard fact in the learning community. (5) The first paragraph of the appendix contains a sentence that seems out of place: "bounded case, following ideas from This...".
Overall, this paper presents an interesting approach to the study of optimal mechanism design using machine learning techniques, with correct results that highlight an intriguing connection between auction theory and machine learning.
