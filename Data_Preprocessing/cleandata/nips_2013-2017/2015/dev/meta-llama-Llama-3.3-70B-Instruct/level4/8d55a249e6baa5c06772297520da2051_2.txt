This manuscript presents an extension of variational auto-encoders to structured prediction, modeling the probability of structured output given input, and introduces several novel training process innovations. The results are demonstrated on pixel labeling tasks using the CUB and LFW datasets. To the best of my knowledge, this work is original and addresses an important goal of leveraging expressive models for structured prediction, which has the potential for significant impact. The concepts and objectives outlined in this paper are therefore noteworthy and deserving of exploration. However, the manuscript has two major shortcomings: 
- The writing lacks clarity and omits crucial details. Specifically, the architecture of the networks used is not fully described; although the authors mention that all networks are 2-layer MLPs, this description is insufficient as MLPs are not inherently generative models. It is unclear whether the MLPs predict parameters of a Gaussian distribution, as in [24], or a mixture model, as in [16]. Furthermore, the modeling of p(y|x,z) by the two networks, net{z2y} and net{x2y}, is not clearly explained; it is uncertain whether these networks' predictions are combined through averaging, multiplication, or another method. This lack of clarity will hinder future researchers attempting to replicate the results.
- The results presented are somewhat disappointing. Tables 3 and 4 indicate that a simpler CNN approach is remarkably competitive, raising questions about the value of the 1-point improvement achieved by the proposed method. The significance of a 1-point gain in these datasets is also unclear. Although Table 5 shows promising results, the experimental setting appears somewhat artificial.
Overall, while the ideas in this paper are commendable and warrant further investigation, the results are not particularly impressive, and the manuscript requires significant revision to enhance clarity and provide missing details. The application of recent variational autoencoder advancements to structured prediction is a noble pursuit, but the current results are underwhelming, and the omission of several key details detracts from the manuscript's overall quality.
