This paper introduces a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) over both sets and paths, which is a crucial problem in planning and learning under uncertainty. The authors propose two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), that enable efficient approximate solution of ASO with pointwise submodular objective functions. They also present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over either a set or a path domain.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to situate their contribution within the broader context of ASO and submodular optimization.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of two new conditions, MLRB and MLB, which provide a framework for understanding the performance of approximation algorithms for ASO.
* The development of a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, RAC, that guarantees near-optimal solution of ASO over both sets and paths.
* The application of RAC to two adaptive informative path planning tasks, which demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the objective function is pointwise monotone submodular, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of RAC, which would be useful for understanding the scalability of the algorithm.
* The experimental evaluation is limited to two tasks, and it would be useful to see more extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness of RAC.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of ASO and submodular optimization, and the authors' approach has the potential to be widely applicable in practice. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach.
