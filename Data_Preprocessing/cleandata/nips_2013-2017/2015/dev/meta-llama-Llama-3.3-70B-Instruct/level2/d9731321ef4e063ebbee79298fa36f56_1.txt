This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic approach for active model selection, called Bayesian Active Model Selection (BAMS), and applies it to the problem of rapid screening for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The authors propose a general framework for active Bayesian model selection, which can be used with arbitrary models, and provide an efficient analytic approximation for Gaussian process (GP) models with arbitrary observation likelihoods.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) BAMS is a effective and efficient approach for active model selection, (2) BAMS can be used for automatically learning the model class of Gaussian processes with arbitrary observation likelihoods, and (3) BAMS can be applied to real-world problems, such as rapid screening for NIHL.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The authors derive an analytical approximation of the BAMS criterion for GP models, which enables active structure learning for GPs. They also evaluate the performance of BAMS on a real-world application, namely, diagnosing NIHL, and demonstrate that it can achieve high accuracy with fewer samples than existing approaches.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its application to NIHL. The use of GP models and the derivation of the analytical approximation are well-motivated and well-explained. The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of BAMS in diagnosing NIHL with fewer samples than existing approaches.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the proposal of a novel and effective approach for active model selection, (2) the derivation of an analytical approximation for GP models, and (3) the demonstration of the approach on a real-world application. The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the assumption of a specific form for the GP model, which may not be applicable to all problems, and (2) the lack of comparison with other active learning approaches.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the results are impressive. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and active learning.
