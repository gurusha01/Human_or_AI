This paper presents a novel approach to color constancy, a fundamental problem in computer vision, by leveraging per-pixel color statistics of natural scenes. The authors propose a method that estimates the illuminant chromaticity by computing a likelihood distribution over possible true chromaticity values for each pixel, given its observed luminance. The approach is based on a conditional likelihood function, L[x̂, y], which is defined over a discrete domain by quantizing both chromaticity and luminance values.
The paper makes two main claims: (1) that per-pixel color statistics can be a powerful cue for color constancy, and (2) that learning the likelihood function L[x̂, y] end-to-end can improve the accuracy of illuminant estimation. The authors support these claims through extensive experiments on the Gehler-Shi database, demonstrating that their method outperforms state-of-the-art color constancy methods, including those that employ more complex features and semantic reasoning.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with comparisons to other methods and detailed analysis of the results. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work in the field and discusses the limitations of the approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* Novel approach to color constancy that leverages per-pixel color statistics
* Extensive experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach
* Clear and concise writing style
* Good overview of related work and discussion of limitations
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The approach assumes a single global illuminant, which may not be the case in all scenarios
* The method requires a large amount of training data to learn the likelihood function L[x̂, y]
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications of the approach and its limitations in practice
Overall, I believe that this paper is a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and color constancy. The approach is novel, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, with some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
