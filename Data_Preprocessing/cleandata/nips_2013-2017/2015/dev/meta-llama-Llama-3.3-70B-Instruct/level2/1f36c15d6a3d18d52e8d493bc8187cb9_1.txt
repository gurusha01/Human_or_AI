This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, providing sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for various fundamental shape restrictions on discrete distributions. The authors' approach is based on a novel use of the 2 statistic, which enables them to achieve optimal sample complexity.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a general framework for testing whether a distribution belongs to a specific class or is far from it, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several important classes, including monotone, log-concave, monotone hazard rate, and unimodal distributions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their approach and results. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
The paper's contributions are significant, as they provide the first sample-optimal testers for many of the classes considered. The authors also provide matching lower bounds, which demonstrate the optimality of their testers.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle high-dimensional distributions, which is a challenging problem in distribution testing. The authors' approach is able to efficiently test for monotonicity in high dimensions, which is a significant improvement over previous results.
The paper also provides a useful building block for future research, as the authors' tester can be used as a subroutine in other distribution testing algorithms.
In terms of weaknesses, the paper assumes that the distribution is discrete, which may limit its applicability to continuous distributions. However, this is a common assumption in distribution testing, and the authors' results can still be applied to continuous distributions by discretizing them.
Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of distribution testing, and its results have important implications for a wide range of applications, including statistics, machine learning, and data analysis.
