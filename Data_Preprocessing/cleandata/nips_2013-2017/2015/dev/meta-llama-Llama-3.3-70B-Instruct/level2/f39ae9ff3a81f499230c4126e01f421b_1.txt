This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, and propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for the need for a more flexible distribution than the Multinomial.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the LPMRF distribution is a more flexible and realistic model for count data than the Multinomial, (2) the authors develop efficient algorithms for estimating the parameters of the LPMRF distribution, and (3) the LPMRF distribution can be used to improve the performance of topic models.
The support for these claims is strong. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of the Multinomial distribution and the Poisson MRF distribution, and show how the LPMRF distribution overcomes these limitations. They also provide experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPMRF distribution in modeling real-world data.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high. The LPMRF distribution has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including topic modeling, text analysis, and recommender systems. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized implementation of their algorithms, which makes it easy for others to reproduce their results.
The paper reflects a good understanding of the field, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work. The novelty of the paper is high, as the LPMRF distribution is a new and original contribution to the field.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, (2) a thorough analysis of the limitations of existing distributions, (3) a well-organized and easy-to-follow presentation of the LPMRF distribution and its properties, and (4) a strong experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of the LPMRF distribution.
The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the paper is quite long and dense, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow, and (2) some of the experimental results could be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas.
