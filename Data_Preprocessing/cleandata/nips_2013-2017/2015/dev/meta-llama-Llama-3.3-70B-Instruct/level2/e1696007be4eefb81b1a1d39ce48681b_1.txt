This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of geometric measures for structured estimation problems with atomic norms. The authors provide general upper bounds for the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, the Gaussian width of the spherical cap induced by the tangent cone, and the restricted norm compatibility constant. These bounds are shown to be tight and are applicable to a wide range of atomic norms, including the k-support norm.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the geometric measures and their relationships to the atomic norm and its dual norm. The results are supported by rigorous proofs and examples, including the application to the k-support norm.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. General and tight bounds: The authors provide general upper bounds for the geometric measures that are applicable to a wide range of atomic norms. These bounds are shown to be tight, making them practical for use in structured estimation problems.
2. Clear and concise writing: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand the analysis and results.
3. Comprehensive analysis: The authors provide a thorough analysis of the geometric measures, including their relationships to the atomic norm and its dual norm.
4. Practical applications: The paper includes examples and applications of the results to the k-support norm, demonstrating the practical relevance of the analysis.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Technical complexity: The paper assumes a strong background in convex analysis, linear algebra, and probability theory, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow.
2. Limited discussion of computational aspects: While the authors provide a procedure for solving the polar operator for the k-support norm, there is limited discussion of the computational aspects of the analysis and how it can be implemented in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of structured estimation and atomic norms. The results and analysis are rigorous and well-supported, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors demonstrate the practical relevance of the analysis through examples and applications, making the paper a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
