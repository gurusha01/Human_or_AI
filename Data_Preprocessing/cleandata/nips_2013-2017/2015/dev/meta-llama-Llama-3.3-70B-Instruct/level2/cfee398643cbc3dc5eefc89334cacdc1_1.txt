This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors introduce efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters, a crucial assumption in most previous works. The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Novel algorithms: The authors propose two algorithms, Agnostic-sphere-comparison and Agnostic-degree-profiling, which achieve optimal accuracy and complexity scaling for large node degrees and exact recovery in the logarithmic degree regime.
2. Theoretical guarantees: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including proofs of the algorithms' correctness and bounds on their performance.
3. Experimental evaluation: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms on real-world data, achieving state-of-the-art results.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
1. Assumptions on community sizes: The algorithms require a lower bound on the relative sizes of the communities, which may not always be available in practice.
2. Computational complexity: While the algorithms have good theoretical guarantees, their computational complexity may be high for very large graphs.
3. Extension to more general models: The paper focuses on the standard SBM, and it would be interesting to extend the results to more general models, such as those with overlapping communities or corrected degrees.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental evaluation is convincing. The paper's contributions are significant, and the results have the potential to impact the field of community detection.
