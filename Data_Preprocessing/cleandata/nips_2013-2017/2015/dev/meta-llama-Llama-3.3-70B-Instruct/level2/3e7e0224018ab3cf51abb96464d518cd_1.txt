This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and learning theory, extending the concept of coarse correlated equilibria to Bayesian games. The authors provide two main technical results: (1) near-optimal welfare in Bayesian games follows directly from the smoothness-based proof of near-optimal welfare in the same game when the private information is public, and (2) no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium in these incomplete information games.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, motivation, and background. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are rigorous and easy to follow. The use of a population interpretation of Bayesian games as a stochastic game of complete information is a clever idea, and it allows the authors to extend the smoothness framework of Roughgarden to Bayesian games.
The results of the paper are significant, as they provide a new understanding of the behavior of no-regret learning dynamics in Bayesian games. The authors show that the average welfare of any no-regret dynamics of the repeated Bayesian game achieves average social welfare at least λ max{1,µ} of the average optimal welfare, almost surely. This result has important implications for the design of mechanisms in online ad-auction marketplaces and other applications where Bayesian games are relevant.
The paper also provides a finite-time analysis and convergence rates, which is an important contribution. The authors show that approximate efficiency results can be obtained even for finite time, when players are allowed to have some -regret.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The results are significant, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are rigorous and easy to follow.
