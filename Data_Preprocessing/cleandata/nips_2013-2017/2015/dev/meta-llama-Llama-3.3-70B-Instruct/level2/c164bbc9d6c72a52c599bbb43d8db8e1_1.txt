This paper introduces a generic scheme for accelerating first-order optimization methods, which the authors call the "catalyst" acceleration. The approach is based on a new analysis of the accelerated proximal point algorithm and can be applied to a wide range of optimization methods, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, SAG, SAGA, SDCA, SVRG, Finito/MISO, and their proximal variants.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the catalyst acceleration can be applied to a large class of optimization methods, (2) it provides a universal positive answer to the question of whether these methods can be accelerated, regardless of the strong convexity of the objective, and (3) it automatically provides direct support for non-strongly convex objectives.
The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the catalyst acceleration, including convergence rates and computational complexity. The authors also present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the catalyst acceleration on several datasets and optimization methods.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the introduction of a novel and generic acceleration scheme, (2) a thorough theoretical analysis, and (3) experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the complexity of the analysis, which may make it difficult to follow for non-experts, and (2) the lack of comparison with other acceleration methods.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and generic acceleration scheme that can be applied to a wide range of optimization methods.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a clear understanding of the convergence rates and computational complexity of the catalyst acceleration.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the catalyst acceleration on several datasets and optimization methods.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis is complex and may be difficult to follow for non-experts.
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other acceleration methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the results.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper because of its novelty, thorough theoretical analysis, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the catalyst acceleration. However, I suggest that the authors provide a clearer comparison with other acceleration methods and simplify the analysis to make it more accessible to non-experts.
