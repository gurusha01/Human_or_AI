This paper proposes a novel mechanism for purchasing information from a sequence of participants, leveraging the principles of prediction markets to incentivize data aggregation while providing reasonable privacy guarantees. The authors introduce two mechanisms: Mechanism 1, a general template for eliciting and aggregating data, and Mechanism 2, a privacy-protected version that ensures differential privacy for participants' updates.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed mechanisms can efficiently aggregate data from multiple participants while providing incentives for truthful reporting, and (2) Mechanism 2 can preserve the privacy of participants' updates while maintaining accuracy. The authors support these claims through theoretical analysis and provide bounds on the worst-case loss and accuracy guarantees.
The paper's strengths include its novel application of prediction market techniques to data aggregation, its provision of privacy guarantees, and its thorough analysis of the mechanisms' properties. The authors also demonstrate the flexibility of their approach by showing how it can be applied to various settings, including exponential family mechanisms and nonparametric hypothesis spaces using kernels.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement. The paper assumes that participants have a clear understanding of the mechanism and can make informed decisions about their updates, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the authors note that the privacy guarantees provided by Mechanism 2 are somewhat weaker than those typically desired in the differential privacy literature.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to data aggregation that addresses important concerns around privacy and incentives.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the mechanisms' properties and demonstrate their effectiveness through theoretical bounds and guarantees.
* The paper has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of prediction markets and data aggregation, and its results could be applied to a wide range of practical problems.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's assumptions about participant behavior and understanding of the mechanism may not always hold in practice, which could limit the applicability of the results.
* The privacy guarantees provided by Mechanism 2 are somewhat weaker than those typically desired in the differential privacy literature, which may be a concern for some applications.
* The paper could benefit from more extensive empirical evaluation and testing to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.
Overall, I believe that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance. The authors' innovative approach to data aggregation and their thorough analysis of the mechanisms' properties make this paper a valuable contribution to the field. With some revisions to address the limitations and concerns noted above, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of prediction markets and data aggregation.
