This paper presents a novel approach to color constancy, a fundamental problem in computer vision, by leveraging per-pixel color statistics of natural scenes. The authors propose a method that estimates the illuminant chromaticity by computing a likelihood distribution over possible true chromaticity values for each pixel, given its observed luminance. The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the areas of color constancy and image understanding.
The strengths of the paper include its simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to outperform state-of-the-art color constancy methods. The authors demonstrate that their approach, based on a conditional likelihood function for true chromaticity given luminance, can achieve high accuracy in estimating the illuminant chromaticity. The paper also presents two approaches to learning this function, one based on empirical pixel statistics and the other on maximizing accuracy of the final illuminant estimate.
The weaknesses of the paper include the assumption of a single global illuminant, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the method relies on a large dataset of natural images, which may not be readily available in all cases. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations and potential failures of the approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method and results. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the comparison to state-of-the-art methods is helpful in understanding the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
