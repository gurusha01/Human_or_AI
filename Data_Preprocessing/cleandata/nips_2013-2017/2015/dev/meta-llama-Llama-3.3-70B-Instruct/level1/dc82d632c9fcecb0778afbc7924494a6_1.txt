This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of efficient inference in Statistical Relational Models (SRMs) by introducing a lifted analogue of the propositional And/Or search space framework, called a lifted And/Or schematic. The authors propose a principled method for computing tight upper bounds on the time and space cost of exact inference, which can be used to improve the efficiency of lifted importance sampling algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the definition of lifted And/Or schematics, the computation of induced lifted width, and the application of the method to Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the variance of the estimates and improving the accuracy of the inference.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and powerful framework for representing and reasoning about SRMs, which has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of inference in these models.
* The provision of a clear and detailed explanation of the approach, including the mathematical foundations and the algorithmic implementation.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through experimental results on several benchmark datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the approach, which may make it difficult to implement and apply in practice, particularly for large and complex SRMs.
* The reliance on the shattering process, which may not always be feasible or efficient, particularly for large and complex models.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for inference in SRMs, which makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of SRMs and inference, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of inference in these models. However, further research is needed to address the complexity and scalability of the approach, as well as to compare its performance with other state-of-the-art methods.
