This paper proposes a novel approach to matrix completion by incorporating pairwise relationships among variables via a graph. The authors formulate a highly efficient conjugate gradient-based alternating minimization scheme that solves optimizations with over 55 million observations up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art gradient-descent-based methods. The paper also provides theoretical consistency guarantees for graph-regularized matrix completion and empirically validates the results on both real and synthetic datasets.
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the areas of matrix completion, collaborative filtering, and graph-based methods. The authors build upon existing work on weighted nuclear norm formulations and Gaussian generative models, and provide a generalization of these methods that incorporates graph information.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm, GRALS, is highly efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
* The paper provides theoretical consistency guarantees for graph-regularized matrix completion, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving comparable error rates to other methods while being significantly more scalable.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the graph information is available and does not provide a method for constructing the graph from scratch.
* The theoretical analysis is limited to the case where the minimum eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is unity, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations, particularly in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and efficient algorithm for matrix completion with graph information.
* The theoretical consistency guarantees provided in the paper are a significant contribution to the field.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving comparable error rates to other methods while being significantly more scalable.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the graph information is available, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The theoretical analysis is limited to a specific case, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion and collaborative filtering. The theoretical consistency guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
