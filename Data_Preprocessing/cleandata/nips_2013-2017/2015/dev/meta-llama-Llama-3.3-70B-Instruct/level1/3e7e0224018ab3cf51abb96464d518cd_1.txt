This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and learning theory, extending the concept of price-of-anarchy analysis to games of incomplete information, also known as Bayesian games. The authors provide two main technical results: (1) near-optimal welfare in Bayesian games follows directly from the smoothness-based proof of near-optimal welfare in the same game when the private information is public, and (2) no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium in these incomplete information games.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, motivation, and background. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are rigorous and easy to follow. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide appropriate citations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The extension of the price-of-anarchy analysis to Bayesian games, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The provision of two main technical results, which are both interesting and important.
* The clear and concise writing style, which makes the paper easy to follow.
* The rigorous and well-organized proofs, which demonstrate a good understanding of the technical material.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in game theory and learning theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers who are not experts in the field.
* The paper could benefit from more examples and illustrations to help motivate the results and make them more accessible to a broader audience.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The results are significant, and the paper is well-written and well-organized. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the technical material, and the proofs are rigorous and easy to follow.
