This paper proposes a novel mechanism for purchasing information from a sequence of participants, where the participants may hold private data points or more sophisticated information. The mechanism, drawing on principles of prediction markets, has a bounded budget and minimizes generalization error for Bregman divergence loss functions. The authors also show how to modify this mechanism to preserve the privacy of participants' information, ensuring that the current prices and predictions of the mechanism reveal almost no information about any one participant.
The paper relates to previous work on prediction markets, crowdsourcing contests, and differential privacy. The authors build upon the work of Abernethy et al. [1] and introduce several innovations, including conditional markets, nonparametric securities, and privacy guarantees. The mechanism is designed to be efficient, incentive-compatible, and private, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for its performance.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to incentivized data aggregation, its ability to provide privacy guarantees, and its potential applications in various fields. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their mechanism and its properties.
However, there are some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement. One concern is the complexity of the mechanism and its potential scalability issues. The authors assume that the participants have access to a private set of samples from the true underlying distribution, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the mechanism relies on a number of parameters and hyperparameters, which may require careful tuning in practice.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to incentivized data aggregation.
* The mechanism provides privacy guarantees, which is an important consideration in many applications.
* The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the mechanism.
* The paper is well-organized and clearly written.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The mechanism may be complex and difficult to scale.
* The authors assume that participants have access to a private set of samples from the true underlying distribution.
* The mechanism relies on a number of parameters and hyperparameters, which may require careful tuning in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more experimental evaluations and comparisons to existing methods.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of AI and machine learning, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, but suggest that the authors address some of the concerns and areas for improvement mentioned above.
