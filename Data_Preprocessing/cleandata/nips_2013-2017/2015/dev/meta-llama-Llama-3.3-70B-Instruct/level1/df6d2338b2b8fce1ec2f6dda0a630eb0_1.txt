This paper introduces a novel approach to adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) problems, which are crucial in planning and learning under uncertainty. The authors propose two conditions, the marginal likelihood rate bound (MLRB) and the marginal likelihood bound (MLB), that enable efficient approximate solutions to ASO problems with pointwise submodular objective functions. They also present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that guarantees near-optimal solutions for ASO problems over both sets and paths.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the conditions and the algorithm, including proofs and examples. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RAC in two robot planning tasks under uncertainty.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of two new conditions, MLRB and MLB, which provide a framework for understanding the performance of approximation algorithms for ASO problems.
* The development of a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, RAC, that can handle ASO problems over both sets and paths.
* The thorough analysis of the algorithm, including proofs and examples.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of RAC in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the objective function is pointwise submodular, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires the computation of the marginal likelihood of a history, which can be computationally expensive.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing algorithms for ASO problems.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel approach to ASO problems, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The algorithm is polynomial-time, which makes it efficient in practice.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a specific structure on the objective function, which may not always be realistic.
* The algorithm requires the computation of the marginal likelihood of a history, which can be computationally expensive.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing algorithms.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of ASO. The introduction of the two conditions and the development of the RAC algorithm are notable achievements. While there are some weaknesses, I believe that the paper is worthy of acceptance.
