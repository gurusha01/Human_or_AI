This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of structured estimation problems with atomic norms, which are commonly used in compressed sensing and statistical applications. The authors provide general upper bounds for three key geometric measures: the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, the Gaussian width of the spherical cap induced by the tangent cone, and the restricted norm compatibility constant. These bounds are derived using a novel approach that only requires simple information about the atomic norm, making them widely applicable.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the general bounds, including proofs and examples to illustrate their application. The results are also compared to existing work in the field, demonstrating the improvements and contributions of the paper.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. General applicability: The bounds derived in the paper are general and can be applied to a wide range of atomic norms, making them a valuable contribution to the field.
2. Novel approach: The authors' approach to deriving the bounds is new and innovative, using a decomposition of the atomic set and a single subgradient of the norm.
3. Improved results: The paper provides improved bounds compared to existing work, particularly for the k-support norm.
4. Clear exposition: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations and examples to illustrate the results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Technical complexity: The paper assumes a strong background in convex analysis and compressed sensing, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.
2. Limited numerical experiments: The paper does not include extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the bounds.
3. Some results are not surprising: Some of the results, such as the bound on the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, may not be surprising to experts in the field.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of compressed sensing and statistical applications, providing general and improved bounds for structured estimation problems with atomic norms. The results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications, from signal processing to machine learning.
