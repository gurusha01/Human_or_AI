This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs). The authors introduce efficient algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs without requiring knowledge of the model parameters, a crucial assumption in most previous works. The paper builds upon previous results, including the work of Abbe-Sandon '15, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the problem.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Technical soundness: The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of correctness and bounds on the error rates.
2. Originality: The authors introduce novel algorithms, such as Agnostic-sphere-comparison and Agnostic-degree-profiling, which achieve optimal performance without requiring knowledge of the model parameters.
3. Significance: The paper addresses a fundamental problem in community detection, and the results have implications for various applications, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and image segmentation.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithms, proofs, and experimental results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Complexity: The algorithms and proofs are complex and may be challenging to follow for non-experts.
2. Assumptions: While the authors relax the assumption of known model parameters, they still require some assumptions about the relative sizes of the communities and the connectivity matrix.
3. Experimental evaluation: The experimental results are limited to a single dataset, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the algorithms on a broader range of datasets.
Arguments pro acceptance:
1. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection, addressing a fundamental problem and providing novel algorithms with optimal performance guarantees.
2. The technical soundness and originality of the paper are evident, and the authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem.
3. The results have implications for various applications, making the paper relevant to a broad audience.
Arguments con acceptance:
1. The complexity of the algorithms and proofs may limit the paper's accessibility to non-experts.
2. The assumptions required by the algorithms may not be satisfied in all practical scenarios, which could limit the applicability of the results.
3. The experimental evaluation is limited, and additional results on a broader range of datasets would strengthen the paper's conclusions.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of community detection, and the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. However, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the limitations and providing additional experimental results to further demonstrate the applicability of their algorithms.
