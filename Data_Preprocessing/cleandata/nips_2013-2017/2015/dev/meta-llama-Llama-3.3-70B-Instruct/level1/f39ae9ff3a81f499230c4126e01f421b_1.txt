This paper proposes a novel distribution, the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF), which generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. The LPMRF distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model but is restricted to a fixed-length vector, making it more suitable for modeling count-valued data such as text documents. The authors develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function, which were not tractable to compute under the PMRF model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for the need for a more flexible distribution than the Multinomial. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, including the development of the LPMRF distribution, the AIS sampling methods, and the extension of the LPMRF distribution to mixtures and topic models. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed models on datasets, showing that they offer good performance when compared to Multinomial-based models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution
* The development of AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function
* The extension of the LPMRF distribution to mixtures and topic models
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed models on datasets
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the LPMRF distribution and the AIS sampling methods, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow
* The lack of comparison with other topic models that use distributions other than the Multinomial
* The limited exploration of the relationship between the topic matrix optimization method and Gibbs sampling
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel distribution that addresses the limitations of the Multinomial distribution
* The technical contributions of the paper are significant and well-motivated
* The evaluation of the proposed models on datasets is thorough and shows good performance
Arguments against acceptance:
* The complexity of the LPMRF distribution and the AIS sampling methods may make it difficult for some readers to follow
* The lack of comparison with other topic models that use distributions other than the Multinomial may limit the impact of the paper
* The limited exploration of the relationship between the topic matrix optimization method and Gibbs sampling may be seen as a limitation of the paper.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and makes significant technical contributions to the field. The proposal of the LPMRF distribution and the development of AIS sampling methods are notable achievements, and the evaluation of the proposed models on datasets is thorough. While there are some limitations to the paper, I believe that it has the potential to make a significant impact in the field and therefore recommend acceptance.
