This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of auction theory, specifically in the context of learning revenue-maximizing auctions from data. The authors develop a general approach, rooted in statistical learning theory, to learn an approximately revenue-maximizing auction from samples. They introduce the concept of t-level auctions, which interpolate between simple auctions and optimal auctions, balancing expressivity and simplicity.
The paper's main ideas are related to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the areas of learning theory and auction design. The authors build upon the work of Balcan et al. [4] and Elkind [12], who also applied learning theory to auction design. However, the current paper extends these results to more general settings, including single-parameter settings with non-finite support distributions.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Technical soundness: The paper provides a rigorous and well-supported analysis of the proposed approach, including proofs of the pseudo-dimension of t-level auctions and the representation error bound.
2. Originality: The introduction of t-level auctions and the application of learning theory to auction design are novel contributions to the field.
3. Significance: The results have important implications for the design of revenue-maximizing auctions in practice, particularly in settings where the underlying distribution of bidder valuations is unknown.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Computational efficiency: The learning algorithms proposed in the paper are not computationally efficient, which may limit their practical applicability.
2. Limited scope: The paper focuses on single-parameter settings, leaving open the question of whether similar results can be obtained for multi-parameter settings.
Arguments pro acceptance:
1. The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of auction theory, with potential applications in practice.
2. The technical analysis is rigorous and well-supported, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.
3. The introduction of t-level auctions provides a new and interesting perspective on auction design.
Arguments con acceptance:
1. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms is a concern, which may limit their practical applicability.
2. The scope of the paper is limited to single-parameter settings, which may not be representative of all real-world auction scenarios.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying concepts. The results are significant and have the potential to impact the field of auction theory. While there are some limitations to the paper, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance.
