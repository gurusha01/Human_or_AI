This paper is mostly clear, with a few exceptions outlined below.
The work builds upon existing research in a potentially valuable manner, though the experiments provided to demonstrate the method are relatively small and straightforward.
The theoretical contributions connect this work to prior research (Proposition 2), establish its applicability to a novel domain (Propositions 1 and 3), and provide an analysis of the algorithm.
However, the utility of the algorithm analysis is debatable (e.g., Theorems 1 and 2).
The derived bound scales with the square of the logarithm of the number of actions (where the actions correspond to the number of possible locations on the path, as each action represents "visit location x") relative to the optimal cost.
This bound does not appear particularly tight for practical use in problems of any reasonable size.
A few clarity issues: line 110, should the inequality be reversed since A is a subset of B? line 125, what are the termination conditions for a policy, and how are they determined in practice? line between 151 and 152, there seem to be some notational errors; line 216, what are the alignment assumptions? experiments: the labels on the plots do not match those referenced in the text.
The captions should provide more informative details rather than repeating information already displayed on the plots (e.g., Gibbs error). This paper presents an extension to submodular optimization, broadening its applicability beyond sets. The contributions include the formulation and analysis of two conditions enabling this extension, as well as the introduction of an algorithm to address problems satisfying these conditions. These contributions appear to be novel, well-motivated, and relevant to the community.
