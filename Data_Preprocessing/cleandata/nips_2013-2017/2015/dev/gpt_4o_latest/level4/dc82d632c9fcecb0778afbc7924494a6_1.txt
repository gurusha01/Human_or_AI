The paper presents a method for estimating the partition function in the context of lifted inference within statistical relational models. It is well-written, clear, and introduces a lifted adaptation of the And/Or search space framework, which, to the best of my knowledge, is a novel contribution.
Overall, the concepts discussed in the paper appear to be well-founded.
However, the evaluation section is somewhat limited and does not include a comparison of the proposed approach with other methods for approximating the partition function. Additionally, the authors do not provide an analysis of the approximation bounds or a broader study of its scalability.
While the lifted And/Or framework proposed in the paper has the potential to significantly reduce the complexity of inference, the limited scope of the evaluation and results makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, the paper introduces an innovative algorithm that could be valuable to the NIPS community focused on lifted inference.
