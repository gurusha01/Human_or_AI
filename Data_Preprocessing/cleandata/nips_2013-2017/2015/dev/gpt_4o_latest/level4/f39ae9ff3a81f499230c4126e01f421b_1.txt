The paper introduces the fixed-length PRMs distribution, which establishes dependencies between the dimensions of a multinomial distribution.
The manuscript is well-written and addresses an intriguing problem.
Poisson graphical models, which are currently gaining significant attention, contribute to the development of innovative probabilistic topic models.
The primary objective is to ensure the partition function remains finite. In this work, the proposed approach achieves this by limiting the support of the partition function to vectors with the same total length or norm.
I find this idea appealing; however, the paper would be considerably stronger if it included a comparison with a truncated Poisson LDA, specifically using TPMRF as described in [6]. At present, the differences are discussed only theoretically, without any empirical evidence to support the claims.
In addition, there should be a comparison with the PMRF topic model introduced in [2]. Such a comparison would highlight the advantages of the proposed method over the more general approach in [2]. While I acknowledge that [2] does not lend itself easily to perplexity evaluations due to the complex partition function, it would still be possible to apply a basic MCMC chain on the locally estimated Poisson distribution.
At the very least, a comparison similar to what is presented in Table 1 should be included to demonstrate any advantages in the discovered dependencies.
Moreover, since the goal is to estimate a "multinomial with dependencies among the states," the authors should discuss the possibility of using a "factorization" of the multinomial distribution into k binary random variables with corresponding dependencies, such as a tree-structured dependency or a dependency network.
In summary, this is an interesting idea that would benefit from a deeper exploration of its connections to related work for stronger justification. The advantages over existing methods are not clearly demonstrated.
