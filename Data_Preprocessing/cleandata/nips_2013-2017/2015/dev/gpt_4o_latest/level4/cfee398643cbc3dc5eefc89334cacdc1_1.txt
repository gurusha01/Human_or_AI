This paper appears to present novel and significant results on recovering the cluster structure in the stochastic block model, even when the number of clusters is unknown. However, as is often the case, a potentially excellent paper is hindered by poor writing quality (hence the score of 7 for Quality of Submission). For example, the notations required to comprehend the results summarized in Section 1.1 are only introduced later in Section 2.1, which seems counterintuitive. Furthermore, the submission includes 47 pages of supplementary material, suggesting that the NIPS submission is essentially a condensed version of a full journal paper. This raises concerns about whether NIPS is the appropriate venue for such a submission, particularly since it is, in my view, nearly impossible to reconstruct the proposed algorithms based on the vague descriptions provided in the main text. A thorough understanding of the algorithm requires consulting the supplementary material. Overall, this is likely a strong paper in terms of content, but it suffers from poor writing and is not well-suited to the NIPS format (47 pages of supplementary material is excessive).
