The paper introduces two algorithms for recovering community labels of nodes in graphs generated by stochastic block models (SBM). It addresses two distinct SBM regimes: one with a constant average degree and another with an average degree scaling as log(n). For both cases, the proposed algorithms rely on shortest path computations. The main contributions of the paper include:
probabilistic bounds for partial recovery of node labels in the sparse (constant degree) regime and complete recovery in the semi-sparse (log(n)-average degree) regime, both above the information-theoretic thresholds for partial and complete recovery. The error bounds derived for the proposed algorithms are shown to be optimal. The work builds on prior research (Abbe and Sanders, 2015), which introduced similar algorithms and analyses but required knowledge of model parameters. This paper removes that assumption.
The paper, along with its supplementary materials, is mathematically rigorous and technically sound. It provides strong results on almost exact and exact recovery of community labels without assuming prior knowledge of model parameters. However, it falls short in providing numerical comparisons with other community detection methods.
The primary weakness of the paper lies in its clarity. While it introduces two algorithms, their presentation in the main text is insufficiently detailed. Much of the content, including the main algorithm descriptions, is relegated to the supplementary material, making the paper difficult to follow without consulting the additional materials. The paper appears to have been condensed to meet conference page limits, resulting in a lack of clarity. The agnostic-sphere-comparison algorithm, which is central to the paper, should be presented more clearly in the main text, similar to its treatment in the supplementary material. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the definition of SBM between Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 (e.g., the use of Q versus Q/n), and the definition of Q as a probability (line 47, page 1) conflicts with its later normalization in the paper.
The paper presents an original, approximately linear-time algorithm and provides a mathematically rigorous proof of its effectiveness for community recovery in general SBM. This positions the proposed algorithms as state-of-the-art methods for community recovery. While shortest-path-based algorithms have been explored in prior work (e.g., Bhattacharyya and Bickel, 2014), the algorithm in this paper is more nuanced, and the results obtained are tighter.
The paper is significant due to its contributions to information-theoretic bounds and the introduction of novel algorithms. It has the potential to be generalized to more complex network models, particularly those with a growing number of communities. However, given the technical depth and the condensed nature of the presentation, the paper seems more suited for a journal publication than a short conference paper. Overall, it is a condensed version of a technical paper with interesting results on community recovery for graphs generated by stochastic block models. While technically strong, the paper lacks clarity in the presentation of its main methods.
