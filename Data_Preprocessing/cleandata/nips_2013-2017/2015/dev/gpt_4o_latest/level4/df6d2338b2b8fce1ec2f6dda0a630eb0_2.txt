This paper presents an iterative procedure to address the Adaptive Stochastic Optimization (ASO) problem. The problem is defined by an objective function \( f \), and the paper establishes conditions on the function that render the problem suitable for their proposed solution approach, termed recursive adaptive convergence.
Quality: The ASO problem is framed as a generalization of POMDPs, and the paper provides conditions for the solution method, supported by simulations. While the choice of baseline algorithms is appropriate, the paper would benefit from a more direct comparison with similar approaches, such as widely-used POMDP solutions. Given the technical depth of the paper, including more practical or concrete examples to illustrate the propositions would enhance its accessibility.
Clarity: The paper is well-structured, with excellent language and flow, particularly given the technical complexity of the material. However, connecting the theoretical flow to specific problems is challenging. Incorporating a running example throughout the paper could improve readability and comprehension.
Originality: The paper leverages theoretical advancements in submodular function optimization and applies these results to the ASO problem. The originality lies in the specific application of these theoretical developments.
Significance: The generality of the problem setting suggests that the results have the potential for significant impact. However, the current presentation does not fully substantiate this potential. Strengthening the numerical comparisons with alternative solution techniques or providing a more direct justification for the applicability of the MLRB and MLB conditions would better support the case for the paper's impact.
In summary, this paper offers a tractable solution algorithm and sufficient conditions for its applicability to a broad (and typically intractable) planning problem, namely ASO.
