This paper adapts variational autoencoders to the structured prediction domain, leveraging them to model the conditional probability of structured outputs given inputs. It introduces several innovations in the training process and presents results on pixel labeling tasks using the CUB and LFW datasets. To the best of my knowledge, the paper is novel, and employing such expressive models for structured prediction is an important and impactful direction. The objectives and ideas proposed in this work are therefore commendable and timely. 
However, the paper has two significant shortcomings:  
- The clarity of the writing is lacking, with several critical details omitted. For instance, the architecture of the networks is not fully described. While the authors mention that all networks are 2-layer MLPs, this cannot be the complete picture since an MLP alone cannot serve as a generative model. Perhaps the authors intend to convey that the MLP predicts the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, as in [24], or a mixture model, as in [16]? Additionally, the modeling of \( p(y|x,z) \) using two networks, \( \text{net}{z2y} \) and \( \text{net}{x2y} \), is unclear. Are the outputs of these networks averaged, multiplied, or combined in some other way? Such ambiguities will make it challenging for future researchers to reproduce the results.  
- The results are somewhat underwhelming. In Tables 3 and 4, the CNN baseline performs surprisingly well while being much simpler. Is the observed 1-point improvement sufficient to justify the added complexity? Furthermore, the significance of a 1-point gain on these datasets is unclear. Although Table 5 demonstrates favorable results, the experimental setup appears somewhat contrived.  
Overall, I appreciate the ideas presented in this paper and believe they warrant further investigation. However, the results are not particularly compelling, and the paper requires significant revisions to improve its clarity. This work leverages recent advancements in variational autoencoders for structured prediction, which is a laudable goal. Nonetheless, the results are modest, and the lack of detail hinders its reproducibility.
