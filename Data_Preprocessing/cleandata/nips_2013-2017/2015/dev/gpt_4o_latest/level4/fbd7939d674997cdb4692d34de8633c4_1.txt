The paper focuses on the design of near-optimal auction mechanisms, where optimality is evaluated in terms of revenue. Auction theory has established that these optimal auctions allocate the item to the bidder with the highest virtual valuation. However, implementing such auctions requires knowledge of the distribution \( Fi \) from which each valuation \( vi \) is drawn. Additionally, even with this knowledge, the payment rules for these auctions can be highly complex and impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, the authors propose a simple class of auctions, referred to as t-level auctions, which feature a straightforward payment rule. Furthermore, to handle the issue of unknown \( F_i \), the authors suggest employing empirical revenue maximization within this auction family.
The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration that, by setting \( t = O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right) \) and using a sample size of \( O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\right) \), the empirically revenue-maximizing t-level auction achieves a revenue that is \( (1 - \epsilon) \)-optimal.
The paper establishes an intriguing link between learning theory and auction theory. This connection has recently garnered attention from several researchers, and the authors provide a thorough review of prior work in this area. The paper is generally well-written, and while the concepts and proofs are relatively straightforward for both the machine learning and auction theory communities, the connection is compelling and warrants further exploration by the learning community.
Below are some suggestions for improving the paper:  
(1) The discussion on pseudo-dimension is overly detailed. Given that this is a learning-focused conference, a brief reference to the definition should suffice, as most readers are likely familiar with it.  
(2) The explanation of equivalence classes is somewhat unclear. Why must most levels induce the same permutation? It appears that the second condition alone might be sufficient.  
(3) In the proof of Lemma 3.5, I believe the correct expression is \( \phi \in [0, \alpha] \).  
(4) It would be helpful to include the reasoning behind Equation (3) in the appendix, as the fact that expected revenue equals the expected allocation of virtual valuations may not be widely known within the learning community.  
(5) In the first paragraph of the appendix, the sentence "bounded case, following ideas from This..." seems out of place and should be removed.
Overall, this paper offers a novel perspective on optimal mechanism design by leveraging machine learning techniques. The results are correct and highlight an exciting intersection between auction theory and machine learning.
