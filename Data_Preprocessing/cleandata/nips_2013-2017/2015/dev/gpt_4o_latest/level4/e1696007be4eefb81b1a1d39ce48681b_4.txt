The authors address the estimation of sparse linear models using atomic norms and establish bounds on Gaussian widths that arise in their analysis. As a specific instance, they derive bounds for the l1 norm and the ordered weighted l1 norm, while also providing an analysis of the recently introduced k-support norms.
The atomic norm is appealing due to its generality in encompassing a wide range of linear inverse problems [Chandrasekaran et al., 2012 FOCM]. However, this paper restricts its focus to sparse linear models, and most of the results, apart from those related to the k-support norm, are already known. While the techniques used to compute Gaussian widths are fairly standard, the dual norm calculation for the k-support norm represents a novel contribution.
Can this approach be extended to other applications of atomic norm analysis, such as nuclear norm penalized estimation for low-rank matrices?
The paper is well-written, with clear and accessible proofs.
While the paper is well-structured and the mathematical proofs are rigorous, its scope is limited. Instead of offering a unified analysis for general atomic norms [Chandrasekaran et al., 2012 FOCM] applicable to a variety of linear inverse problems, the authors confine their study to sparse linear regression, where the primary results are already established.
