In game theory, it is well-established that, under certain smoothness conditions, the so-called price of anarchy in full-information games can be bounded. The price of anarchy is defined as the ratio of the optimal social welfare to the worst social welfare achievable under a specific type of equilibrium. The literature on this topic is extensive, and bounds on the price of anarchy have been derived for a broad class of coarse correlated equilibria. However, in the context of games with incomplete information, such results are absent, with existing work only providing bounds on the price of anarchy for Bayes-Nash equilibria.
The primary contribution of this paper is to establish a bound on the price of anarchy for coarse correlated equilibria in games with incomplete information. The authors achieve this by reducing such games to a series of full-information games.
Unfortunately, the paper is challenging to read and appears to lack generality. Even the problem setup is not entirely clear. For instance, the authors state, "Fi be the empirical distributions of values in population Pi," but it is unclear which samples are being used to define the empirical distribution.
The main concern with the paper lies in Lemma 10. The hypotheses of the lemma are not clearly articulated. Specifically, the authors describe \( D^T \) as an empirical distribution of plays and assert that if a subsequence of \( D^T \) converges in distribution to \( D \), then certain results follow. However, \( D^T \) is a random measure, so it is unclear whether the convergence in distribution is almost sure (a.s.). Additionally, must the subsequence be the same for all realizations of \( D^T \)? Similar ambiguities arise in Equation (10), where the authors take a limit of the form:
\[
\mathbb{E}{s \sim D^T}[fT(s)]
\]
and claim that because \( f_T \to f \) a.s. and \( D^T \to D \) in distribution (which itself is unclear), the above term converges to:
\[
\mathbb{E}_{s \sim D}[f(s)].
\]
It is not evident that this holds in general, and if it does, the authors need to provide a more rigorous explanation.
The remainder of the paper appears to be correct, so if the authors can address my concerns regarding Lemma 10, I would consider recommending acceptance. However, I am not convinced that the topic of the paper would be of significant interest to the NIPS community.
In summary, this is an adequate paper that extends price of anarchy results from full-information games to Bayesian games. However, the paper is difficult to follow, and I suspect that one of the proofs may be incorrect.
