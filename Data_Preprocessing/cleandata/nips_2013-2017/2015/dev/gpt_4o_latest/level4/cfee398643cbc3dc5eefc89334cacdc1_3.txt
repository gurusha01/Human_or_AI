[light review] The authors may find the paper "Achieving optimal misclassification proportion in the stochastic blockmodel" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03772) and "Minimax rates of community detection in stochastic blockmodels" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05313) to be of interest. [light review] These works present efficient algorithms for achieving optimal classification rates in the stochastic blockmodel, a topic that remains an active area of research with numerous significant findings. That said, the submitted paper lacks clarity and readability. For instance, there is no clear explanation of the algorithms, although additional details might be available in the supplementary material. It gives the impression that minimal effort was made to adapt a longer paper into a shorter format.
