This study presents a novel criterion for sequential experimental design aimed at model selection. The author(s) implement this algorithm in an audiometric experiment designed to detect noise-induced hearing loss, yielding promising results.
Quality and clarity: The paper is exceptionally clear and well-written. It effectively details the steps required to approximate model evidence, hyperparameter posterior distributions, and predictive distributions. Minor issues include: on line 134, X* is referenced before being defined (and it appears to remain undefined), and on line 342, "exes" should be corrected to "crosses."
Originality: The author(s) employ a technique similar to that of [12], leveraging the symmetry of mutual information to transform an intractable quantity into a one-dimensional intractable quantity that can be approximated more easily. This approach is applied to the novel problem of active model selection.
Significance: Model selection is undoubtedly a critical problem, and the specific application in the paper—choosing among different GP priors—is a pertinent example. However, the example provided is relatively simple, focusing only on selecting among prior means rather than covariance kernels, which are typically more challenging to determine. Additionally, the first model (healthy) is nested within the NIHL model (as d → 0), raising the question of whether one could instead use the more complex model, infer the hyperparameters, and then evaluate the magnitude of d and/or w. While the method has clear potential for broader applications, this particular example does not fully demonstrate its strengths.
Minor points:  
- Section 3: It would be helpful to briefly mention the hyperparameter marginalization via MCMC technique around equation (7).  
Overall, this is an excellent paper on a Bayesian approach to active model selection. The methods are described with an appropriate level of detail and supported by useful references for further exploration. However, while the methodology is compelling, the application presented does not fully showcase the method's capabilities for the reasons outlined under the "significance" section.
