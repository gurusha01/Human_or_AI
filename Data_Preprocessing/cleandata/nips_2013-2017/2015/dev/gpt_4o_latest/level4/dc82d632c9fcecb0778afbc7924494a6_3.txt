This paper explores the combination of lifted and approximate inference. The two main contributions are: (1) providing estimates of computational effort and (2) employing a Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling approach. The text is well-written but presumes a strong familiarity with prior work, particularly with reference [9], which is frequently cited. I would appreciate more elaboration on the Rao-Blackwellisation aspect. Additionally, the experimental evaluation is insufficiently robust.
Specific Comments:
- Lines 46-47: While I understand the concept of "inference unaware," the notion that being "inference aware" implies having foresight into computational effort seems unusual to me, as such predictions are typically infeasible.
- Line 54: A traditional AND-OR tree is not inherently a "compact" representation. What exactly do you mean by "pseudotree"? Are you referring to a folded tree?
- Line 57: I understand the concept here, but why do you describe it as "schematic"?
- Lines 81-90: The paper discusses an AND/OR tree (a spanning tree for the graph representing the original graphical model), a "pseudotree," and another final graph. While I believe I understand the distinctions, it would be helpful to clearly define each of these terms.
- Line 119: What do you mean by "new MLNs"? How exactly are you defining an MLN?
- Lines 148-160: The rules presented here are complex and would benefit from at least a minimal description. Additionally, the term "decomposer" needs further explanation—simply citing reference [9] is insufficient.
- Line 176: The term "optimal" is used—what exactly do you mean by "optimal" in this context? Is there a formal definition or guarantee?
- Line 212: The sentence "The overall complexity of depends:" appears to be missing a word.
- Lines 346-348: The statement "which in turn decreases the accuracy because fewer samples are generated" could use clarification. Is this due to a fixed time budget?
- Section 6: Earlier in the paper, you state: "We demonstrate experimentally that it vastly improves the accuracy of estimation on several real-world datasets." However, based on the presented results, I am not convinced this conclusion is fully supported.
General Feedback:
This paper contributes to the field of lifted and approximate inference by focusing on computational effort estimation and Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling. While the focus appears to be on the first contribution, I find the second equally intriguing. Overall, the work seems solid and methodologically sound. However, the experimental results do not convincingly support the claims made, particularly regarding the improvements in accuracy.
