This paper tackles the challenge of learning reserve prices that approximately maximize revenue by utilizing sample draws from an unknown distribution of bidder valuations. The authors propose t-level auctions, where (broadly speaking) each bidder's bid space is discretized into levels. In this framework, the bidder whose bid falls on the highest level wins and pays the lowest value corresponding to the lowest level required to secure the win.
The authors provide bounds on the number of samples necessary to identify an approximately revenue-maximizing auction from a given set C (e.g., the set of 10-level auctions). They also establish bounds on the revenue gap between the optimal t-level auction and the theoretically optimal auction. While the results are initially derived for single-item auctions, they are extended to more general settings, such as matroid and single-parameter environments.
The paper is well-written and effectively situates the problem, approach, and results within the context of existing literature. The work is novel and bridges multiple disciplines, including auction theory and learning theory. The technical quality is very high, with some of the most compelling results presented in the appendix.
One potential practical concern is that, once a specific t-level auction is implemented, some information about bidder valuations may be lost. Although truth-telling is a dominant strategy, bidders may instead report the lowest value within the same level as their true valuation. This alternative strategy yields the same payment and allocation outcomes while revealing less information to the auctioneer. If the auctioneer aims to re-learn optimal reserve prices in the future or analyze bidder behavior under a modified mechanism, this loss of precision in observed valuations could pose challenges, particularly in non-stationary settings where the distribution F may change over time.
On a more fundamental note, while I recognize the theoretical significance of the work (and this does not affect my evaluation), I am somewhat skeptical about the practical utility of revenue-maximizing auctions in certain real-world domains. These auctions often fail to account for the fact that bidders make decisions over time, and maximizing revenue in a single auction may not align with maximizing long-term revenue. I would be interested in the authors' perspective on the practical relevance of optimal auctions in real-world applications or their thoughts on reconciling the tension between short-term and long-term revenue optimization. If space permits and the authors have a compelling argument, addressing this issue in the paper would enhance its practical impact.
A minor question: the paper mentions in a footnote that the results hold for other tie-breaking rules. Could the authors clarify which tie-breaking rules are included? For instance, do the results hold when ties are broken uniformly at random? My initial intuition is that they might not, but the authors likely have a definitive answer. 
In summary, this paper introduces t-level auctions, quantifies the data requirements for learning a near-optimal t-level auction, and bounds the gap between the optimal t-level auction and the theoretically optimal auction. The work is well-written, technically robust, and makes significant interdisciplinary contributions.
