This paper presents a generative model for structured output variables by extending the variational auto-encoder framework to a conditional setting. The authors introduce several model variations and evaluate their approach on pixel labeling tasks using both toy MNIST data and real-world datasets like CUB and LFW, achieving promising results.
While the paper is generally well-written and clear, aside from a few minor typos, the process for producing the final pixel labeling remains somewhat ambiguous. A brief explanation demonstrating how Section 3.1 is applied to pixel labeling could enhance clarity for readers. Additionally, a few closely related references are missing: [Deep Structured Output Learning for Unconstrained Text Recognition, ICLR 2015] and [Learning Deep Structured Models, ICLR 2015]. The paper provides an interesting exploration of the conditional variational autoencoder framework for pixel labeling, though it would have been valuable to see its application to other structured prediction tasks, as well as a more explicit discussion of the inference process.
