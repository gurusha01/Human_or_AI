This manuscript seeks to determine the number of observations necessary to distinguish an unknown distribution \( p \) from a class of distributions \( \mathcal{C} \) that are at least \( \epsilon \)-far in total variation distance. The classes of \( \mathcal{C} \) considered include monotone, log-concave, unimodal, and monotone hazard rate distributions.
Below, I outline several questions and comments that I hope will assist the author(s) in improving the manuscript:
---
A. Motivations  
The motivations for imposing shape-related constraints on discrete distributions could be elaborated further. Discrete distributions are primarily used for modeling (i) the frequencies of observed objects (e.g., IP addresses) and (ii) counting data. In case (i), applying a monotone constraint necessitates imposing an ordinal structure on the objects, while using the log-concave constraint requires a metric associated with this ordinal structure. These assumptions may limit the applicability of the proposed method, as not all objects naturally possess an inherent order.

B. Theory  
B1. Proof of Theorem 1  
To establish (1) and (2), independence between the observations \( X_i \) and the newly-drawn distribution \( q \) (which satisfies Properties 1 and 2) is required. However, this independence is not guaranteed unless the observations used to estimate \( q \) are excluded from subsequent analysis. This requirement should be explicitly stated in the manuscript.
B2. Use of Lemma 5  
In the monotone case, Lemma 5 guarantees the existence of a distribution \( q \) such that \( \mathbb{E}[\chi^2(p, q)] \leq \epsilon^2 / 500 \). However, Theorem 1 requires \( \chi^2(p, q) \leq \epsilon^2 / 500 \) to hold deterministically. This creates a gap that needs to be addressed.
B3. Continuous vs Discrete Case  
The manuscript cites Birgé (1987) multiple times in the theoretical development. To my knowledge, Birgé's work focuses on density estimation. Could the author(s) clarify which specific result from Birgé (1987) is being referenced here?
B4. Log-Concavity vs Unimodality  
In the proof of Lemma 7 and Section H.2 of the appendix, the manuscript asserts that "any log-concave distribution is unimodal." However, this claim is incorrect based on the definition provided in Section 2 (i.e., \( f{i-1}f{i+1} \leq fi^2 \)). For example, consider \( n = 7 \) with \( f1 = f4 = f7 = 1/3 \) and \( f2 = f3 = f5 = f6 = 0 \). This counterexample demonstrates that the statement is false.
B5. Rate for Testing Log-Concavity  
The abstract states that testing log-concavity requires \( O(\sqrt{n} / \epsilon^2) \) samples. However, Theorem 4 shows that this holds only when \( \epsilon > n^{-1/4} \). This discrepancy implies that the statement in the abstract is not precise when \( n \) is fixed and \( \epsilon \) decreases.
---
C. Connections to Statistics  
The manuscript assumes that the distribution of interest, \( p \), is discrete and that its support is \( [n] \) (i.e., \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \)), which grows with \( n \). While this setting is common in Computer Science, it may be less familiar to the Statistics community. The manuscript cites works such as Hall and Van Keilegom (2005) and Cule and Samworth (2010), which focus on the continuous case. For more relevant references on estimating/testing discrete monotone and log-concave distributions, the author(s) may consider citing Jankowski and Wellner (2009) and Balabdaoui et al. (2013).

The primary method in this manuscript builds on the work of Valiant and Valiant (2014), though the new settings introduce significant differences, necessitating the development of novel theory (including new lemmas in the appendix). While the theoretical contributions appear interesting, I remain unconvinced of the rigor of the proofs and encourage the author(s) to address the aforementioned concerns.
