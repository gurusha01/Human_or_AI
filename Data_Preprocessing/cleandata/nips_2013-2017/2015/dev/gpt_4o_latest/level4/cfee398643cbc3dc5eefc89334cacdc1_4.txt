Certainly! Here's the paraphrased version of your review:
---
Typically, SBMs require the number of communities to be predefined.
In contrast, the proposed algorithms for SBMs do not rely on this information and instead achieve optimal trade-offs from an information-theoretic perspective.
The authors establish conditions and accuracies for both partial and exact recoveries.
However, I must admit that I struggled to fully grasp the meaning of the theorems, which limits my ability to completely understand the paper's contributions.
As someone working on community clustering in a private company, my perspective leans towards practical applications for engineers.
Regarding Theorems 3 and 4: What specific improvements do these results offer over existing work? It would be highly beneficial to include intuitive explanations for readers who may not be deeply familiar with SBM theories, such as myself.
Line 228: Don't you need to know "the relative sizes of communities"?
I believe that determining "the relative sizes of communities" is just as challenging as specifying the number of clusters beforehand. For instance, in social networks with long-tailed community structures, identifying either the smallest or largest community sizes can be quite difficult.
Lines 419-420: Testing on only one real-world dataset is insufficient as a proof of concept. I am more interested in understanding how robust the proposed algorithm is when applied to diverse real-world networks that may not strictly adhere to the stated assumptions.
What about computational cost? Does the algorithm run within a realistic timeframe for large-scale networks? Please refer to my detailed comments for further suggestions.
