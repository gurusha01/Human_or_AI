This paper is of high quality, well-written, original, and holds significant potential for impact.
The primary contribution and innovation, as I interpret it, lies in the authors' integration of a symbolic physical model with an image-level recognition and tracking algorithm.
Given this, I believe the authors should allocate more space to elaborating on the image-level recognition/tracking model, including its strengths and limitations.
The scenarios tested involve relatively simple images; how robust would this model be when applied to novel scene configurations? To surfaces that are not smooth planes? To objects that are not simple blocks?
If this algorithm is indeed as generalizable as it initially appears, this should be explicitly emphasized. Conversely, if its applicability is limited to simplified scenes with predefined geometric configurations (a plausible way to handle image data but constrained by the simplicity of the object domain), this limitation needs to be clearly articulated.
In either case, the work represents meaningful progress, though the former scenario would be considerably more compelling.
Additional comments:  
- In the introduction (lines ~96-98), the authors state that a "computational solution asserts that the infant starts with a relatively reliable mental physics engine, or acquires it soon after birth." This phrasing suggests a nativist perspective, which I doubt the authors intend to strongly endorse. Even if infants develop a mature physics engine over the first year or two of life, the findings of this paper would remain valid (and "soon after birth" may not accurately reflect this timeline). Renee Baillargeon's research, for instance, demonstrates that physical reasoning evolves significantly during the first year of life. If the authors wish to argue for an early development of mental physics engines, they should acknowledge this body of work. However, I suggest that this statement detracts from the paper's main message and could be omitted.
- On line 198, the authors set sigma (velocity noise) to 0.05, but it is unclear how this value was determined or how sensitive the model is to variations in this parameter. Providing units for this value (e.g., m/s or normalized velocity) and briefly showing that the model's predictions remain consistent under other reasonable parameter values would be beneficial.
- In the Outcome Prediction experiment (6.1), the target object is described as either cardboard or foam, but Fig. 5 appears to show only the material of the initially moving object on the x-axis. Are the errors in Fig. 5 averaged across both target objects, or was each initial material paired with a single target object? Clarification would be helpful.
- Estimating error correlations between human participants, the uniform model, and POM for the data in Fig. 5 could provide additional insights, especially given the wide variation in errors across scenes.
- For the Mass Prediction and "Will It Move" experiments, the data analysis methods are not entirely clear. For both experiments, I assume human decisions are binary (e.g., "object 1 heavier" vs. "object 2 heavier" for Mass Prediction, and "moving" vs. "not moving" for Will It Move) and that these are aggregated across trials to compute proportions for each decision. Similarly, I assume the model samples from the posterior to compute proportions for each choice. Providing more clarity on this analysis would help readers better interpret the results.
- In the Mass Prediction experiment, the authors use Spearman's rho to calculate correlations between human and model data, citing non-linearity in the relationship. However, if the POM accurately captures human judgments, the relationship should ideally be linear and 1:1. Pearson's correlation might be more appropriate unless outliers significantly skew the results. Including scatterplots of these relationships by trial would also aid in understanding.
- In the first sentence of the paper (line 37), the correct term is Rube Goldberg machine.  
This paper introduces a physical reasoning system that combines a physics engine with an image-level tracking algorithm to infer latent physical properties of objects and evaluates the system's predictions against human judgments in multiple experiments. The work represents a valuable contribution with the potential to significantly advance physical reasoning models by directly addressing image-level data.
