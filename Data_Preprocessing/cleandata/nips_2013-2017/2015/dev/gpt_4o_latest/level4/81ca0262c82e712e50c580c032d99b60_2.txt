The authors introduce an innovative formulation of path integral control, leveraging an exponential representation of the value function. This approach enables them to analytically solve the path integrals of the cost and, notably, evaluate these integrals in a backward manner. Consequently, they can employ a forward-backward optimization strategy: a Gaussian Process (GP) is used to model the forward paths in time, followed by backward integration to compute path costs and derivatives, which are then utilized in a numerical method to update the controls.
Quality: The technical correctness of the paper is commendable, and I found the work intellectually stimulating and informative. 
I was, however, surprised by the reported performance gains over iterative Path Integral (PI) methods. Unless I have overlooked something, this discrepancy likely stems from the relatively low number of samples used (10³ for the cart-pole and 10⁴ for the double pendulum). While the proposed technique is undoubtedly more efficient, the authors should exercise caution when evaluating their baseline to ensure a fair comparison.
Clarity: My primary concern with the paper lies in its rapid progression through critical steps. For instance, the transition from Equation 7 to Equation 8 is non-trivial and central to the paper's contribution. Similarly, the derivation from the initial integral of \(\Psit\) (mid-page 5) to the final recursive form \(\Phi{t+dt}\Psi_{t+dt}\) is even more challenging to follow.
Originality: While the use of a GP for modeling is not novel, the forward-backward integration approach is original. Furthermore, the ability to use the GP to infer the integral for a modified value function is, at the very least, new to me.
Significance: The proposed method represents a meaningful and noteworthy advancement in path integral techniques.
I strongly recommend numbering all equations. While there is a perspective that equations should only be numbered if explicitly referenced in the text, this stylistic choice creates significant challenges for external discussions, reviews (such as this one), and citations in future work. The authors have presented a novel method that pushes the boundaries of the current state of the art. Overall, this is a solid paper, though certain sections are difficult to follow, likely due to space constraints. I do not hold the authors entirely accountable for this issue.
