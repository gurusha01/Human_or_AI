This paper introduces a method for active model selection based on a mutual information (MI) criterion. The primary technical innovation lies in an approximation of the MI criterion that avoids the need to re-fit the model for each candidate. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of detecting noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) with minimal sound queries.
In general, the paper offers a compelling and well-designed solution to the active model selection problem. It is clearly written and provides strong justification for its design choices. The application to NIHL detection is a novel and interesting use case for active model selection, and its inclusion represents a valuable contribution.
However, the paper lacks experimental comparisons with prior methods for active model selection, either on the NIHL task or on established benchmarks where other approaches have been tested. In the experiments, the baseline method [8] exhibits a pathology (overfitting to the more likely model), which other active model selection techniques might address. It would therefore be insightful to compare the proposed method against these alternatives.
A limitation of the NIHL task is that the positive examples are simulated from the model, which could potentially lead to an overestimation of the performance of model-based methods. While this may be an unavoidable constraint in the medical domain, it would be worth exploring whether alternative experimental setups could mitigate this issue.
Overall, I recommend acceptance of this paper. It is well written, the proposed methods appear novel and well justified, and the introduction of a real-world medical application is a noteworthy contribution. The primary shortcoming is the absence of comparisons to other active model selection methods. Additionally, as I am not an expert in active learning, I cannot confidently assess the paper's relationship to prior work in this area.
