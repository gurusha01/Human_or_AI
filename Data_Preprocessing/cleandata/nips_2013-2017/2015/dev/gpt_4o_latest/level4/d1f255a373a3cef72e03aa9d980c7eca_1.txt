This paper introduces an algorithm designed to optimize the F-Measure in an online setting. The approach leverages an online learner to estimate the posterior, which is subsequently utilized during each update. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm can converge to the optimal threshold derived from batch learning. Empirical evaluations provide consistent support for these findings. The experiments also explore the sensitivity of the algorithm to three distinct online learners. The paper is well-structured and clearly presented. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm shows potential for practical applications. Both theoretical and empirical evaluations highlight the effectiveness of the algorithm, yielding promising results.
