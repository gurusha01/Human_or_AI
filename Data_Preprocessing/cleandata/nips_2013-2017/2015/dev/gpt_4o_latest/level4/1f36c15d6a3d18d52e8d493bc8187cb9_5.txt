This paper introduces a novel method and establishes new bounds for testing whether a distribution belongs to specific classes (e.g., monotone, log-concave, unimodal) of distributions. The authors present both upper and lower bounds for the considered classes, demonstrating that their upper bounds are nearly tight. Additionally, they include simulations on synthetic data to evaluate the performance of their algorithm.
The paper is generally well-written, and the results appear to be correct. The authors provide sufficient comparisons with prior bounds and carefully discuss the regimes in which their results achieve improved rates.
However, my primary concern is that the work focuses exclusively on discrete distributions. It would be helpful if the authors could include a motivational discussion on the practical relevance of the testing problems they address. Furthermore, it would be valuable to explore whether their results could be extended to non-discrete distributions, potentially under certain assumptions about the density.
Minor comments: The authors could improve the paper's self-contained nature. For instance, on page 3, they refer readers to the appendix for basic definitions, but those definitions are missing from the appendix.
