The paper presents lifted and/or schematics, which serve as an abstract representation of the PTP search space. By analyzing these schematics, the authors are able to quantify the size of the search space. While this analysis holds independent theoretical interest (though the theory is not yet mature enough to yield profound insights), it also demonstrates practical utility, particularly in the context of Rao-Blackwellized importance sampling.
This line of work is, in my view, significant, as our understanding of lifted inference algorithms remains incomplete. Although the proposed schematics are not yet simple enough to offer substantial insights, they represent a step in the right direction. The presentation is adequate, though I was unable to verify several technical details due to time constraints.
Given the theoretical nature of this paper, I am curious about the framework's power in terms of liftability. Specifically, can these schematics encompass all known classes of domain-liftable models?
The paper misses an opportunity to connect its contributions to related techniques. For instance:
- How do dtrees, which are used in recursive conditioning and knowledge compilation, relate to lifted and/or schematics?
- How are first-order NNF circuits connected to lifted and/or schematics? They appear quite similar, particularly with counting nodes having a single child, inducing summation during evaluation, and so forth. There is existing work on the complexity of evaluating partition functions from first-order NNF circuits, which shows that this complexity is exponential in the number of nested counting operations (existential quantifiers). This result seems relevant to the analysis in Section 4.
- How does this framework compare to the first-order decomposition trees proposed by Taghipour et al.? The footnote on page 3 mentions that these are not as tight, but I would expect more details here, perhaps with an example illustrating where the complexity differs.
I appreciate the importance sampling algorithm, which effectively leverages the theory in a meaningful and convincing way. While I understand that the experiments are preliminary, I would like more details about the experimental setup. For instance, I find it hard to believe that 10% evidence on webkb leaves any symmetries to exploit. I suspect that the evidence predicates were chosen to maximize the remaining symmetries (e.g., evidence only on page class, not on links). Clarifying this would be helpful.
Typos: On line 105, the thetai should be ti. On line 171, "exchangeable variables" should likely refer to "exchangeable constants," as the random variables after shattering are not fully exchangeable in general. On line 212, "of depends" appears to be a typo.
Overall, this is commendable work tackling a challenging problem. While the theoretical analysis is difficult to follow, it makes sense at a high level for those familiar with the lifted inference literature. The sampling application is elegant and provides an immediate practical use for the theory.
