This paper investigates the use of atomic norms in structured sparse regression. For a given atomic set \( A \) (satisfying a sign-change invariance assumption), the authors provide bounds on the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, the tangent cone, and the \( L_2 \)-compatibility numberâ€”key quantities that are sufficient to characterize the convergence rate of the estimation problem under specific conditions.
The proposed technique is general and, when applied to the \( L_1 \) norm (both unweighted and weighted), it reproduces bounds that align with those obtained using existing methods. Additionally, the authors extend their technique to \( k \)-support norms and derive novel bounds, which lead to the intriguing practical implication that \( k \) should be under-specified.
The analysis of the unit norm ball leverages a lemma from [14], but this aspect does not appear to represent a significantly novel contribution. However, the analyses of the tangent cone and the \( L2 \)-compatibility number are more substantial. These analyses are built upon a simple yet powerful insight: the tangent cone of an atomic norm can be upper bounded by the tangent cone of a weighted \( L1 \) norm (Lemma 3).
I would suggest that the authors conduct numerical simulations with \( k \)-support norms to test whether the derived bounds align with empirical behavior. It would be particularly interesting to examine whether over-specifying \( k \) negatively impacts recovery performance.
Overall, I find the paper to be engaging, with proofs that are relatively straightforward to follow. The paper is well-structured, and the results are clearly articulated and explained.
[14] "An inequality with application to structured sparsity and multi-task dictionary learning." This paper introduces a novel method for bounding the Gaussian width of various sets, which is crucial for deriving consistency rates for predictors with structured sparsity penalties. The method appears innovative and provides a new convergence rate for regressions involving \( k \)-support norms.
