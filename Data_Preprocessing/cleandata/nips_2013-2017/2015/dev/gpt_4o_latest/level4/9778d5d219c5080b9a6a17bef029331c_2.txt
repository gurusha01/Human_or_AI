This study is well-executed, presenting impressive results, and is summarized in a paper that is overall well-written.
I encourage the authors to make their code publicly available online if the paper is accepted.
The authors propose an illuminant estimation method that leverages the relationship between a pixel's luminance and its true chromaticity, grounded in the principle that natural illuminant chromaticities are constrained to a limited range of values due to Planck's radiation law. They train a luminance-to-chromaticity classifier using a dataset of natural images and employ it during inference to derive a distribution of illuminants consistent with the observed pixels. A global scene illuminant estimate is then obtained by aggregating these distributions across all pixels.
