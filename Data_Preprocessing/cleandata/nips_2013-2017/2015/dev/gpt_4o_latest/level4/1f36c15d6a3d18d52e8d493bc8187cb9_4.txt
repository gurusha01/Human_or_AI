The paper addresses the problem of testing whether an unknown distribution belongs to specific sets of shape-constrained distributions, including monotone, log-concave, unimodal, and monotone hazard rate distributions over [n] (or [n]^d for monotonicity). The methodology for each problem adheres to a well-structured framework: first, an estimate q of the unknown distribution p is constructed under the assumption that p belongs to the target class, thereby reducing sample complexity. Subsequently, a modified chi-squared test is employed to determine whether p and q are sufficiently close. The estimators developed for the first step are innovative and tailored to each class of distributions under consideration.
This two-step approach circumvents the need for more straightforward but computationally and statistically expensive alternatives, such as testing equality between p and a net over the target class. The proposed method results in efficient algorithms with improved (and optimal) sample complexities.
Interestingly, the (optimal) rates for all four distribution classes are identical in the case of d=1 for monotone distributions, and the construction used to establish the matching lower bounds for each problem is also the same.
The inclusion of certain definitions would enhance clarity for readers less familiar with the topic, such as the partial order used in defining monotone distributions over the hypergrid. Additionally, line 161 mentions definitions of the distances in the appendix, but these appear to be missing. Overall, the paper makes substantial contributions to the field of testing shape-constrained discrete distributions.
