=== Summary ===
This paper presents a method to bound geometric quantities that appear in the statistical error bounds of structured estimation problems involving atomic norms.
Prior work demonstrated that the estimation error of Dantzig-like estimators with random Gaussian designs can be bounded using three critical quantities: the Gaussian width of the unit ball of the regularizer, the Gaussian width of the spherical cap of the tangent cone, and the restricted norm compatibility constant. The primary objective of this paper is to derive computationally tractable bounds for these three quantities in the context of sign-invariant atomic norms.
In Section 3, the authors introduce upper bounds for the three geometric quantities, which constitute the main contribution of the paper. The Gaussian width of the unit ball is bounded by decomposing the set of atoms into a union of simpler subsets, for which the Gaussian widths are straightforward to compute. This result was previously established in [14]. The Gaussian width of the spherical cap of the tangent cone is bounded using a single subgradient of the regularizer evaluated at the true parameter vector \( w^* \). Lastly, the restricted norm compatibility constant is bounded using two auxiliary "norm compatibility constants," which are easier to compute due to the simpler sets on which they are defined. The authors illustrate the applicability of these results through two examples: the \( \ell_1 \) norm and the OWL norm.
In Section 4, the authors derive lower bounds for the latter two quantities. Although the lower bounds do not exactly match the upper bounds, they demonstrate that the upper bounds are relatively tight and therefore practically useful.
In Section 5, the authors apply their derived bounds to the k-support norm, yielding improvements over previously known results.
=== Significance ===
This paper addresses a significant problem and introduces valuable tools for analyzing sparse estimation problems with atomic norms. The writing is clear, and the organization is logical. The inclusion of examples aids in understanding the results and their practical applications. Furthermore, the derived bounds enable new insights into the k-support norm, underscoring the relevance of the findings. Overall, this is a well-written and impactful paper that provides computationally efficient bounds for studying the statistical error of Dantzig-like estimators with atomic norms.
