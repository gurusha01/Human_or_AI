Summary: The authors propose an innovative method for inferring hidden physical properties of objects (such as mass and friction), which also enables the system to make subsequent predictions that rely on these properties. Their approach employs a black-box generative model (a physics simulator) for sampling-based inference, combined with a tracking algorithm to convert the data into more suitable latent variables (reducing dimensionality) and a deep model to enhance the sampler. The method assumes priors over the hidden physical properties and uses a tracking algorithm to estimate the geometry and velocities of objects, resulting in a complete scene specification that can be fed into a physics engine to generate simulated velocities. These simulated velocities facilitate inference of the hidden properties within an MCMC sampler: proposed property values are used to generate simulated velocities, which are then compared to the estimated velocities, following a process akin to ABC. Additionally, a deep network can be trained as a recognition model using both the generative model's inferences and the Physics 101 dataset. This network's predictions of mass and friction can serve as initializations for the MCMC sampler. The authors benchmark their method against a convnet and various human judgments.
Quality: Strong. The proposed approach is well-designed, effectively implemented, and demonstrates solid performance on a challenging and meaningful task.
Clarity: The paper is very well-written, with minimal (if any) typographical errors, and is easy to follow.
Originality: To my knowledge, there are no existing methods directly addressing this problem. The authors also implement a convnet ("oracle" model) for comparison, further highlighting the novelty of their approach.
Significance: This work is impactful and should attract interest from both the machine learning and computer vision communities.
Suggestions: - The analysis of outcome predictions (pages 6-7) would benefit from an additional comparison metric, such as correlations between human, POM, and uniform predictions, as the "Mean" bars in Figure 5 may give a misleading impression that human and POM performances are very similar, despite their error patterns being quite distinct. - In Section 4, the authors mention that after inferring physical properties, the system can be applied to novel scenarios like predicting buoyancy, which is stated to be demonstrated in Section 6. However, buoyancy is not discussed further, so this claim should be removed. Overall, this paper should be accepted, as it presents a novel integration of deep learning and rich generative models to address a complex, real-world physical reasoning challenge. The writing is clear, the technical contributions are robust, and the performance is rigorously evaluated through multiple experiments.
