This paper presents results on tests for hypotheses such as:
H0: P is monotone  
versus  
H1: P is not monotone.
Overall, I find the paper interesting and the results compelling. However, I have several concerns:
1. The sample space considered in the paper is a discrete cube.  
   Why would one want to test for monotonicity over such a space?  
   In practical applications, monotonicity tests are typically used for continuous random variables.  
   Can you provide an example of a real-world data analysis problem where testing monotonicity in your specific setting is of scientific relevance?
2. The paper critiques the statistics literature for focusing on the large-sample regime.  
   This characterization feels somewhat misleading. Many statistical tests can be made exact by simulating the null distribution, and asymptotics are often employed to derive precise theoretical results about test power—by "precise," I mean limits rather than bounds.  
   Furthermore, there are statistical papers that provide finite-sample guarantees. For instance:  
   Dümbgen, Lutz, and Günther Walther.  
   "Multiscale inference about a density." The Annals of Statistics (2008): 1758–1785.  
   Overall, the paper's references to the extensive statistical literature on this topic are too sparse. A more thorough engagement with prior work in statistics is necessary.
3. I am not entirely convinced that your test qualifies as a finite-sample test.  
   Suppose I wish to use your test and ensure that the type I error is below a specified level, say α. While you take α = 1/3, I assume the test can be adjusted for any user-specified α. Your results indicate that there exists some N₀ such that, for sample sizes N > N₀, the type I error is less than α. This is not fundamentally different from asymptotic statistical tests, which state that for large N, the type I error approaches α.  
   In practice, when applying your test to real data, there is no way to verify whether N exceeds N₀. One must simply assume that the sample size is sufficiently large. Consequently, at a practical level, your test does not seem to differ meaningfully from an asymptotic test.
In summary, while the paper is interesting, I am not convinced that the problem addressed arises frequently in practice. Additionally, the paper's treatment of connections to the statistical literature is too dismissive.
