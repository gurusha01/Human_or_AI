The paper addresses the challenge of designing revenue-maximizing auctions based on samples drawn from the users' "valuation distribution" F.
The authors establish an upper bound on the number of samples required to construct an auction that performs nearly as well as an optimal auction.
A central idea in the paper is the introduction of a class of auctions, Ct, referred to as t-level auctions. As t increases, one of the auctions in Ct approaches the performance of the optimal auction. This is noteworthy because t-level auctions are parameterized by only n*t free variables, which allows the authors to leverage fundamental learning-theoretic principles to derive an upper bound on the sample complexity for learning a high-performing auction. While the existence of such auctions is intriguing from a game-theoretic perspective, I am somewhat doubtful about the level of interest this work might generate at NIPS. There are many compelling problems at the intersection of learning and game theory, such as the one tackled here, but the authors could strengthen their case by, for example, presenting faster algorithms, identifying specific classes of distributions F where learning the auction is significantly more efficient, or demonstrating scenarios where fewer samples suffice. Additionally, it would be valuable to explore lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning near-optimal auctions. For instance, since sample complexity in many learning problems is closely tied to the logarithm of the covering number, it would be intriguing to investigate whether similar results apply in this context.
The paper is clearly written, though additional motivation would benefit readers less familiar with auction theory. The primary contribution lies in demonstrating the existence of a hierarchy of auction classes, C1 < C2 < ..., such that as t increases, Ct contains an auction that is nearly optimal. While I appreciate this result, the learning arguments are relatively straightforward and primarily existential, as they involve computationally hard constructions. In this sense, the results feel somewhat incremental. However, one potential advantage of this paper at NIPS is its ability to introduce these compelling problems in algorithmic game theory to the learning community within a learning-theoretic framework.
