The problem of learning binary classifiers that optimize non-decomposable performance metrics has garnered significant attention recently. This paper focuses on the widely-used F-measure and introduces an algorithm designed to optimize the F-measure in an online learning framework. The authors provide a formal consistency analysis for the proposed online algorithm and present experimental results on large, real-world datasets.
The core idea of the paper, along with the proposed online algorithm, is both elegant and straightforward. The algorithm is relatively easy to understand and implement, though estimating a model for class-conditional probabilities in each round poses some challenges. The consistency analysis is novel to a reasonable extent. However, the presentation of the guarantee in Theorem 3 (and 5) could be more precise. Specifically, it might be clearer to explicitly include the regret term, defined as F((y1, ..., yt), (\hat{y}1, ..., \hat{y}t)) - F(\tau^*), in the theorem statement, as the authors later discuss in Section 6.
A recent work, [9], introduced a framework for optimizing and analyzing non-decomposable measures in the online setting. From the discussion in Section 6, it is not entirely clear how the analysis of the proposed OFO algorithm is stronger than that of [9]. The framework in [9], which is based on a per-round non-decomposable loss, is quite intuitive and also provides convergence rates for regret. Furthermore, it is surprising that the method in [9] is not included in the experimental comparisons. If a direct comparison is not feasible, the authors should at least provide a justification for its omission.
Another concern lies in the organization of the paper. The main contribution, namely Algorithm 1 and its analysis, is introduced relatively late in the manuscript. Sections 2 and 3 are largely redundant. Specifically, Section 3 seems unnecessary in the context of the paper's primary contribution and could be condensed into a combined Background section that integrates the key ideas from Sections 2 and 3. This restructuring would allow readers to focus on Sections 4 and 5, which form the crux of the paper, without unnecessary distractions or potential confusion. Additionally, some useful results on synthetic data, currently relegated to the Appendix, should be included in the main paper.
The authors have provided satisfactory responses to the concerns raised. I am therefore raising my score to Accept.
In summary, the paper addresses the problem of optimizing the F-measure in an online setting. It proposes an algorithm that is conceptually simple and relatively easy to implement, with a formal consistency analysis and experimental validation. While the paper makes meaningful contributions, there are some issues with the evaluation and the organization of the content that could be improved.
