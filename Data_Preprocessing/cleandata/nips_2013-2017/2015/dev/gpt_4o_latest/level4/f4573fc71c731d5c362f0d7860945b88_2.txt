Paper 1260 addresses the challenge of matrix completion incorporating side information represented as a graph. The authors assert that this framework is broadly applicable, as the side information can originate from a variety of sources. The key contributions of this work include a scalable learning algorithm for matrix completion with graph structures, establishing connections to prior works in the matrix factorization literature, and providing both theoretical and experimental validation of the proposed method.
As noted by the authors, this problem has significant practical relevance, such as in recommendation systems that leverage social network information. Given the scale of such datasets, the development of a scalable algorithm, as proposed in this paper, is particularly important.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written. It is commendable that the authors provide both theoretical consistency analysis and experimental results using real-world data. Furthermore, situating the proposed method within the broader context of convex optimization and noisy matrix approximation enhances its relevance and impact.
Regarding the experiments (Section 6): some of the baselines presented in Table 1 are overly simplistic; comparisons with Global/User/Movie mean are unlikely to be of broad interest. I recommend including comparisons with more recent, state-of-the-art methods, such as:
- Salakhutdinov and Mnih, Probabilistic Matrix Factorization [NIPS 2008]  
- Mackey et al., Divide-and-Conquer Matrix Factorization [NIPS 2011]  
- Lee et al., Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation [ICML 2013].
The reported runtime of O(10^3) seconds for the dataset in Table 2 is impressive. However, to substantiate claims of scalability, I suggest testing the algorithm on larger datasets, such as Netflix or Yahoo Music. This would also enable comparisons of RMSE scores with other established methods.
Minor comments:  
1) The x-axis formats in Figure 1 and Figure 2 are inconsistent. I recommend adopting the format of Figure 2 (10^1, 10^2, ...) rather than plotting log(time) directly, as log-scale without specifying the base can be ambiguous.  
2) The citations do not adhere to NIPS formatting guidelines.  
Overall, this paper introduces GRALS, an efficient approach for solving the graph-regularized matrix completion problem. Despite minor experimental issues, the paper is generally well-written, clear, and makes a valuable contribution.
