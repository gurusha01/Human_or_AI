This paper aims to demonstrate that the price of anarchy bounds derived using the smoothness property of games can be extended to analyze the quality of learning outcomes in Bayesian games. To achieve this, the authors model a Bayesian game as a stochastic game with complete information, involving a large population of potential participants. Based on this framework, two key results are established: First, when all players employ a form of no-regret learning in the stochastic game, the outcomes converge to a variant of Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium. Second, the stochastic game remains smooth if the underlying game or mechanism is smooth. Together, these results indicate that the price of anarchy bounds obtained through the smoothness framework apply to the outcomes of no-regret learning in Bayesian games. 
However, the paper is challenging to read and evaluate. It appears more suited for the "Game Theory" community than for the "NIPS" audience, as evidenced by its references. Additionally, the paper does not seem tailored specifically for the NIPS conference, resembling a "cut and paste" from an extended version. This is particularly evident in the final section, where the authors state: "In this section, we analyze the convergence..." without providing sufficient details about the convergence.
Some questions, remarks, and suggestions for improvement:  
(a) Why does the supplementary material only provide proofs for Theorems 10 and 13? What about the other theorems and lemmas?  
(b) Why is the correlated equilibrium in question the one defined by Forges?  
(c) The statement of Theorem 11 is unclearâ€”does it imply convergence to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium (BCCE)? Please elaborate further.  
(d) Managing selfish players is generally challenging unless a central entity is introduced, as is the case with correlated equilibria. While this type of equilibrium simplifies the problem, does it realistically reflect practical scenarios?
In summary, the main contribution of this paper is to show that the price of anarchy bounds derived from the smoothness property extend to learning outcomes in Bayesian games. However, the paper seems more appropriate for the "Game Theory" community than for the "NIPS" audience.
