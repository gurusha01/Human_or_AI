The paper addresses an important extension of the price of anarchy (PoA) framework from full-information games to Bayesian games, focusing on coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). The authors propose a reduction of Bayesian games to full-information games, enabling the application of smoothness arguments to bound the PoA in the Bayesian setting. Additionally, they demonstrate that no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian CCE, ensuring near-optimal welfare in repeated Bayesian games. The paper's contributions are theoretically significant, particularly in the context of auctions and resource allocation mechanisms, where Bayesian games are prevalent.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: Extending PoA analysis to Bayesian games is a meaningful theoretical advancement. The reinterpretation of Bayesian games as stochastic games of complete information is a creative and elegant approach.
2. Technical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous framework for analyzing the efficiency of Bayesian CCE and demonstrates that smoothness properties carry over from static to Bayesian settings. The main theorem (Theorem 9) and its implications for no-regret learning dynamics are particularly noteworthy.
3. Relevance to Mechanism Design: The results have potential applications in online ad auctions and other domains where Bayesian games naturally arise, making the work relevant to both game theory and machine learning communities.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Readability: The paper is difficult to read, even for an expert audience. The setup and notation are overly dense, and key concepts are not explained with sufficient clarity. For instance, the population interpretation of Bayesian games and its connection to stochastic games could benefit from a more intuitive exposition.
2. Lemma 10: This lemma is critical to the paper's results, yet its proof is unclear. The hypotheses, convergence definitions, and claims about product distributions require more rigorous justification. This lack of clarity raises concerns about the validity of the main results.
3. Equation (10): The explanation of convergence is insufficient, leaving doubts about its general applicability. The reliance on empirical process theory is not adequately supported, and the argument appears incomplete.
4. Significance to NIPS Community: While the paper is technically sound in parts, its focus on theoretical game theory may not resonate strongly with the broader NIPS audience, which often prioritizes empirical and computational contributions.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution by extending PoA results to Bayesian games, a challenging and underexplored area.
- Con: The paper's lack of clarity, particularly in critical proofs, undermines its accessibility and reliability. Additionally, its relevance to the NIPS community is limited.
Recommendation:
The paper is an "OK" contribution but requires significant revisions to improve clarity and address concerns about Lemma 10. If these issues are resolved, the work could be a valuable addition to the literature on game theory and learning. However, its limited appeal to the NIPS audience may warrant submission to a more specialized venue.
