The paper introduces a novel lifted version of the And/Or search space framework, termed the "lifted And/Or schematic," to address the problem of estimating the partition function in statistical relational models (SRMs). This approach builds on the And/Or search space framework used in propositional inference and extends it to the lifted domain, enabling inference-aware representations. The authors propose algorithms to compute tight upper bounds on the cost of inference and integrate this framework into a Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling (LIS) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of partition function estimates on several real-world datasets.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper presents a novel extension of the And/Or search space framework to the lifted domain, which is a significant contribution to the field of lifted inference. The proposed framework is well-motivated and addresses a key limitation of existing lifted algorithms, namely their inference-blind representations.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and clearly structured, with detailed explanations of the lifted And/Or schematic, its complexity analysis, and its integration into a Rao-Blackwellised LIS algorithm. The inclusion of algorithms and theoretical analysis enhances the paper's clarity.
3. Potential Impact: The proposed framework has the potential to significantly reduce inference complexity in SRMs, making it a valuable contribution to the NIPS community, particularly for researchers working on lifted inference and probabilistic graphical models.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Evaluation: The experimental evaluation is limited in scope. While the authors demonstrate the utility of their framework on three benchmark datasets, the results lack comparisons with other state-of-the-art partition function approximation methods. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative performance and practical advantages of the proposed approach.
2. Scalability and Approximation Bounds: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the bounds of the approximation or the scalability of the proposed framework. These are critical aspects for understanding the practical applicability of the method to large-scale SRMs.
3. Insufficient Evidence: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the experimental results are not comprehensive enough to fully substantiate the claims of improved accuracy and efficiency. Additional experiments and ablation studies would strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound framework that addresses a significant limitation in lifted inference.
- The ideas are clearly presented and have the potential to advance the state of the art in lifted inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The evaluation is insufficient, with no comparisons to other methods, limiting the ability to assess the practical impact of the work.
- The lack of scalability analysis and approximation bounds leaves questions about the framework's applicability to real-world, large-scale problems.
Recommendation
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the limited evaluation and lack of comparative analysis detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance conditional on the authors addressing these concerns in a revised version. Specifically, including comparisons with other methods and providing a more detailed analysis of scalability and approximation bounds would significantly enhance the paper's contribution.
