The paper presents a novel approach to matrix completion by incorporating graph-based structural information for row and column variables. It introduces a scalable alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm that leverages efficient Hessian-vector multiplication schemes, achieving significant computational speedups over stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The authors frame their regularizer as a generalized weighted nuclear norm and provide theoretical guarantees for statistical consistency, which is a notable contribution to the collaborative filtering domain. The method is validated on real-world datasets, including a movie ratings dataset, where it achieves the lowest RMSE compared to leading approaches. Additionally, the scalability of the ALS algorithm is demonstrated on large datasets, showcasing its practical applicability.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The optimization problem is novel and addresses a critical challenge in collaborative filtering by incorporating graph information, which is underexplored in prior work. The connection to weighted nuclear norm minimization is insightful and broadens the theoretical understanding of matrix completion.
2. Scalability: The proposed ALS algorithm is highly scalable, outperforming SGD by orders of magnitude in runtime, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
3. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides statistical consistency guarantees for its low-rank estimators, which adds rigor and reliability to the proposed method.
4. Empirical Validation: The method achieves state-of-the-art RMSE on the MOVIELENS dataset and demonstrates its practicality through experiments on large datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper suffers from unclear explanations in key sections. The description of row/column graph generation is vague, leaving readers uncertain about how the graphs are constructed from the dataset. Additionally, Sections 5 and 5.1 are dense and difficult to follow, with undefined terms like "spikiness" that are critical for understanding the results.
2. Missing Results: The RMSE results for three large datasets are not provided, which limits the ability to fully assess the method's performance. Figure 2 lacks clarity in presenting GRALS' RMSE performance relative to other methods.
3. Writing Quality: The writing in several sections is convoluted, and the proofs were not verified by the reviewer due to their complexity and lack of clarity. This detracts from the paper's overall readability and accessibility.
4. Incomplete Evaluation: While the method is validated on the MOVIELENS dataset, the absence of results for other datasets and a broader comparison to additional baselines weakens the empirical evaluation.
Recommendation:
The paper addresses an important problem in collaborative filtering and makes significant contributions in terms of scalability, theoretical guarantees, and empirical performance. However, the lack of clarity in key sections, missing experimental results, and writing issues detract from its overall quality. I recommend acceptance with major revisions to address the clarity of explanations, provide missing results, and improve the presentation of key concepts and proofs.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and relevant problem formulation.
- Significant scalability improvements over existing methods.
- Strong theoretical contributions with statistical guarantees.
- Promising empirical results on the MOVIELENS dataset.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in critical sections and undefined terms.
- Missing RMSE results for large datasets.
- Writing quality hinders comprehension.
- Limited empirical evaluation beyond MOVIELENS.
With revisions to address these weaknesses, the paper has the potential to make a strong contribution to the field.
