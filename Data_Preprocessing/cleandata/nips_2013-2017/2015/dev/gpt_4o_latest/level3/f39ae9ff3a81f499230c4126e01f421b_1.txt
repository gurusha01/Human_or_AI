The paper introduces the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF) distribution, a novel generalization of the Multinomial distribution that incorporates dependencies between dimensions while maintaining a fixed vector length. This work addresses a key limitation of the Multinomial distribution, which assumes independence between dimensions, making it less suitable for real-world data such as text documents. By leveraging the parametric form of the Poisson MRF and restricting its domain to fixed-length vectors, the authors propose a tractable alternative that allows for positive dependencies and efficient likelihood estimation.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and tackles an important problem in probabilistic topic modeling. The LPMRF distribution is a refreshing and innovative approach, addressing key limitations of the Multinomial and Poisson MRF models. The authors demonstrate technical rigor by developing annealed importance sampling (AIS) methods for estimating the log partition function, which was previously intractable for Poisson MRFs. The extension of LPMRF to mixtures and topic models is well-motivated, and the experimental results show promising improvements in perplexity over Multinomial-based models. Additionally, the qualitative analysis highlights the ability of LPMRF to discover meaningful word dependencies, which is a significant advantage over traditional topic models like LDA.
The scalability of the proposed algorithms is another strength, with practical implementation details provided and timing experiments demonstrating linear scaling in key parameters. The availability of code online further enhances the reproducibility and impact of this work.
Weaknesses:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, several areas require improvement to strengthen its empirical validation. First, the lack of comparison with the Truncated Poisson MRF (TPMRF) model is a notable omission, as TPMRF is a closely related baseline. Similarly, the paper does not compare its approach to the Poisson MRF (PMRF) topic model, which would help clarify the advantages of LPMRF. A comparison table summarizing the benefits of LPMRF in terms of discovered dependencies, perplexity, and computational efficiency would be highly beneficial.
The discussion of alternative approaches, such as factorizing multinomials into binary random variables with dependencies, is limited. Expanding this discussion would provide better context for the novelty of LPMRF. Additionally, the connection to related work, particularly recent advances in probabilistic topic modeling, could be explored more thoroughly. Finally, while the perplexity results are promising, the paper does not clearly demonstrate significant benefits over existing methods for larger topic models, where LDA performs better.
Recommendation:
The paper introduces a novel and technically sound contribution to probabilistic modeling, with clear potential for impact. However, the empirical validation and comparison to related work need to be strengthened. I recommend acceptance conditional on the authors addressing the following: (1) include comparisons with TPMRF and PMRF topic models, (2) add a comparison table summarizing benefits, (3) expand the discussion of alternative approaches and related work, and (4) clarify the advantages of LPMRF for larger topic models.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and well-motivated distribution addressing a key limitation of the Multinomial.
- Rigorous technical contributions, including AIS for likelihood estimation.
- Promising experimental results and scalability.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Missing comparisons with key baselines (TPMRF, PMRF).
- Limited discussion of alternative approaches and related work.
- Benefits over existing methods not clearly demonstrated for larger topic models.
