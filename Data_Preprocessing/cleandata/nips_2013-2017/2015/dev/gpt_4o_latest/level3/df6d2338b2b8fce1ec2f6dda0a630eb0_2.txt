This paper addresses the computationally intractable Adaptive Stochastic Optimization (ASO) problem by proposing an innovative algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), that leverages two newly introduced conditions: the Marginal Likelihood Rate Bound (MLRB) and the Marginal Likelihood Bound (MLB). These conditions, combined with pointwise submodularity, enable efficient approximate solutions to ASO problems over both sets and paths. The authors demonstrate the applicability of RAC through simulations on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty, showcasing its performance against heuristic algorithms.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper makes a novel contribution by extending submodular optimization techniques to ASO problems over paths, a domain previously restricted to set-based optimization. The introduction of MLRB and MLB conditions is a creative application of submodular function optimization, broadening the scope of problems that can be efficiently approximated.
2. Technical Contribution: RAC provides a tractable solution to a generally intractable problem, with theoretical guarantees on approximation bounds. The algorithm's ability to handle both set and path domains is a significant advancement.
3. Significance: The results have the potential to impact fields like robotics and planning under uncertainty. The application to noisy Informative Path Planning (IPP) tasks demonstrates the algorithm's practical relevance.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with detailed theoretical analysis and algorithmic descriptions. The inclusion of experimental results strengthens the paper's claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparative Analysis: While the paper positions ASO as a generalization of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), it lacks strong numerical comparisons with state-of-the-art POMDP solvers. This omission weakens the argument for RAC's broader applicability.
2. Practical Examples: The experimental evaluation is limited to two robot planning tasks. Including more diverse, real-world examples would enhance the paper's impact and demonstrate the algorithm's versatility.
3. Running Example: The paper would benefit from a running example to help readers connect the theoretical framework to practical scenarios. This would improve accessibility for a broader audience.
4. Significance of Results: While the theoretical guarantees are compelling, the experimental results could be more robust. Stronger numerical evidence and comparisons with baseline methods are needed to solidify the claims of superiority.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant theoretical and algorithmic contribution to ASO, with promising applications in planning under uncertainty. However, its practical impact would be strengthened by more diverse examples and stronger empirical comparisons. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on enhancing the experimental evaluation and providing a running example to improve clarity. 
Pros:
- Novel algorithm and theoretical framework.
- Extends submodular optimization to new domains.
- Promising applications in robotics and planning.
Cons:
- Limited experimental diversity.
- Insufficient comparisons with POMDP solvers.
- Lack of a running example for clarity.
