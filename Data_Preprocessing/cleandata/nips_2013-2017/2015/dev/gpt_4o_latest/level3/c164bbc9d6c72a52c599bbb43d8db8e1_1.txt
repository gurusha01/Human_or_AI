The paper introduces a generic acceleration scheme for first-order optimization methods, termed "Catalyst," which builds upon an analysis of the accelerated proximal point algorithm. The authors claim that this approach accelerates a wide range of optimization methods, including gradient descent, SAG, SAGA, SDCA, and their proximal variants, and extends support to non-strongly convex objectives. The theoretical contributions include convergence guarantees for both strongly convex and non-strongly convex cases, as well as a discussion of practical implementation details. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the method's performance, particularly for ill-conditioned problems.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The Catalyst framework is a novel contribution that generalizes Nesterov's acceleration to a broad class of optimization methods. Its ability to handle non-strongly convex objectives without requiring additional regularization is a significant advancement.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides convergence theorems for both strongly convex and non-strongly convex cases, demonstrating near-optimal rates of convergence. The analysis is grounded in the concept of estimate sequences, extending prior work on inexact proximal point methods.
3. Practical Implications: The proposed method is versatile, applying to various optimization algorithms. The numerical experiments demonstrate its utility, particularly for ill-conditioned problems, and highlight its stabilizing effect on methods like MISO.
4. Relevance: The work addresses a critical problem in optimization and is aligned with the interests of the NeurIPS community, particularly in large-scale machine learning.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Maturity in Main Idea: While the Catalyst framework is promising, its theoretical underpinnings lack rigor in certain areas. For instance, the dependence on the unknown optimal value \( F^* \) in the convergence guarantees is problematic, as it limits practical applicability.
2. Algorithmic Limitations: Algorithm 1 is essentially an inexact variant of GÃ¼ler's fast proximal method, but with restrictive parameter choices (\( \kappa \)) and suboptimal handling of error accumulation. The fixed \( \kappa \) approach is suboptimal, and adaptive updates are necessary for robustness.
3. Convergence Analysis: The convergence analysis is not rigorous enough, particularly for extensions to composite forms where the regularizer lacks a low-cost proximal operator. Leveraging sliding gradient or conditional gradient methods could strengthen the analysis.
4. Complexity Misrepresentation: The use of \( \tilde{O} \)-notation in the convergence guarantees obscures the iteration count of the inner loop, potentially leading to worse complexity than existing methods.
5. Numerical Experiments: While experiments are provided, they are insufficient to robustly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. The results lack diversity in datasets and fail to explore edge cases where the method might struggle.
Recommendation:
While the paper introduces a novel and potentially impactful framework, its theoretical and experimental contributions are not yet mature enough for acceptance. The authors should address the following:
- Provide a more rigorous convergence analysis, particularly for composite objectives.
- Explore adaptive parameter updates for \( \kappa \) to handle error accumulation.
- Clarify the complexity analysis to accurately reflect the inner loop's iteration count.
- Expand the numerical experiments to include more diverse datasets and challenging scenarios.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel framework with broad applicability.
- Promising theoretical results and practical implications.
- Significant relevance to the optimization and machine learning communities.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Theoretical analysis lacks rigor and practical applicability.
- Algorithmic limitations in parameter choice and error handling.
- Insufficient experimental validation.
Overall, the paper is a promising contribution but requires further refinement to meet the standards of NeurIPS.
