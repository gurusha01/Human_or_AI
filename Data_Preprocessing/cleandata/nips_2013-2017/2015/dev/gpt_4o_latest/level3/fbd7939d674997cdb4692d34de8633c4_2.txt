This paper presents a novel approach to learning approximately revenue-maximizing auctions by introducing the concept of t-level auctions. The authors propose a framework that interpolates between simple and optimal auctions, balancing expressivity and simplicity. The main contributions include bounding the sample complexity for learning t-level auctions, quantifying the revenue gap between t-level and theoretically optimal auctions, and extending the results to single-item, matroid, and single-parameter settings. The paper is well-written, technically rigorous, and bridges auction theory with learning theory in a meaningful way.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Depth: The introduction of t-level auctions as a tunable mechanism to balance simplicity and optimality is innovative. The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees, including bounds on pseudo-dimension and representation error, which are crucial for understanding the trade-offs in auction design.
2. Generalization: The results extend beyond single-item auctions to matroid and single-parameter settings, demonstrating the broad applicability of the proposed framework.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of concepts like pseudo-dimension and its application to auction classes. The examples provided, such as the payment rules in t-level auctions, aid in understanding the mechanisms.
4. Significance: The work advances the state of the art by offering a principled way to design auctions that are both learnable and near-optimal. It also provides insights into the trade-off between representation error and learning error, which is a key challenge in auction design.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Concerns: While the theoretical contributions are compelling, the practical implications of t-level auctions are less clear. The discretization of bidder valuations may lead to a loss of information, potentially impacting future re-learning of optimal reserves. Additionally, bidders may adopt strategies like bidding the lowest value on an interval to minimize information revelation, which could undermine the auction's effectiveness.
2. Skepticism About Revenue Maximization: The focus on short-term revenue maximization may not align with long-term revenue goals in real-world applications. A discussion on the tension between short-term and long-term objectives would strengthen the paper.
3. Computational Efficiency: The proposed learning algorithms are not computationally efficient, which limits their practical applicability. Addressing this limitation or providing a roadmap for future work in this direction would enhance the paper's impact.
4. Tie-Breaking Rules: The paper does not explicitly address whether the results hold under different tie-breaking rules, such as uniform random tie-breaking. This could be a minor but important clarification.
Recommendation:
This paper makes significant theoretical contributions to the intersection of auction theory and learning theory, offering a novel and rigorous framework for designing learnable auctions. However, its practical applicability and computational feasibility remain open questions. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the practical concerns and discuss the implications of their work in real-world settings. Additionally, clarifying the impact of tie-breaking rules and bidder strategies would further strengthen the paper. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical contributions with broad generalization.
- Novel framework that bridges auction theory and learning theory.
- Clear and well-organized presentation of results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited discussion on practical implications and real-world feasibility.
- Lack of computational efficiency in the proposed algorithms.
- Insufficient exploration of long-term revenue considerations.
Overall, this paper is a valuable addition to the field and merits inclusion in the conference program.
