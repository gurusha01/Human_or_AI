Review
This paper addresses the computational challenges of Adaptive Stochastic Optimization (ASO) by introducing two novel conditions, the Marginal Likelihood Rate Bound (MLRB) and the Marginal Likelihood Bound (MLB), which enable efficient approximate solutions for ASO problems. The authors propose a new algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), which extends submodular optimization to both sets and paths, and demonstrate its applicability in two robot planning tasks under uncertainty. The theoretical contributions include a detailed analysis of RAC's performance guarantees and its relationship to prior work in submodular optimization and adaptive planning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The paper extends submodular optimization from sets to paths, addressing a significant limitation in prior work. This generalization is well-motivated and has potential applications in robotics and decision-making under uncertainty.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of MLRB and MLB conditions is a meaningful addition to the literature. The paper provides rigorous proofs and performance guarantees for RAC under these conditions, which is a valuable theoretical contribution.
3. Experimental Validation: The application of RAC to noisy Informative Path Planning (IPP) tasks demonstrates its practical utility. The results show that RAC outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of cost-effectiveness, particularly for the Gibbs error objective.
4. Clarity of Motivation: The UAV search and rescue example effectively illustrates the need for extending ASO to path domains, making the problem accessible to a broader audience.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: While the paper is generally clear, several sections suffer from technical ambiguities. For example, the reversed inequality on line 110, unclear termination conditions on line 125, and notation mistakes on lines 151-152 detract from the readability. The alignment assumptions on line 216 also require further elaboration.
2. Algorithm Analysis: The usefulness of the algorithm analysis is questionable, particularly for Theorems 1 and 2. The resulting bounds, which grow with the square of the logarithm of the number of actions, may not be tight for practical applications, limiting the real-world applicability of the theoretical results.
3. Experimental Limitations: The experiments are small in scale and limited to two tasks. While the results are promising, they do not conclusively demonstrate the algorithm's robustness across diverse domains or larger problem instances.
4. Presentation of Results: The experimental plots have mismatched labels, and the captions are redundant and lack sufficient detail. This reduces the clarity and impact of the experimental findings.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution by introducing new conditions (MLRB and MLB) and extending submodular optimization to paths. The RAC algorithm is novel and shows promise in practical applications.
- Con: The clarity issues, questionable tightness of theoretical bounds, and limited experimental validation weaken the overall impact of the work.
Recommendation: Weak Accept. While the paper has notable strengths in its theoretical contributions and novelty, the clarity and experimental limitations need to be addressed. The authors should revise the manuscript to fix the identified clarity issues, provide tighter bounds or justify their practicality, and expand the experimental evaluation to strengthen the paper's impact.
