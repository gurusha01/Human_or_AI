The paper addresses the problem of sparse linear model estimation using atomic norms, with a focus on deriving bounds for Gaussian widths and restricted norm compatibility constants. It provides specific analyses for the \( l1 \), ordered weighted \( l1 \) (OWL), and \( k \)-support norms. The authors present general upper and lower bounds for geometric measures like the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, the Gaussian width of the spherical cap induced by the tangent cone, and the restricted norm compatibility constant. Notably, the paper introduces new dual norm calculations for the \( k \)-support norm, offering sharper bounds compared to prior work. However, the proof techniques for other norms largely rely on standard methods already established in the literature.
The atomic norm framework is well-recognized for its generality in solving structured linear inverse problems. However, this paper narrows its scope to sparse linear models, leaving out broader applications such as nuclear norm penalized low-rank matrix estimation. While the results are technically sound and mathematically rigorous, the contribution is somewhat incremental, as many results for sparse linear regression are already available. The paper does not explore the generalizability of its methods to other atomic norm applications, which limits its impact.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor: The mathematical proofs are clear, gap-free, and well-organized, making the results easy to follow for experts in the field.
2. Novelty in \( k \)-Support Norm Analysis: The dual norm calculations and bounds for the \( k \)-support norm fill a gap in the literature and provide practical insights into its use.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written, with a logical flow and sufficient background provided for readers to understand the derivations.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope: The focus is restricted to sparse linear models, which diminishes the broader applicability of the results to other atomic norms like the nuclear norm.
2. Incremental Contribution: Many of the results for \( l_1 \) and OWL norms are extensions of existing work, with limited novelty in proof techniques.
3. Lack of Experimental Validation: The paper does not include empirical results to demonstrate the practical utility of the derived bounds.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a detailed and rigorous analysis of Gaussian widths and restricted norm compatibility constants, particularly for the \( k \)-support norm.
- The results are technically sound and fill a gap in the literature for specific norms.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The contribution is narrow and incremental, with limited novelty beyond the \( k \)-support norm analysis.
- The lack of generalizability to other atomic norm applications reduces the paper's significance.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically solid and well-written, its narrow scope and incremental contributions limit its impact. I recommend borderline rejection, as the results may be better suited for a more specialized venue focusing on sparse linear models rather than a broad AI conference like NeurIPS. Expanding the scope to include other atomic norm applications or providing experimental validation could significantly improve the paper's value.
