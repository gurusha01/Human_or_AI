This paper addresses the problem of community detection in stochastic block models (SBMs) without prior knowledge of model parameters, proposing novel algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs. The authors extend prior work by developing agnostic algorithms for both constant and logarithmic degree regimes, achieving strong and exact recovery under minimal assumptions. The paper contributes to a highly active research area, building on foundational work such as Abbe and Sandon (2015) and others on phase transitions and recovery thresholds in SBMs. However, it lacks adequate referencing to related work on stochastic blockmodels, such as two key papers that address optimal misclassification and minimax rates, which would provide a more comprehensive context for the results.
Strengths:
1. Significant Contribution to Theory and Practice: The proposed algorithms achieve strong and exact recovery without requiring knowledge of model parameters, a notable advancement over prior work. The results are theoretically grounded, with clear connections to information-theoretic limits such as the CH-divergence.
2. Efficiency and Scalability: The algorithms are computationally efficient, running in quasi-linear time, and are applicable to large-scale networks. This makes them practical for real-world applications in social and biological networks.
3. Novelty: The paper introduces fully agnostic algorithms for the logarithmic degree regime, which simultaneously learn model parameters and achieve optimal recovery rates. This is a novel contribution that advances the state of the art in SBM research.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Readability: The paper is dense and difficult to follow, particularly in its algorithmic descriptions. Key steps of the algorithms, such as the Agnostic-sphere-comparison and Agnostic-degree-profiling, are not clearly explained, making it challenging for readers to reproduce the results. Simplifying and structuring these sections would significantly improve accessibility.
2. Condensation Effort: The paper appears to be a condensed version of a longer manuscript, but minimal effort has been made to streamline the content. The inclusion of excessive technical details detracts from the main contributions and overwhelms the reader.
3. Missing References: The paper does not adequately reference related work on stochastic blockmodels, particularly two key papers that address optimal misclassification and minimax rates. Including these references would strengthen the paper's positioning within the broader literature.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical and challenging problem in SBM research, presenting theoretically sound and computationally efficient solutions.
- The results have significant implications for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in network science.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of clarity and organization significantly hinders comprehension and reproducibility.
- The omission of key references and minimal condensation effort suggest a lack of thoroughness in preparation.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field, its readability and presentation need substantial improvement. I recommend conditional acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing the clarity issues, improving algorithm descriptions, and incorporating the missing references.
