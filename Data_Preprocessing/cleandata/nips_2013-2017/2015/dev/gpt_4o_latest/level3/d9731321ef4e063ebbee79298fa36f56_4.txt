This paper presents a novel information-theoretic framework for active model selection, termed Bayesian Active Model Selection (BAMS), and demonstrates its application in diagnosing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) using Gaussian Process (GP) models. The authors address the critical challenge of reducing the number of tone presentations required for audiometric diagnosis, achieving real-time performance and significant efficiency gains over existing methods. The proposed approach is particularly notable for its analytical approximation of mutual information, which eliminates the need for costly model retraining, making it computationally feasible for real-time applications.
Strengths:  
1. Contribution: The paper introduces a new criterion for sequential experimental design aimed at model selection, which is a significant contribution to the field. The application to NIHL detection is compelling, as it addresses a real-world problem with potential societal impact. The results demonstrate that the method can diagnose NIHL with fewer than 15 tones, a drastic improvement over traditional audiometric tests.
2. Originality: The use of a symmetry-based trick to simplify an otherwise intractable quantity for active model selection is innovative. This builds on prior work but extends it meaningfully to a new domain.
3. Quality and Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the methodology, including approximations for model evidence, hyperparameter posterior, and predictive distributions. The inclusion of reusable code and explicit formulas enhances reproducibility. However, minor issues such as undefined terms and typos should be addressed.
4. Significance: The work tackles an important problem in model selection and demonstrates its utility in a practical, high-impact application. The focus on reducing the diagnostic burden in large-scale screenings is particularly noteworthy.
Weaknesses:  
1. Scope of Application: While the NIHL example is compelling, the paper does not fully explore the broader potential of the method, particularly in selecting covariance kernels for GPs. A more complex or diverse set of examples would better illustrate the generality of the approach.
2. Model Complexity: The necessity of simpler models (e.g., the healthy vs. NIHL models) is questioned, as the more complex model could potentially suffice by inferring hyperparameters. This tradeoff could be better justified.
3. Minor Omissions: The paper could benefit from referencing hyperparameter marginalization via MCMC in Section 3, which would provide additional context for the approximations used.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel, efficient approach to active model selection with clear theoretical and practical contributions. The application to NIHL detection is impactful and demonstrates the method's utility in a real-world setting.
- Con: The scope of the application is somewhat narrow, and the paper does not fully explore the method's potential in more complex model selection scenarios. Additionally, the justification for using simpler models could be strengthened.
Recommendation:  
This is a high-quality paper with a significant contribution to active model selection and its application to a practical problem. While there are some limitations in scope and minor clarity issues, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted concerns.
