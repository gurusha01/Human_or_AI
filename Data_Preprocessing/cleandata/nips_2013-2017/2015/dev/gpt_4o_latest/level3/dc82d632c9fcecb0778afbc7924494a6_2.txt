The paper introduces the concept of lifted And/Or schematics as an inference-aware representation of the search space for Probabilistic Theorem Proving (PTP) in statistical relational models (SRMs). This framework enables efficient computation of upper bounds on inference costs and facilitates Rao-Blackwellized importance sampling. The authors extend the propositional And/Or framework to the lifted domain, offering a novel intermediate representation that bridges high-level probabilistic logics and inference-time search space representations. They demonstrate the utility of this approach by developing a Rao-Blackwellized Lifted Importance Sampling (LIS) algorithm, which improves estimation accuracy on real-world datasets.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant challenge in lifted inferenceâ€”quantifying the complexity of inference without full exploration of the search space. The introduction of lifted And/Or schematics is a novel contribution that aligns well with the literature on lifted inference and probabilistic graphical models. The proposed framework has practical implications, as demonstrated by the Rao-Blackwellized LIS algorithm, which shows improved accuracy in experiments. The theoretical grounding of the approach, particularly the complexity analysis and the induced lifted width metric, is rigorous and provides a solid foundation for future work. The experimental results, though limited in scope, convincingly illustrate the benefits of the proposed method.
Weaknesses:  
The theoretical contributions, while novel, lack sufficient depth to provide transformative insights. The framework's generality and power in terms of liftability are unclear, particularly its ability to capture all domain-liftable model classes. The paper does not adequately relate its approach to existing techniques, such as dtrees, first-order NNF circuits, or first-order decomposition trees, which could provide valuable context and comparisons. For instance, connections to first-order NNF circuits and their complexity analysis (e.g., nested counting operations) are mentioned but not explored in detail. Similarly, the relationship to first-order decomposition trees is underdeveloped, with no illustrative examples provided. The experimental setup lacks critical details, such as the method of evidence selection and how symmetry exploitation is performed. Additionally, minor technical inaccuracies and typos detract from the paper's overall clarity.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- The paper tackles a challenging and important problem in lifted inference.  
- The lifted And/Or schematic is a novel and promising abstraction.  
- The Rao-Blackwellized LIS algorithm demonstrates practical utility.  
- Theoretical analysis is rigorous and aligns with prior work in the field.  
Con:  
- The theoretical contributions are not sufficiently deep or general.  
- Connections to related work are inadequately explored.  
- Experimental details and clarity are lacking.  
- Minor technical inaccuracies and typos reduce polish.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to lifted inference, its theoretical and experimental shortcomings limit its impact. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions to address the lack of depth in theoretical analysis, improve connections to related work, and provide more detailed experimental descriptions.
