This paper explores the intersection of lifted and approximate inference for statistical relational models (SRMs), proposing a novel "lifted And/Or schematic" framework and introducing a Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling (LIS) algorithm. The authors aim to address the limitations of inference-blind representations in lifted algorithms by introducing an inference-aware representation that enables efficient computation of inference costs. Their contributions include a formal specification of lifted And/Or schematics, complexity bounds for lifted inference, and an application of these bounds to improve the accuracy of LIS through Rao-Blackwellisation. While the ideas are intriguing and potentially impactful, the paper has several strengths and weaknesses that merit discussion.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a principled, inference-aware representation for lifted inference, which is a significant step forward in addressing the computational challenges of lifted algorithms. The extension of the And/Or framework to SRMs is innovative and demonstrates a clear understanding of prior work.
2. Rao-Blackwellisation Contribution: The second contribution, a Rao-Blackwellised LIS algorithm, is particularly interesting. It leverages the proposed framework to reduce variance in sampling-based inference, which could have practical implications for SRM-based applications.
3. Clarity of Writing: The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear presentation of the problem and contributions. However, as noted below, it assumes significant prior knowledge, which may limit accessibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumption of Prior Knowledge: The paper heavily relies on reference [9] and assumes familiarity with lifted inference and Rao-Blackwellisation. Key concepts, such as Rao-Blackwellisation and the lifted And/Or schematic, are not explained in sufficient detail, making the paper difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with these topics.
2. Ambiguity in Terminology: Terms like "pseudotree," "schematic," and "new MLNs" lack clear definitions or distinctions from existing concepts. This ambiguity detracts from the clarity and rigor of the work.
3. Experimental Evaluation: The experimental results are weak and fail to robustly support the claims. While the Rao-Blackwellised LIS algorithm shows reduced variance, the experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed framework. The relationship between fixed time budgets and reduced accuracy due to fewer samples is also not adequately addressed.
4. Unsubstantiated Claims: The claim of "optimal" complexity bounds is questionable and requires further justification. Additionally, the conclusion that the proposed method improves accuracy is not convincingly validated by the experimental results.
5. Technical Issues: There is a missing word in the sentence, "The overall complexity of depends," which needs correction. Such errors, though minor, reflect a lack of attention to detail.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in lifted inference, proposing novel ideas that could inspire future research.
- The Rao-Blackwellised LIS algorithm is an interesting contribution with potential practical benefits.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation is insufficient to validate the claims, and the practical utility of the proposed framework remains unclear.
- The lack of detailed explanations and ambiguous terminology limits the accessibility and rigor of the paper.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents novel ideas, its weaknesses, particularly in experimental validation and clarity, outweigh its strengths. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage the authors to address these issues and resubmit. Specifically, they should provide more detailed explanations of key concepts, clarify terminology, strengthen the experimental evaluation, and substantiate their claims with rigorous analysis.
