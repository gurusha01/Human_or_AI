The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of structured estimation with atomic norms by introducing general bounds for key geometric quantities that influence statistical error bounds. Specifically, it focuses on the Gaussian width of the unit ball, the Gaussian width of the spherical cap of the tangent cone, and the restricted norm compatibility constant. These quantities are crucial for understanding the sample complexity and estimation error in structured sparse recovery problems. The authors propose novel upper bounds for these measures, leveraging simpler sets and subgradients for computation, and provide corresponding lower bounds to demonstrate the tightness of their results. The application of these bounds to the k-support norm is particularly noteworthy, as it improves upon prior results and offers practical insights for parameter selection in sparse estimation.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-supported claims derived from theoretical analysis. The inclusion of both upper and lower bounds for the geometric measures ensures a comprehensive understanding of their behavior.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is clearly written and well-structured, with a logical progression from background concepts to general results and specific applications. The inclusion of practical examples, such as the k-support norm, enhances the accessibility of the theoretical contributions.
3. Originality: The work is novel in its approach to bounding geometric measures using simpler computational techniques and subgradient information. The results extend beyond decomposable norms to general atomic norms, broadening the applicability of the findings.
4. Significance: The results are important for the field of sparse estimation, particularly in advancing the understanding of non-decomposable norms. The improved bounds for the k-support norm and the insights into parameter selection (e.g., under-specifying k) are likely to influence both theoretical research and practical applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper could benefit from empirical validation to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed bounds in real-world scenarios.
2. Complexity of Presentation: Some sections, particularly those involving detailed proofs and derivations, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Simplifying or summarizing key results could improve accessibility.
3. Scope of Applications: Although the k-support norm is a compelling example, additional applications to other atomic norms could further demonstrate the generality and impact of the proposed framework.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in structured estimation and provides novel, theoretically sound solutions.
- The results are significant and have the potential to advance the state of the art in sparse recovery with atomic norms.
- The writing is clear, and the inclusion of practical examples enhances the paper's utility to both researchers and practitioners.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the demonstration of the practical impact of the results.
- The presentation of some technical details may be overly dense for a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions to bounding geometric measures in structured estimation are both novel and significant. However, the authors are encouraged to include empirical results and consider simplifying the presentation of technical details to make the work more accessible.
