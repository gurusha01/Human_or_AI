This paper addresses the problem of matrix completion with graph-based side information, presenting a general framework capable of incorporating diverse data sources. The authors propose a scalable algorithm, GRALS (Graph Regularized Alternating Least Squares), which integrates graph structural information into matrix factorization. The paper claims significant contributions, including a highly efficient conjugate gradient-based alternating minimization scheme, theoretical consistency guarantees, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The work is positioned as a generalization of weighted nuclear norm formulations and connects to broader literature on structured matrix factorization and noisy matrix approximation.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contributions: The paper introduces a novel and scalable algorithm for graph-regularized matrix completion. The use of efficient Hessian-vector multiplication schemes makes the approach computationally attractive, particularly for large datasets.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide statistical consistency guarantees for their method, which is a significant theoretical contribution. The connection to generalized weighted nuclear norms and convex optimization is well-articulated.
3. Practical Relevance: The application of GRALS to recommendation systems, particularly with social network data, is compelling. The scalability of the method is demonstrated through experiments on large datasets, achieving orders of magnitude speedups over competing methods.
4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-structured, with clear problem formulation, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The connections to related work are comprehensive and well-referenced.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Baselines: While the experimental results are promising, the baselines in Table 1 are overly simplistic. The comparison lacks recent state-of-the-art methods, which would provide a more robust evaluation of GRALS's performance.
2. Scalability Validation: Although the scalability claims are impressive, the datasets used (e.g., MovieLens 100k) are relatively small compared to industry-scale datasets like Netflix or Yahoo Music. Validation on such larger datasets, along with RMSE comparisons, would strengthen the claims.
3. Minor Presentation Issues: There are inconsistencies in x-axis formats in figures, ambiguous log-scale labeling, and non-standard citation formatting. These issues, while minor, detract from the overall polish of the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in matrix completion, advancing the state of the art with a novel and scalable approach.
- The theoretical contributions are robust and connect well to existing literature.
- The practical implications of the work, particularly for recommendation systems, are substantial.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, particularly with stronger baselines and validation on larger datasets.
- Minor presentation issues suggest the need for additional refinement.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of matrix completion and convex optimization. While the experimental section could be improved, the theoretical and algorithmic advancements are significant. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the experimental and presentation concerns in the final version.
