The paper presents a novel recursive algorithm, Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), for addressing adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) problems over both sets and paths. By introducing two new conditions—Marginal Likelihood Rate Bound (MLRB) and Marginal Likelihood Bound (MLB)—the authors enable efficient approximation of ASO problems that are otherwise computationally intractable. The RAC algorithm leverages these conditions to achieve near-optimal expected cost guarantees, extending the applicability of ASO to new problem domains, such as noisy robot planning tasks.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical advancement by generalizing classical results in Bayesian pool-based active learning under MLB conditions. This generalization is achieved up to a constant factor, which is a meaningful extension of prior work. The introduction of MLRB and MLB conditions provides a new lens for analyzing ASO problems, expanding the class of tractable problems.
2. Algorithmic Novelty: The RAC algorithm is technically innovative, particularly in its ability to handle both set and path domains. This is a notable improvement over prior approaches that were limited to set domains.
3. Experimental Validation: The application of RAC to two robot planning tasks under uncertainty demonstrates its practical relevance. The results show that RAC outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of cost efficiency, particularly when using the Gibbs error function.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Guarantees: The paper provides rigorous approximation bounds for RAC under both MLRB and MLB conditions, which strengthens the reliability of its claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Empirical Comparisons: While the experimental results are promising, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive empirical evaluation. Specifically, comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms beyond the provided baselines (e.g., Sampled-RAId and IG-Cost) would strengthen the empirical claims.
2. Clarity of Concepts: The definitions of MLRB and MLB, while mathematically precise, could be made more accessible through intuitive explanations or illustrative examples. This would help readers unfamiliar with adaptive submodularity better grasp the distinctions and implications of these conditions.
3. Scope of Applications: The experiments focus on two specific tasks (UAV search and grasping), which, while relevant, may not fully demonstrate the generalizability of RAC to other ASO problems.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in adaptive stochastic optimization.
- It introduces novel theoretical concepts and an innovative algorithm with provable guarantees.
- The experimental results, though limited, indicate the practical utility of the proposed approach.
Con:

- The clarity of the paper could be improved, especially for readers unfamiliar with the technical background.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical and algorithmic contribution to the field of adaptive stochastic optimization. While there are areas for improvement in empirical evaluation and clarity, the novelty and significance of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
