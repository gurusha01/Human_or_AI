Review
This paper addresses the problem of designing revenue-maximizing auctions using samples from bidders' valuation distributions, leveraging tools from statistical learning theory. The authors introduce a hierarchy of t-level auctions (C_t), which interpolate between simple and optimal auctions, balancing expressivity and simplicity. The main contributions include (1) proving that t-level auctions can achieve near-optimal revenue with a polynomial number of samples, (2) bounding the pseudo-dimension of t-level auctions as \(O(nt \log nt)\), and (3) quantifying the trade-off between the number of levels \(t\), representation error, and sample complexity. The results are applicable to single-parameter settings, including single-item and matroid feasibility auctions, and demonstrate that t-level auctions can approximate optimal auctions as \(t\) increases.
The paper is technically sound and builds on prior work in auction theory and learning theory, such as Balcan et al. (2008) and Cole & Roughgarden (2014). The authors extend these works by generalizing to broader settings and providing tighter sample complexity bounds. However, the learning arguments are primarily existential and computationally intractable, which limits their practical applicability. While the theoretical results are rigorous, the computational hardness of the proposed methods makes the contribution slightly incremental, especially for an audience at NIPS, where practical algorithms are often emphasized.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with detailed proofs and sufficient references to related work. However, it could benefit from additional motivation for readers unfamiliar with auction theory, as the practical significance of the results may not be immediately apparent. For instance, the authors could provide examples of real-world applications where t-level auctions would be impactful. Additionally, the connection between auction theory and statistical learning could be better contextualized for the NIPS audience.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The introduction of t-level auctions as a tunable hierarchy is an elegant contribution to auction theory.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees, including bounds on pseudo-dimension and sample complexity.
3. Clarity: The writing is clear, and the mathematical arguments are well-supported and precise.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Intractability: The proposed learning algorithms are not computationally efficient, limiting their practical utility.
2. Incremental Contribution: The results, while interesting, are largely extensions of prior work and may not significantly advance the state of the art for NIPS.
3. Limited Scope: The focus on single-parameter settings excludes more complex multi-parameter scenarios, which are often more relevant in practice.
4. Insufficient Motivation: The paper does not adequately motivate the significance of the results for a broader machine learning audience.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Explore computationally efficient algorithms for learning t-level auctions, potentially using approximation techniques.
2. Investigate special cases of valuation distributions where tighter sample complexity bounds or faster algorithms might be achievable.
3. Provide lower bounds on sample complexity to complement the upper bounds and better contextualize the results.
4. Strengthen the connection to algorithmic game theory and highlight how this work could introduce novel problems to the learning community.
5. Include more examples or applications to motivate the practical relevance of the results.
Recommendation:
While the paper is well-executed and contributes to the intersection of auction theory and learning theory, its computational intractability and incremental nature make it less compelling for NIPS. I recommend weak rejection, but encourage the authors to address the practical limitations and broaden the appeal of their work in future revisions.
