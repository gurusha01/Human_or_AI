This paper presents a novel framework for testing whether a discrete distribution belongs to a specific class \( C \) or is far from it, with a focus on small-sample regimes. The authors introduce a sample-optimal and computationally efficient approach leveraging the chi-square (\( \chi^2 \)) statistic, achieving significant improvements in sample complexity for monotonicity, log-concavity, unimodality, and monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions. The paper also provides matching lower bounds, establishing the optimality of the proposed testers.
The use of the \( \chi^2 \) statistic is particularly noteworthy, as it enables sublinear sample complexity in many cases, contrasting with the higher complexities of previous approaches. The authors extend Birg√©'s decomposition theorem for multidimensional monotone distributions and develop computationally efficient learners for log-concave and MHR distributions, which are the first of their kind in the low-sample regime. The paper also addresses testing independence of random variables, offering improvements over prior work for multidimensional cases.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contributions: The paper provides a unified framework for testing multiple distribution classes, with rigorous theoretical guarantees and optimal sample complexities. The novel use of the \( \chi^2 \) statistic is a key innovation.
2. Comprehensive Results: Matching lower bounds are provided for all considered classes, demonstrating the tightness of the proposed methods.
3. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly delineates its contributions relative to prior work, particularly in improving sample complexity and addressing computational efficiency.
4. Significance: The results advance the state of the art in distribution testing, with potential applications in statistics, machine learning, and theoretical computer science.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope of Distribution Classes: The paper limits its focus to monotonicity, log-concavity, unimodality, and MHR distributions. While these are fundamental, the rationale for this restriction is not fully explained. It would be helpful to discuss whether the proposed framework can be extended to other distribution families or why these specific classes were prioritized.
2. Accessibility: While the paper is technically sound, some sections are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with \( \chi^2 \)-based methods or property testing. Additional intuition and examples could improve accessibility.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper is purely theoretical, with no experimental results to validate the practicality of the proposed methods. While the focus is on theoretical guarantees, empirical evidence could strengthen the paper's impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically robust framework with optimal sample complexity, addressing a fundamental problem in distribution testing.
- It provides significant theoretical advancements, including computationally efficient learners and matching lower bounds.
- The work is well-positioned within the existing literature and advances the state of the art.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The scope of distribution classes is somewhat narrow, and the limitations are not fully justified.
- The lack of empirical validation may limit the practical impact of the results.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of distribution testing. While some limitations exist, they do not detract significantly from the quality or significance of the work. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to include a discussion on the rationale for the chosen distribution classes and potential extensions.
