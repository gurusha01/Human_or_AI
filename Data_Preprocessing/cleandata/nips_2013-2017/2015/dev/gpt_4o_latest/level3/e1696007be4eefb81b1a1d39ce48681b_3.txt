This paper investigates the sample complexity and error bounds for Dantzig-type estimators in structured regression, focusing on atomic norms invariant under sign changes. The authors leverage geometric properties, particularly the Gaussian width of the norm ball, to derive novel and easily computable bounds for these estimators. They also analyze the tightness of their bounds by comparing upper and lower limits, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework. The paper's contributions are particularly relevant to the machine learning community, as structured estimation and sparse recovery are critical areas of research.
The work builds on prior studies of Lasso- and Dantzig-type estimators and extends the analysis to a broader class of atomic norms, including the k-support norm. While previous research often struggled with bounding geometric measures for non-decomposable norms, this paper introduces a general method that simplifies the computation of these bounds. The authors also provide practical insights into the choice of parameters, such as the value of \( k \) in the k-support norm, which could influence recovery guarantees.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides novel bounds for geometric measures like the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball and spherical cap, which are central to understanding sample complexity and estimation error.
2. Practical Relevance: The results are applicable to a wide range of atomic norms, including those used in sparse recovery, making the work valuable for both theoretical and applied researchers.
3. Clarity of Results: The authors clearly demonstrate the tightness of their bounds, which enhances confidence in the robustness of their theoretical findings.
4. Novelty: The approach of using a single subgradient for bounding measures is innovative and reduces computational complexity compared to prior methods.
5. Relevance: The topic aligns well with ongoing research in structured regression and sparse estimation, making it a timely contribution to the field.
Weaknesses:
1. Technical Complexity: While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, such as the proof of Theorem 7, are dense and difficult to follow. Additional explanations or examples could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Empirical Validation: Although the theoretical results are strong, the paper could benefit from empirical experiments to validate the practical utility of the proposed bounds.
3. Scope of Norms: The focus on atomic norms invariant under sign changes is somewhat restrictive, and it would be interesting to see if the methods generalize to other classes of norms.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant theoretical contribution to structured regression and sparse recovery. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper is likely to stimulate further research in the field. However, I encourage the authors to improve the clarity of technical proofs and consider adding empirical results in future work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and theoretically sound contributions.
- High relevance to the machine learning community.
- Clear demonstration of the tightness of bounds.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Some technical sections are challenging to follow.
- Lack of empirical validation.
Overall, this is a well-written and valuable theory paper that advances the understanding of Dantzig-type estimators and structured regression.
