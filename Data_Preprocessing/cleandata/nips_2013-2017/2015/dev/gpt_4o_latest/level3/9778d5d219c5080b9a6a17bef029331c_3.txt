This paper presents a novel approach to color constancy by leveraging per-pixel luminance and chromaticity histograms, offering a simple yet effective algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard color checker dataset. The authors propose two training methodologies: an empirical approach based on pixel statistics and an end-to-end optimization approach that slightly improves performance. The simplicity of the algorithm makes it a promising building block for more complex models, such as those addressing spatially-varying illumination.
Strengths:  
The proposed method is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and achieves impressive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. The use of pixel-wise statistics without requiring spatial or semantic context is an interesting and novel contribution to the field. The empirical approach is well-grounded in statistical properties of natural scenes, while the end-to-end training demonstrates the adaptability of the model to improve performance, particularly in challenging cases with outliers. The algorithm's ability to outperform more complex methods, including those using convolutional neural networks or semantic reasoning, underscores its significance. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed experimental evaluation, including cross-validation and comparisons to prior work, which strengthens the credibility of their claims.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is reasonably well-written, the mathematical notation is overly complex and could benefit from simplification. For instance, the notation in equations and derivations might be intimidating for readers unfamiliar with the domain, potentially hindering accessibility. The inclusion of illustrative figures corresponding to key mathematical expressions would significantly improve clarity and comprehension. Another concern is the use of modified error metrics in the evaluation, which raises questions about the validity and reliability of the reported results. The authors should present results with unmodified metrics alongside clear disclaimers, leaving the burden of revision on prior work. Additionally, the speculative nature of the corrections to alleged black-level errors in prior work ([7,19]) is problematic and should be handled with more caution.
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The algorithm is simple, fast, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.  
- It introduces a novel perspective by focusing on pixel-wise statistics, which could inspire future research.  
- The end-to-end training approach demonstrates adaptability and robustness.  
- The method has potential as a building block for more complex illumination models.
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The mathematical exposition is unnecessarily complex, reducing accessibility.  
- The evaluation methodology, particularly the use of modified error metrics, raises concerns about the reliability of the results.  
- Allegations against prior work ([7,19]) are speculative and not rigorously substantiated.
Recommendation:  
This paper makes a meaningful contribution to color constancy research and is likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners. However, the authors should address the evaluation concerns and improve the clarity of their presentation. With these revisions, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance.
