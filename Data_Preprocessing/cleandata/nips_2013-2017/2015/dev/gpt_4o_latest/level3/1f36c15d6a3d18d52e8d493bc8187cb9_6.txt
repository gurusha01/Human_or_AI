The paper addresses the problem of testing whether a discrete distribution \( p \) belongs to a specific class of distributions \( C \) or is far from it, with a focus on the small-sample regime. The authors propose computationally efficient and sample-optimal testers for several fundamental distribution classes, including monotonicity, independence, log-concavity, unimodality, and monotone hazard rate. Their approach leverages a novel use of the \(\chi^2\)-statistic, combined with structural insights into these distribution classes, to achieve optimal sample complexity. Additionally, the paper provides matching lower bounds, demonstrating the optimality of their methods.
Strengths:
1. Significant Contributions: The paper makes notable advancements in the field of distribution testing by providing sample-optimal testers for several important classes. The results improve upon prior work, particularly in terms of sample complexity, with tighter bounds and removal of logarithmic factors.
2. Novel Techniques: The use of the \(\chi^2\)-statistic in the small-sample regime is innovative and well-motivated. The authors also extend Birgé's decomposition theorem and employ convex programming to handle complex distribution classes like log-concave and monotone hazard rate distributions.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed proofs for both the upper and lower bounds, ensuring that the results are theoretically sound. The lower bounds, based on extensions of Paninski's construction, are particularly compelling.
4. Broad Applicability: The work addresses a wide range of distribution classes, making it relevant to both theoretical computer science and statistics. The results have potential applications in sublinear algorithms, property testing, and probabilistic modeling.
Weaknesses:
1. Motivations: The paper does not clearly articulate the motivations for imposing shape-related constraints on discrete distributions. This lack of context limits the perceived applicability of the proposed methods, especially for practitioners outside theoretical computer science.
2. Theorem 1 Assumptions: The independence assumption between observations and the newly drawn distribution \( q \) is not always valid. This critical assumption should be explicitly stated and justified to avoid confusion.
3. Lemma 5 and Theorem 1: There is a gap between the conditions stated in Lemma 5 and the requirements for invoking Theorem 1. This weakens the logical flow of the paper and raises concerns about the rigor of the proofs.
4. Continuous vs. Discrete Case: The frequent citation of Birgé (1987), which focuses on density estimation in the continuous case, lacks clarity regarding its relevance to the discrete setting. This connection needs to be better explained.
5. Incorrect Claim: The assertion that "any log-concave distribution is unimodal" is incorrect based on the definitions provided. This error undermines the theoretical foundation of some results and should be addressed.
6. Sample Complexity Precision: The sample complexity stated in the abstract is imprecise for certain parameter regimes, particularly when \( \epsilon \) decreases while \( n \) is fixed. This could mislead readers about the generality of the results.
7. Connections to Statistics: The paper assumes a discrete distribution with support \([n]\), which is standard in computer science but less common in statistics. Relevant statistical references for discrete cases are missing, limiting the paper's interdisciplinary impact.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes significant theoretical contributions and advances the state of the art in distribution testing, the issues with clarity, rigor, and motivation are concerning. The authors should address the gaps in assumptions, improve the precision of claims, and provide better context for the relevance of their work. If these concerns are adequately addressed in a revision, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance. For now, I recommend major revisions. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and theoretically sound contributions to distribution testing.
- Optimal sample complexity results with matching lower bounds.
- Broad applicability to multiple distribution classes.
Arguments against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in motivations and assumptions.
- Gaps in logical flow and rigor of proofs.
- Errors and imprecisions in key claims.
- Limited interdisciplinary relevance due to missing statistical connections.
