This paper presents a novel method for active model selection, termed Bayesian Active Model Selection (BAMS), which leverages a mutual information (MI) criterion with an efficient analytical approximation. The authors focus on Gaussian process (GP) models with arbitrary observation likelihoods and apply their framework to the critical medical task of diagnosing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). By formulating the problem as one of model selection rather than feature selection, the proposed method aims to identify the appropriate model (normal hearing vs. NIHL) with minimal sound queries, significantly reducing the time and resources required for diagnosis.
The paper is well-written and effectively motivates the need for its contributions. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges in NIHL diagnosis, particularly the inefficiency of traditional audiometric tests and the limitations of existing active learning methods in real-time applications. The proposed BAMS framework is computationally efficient, as it avoids costly model retraining, and its application to NIHL diagnosis is both novel and impactful. The introduction of a new GP prior mean to model notched hearing loss further highlights the paper's originality. The results, based on simulated patient data, indicate that BAMS can achieve accurate diagnoses with fewer than 15 sound queries, outperforming baselines and demonstrating its potential for large-scale clinical screenings.
However, the paper has some limitations. A significant drawback is the lack of experimental comparisons with prior active model selection methods, such as those by Ali et al. (2014) and Kulick et al. (2015). While the authors argue that these methods are computationally prohibitive, empirical evidence would strengthen this claim. Additionally, the reliance on simulated NIHL examples raises concerns about the generalizability of the results to real-world clinical data. Simulated data may inflate the performance of model-based methods, and the absence of validation on real patient data limits the robustness of the findings.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The clarity of the writing and organization is commendable, making the work accessible to readers. The originality of the approach and its application to a novel medical task are notable strengths. The significance of the work is high, as it addresses a real-world problem with potential for substantial impact in healthcare.
Arguments for acceptance:
- Novel and efficient active model selection framework.
- Clear and well-motivated application to a critical medical problem.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating the method's effectiveness.
Arguments against acceptance:
- Lack of experimental comparisons with prior active model selection methods.
