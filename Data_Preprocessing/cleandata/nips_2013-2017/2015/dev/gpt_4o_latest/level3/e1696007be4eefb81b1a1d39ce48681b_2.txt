This paper investigates the role of atomic norms in structured sparse regression, focusing on bounding key geometric measuresâ€”Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, Gaussian width of the tangent cone, and restricted norm compatibility constant. These measures are critical for characterizing estimation convergence rates. The authors derive general upper bounds for these quantities, establish their tightness through corresponding lower bounds, and apply their results to specific norms, notably the k-support norm, where prior analysis is incomplete. The paper also provides insights into the practical choice of the parameter \( k \), suggesting that under-specifying \( k \) may yield better recovery guarantees.
Strengths:
1. General Framework: The proposed technique is broad and accommodates a wide range of atomic norms, including the widely used \( \ell_1 \), OWL, and k-support norms. This generality makes the work applicable to diverse structured estimation problems.
2. Novel Contributions: While the bounds for \( \ell_1 \) norms align with existing results, the novel bounds for k-support norms are a significant contribution. The suggestion to under-specify \( k \) in practice is particularly insightful and could influence future applications of k-support norms.
3. Nontrivial Analyses: The tangent cone and compatibility analyses are mathematically rigorous and impactful. The use of a weighted \( \ell_1 \) norm to upper bound the tangent cone is a clever and effective approach.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions, theorems, and proofs. The inclusion of examples (e.g., \( \ell_1 \) and OWL norms) aids in understanding the general results.
5. Practical Implications: The authors provide actionable insights, such as the recommendation to test the derived bounds through numerical simulations for k-support norms, particularly in scenarios where \( k \) is over-specified.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty in Unit Norm Ball Analysis: The analysis of the unit norm ball builds on prior work and lacks significant innovation. While the decomposition approach is practical, it does not substantially advance the state of the art.
2. No Numerical Validation: The paper is purely theoretical, and the lack of numerical simulations to validate the derived bounds, especially for k-support norms, is a missed opportunity. Empirical results would strengthen the practical relevance of the findings.
3. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is clear for experts, some sections, particularly the proofs and derivations, may be challenging for non-specialists. Simplifying or summarizing key results could improve accessibility.
4. Limited Discussion of Related Work: Although the paper references prior work, a more detailed comparison with recent advances in structured estimation (e.g., overlapping group sparsity) would contextualize the contributions better.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of structured sparse regression, particularly in its treatment of k-support norms. Its general framework and rigorous analysis make it a valuable addition to the literature. However, the lack of numerical experiments and limited novelty in some aspects slightly detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the suggestion to include numerical simulations and expand the discussion of related work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- General and rigorous framework for bounding geometric measures.
- Novel and impactful results for k-support norms.
- Clear organization and actionable insights for practitioners.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Limited novelty in some aspects of the analysis.
- Complexity of presentation for a broader audience.
Overall, the paper meets the quality, clarity, originality, and significance criteria of the conference, with minor areas for improvement.
