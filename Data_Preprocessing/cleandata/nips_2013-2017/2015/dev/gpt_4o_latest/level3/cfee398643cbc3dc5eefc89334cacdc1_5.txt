This paper presents two novel algorithms for community recovery in stochastic block models (SBM), addressing both constant average degree and logarithmic average degree regimes. The key contributions include achieving optimal bounds for partial recovery in sparse regimes and complete recovery in semi-sparse regimes, without requiring prior knowledge of model parameters. This work builds on prior results, particularly those of Abbe and Sandon (2015), but removes the assumption of parameter knowledge, making it a significant step forward in the field. The algorithms, based on shortest path computations, improve upon earlier methods such as those by Bhattacharyya and Bickel (2014) by offering tighter theoretical guarantees and state-of-the-art performance.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically rigorous and mathematically well-grounded, providing strong theoretical results that align with information-theoretic limits. The introduction of agnostic algorithms capable of learning model parameters while achieving optimal recovery is a notable advancement. The proposed methods are computationally efficient, running in quasi-linear time, which is crucial for large-scale networks. Additionally, the results have potential for generalization to more complex network models, making the work broadly impactful. The application of these methods to real-world data, such as the blog network of Adamic and Glance, demonstrates their practical relevance and effectiveness.
Weaknesses:  
The paper suffers from significant clarity issues. The main algorithms, particularly the agnostic-sphere-comparison algorithm, are not well-outlined in the main text and rely heavily on supplementary material. This makes it challenging for readers to fully grasp the methods without extensive cross-referencing. Additionally, inconsistencies in the definitions and normalizations of SBM parameters (e.g., Q vs. Q/n) detract from the overall readability. While the theoretical contributions are strong, the presentation feels more suited for a journal publication due to its technical depth and lack of concise exposition. Furthermore, the lack of detailed experimental validation beyond a single dataset limits the empirical grounding of the proposed methods.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:  
1. Significant theoretical contribution, advancing the state-of-the-art in community recovery for SBMs.  
2. Removal of parameter knowledge assumption is a major step forward.  
3. Algorithms are computationally efficient and have practical relevance.  
Con Acceptance Arguments:  
1. Poor clarity and organization hinder accessibility for a broader audience.  
2. Heavy reliance on supplementary material for understanding key algorithms.  
3. Limited experimental validation reduces confidence in real-world applicability.  
Conclusion:  
While the paper makes substantial theoretical contributions and introduces innovative algorithms, its lack of clarity and limited empirical validation are notable drawbacks. It may be better suited for a journal publication where the authors can expand on the presentation and experimental results. Nonetheless, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and warrants acceptance if the authors address the clarity and presentation issues in a revised version.
