This paper addresses the problem of community detection in the stochastic block model (SBM) without prior knowledge of model parameters, presenting agnostic algorithms that achieve optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs. The authors propose algorithms for both constant and logarithmic degree regimes, achieving strong and exact recovery with quasi-linear time complexity. The work builds on prior results such as Abbe-Sandon (2015) and extends the state-of-the-art by removing the assumption of known parameters. The proposed methods are tested on real-world data, achieving competitive performance.
Strengths:
1. Significance and Novelty: The paper tackles an important problem in community detection, particularly the challenge of parameter-agnostic recovery in SBM. The development of efficient algorithms achieving optimal tradeoffs is a meaningful contribution to the field.
2. Technical Depth: The theoretical results are rigorous, with detailed proofs and clear connections to prior work. The extension to agnostic algorithms represents a novel contribution, addressing a gap in the literature.
3. Practical Relevance: The application to real-world data (e.g., the blog network) demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Weaknesses:
1. Anonymity Violation: The authors reveal their identities in the supplementary material, violating the double-blind review policy. This is a serious issue that compromises the integrity of the review process.
2. Overlap with Existing Work: The paper shares significant similarities with prior work, particularly on community detection in SBM (e.g., Abbe-Sandon, 2015). While the authors extend these results, the novelty could be more clearly delineated.
3. Formatting Issues: The paper's format is more suited for a journal submission than a conference proceeding. The extensive theoretical exposition, while thorough, may not align with the expectations of this conference, which typically prioritizes concise presentations of key ideas and results.
4. Clarity: While the technical content is detailed, the paper is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers not deeply familiar with SBM. The organization could be improved to make the contributions more accessible.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant and challenging problem, contributing novel algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.
- The results are rigorously derived and supported by empirical validation on real-world data.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The violation of anonymity is a major concern and against conference policy.
- The overlap with prior work raises questions about the degree of originality.
- The paper's format and presentation are not well-suited for a conference audience.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field, the anonymity violation and formatting issues are significant drawbacks. Additionally, the overlap with existing work warrants further clarification. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage the authors to address these concerns and consider submitting to a journal, where the detailed exposition may be more appropriate.
