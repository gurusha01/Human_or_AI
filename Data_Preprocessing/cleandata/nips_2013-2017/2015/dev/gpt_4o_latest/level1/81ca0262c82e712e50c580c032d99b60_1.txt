The paper introduces a novel data-driven optimal control framework based on Path Integral (PI) control, which combines probabilistic model-based reinforcement learning with linearly solvable optimal control theory. The authors propose an iterative forward-backward optimization scheme that analytically derives control laws without requiring policy parameterization. This approach addresses key limitations of existing PI-related methods, such as sample inefficiency, lack of generalizability, and reliance on extensive forward sampling. The paper demonstrates the proposed method's efficiency and generalizability through experiments on three tasks: cart-pole swing-up, double pendulum swing-up, and PUMA-560 robotic arm reaching. The authors also highlight the framework's ability to generalize learned controllers to new tasks without re-sampling, leveraging compositionality theory.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, deriving control laws analytically and providing a clear mathematical foundation for the proposed framework. The forward-backward optimization scheme is a significant departure from traditional PI methods, offering a novel approach to solving stochastic optimal control problems.
2. Sample Efficiency: The method demonstrates superior sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods like PILCO and PDDP, as shown in the experimental results. This is particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or time-consuming.
3. Generalizability: The ability to generalize controllers to new tasks without re-sampling is a notable contribution, addressing a major limitation of many reinforcement learning and control methods. The use of compositionality theory is well-motivated and effectively demonstrated in the experiments.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to experimental validation. The derivations are detailed, and the inclusion of algorithmic steps enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions and Limitations: The framework assumes partial knowledge of the dynamics (e.g., the control matrix \( G \)), which may limit its applicability to systems with fully unknown dynamics. Additionally, the uncertainty in \( G \) is not accounted for, as acknowledged by the authors.
2. Computational Complexity: While the method is more computationally efficient than PILCO, it is more expensive than PDDP due to the global nature of the optimization. This trade-off between computational cost and optimality could be further explored.
3. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to simulated tasks, and no results are provided on real-world systems. While the authors mention future applications to real systems, the lack of real-world validation weakens the practical impact of the work.
4. Comparison with Broader Methods: The paper does not compare the proposed method with model-free PI-related approaches or other recent reinforcement learning algorithms, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its relative strengths and weaknesses.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and technically sound contribution to the field of optimal control and reinforcement learning.
- The proposed method addresses key limitations of existing approaches, particularly in terms of sample efficiency and generalizability.
- The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the framework's advantages over state-of-the-art methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on partial knowledge of the dynamics and the lack of real-world experiments limit the practical applicability of the method.
- The computational cost, while reasonable, may be a concern for high-dimensional or real-time applications.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant scientific contribution to the field and is well-suited for presentation at NeurIPS. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the work has the potential to inspire further research in sample-efficient and generalizable control frameworks. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
