This paper addresses the problem of structured estimation with atomic norms, focusing on bounding key geometric measuresâ€”Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, Gaussian width of a spherical cap induced by a tangent cone, and restricted norm compatibility constants. These measures are critical for understanding sample complexity and estimation error bounds in high-dimensional recovery problems. The authors propose general upper bounds for these measures, requiring only simple information about the atomic norm, and demonstrate the tightness of these bounds through corresponding lower bounds. The paper also applies the results to specific norms, such as the k-support norm, filling gaps in prior literature.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper provides a comprehensive and general framework for bounding geometric measures associated with atomic norms. This is a significant contribution, as prior work often focused on specific norms or provided incomplete results.
2. Novel Insights: The authors introduce a decomposition-based approach for bounding the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball and a subgradient-based method for bounding the spherical cap width and restricted norm compatibility. These methods are practical and broadly applicable.
3. Tightness of Bounds: By deriving both upper and lower bounds, the authors convincingly demonstrate the tightness of their results, which enhances the reliability and utility of their framework.
4. Application to k-Support Norm: The detailed analysis of the k-support norm is a valuable addition, providing sharper bounds than prior work and offering practical guidance on the choice of k in recovery problems.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper is well-organized, with clear theoretical statements (e.g., lemmas and theorems) and proofs. The inclusion of algorithmic insights, such as solving the polar operator for the k-support norm, adds practical relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections, particularly the derivations of bounds, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Additional intuition or visual aids could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Empirical Validation: The paper primarily focuses on theoretical results. While the k-support norm example is illustrative, empirical experiments comparing the proposed bounds to existing methods across a range of norms would strengthen the paper's impact.
3. Scope of Norms: Although the framework is general, the focus on norms invariant under sign changes may limit applicability to certain structured estimation problems. A discussion of potential extensions to other classes of norms would be beneficial.
4. Connection to Prior Work: While the paper references related work, a more explicit comparison of the proposed bounds with existing results (e.g., for specific norms like L1 or OWL) would help contextualize the contributions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by generalizing and tightening bounds for geometric measures in structured estimation.
- The results are broadly applicable and address gaps in prior literature, particularly for non-decomposable norms like the k-support norm.
- The framework is well-supported by proofs and includes practical insights, such as the polar operator algorithm.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's dense mathematical presentation may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
- The lack of empirical validation leaves open questions about the practical performance of the proposed bounds.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance, as the paper provides a strong theoretical contribution to structured estimation with atomic norms. However, the authors should consider adding empirical results and improving the accessibility of the presentation in the final version.
