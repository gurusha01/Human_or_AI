This paper addresses the computational intractability of Adaptive Stochastic Optimization (ASO) by introducing two novel conditions—Marginal Likelihood Rate Bound (MLRB) and Marginal Likelihood Bound (MLB)—that enable efficient approximation of ASO problems. The authors propose Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC), a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves near-optimal solutions for ASO over both sets and paths, expanding the applicability of existing submodular optimization techniques. The paper demonstrates RAC's theoretical guarantees and evaluates its performance on two robot planning tasks under uncertainty, showing superior results compared to heuristic baselines.
The work builds on prior research in submodular optimization (e.g., [5], [10]) and adaptive planning, extending the scope of adaptive submodularity to include path-based ASO problems. The introduction of MLRB and MLB is particularly significant, as these conditions generalize the diminishing returns property to stochastic settings, enabling RAC to handle a broader class of problems. The authors also relate their work to the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, situating their contributions within a well-established theoretical context.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of MLRB and MLB conditions is a key theoretical advancement. The authors rigorously prove that these conditions expand the set of ASO problems that can be efficiently approximated.
2. Algorithmic Design: RAC is well-motivated and carefully designed, with mechanisms to hedge against over-commitment and adapt to noisy observations. The use of submodular orienteering within RAC is innovative and effective.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on UAV search and rescue and grasping tasks convincingly demonstrate RAC's practical utility. The comparison with baselines like IG, IG-Cost, and Sampled-RAId highlights RAC's superior performance.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Guarantees: The approximation bounds for RAC are clearly stated and supported by detailed proofs, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, its dense notation and technical depth may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with submodular optimization or ASO. Simplifying some explanations or including intuitive examples could improve clarity.
2. Limited Real-World Validation: The experiments are conducted in simulation, and while the tasks are relevant, real-world deployment would strengthen the paper's claims about RAC's practical applicability.
3. Comparison with POMDP Solvers: Although the authors position ASO as a special case of POMDPs, a direct comparison with state-of-the-art POMDP solvers could provide additional context for RAC's performance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing MLRB and MLB, which generalize adaptive submodularity.
- RAC is a novel and effective algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees and competitive empirical performance.
- The work addresses a challenging and important problem in planning under uncertainty, advancing the state of the art.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The dense presentation may limit accessibility for a broader audience.
- The lack of real-world experiments leaves some questions about practical scalability unanswered.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are substantial, both in terms of theory and algorithm design, and the empirical results are promising. Minor revisions to improve clarity and accessibility would enhance its impact.
