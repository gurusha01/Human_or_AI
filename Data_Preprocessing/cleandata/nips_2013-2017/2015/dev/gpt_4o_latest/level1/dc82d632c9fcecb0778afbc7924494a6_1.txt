This paper introduces a novel framework for lifted inference in Statistical Relational Models (SRMs) by extending the propositional And/Or search space into a "lifted And/Or schematic." The authors address a significant limitation in existing lifted inference algorithms, which lack inference-aware representations of the search space, making it challenging to pre-compute tight upper bounds on inference costs. The proposed framework enables efficient computation of such bounds and facilitates principled Rao-Blackwellisation within lifted importance sampling (LIS). The experimental results demonstrate that the Rao-Blackwellised LIS algorithm improves estimation accuracy on several real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The introduction of the lifted And/Or schematic is a significant advancement, bridging the gap between high-level probabilistic logics and inference-time search space representations. This framework provides a principled way to compute tight complexity bounds, which is a notable improvement over prior work.
2. Novelty: The paper extends the And/Or search space framework to the lifted domain, which is a novel and impactful contribution. The proposed bounding method and its integration into Rao-Blackwellised LIS represent a meaningful step forward in lifted inference.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments on benchmark SRMs demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method. The reduction in variance achieved by Rao-Blackwellisation highlights the effectiveness of the approach.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly delineates its contributions, including the formal specification of lifted And/Or schematics, complexity analysis, and the application to Rao-Blackwellised LIS.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the technical content is rich, the paper is dense and difficult to follow in places, particularly for readers unfamiliar with lifted inference or the And/Or framework. The notation and algorithms could benefit from additional explanation and illustrative examples.
2. Scope of Experiments: Although the experiments validate the proposed method, the evaluation is limited to three datasets. Broader testing on more diverse SRMs would strengthen the claims of generality and robustness.
3. Comparison with Baselines: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other lifted inference algorithms beyond LIS. It would be helpful to see how the proposed method performs relative to other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
4. Practical Impact: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the practical implications for real-world applications are not fully explored. For instance, the paper does not discuss how the proposed method scales with increasing model complexity or domain size.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing a novel framework for lifted inference.
- The proposed method addresses a critical limitation in existing algorithms and demonstrates practical utility through experiments.
- The work is original and advances the state of the art in lifted inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly for non-experts.
- The experimental evaluation is somewhat limited in scope and lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
- The practical scalability and impact of the approach are not thoroughly discussed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of lifted inference and probabilistic reasoning. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and experimental breadth, the novelty and significance of the proposed framework justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and experimental limitations.
