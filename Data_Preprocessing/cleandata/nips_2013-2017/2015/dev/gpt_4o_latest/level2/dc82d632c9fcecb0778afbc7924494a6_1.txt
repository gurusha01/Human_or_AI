The paper presents a novel, inference-aware representation for Statistical Relational Models (SRMs) using a lifted And/Or schematic framework. This work addresses a key limitation in existing lifted inference algorithms, particularly Probabilistic Theorem Proving (PTP), by enabling efficient computation of tight upper bounds on inference complexity. The authors demonstrate the utility of this framework by integrating it into a Rao-Blackwellised Lifted Importance Sampling (LIS) algorithm, which improves the accuracy of partition function estimates on real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The introduction of the lifted And/Or schematic framework is a significant advancement in lifted inference. By bridging the gap between high-level probabilistic logics and inference-time search space representations, the paper provides a principled approach to bounding inference complexity.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper is technically sound, with clear definitions and formal proofs for key concepts such as the induced lifted width and complexity bounds. The complexity analysis is thorough and well-justified.
3. Practical Utility: The proposed Rao-Blackwellised LIS algorithm demonstrates practical benefits, reducing variance in estimates compared to standard LIS. The experimental results on benchmark SRMs (e.g., WebKB, Protein MLN) validate the approach.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem definition to contributions, methodology, and experiments. The use of algorithms and examples (e.g., Figure 1) aids comprehension of complex concepts.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Scope: While the experiments demonstrate variance reduction, the evaluation is limited to three datasets. It would strengthen the paper to include more diverse SRMs or larger-scale benchmarks to assess scalability and generalizability.
2. Comparison with Baselines: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other lifted inference algorithms beyond LIS. For instance, how does the proposed method compare to other approximate algorithms like lifted variational inference or lifted belief propagation?
3. Proposal Distribution: The uniform proposal distribution used in the experiments may not be optimal. A discussion on the impact of different proposal distributions on the performance of the Rao-Blackwellised sampler would be valuable.
4. Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that the structure of the model affects the effectiveness of the complexity bounds, it does not explore this aspect in depth. A more explicit discussion of when the proposed method may fail or perform suboptimally would improve completeness.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in lifted inference, providing a novel and theoretically grounded solution.
- The proposed framework has clear practical applications and demonstrates measurable improvements in inference accuracy.
- The work is relevant to the NIPS community, advancing the state of the art in probabilistic reasoning and statistical relational learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation, while promising, is somewhat limited in scope and lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper does not fully explore the limitations of the proposed approach or provide guidance on its applicability to different SRMs.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of lifted inference and probabilistic reasoning. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in experimental evaluation and discussion of limitations, the strengths of the work outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified concerns.
