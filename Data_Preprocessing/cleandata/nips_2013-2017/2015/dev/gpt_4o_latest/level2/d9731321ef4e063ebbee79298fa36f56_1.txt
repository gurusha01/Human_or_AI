The paper introduces a novel information-theoretic framework for active model selection, termed Bayesian Active Model Selection (BAMS), and demonstrates its application in diagnosing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The authors propose a method that maximizes mutual information to distinguish between competing Gaussian Process (GP) models while avoiding computationally expensive model retraining. The paper's primary contributions include the development of an efficient analytical approximation for active structure learning in GPs, the extension of prior work on active audiometric testing to model selection, and the introduction of a novel GP prior mean function for modeling NIHL. The method is validated using clinical data, showing that it can diagnose NIHL with fewer than 15 tone queries, a significant reduction compared to conventional audiometric tests.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses a critical problem in personalized medicine—rapid and efficient diagnosis of NIHL—by reframing it as a model selection problem. This shift in perspective is innovative and has practical implications for large-scale screenings.
2. Technical Rigor: The proposed BAMS framework is grounded in information theory and Bayesian inference, with clear derivations and approximations for computational feasibility. The use of Laplace and MGP approximations is well-justified and effectively balances accuracy and efficiency.
3. Empirical Validation: The method is tested on real-world clinical data, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing approaches in terms of speed and accuracy. The results are compelling, with BAMS achieving over 99% confidence in the correct model with minimal samples.
4. Practical Utility: The focus on reducing the number of tone queries directly addresses the time and resource constraints in audiometric testing, making the method highly relevant for real-time applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Validation: While the results are promising, the clinical data used for validation is relatively small in scale. The generalizability of the method to larger and more diverse patient populations remains unclear.
2. Assumptions on Prior Knowledge: The method relies on expert-informed priors for the NIHL model parameters. While reasonable, the sensitivity of the results to these priors is not thoroughly explored.
3. Clarity: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may limit accessibility to a broader audience. For example, the detailed mathematical derivations could benefit from additional intuitive explanations or visual aids.
4. Comparison to Baselines: While the paper compares BAMS to random sampling and the method of Gardner et al., additional comparisons to other state-of-the-art active learning or model selection techniques (e.g., query-by-committee) would strengthen the evaluation.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Expand the experimental validation to include a more diverse dataset, potentially with real-world NIHL cases, to better assess generalizability.
2. Investigate the robustness of the method to variations in prior distributions and hyperparameter settings.
3. Simplify the presentation of technical details where possible, and include more visualizations to aid understanding.
4. Provide a more comprehensive comparison to alternative active learning and model selection approaches.
Recommendation:
This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of active learning and its application in medical diagnostics. Despite some limitations in scope and clarity, the novelty, technical rigor, and practical relevance of the proposed method make it a strong candidate for acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and validation concerns. 
Pros for Acceptance:
- Innovative approach to active model selection.
- Strong empirical results with real-world applicability.
- Efficient and computationally feasible framework.
Cons for Rejection:
- Limited scale of validation.
- Dense presentation may hinder accessibility.
Overall Rating: 8/10
