The paper addresses the problem of structured estimation using atomic norms and provides general bounds for key geometric measuresâ€”Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, Gaussian width of the spherical cap induced by the tangent cone, and restricted norm compatibility constants. These measures are critical for analyzing the recovery guarantees of Dantzig-type estimators. The authors propose novel upper bounds for these measures that rely on simple properties of the atomic norm, and they establish the tightness of these bounds by deriving corresponding lower bounds. The paper also demonstrates the application of these results to specific atomic norms, such as the k-support norm, for which prior analyses were incomplete.
Strengths:
1. Novel Contributions: The paper provides a systematic framework for bounding geometric measures associated with atomic norms, which is a significant contribution to the field of structured estimation. The results are general and applicable to a wide range of norms, including non-decomposable ones.
2. Tightness of Bounds: The authors not only derive upper bounds but also establish their tightness by providing lower bounds, enhancing the practical utility of the results.
3. Practical Insights: The application to the k-support norm is particularly well-executed, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance on the choice of parameters (e.g., the value of k).
4. Clarity of Methodology: The decomposition-based approach for bounding the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball is elegant and computationally efficient. The use of a single subgradient to bound other measures is a notable simplification.
5. Relevance: The work builds on and extends prior research in compressed sensing and structured sparsity, addressing gaps in the literature, particularly for non-decomposable norms.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the technical content is rigorous, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced concepts in geometric analysis and atomic norms. For example, the derivations and proofs could benefit from additional intuition and illustrative examples.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the theoretical bounds. While the focus is on theoretical contributions, numerical simulations demonstrating the tightness of the bounds or their practical implications would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed bounds or scenarios where the results may not apply. For instance, the assumptions about the invariance of norms under sign changes may restrict the applicability of the results.
4. Comparison with Existing Work: Although the paper references prior work, a more detailed comparison of the proposed bounds with existing results (e.g., for specific norms like L1 or OWL) would provide additional context and highlight the novelty more effectively.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the understanding of geometric measures in structured estimation.
- The results are general and applicable to a broad class of atomic norms, including those not well-studied in prior work.
- The application to the k-support norm addresses an important gap in the literature and provides actionable insights for practitioners.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the practical impact of the results.
- The dense presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
- The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of its limitations and a stronger comparison with prior work.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The theoretical contributions are strong and relevant to the NIPS community, but the paper would benefit from additional clarity, empirical validation, and a more detailed discussion of its limitations and comparisons with existing work.
