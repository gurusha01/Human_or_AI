The paper presents a novel data-driven optimal control framework derived from the path integral (PI) control approach, which addresses key limitations of existing PI-related methods. The authors propose an iterative forward-backward optimization scheme that analytically computes control laws without requiring a priori policy parameterization. By leveraging a probabilistic representation of learned dynamics, the method achieves significant sample efficiency and generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods in experiments.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Innovation: The paper introduces a forward-backward optimization scheme that departs from traditional forward-sampling-based PI methods. This approach enables analytic computation of control laws and adapts control cost weights based on explicit uncertainty, which is a notable generalization over prior work.
2. Sample Efficiency: The proposed method demonstrates superior sample efficiency compared to PILCO and PDDP in the experiments, which is critical for real-world applications where data collection is expensive.
3. Generalizability: The compositionality theory is effectively utilized to generalize learned controllers to new tasks without re-sampling, a feature not supported by many existing methods.
4. Theoretical Contributions: The authors extend PI control theory to uncertain systems and derive a linear Chapman-Kolmogorov PDE, providing a solid theoretical foundation for their approach.
5. Experimental Validation: The paper includes experiments on three challenging RL tasks (cart-pole, double pendulum, and PUMA-560 robotic arm), demonstrating the method's efficiency, computational feasibility, and generalizability.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the dense mathematical derivations and lack of intuitive explanations may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. Simplifying some sections or providing visual aids could improve clarity.
2. Assumptions: The method assumes partial knowledge of the control matrix \( G \), which may limit applicability to systems where such information is unavailable. The authors acknowledge this but do not provide a clear pathway for addressing this limitation.
3. Computational Complexity: Although the method is more computationally efficient than PILCO, it is more expensive than PDDP due to the global optimization approach. This trade-off is not fully explored in terms of scalability to higher-dimensional systems.
4. Limited Real-World Validation: The experiments are conducted in simulated environments, and the applicability to real-world systems is not demonstrated. Addressing uncertainty in \( G \) and testing on physical systems would strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution by combining PI control theory with probabilistic model-based RL.
- It addresses critical challenges in sample efficiency and generalizability, which are highly relevant to the NeurIPS community.
- The experimental results are compelling, showing clear advantages over state-of-the-art methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on partial knowledge of \( G \) and the lack of real-world experiments limit the immediate applicability of the method.
- The dense presentation of mathematical details may reduce the paper's accessibility to a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper presents a novel and impactful contribution to optimal control and reinforcement learning, with strong experimental results and theoretical underpinnings. Addressing clarity issues and providing additional insights into real-world applicability would further enhance its impact.
