The problem of testing membership of an unknown distribution to the sets of monotone, log-concave, unimodal, and monotone hazard rate distributions over [n] (or [n]^d, for monotonicity) is considered. The approach to each problem follows a nice general framework -- first, an estimate q of the unknown distribution p is constructed, which effectively assumes that p belongs to the class being considered to reduce sample complexity. A modified chi-squared test is then applied to test whether p and q are close. The estimators necessary to achieve the first step are novel and unique to each class of distributions considered.
This two step procedure avoids the need for obvious alternatives such as testing equality between p and, say, a net over the class in question, which incurs large computational and statistical costs. The proposed approach gives efficient algorithms with improved (and optimal) sample complexities.
It is perhaps somewhat noteworthy that not only are the (optimal) rates for each of the four classes identical (in the case d=1, for monotone distributions), but that the construction used in the matching lower bound for each problem is identical.
 Including some definitions would improve clarity for readers not familiar with this particular subject, e.g. the partial order in the definition of monotone distributions over the hypergrid. (Also, line 161 promises definitions of the distances in the appendix, which seem to be missing.) The paper makes significant contributions to testing shape-constrained discrete distributions.
