The paper considers matrix completion in a setting where the row and column variables lie on graphs. The authors
develop a scalable alternating least squares algorithm. Further, they show that the regularizer in the optimization problem can be seen as a generalized form of weighted nuclear norm, and derive statistical consistency guarantees for the low rank matrix estimators. Experiments comparing to leading methods on a movie ratings data set shows their method achieving lowest RMSE. Further, their ALS algorithm is shown to scale orders of magnitude better than SGD.
a. The description of how the row/column graphs are generated from the movielens dataset is vague in the paper; please clarify.
b. Sections 5 and 5.1 were difficult to follow. Terms such as "spikiness" are not defined, but it's key to following the main theoretical result and the comparison to standard matrix completion.
c. why is there no RMSE table for the 3 large datasets? from Fig.2 it's unclear if RMSE of GRALS is equal/poorer than the other methods (it's clear that GRALS scales better) The optimization problem considered in this paper -- graph-structed matrix factorization with partial observations -- appears to be novel and is likely to be of significant interest to the collaborative filtering community. The solution is based on weighted norm minimization (similar to work in Srebro and Salakhutdinov (2010)). The alternating least squares algorithm developed by the authors is convincingly shown to be much more efficient than SGD, and performs better than leading methods that include side information. However, I found the writing in key sections difficult to follow, and I haven't checked proofs.
