This work introduces a new criterion for sequential experimental design with the goal of model selection. The author(s) applies this algorithm to an audiometric experiment consisting of detecting noise-induced hearing loss. The experiment produces good results.
Quality and clarity: This paper is very clear and very well written. It nicely outlines the steps necessary in approximating model evidence, hyperparameter posterior and predictive distributions. Minor points: on line 134, X* is mentioned before it is defined (actually, I don't believe it is ever defined) and on line 342, "exes" -> "crosses."
Originality: The author(s)'s work applies a trick similar to that of [12], using the symmetry of mutual information to turn an intractable quantity into a one-dimensional intractable quantity that can be approximated relatively easy. They apply this technique to the problem of active model selection, which is novel.
Significance: The problem of model selection is obviously an important one. The particular application discussed in the paper of selecting among different GP priors is a prime example. Unfortunately, the example provided was simple and included only selecting among prior means and not the covariance kernel, which is often the more difficult to choose. In addition, the first model (healthy) is included in the NIHL model (as d -> 0). Therefore it begs the question of whether one could simply use the more complex model and infer the hyperparameters, and then examine the magnitude of d and/or w. Though I do not doubt the potential applications of this method, I do question how convincing this particular one is.
Minor points: - Section 3: it is worth at least mentioning the hyperparameter marginalization via MCMC technique around equation (7). This is a very nice paper about a Bayesian method for active model selection. The techniques used in the method are explained at a very appropriate level of detail with useful references for further reading. Though compelling, in my opinion, the application presented failed to illustrate the strength of the method due to concerns I raise under the "significance" heading below.
