The paper studies the problem of training classifiers that maximize the F-measure in the online setting, which is defined as the ratio of two linear functions and thus, unlike the traditional loss functions, is non-decomposable. Most existing algorithmic approaches of optimizing F-measure are in the batch setting and solve the problem by finding the optimal threshold of probabilistic classifiers on a validation set. This paper proposes an online learning algorithm to find the optimal threshold and proof consistency results under various assumptions. This authors also include comprehensive experiments (including the appendix) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.
 Generally, the paper is well written and I like the presentation of the proof the Theorem 3. The theoretical results seem to be solid and experimental section is fairly convincing.
 This is not my area of expertise, so I'm less certain about the novelty of the technical contribution comparing to the existing literature on F-measure maximization. That been said, I like that this paper has a balanced combination of theory/algorithm/experiments.
 Minor comments:
 In the Discussion section (Section 6), it would be nice to expand the comparisons with [9]. In terms of AUC maximization in the online setting, there are two relevant papers on the analysis of the generalization performance.

  This paper proposes an online learning algorithm to optimize the F-measure with a nice combination of theory, algorithms and experiments.
