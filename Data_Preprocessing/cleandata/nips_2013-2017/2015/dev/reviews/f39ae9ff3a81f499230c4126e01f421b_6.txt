Multinomial distribution is widely used in topic modeling and other applications in machine learning community, due to its simplicity and conjugate property. This paper proposes a novel distribution using a fixed-length Poisson Markov random field. With this new distribution, the authors can capture the dependencies among words in a topic model.
 Topic model is a good application for this distribution as dependencies among words are needed for better interpretation. I think the authors motivated the work well and make the paper easy to follow. The results shows the improved perplexity and positive edges captured many common phrases (some are not clear: tests+test)
Some simple analysis on the number of parameters and learning curve would be interesting to help reader understand the complexity of this model. This paper proposes a novel distribution, which assigns probability as Multinomial to a fixed-length vector, but can model the dependences among items. The paper is well motivated with topic modeling application and experiments show the improvement.
