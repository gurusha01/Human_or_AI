Typically, SBMs require a number of communities to be specified beforehand.
The proposed algorithms for SBM does not require the information, but achieve an optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs.
The authors prove accuracies and conditions for partial and exact recoveries.
 I need to be honest that I cannot fully follow the meaning of theorems and therefore cannot fully understand the contributions of the paper.
I'm working on community clustering in a private company thus my viewpoint is weighed on a practical side for engineers.
 Theorem 3 and 4: What are the improvements from the known results? It is very helpful if you can provide intuitive explanations for readers unfamiliar for the SBM theories (like me).
 Line 228: You need to know"the relative sizes of communities", don't you?
 I think the information about "the relative sizes of communities" is difficult to determine (know) beforehand like the number of clusters. Assume a social network that typically has a long-tailed community structure. It is difficult to determine the finest or the largest size of a community.
 Line 419-420: Only one real-world data test is no enough for a proof of concept. I am rather interested in how robust the proposed algorithm is for various real networks that does not necessarily satisfy assumptions.
How about the computational cost? Works in realistic computational time for large networks?  Please find the detailed comment.
