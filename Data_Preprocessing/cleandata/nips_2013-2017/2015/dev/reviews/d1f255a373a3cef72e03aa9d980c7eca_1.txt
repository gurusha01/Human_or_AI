This paper proposes an algorithm that can optimize the F-Measure in an online fashion. To do that, it relies on an online learner to estimate the posterior which is utilized at each updating. The algorithm has been proved theoretically to be able to converge to the optimal threshold computed based on batch learning. Empirical evaluation shows consistent results. The experimental results on sensitivity towards three different online learners are shown. The paper is clearly presented and organized. Also, the proposed algorithm can be of practical use. This paper proposes an algorithm that can optimize the F-Measure in an online fashion. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated both theoretically and empirically with promising results.
