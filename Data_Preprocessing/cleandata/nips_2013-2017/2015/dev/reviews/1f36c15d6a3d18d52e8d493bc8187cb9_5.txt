This paper derives a new method and new bounds for testing whether a distribution belongs to a certain class (eg monotone, log-concave, uni-modal) distribution. The authors provide both upper and lower bounds for the classes they consider (showing that their upper bounds are essentially tight). They also provide some simulations on synthetic data for their algorithm.
The paper is generally well written and the results seem correct. The authors also provide adequate comparisons with earlier bounds and discuss carefully in which regimes their result provides a better rate.
My main concern about this work is that it only considers discrete distributions. It would be nice if the authors could provide some motivational discussion on whether the actual testing problems they consider occur in practice. Further it would be nice to see some discussion on whether the results are extendable to non-discrete distribution (maybe under sone assumptions on the density?).
Minor comments: The authors could make a stronger effort to make it a self contained read. Eg, on page 3 they refer the reader to the appendix for some basic definitions, but those definitions are not in the appendix.
