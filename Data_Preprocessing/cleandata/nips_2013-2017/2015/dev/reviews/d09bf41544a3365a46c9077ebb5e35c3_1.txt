Summary: The authors introduce a novel approach for inferring hidden physical properties of objects (mass and friction), which also allows the system to make subsequent predictions that depend on these properties. They use a black-box generative model (a physics simulator), to perform sampling-based inference, and leverage a tracking algorithm to transform the data into more suitable latent variables (and reduce its dimensionality) as well as a deep model to improve the sampler. The authors assume priors over the hidden physical properties, and make point estimates of the geometry and velocities of objects using a tracking algorithm, which comprise a full specification of the scene that can be input to a physics engine to generate simulated velocities. These simulated velocities then support inference of the hidden properties within an MCMC sampler: the properties' values are proposed and their consequent simulated velocities are generated, which are then scored against the estimated velocities, similar to ABC. A deep network can be trained as a recognition model, from the inferences of the generative model, and also from the Physics 101 dataset directly. Its predictions of the mass and friction can be used to initialize the MCMC sampler. The authors compare performance to a convnet and to various human judgments.
Quality: Good. The approach is well-executed, and provides good performance on an interesting task.
Clarity: The writing is very clear. Few (if any) typos, easy to understand.
Originality: I'm not aware of any competing approach to this problem, and the authors implement a convnet ("oracle" model) to compare their system against.
Significance: This work is strong, and should be of interest to both machine learning and computer vision.
Suggestions: - The outcome prediction analysis (pgs 6-7) should include another comparison besides the error bar graph, such as correlations between human, POM, and uniform, because the summary "Mean" bars in Figure 5 give a misleading impression that human and POM are very similar, despite their patterns of errors being fairly different. - Section 4 says that after inferring physical properties, the system can be applied to novel settings, such as predicting buoyancy, which the authors say will be demoed in Section 6. There is no more talk of buoyancy, however, so this statement should be removed. The paper should be accepted because it offers a novel amalgam of deep learning and rich generative models to tackle a complex, real-world physical reasoning problem. The writing is clear, the technical work is well-executed, and the performance is thoroughly tested in various ways.
