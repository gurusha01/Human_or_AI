The paper considers the problem of designing revenue-maximizing auctions given samples from the "valuation distribution" F of the users.
 The paper shows an upper bound on the number of samples required to obtain an auction whose performance is close to an optimal auction.
The key ingredient is to design a class of auctions Ct, called t-level auctions. As t grows one of the auctios in Ct is close to the optimal auction. This is interesting since t-level functions have only n*t free parameters, and hence applying basic learning theoretic arguments, the authors provide an upper bound on the number of samples required to learn a good auction. While the existence of such auctions are interesting to a game-theoretic audience, I am slightly skeptical about the interest it can generate in NIPS. I think there are a number of interesting problems such as the one the authors consider here at the intersection of learning and game theory, however, they need to make a better case, for example with either faster algorithms, or showing some special classes of distributions F for which learning the auction is possible much faster, and or with much fewer samples. Finally, it would be interesting to know what kind of lower bounds exist on the number of samples required to learn a near-optimal auction. In particular, since in many learning problems the number of samples is close to the logarithm of the covering number, it would be interesting to see if some such results hold in this setting.
 The paper is well written, although a little more motivation might be helpful for someone not completely knowledgeable about the auction theory literature.  The main contribution is showing that there exist a class of auctions C1< C2< ... such that as t grows Ct contains an auction that is nearly optimal. Even though i like this result, the learning arguments are straight-forward, and are existential (computationally hard). I also believe the results are slightly incremental in that sense. One plus of this paper at nips could be introducing these interesting problems in algorithmic game theory to the learning community in a learning framework.
