This is a paper on the line of combining lifted and approximate
inference. In this case the two contributions are: estimates of the computional effort , and using an a Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling. The text is well written, but assumes good understanding of previous work, namely ref [9] comes up all the time. I'd also like some more on RaoBlackwell. Experimentsl evslustion is weak.
46-47 I understand the concept of inference unaware, but the idea that being aware of inference means having an idea of how much computation ahead is strange for me, because usually we just can't.
54 - a traditional and-or tree is not a "compact"representation. What do you by "pseudotree"? Folded tree?
57 - ok, I got
the idea, but why do you call it schematic?
81-90 there is an and/or tree, which is a spanning tree for a graph that is the original graphical model, there is a mysterious pseudo-tree, there is anther final graph, I think I understnd but please try to define precisely what is what.
119 ->new MLNs ? what do you define as a MLN?
148-160 -> these are complex rules, should have a minimal description. Also explain decomposer,just citing [9] is not enough?
176 - optimal? Is there an optimal?
212 "The overall complexity of depends:"
missing word
346 - which in turn decreases the 347 accuracy because fewer samples are gener- 348 ated.
 -> because time budget is fixed?
Sec 6 You previously said: "We demonstrate experimentally that it vastly improves the accuracy of estimation on several real-world datasets." Is this a valid conclusion from your results?
  This is a paper on the line of combining lifted and approximateinference. In this case the two contributions are: estimates of the computional effort, and using an a Rao-Blackwellised lifted importance sampling. The paper focus on the first, although I think the second quite interesting too. In general it looks like solid, robust work, but I don't see how the experimental results suppport the claims.
