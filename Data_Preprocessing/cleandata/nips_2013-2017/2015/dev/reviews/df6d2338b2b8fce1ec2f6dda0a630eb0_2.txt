This paper gives an iterative procedure to solve the Adaptive Stochastic Optimization problem. The problem defined by an objective function f, and the paper develops conditions on the function that make the problem amenable to their solution approach (recursive adaptive convergence).
Quality: The ASO problem is described as a generalization of POMDP and conditions on the solution technique are given in simulation. The choice of baseline algorithms makes sense, but the paper would be much stronger if it the approach was compared more directly to similar approaches, e.g. popular POMDP solutions. Since the paper is rather technical giving more practical/concrete examples of the propositions would be helpful.
 Clarity: The layout of the paper, language and flow are excellent, especially given the technical nature of the material.
Connecting the flow to specific problems is difficult. Having a running example, might make the paper easier to follow.
 Originality:
This paper seems to capitalize on theoretical developments in sub-modular function optimization and applying these results to the ASO problem. The original part comes from the particular application.
Significance: Given the generality of the setting, the results could have a significant impact.
However, the current presentation does not make a strong case for this potential. Comparing the numerical results to alternative solution techniques or more directly arguing for the applicably of the MLRB and MLB conditions would make the case of impact stronger.
 This paper gives a tractablesolution algorithm and sufficient conditions for when it's applicable for a general (and generally intractable) planning problem (ASO).
