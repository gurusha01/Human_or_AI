The authors propose a novel formulation of path integral control, where they use an exponential form of the value function, which allows them to solve the path integrals of the cost analytically, and in particular they can evaluate the path integrals backwards. This gives them the ability to optimize using a forward-backward approach where they use a GP to model the paths forward in time, and then run the backward integration to get the path costs and derivatives, and then use a numerical technique to update the controls.
 Quality: The quality of the paper is relatively high, in technical correctness. I enjoyed reading the paper and learned something new.
 I was surprised that this technique outperformed iterative PI - unless I am missing something, this is almost certainly a problem with the number of samples (10^3 for cart-pole, 10^4 for double pendulum) which seem relatively low. No doubt the new technique is more efficient, but the authors need to be careful with their baseline evaluation.
 Clarity: The major comment I have about the paper is that the authors move quickly through some key steps. In particular, the move from eqaution 7 to 8 is non-trivial, and is key to the overall paper. Similarly, the moves from the initial integral of \Psit (mid-page 5) to the final recursive form of \Phi{t+dt)\Psi_{t+dt} is even harder.
 Originality: The use of a GP for the model is not new, but the forward-backward is, additionally the ability to use the GP to infer the integral for a changed value function is at least new to me.
 Significance: An interesting and substantial improvement to existing path integral methods.
 Please number all equations -- I understand there is a school of thought that equations should only be numbered if they are referenced in the text, but that stylistic conceit creates major problems when others want to refer to the equations outside the text of the paper, either in reviews (like this one), in other papers referencing this one, or in discussion.  The authors have proposed a novel method that advances the state of the art. Overall a good paper, although not easy to read in places. This is largely due to page limitations so I can't hold the authors too much to blame for this.
