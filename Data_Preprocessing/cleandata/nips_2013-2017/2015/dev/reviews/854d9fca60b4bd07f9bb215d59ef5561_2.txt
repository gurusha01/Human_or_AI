Quality The paper appears to be of high quality and contains a substantial theoretical advance.
Clarity The paper presentation is clear.
Originality The work is original.
Significance This work is likely of significance to the community. The paper considers the problem of impact of label order in classifier chain (CC) multi-label classification and proposes two algorithms CC-DP and CC-Greedy which in effect optimize this order. In extensive experiments, the algorithms appear to outperform other state of the art algorithms. The paper significantly contributes to understanding the impact of label order in the CC approach.
