This paper is generally clear, with a few exceptions as noted below.
The paper extends current work in a potentially useful way, although the experiments used to illustrate the method are fairly small and simple.
The theoretical work relates this work to prior work (prop 2), demonstrates applicability to a new domain (prop 1 and 3), and analyzes the algorithm.
The usefulness of the algorithm analysis is questionable (e.g. Thm 1 and 2).
The resulting bound grows with the square of the log of the number of actions (where this is actually the number of possible locations on the path, as each action is "visit location x") as compared to the optimal cost.
This does not seem especially tight for application with any reasonable-sized problem.
A couple of clarity issues: line 110, should this inequality be reversed as A is a subset of B? line 125, what are the conditions for termination of a policy and how is that determined in practice? line between 151 and 152, I think some mistakes in notation line 216, what are alignment assumptions? experiments: the labels on the plots don't match those in the text.
The captions should be more informative and not repeat information already on the plots (Gibbs error)  This paper introduces an extension to submodular optimization that extends the method to apply to more than sets.The contributions include the development and analysis of two conditions that allow this, as well as introducing an algorithm to solve problems meeting these conditions.These contributions appear novel, well justified, and of interest to the community.
