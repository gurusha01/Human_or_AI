The authors have developed a new algorithm for multi-label classification. They have supplied theoretical analysis. They have also supplied empirical analysis in which they have improved the state of the art. The paper is well motivated and clearly written. The contents of the paper is quite original. Further the proposed algorithm is not theoretically interesting but also practically interesting.
In the future, I would like to see the results of the method on large scale datasets. The authors have developed a new algorithm for multi-label classification. They have supplied theoretical analysis. They have also supplied empirical analysis in which they have improved the state of the art. I suggest acceptance of the paper.
