Quality:
This is a very nice paper - an elegant approach to a long studied problem. The methodology is clear, its motivations are well founded and experiments are well performed. There is a good amount of analysis (right most columns of Figure 2 are especially interesting) but I would want a bit more analysis for the relationship between the variance of estimators and the error at specific locations. Though I would expect these to be highly correlated, it does not seem that way in the figures.
Clarity:
The paper is very clearly written, easy to follow and uses notation well. Minor comments about this - I would use bold face characters for all properties which are vectors (such as chromaticity, pixels etc.). This would make the distinction between scalars and vectors easier. Additionally, some important equations are inline - line 158, 216 and line 237 certainly deserve their own numbered equation (or at least a clearer separation). In line 308, "it's" should be "its".
Originality:
An original approach to an old problem.
Significance:
An old and well studied problem which is interesting for a large part of the vision community. I'm not sure NIPS is an ideal audience for this work, but in terms of quality, it is certainly suitable. This paper proposes a method for color constancy in image by learning about the conditional chromaticity distribution, conditioned on pixel luminance. This is done by simply modeling the empirical histograms in a training set, as well as globally optimizing the histograms over the training set using gradient descent on a cost function. Surprisingly enough, the luminance allows for informative predictions for the illumination chromaticity (up to the usual scaling constants) even when pixels are treated as independent. The method is quite fast to compute and results are pleasing as well as numerically impressive.
