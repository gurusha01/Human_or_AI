The paper deals with the construction of optimal classifier chains for multi-label classification. The first part of the paper provides a bound on the error of the classifer chain in terms of the margins over the labels. This result is used in the second part to derive a DP and greedy algorithm. The experimental section shows that that the DP approach has the best results in 5 out of 8 datasets and the greedy approach in 1.
Quality: The bound on error involves interesting ideas. Hence the paper scores high on quality.
Clarity: The exposition is clear. The authors should address the following questions.
1. The greedy approach performs better than DP on 2 out of 8 datasets. Some explanation will be helpful. 2. Comparison of actual runtimes of greedy vs DP will help.
The paper has some typos. For example, line 313 should read "\gamma^1_i represents ..."
Orginality: High
Significance: The techniques used in the paper have theoretical significance. I have not seen many people using multilabel classification in practice.  The paper has strong theoretical content which is also empirically validated.
