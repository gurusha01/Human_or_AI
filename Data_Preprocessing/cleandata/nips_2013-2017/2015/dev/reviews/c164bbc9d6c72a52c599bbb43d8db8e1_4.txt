This paper essentially extends Neterov's first acceleration technique for proximal point algorithms, considering inexact solutions of subproblems. Nontrivial modifications to exiting analyses were made to allow for controlled inexactness, so that global convergence rate can be derived depending on it.
The paper presents technical ideas with clarity and high quality. As far as I know, this work is original, which brings a new unified framework and understanding for accelerating first order methods with inexact inner solvers.
 Personally, it was a bit disappointing to see in Thm 3.3 that the amount of inexactness has to decrease in a rapid rate as global iterations go on, but it is also expected.
  This paper provides a unified acceleration framework and analysis for first-order optimization methods, considering carefully of inexactness of solving subproblems and showing its effect on convergence rate. Although I didn't check all the proofs, the theory looks solid and provides deeper understanding of the acclaimed acceleration techniques.
