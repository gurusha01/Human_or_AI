Quality: - This paper is technically sound and the supplemental file contains the detailed proofs and extensive experiments.
The discussion in Session 6 is interesting
and insightful, especially the argument that F-measure itself is an aggregate measure which thus makes no sense to analyze the regret bound in general online learning.
 - In line 196-197, although $\hat{h}(\tau)$ is an unbiased estimate of $h(\tau)$, what is the variance of $\hat{h}(\tau)$ w.r.t. the data distribution? Alternatively, it is suggested to add some discussions on other estimated functions of $h(\tau)$. - Moreover, in line 268-269, it is stated that the noisy estimation of $h(.)$ depends on the labels. How can the decomposition step help to handle this undesired effect?
- In line 286, it is better to clarify the assumptions that are required on the online learner.
 Clarity: - This paper is well written and clearly organized, although there are still some minor issues.
The overall idea of this paper is easy to follow. - For example, the second "-" sign in Eq.(5) should be a "+" sign.
 - There seems to be an error in the most right hand side of Eq.(1).
- In line 155, what does "P" above the arrow denote? It should be clarified first before its usage. - In line 65-66, "positive a negative" should be " positive and negative". - In line 7 of the pseudo-code, it is better to add some notes that $at$ and $bt$ can be calculated by Eq.(9). - In line 251-252, what do $F_t$-measurable and filtration mean? It is better to add more explanation on them. - In line 296, " conference rate" may be " convergence rate".
Originality: In this paper, the authors study the online optimization problem of a non-decomposable metric, the F-score, which is less explored in the community. The reviewer thinks the idea in this paper is novel.
Significance: Since there are still several nice properties of the four fundamental quantities (true/false positive/negative rate), more exploration based on this paper is expected. Moreover, since F-score function is neither convex nor concave and has the decomposition nature, there are still more challenging open problems on F-measure optimization. The reviewer thinks this paper can raise further research interest in the online learning community. In this paper, the authors propose an online algorithm to threshold a given classifier for the purpose of F-measure maximization and prove the convergence of the online F-scores obtained by the proposed algorithm to the optimal F-score.Extensive experiments are conducted to verify its convergence properties in the theoretical analysis.
