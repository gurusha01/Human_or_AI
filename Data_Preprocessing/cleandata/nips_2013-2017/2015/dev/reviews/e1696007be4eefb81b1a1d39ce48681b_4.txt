The authors consider sparse linear model estimation with atomic norms and provide some bounds on Gaussian widths arising in their analysis. As a special case, the authors derive bounds for l1 and ordered wighted l1 norm and provides some analysis on the recently proposed k-support norms.
The atomic norm is attractive for its generality to capture a broad class of linear inverse problems [Chandrasekaran et al, 2012 FOCM]. The present paper, however, focuses only on sparse linear models and the results, except for the recently proposed k-support norm, are already available. The proof techniques for calculating Gaussian widths are also fairly standard, although the dual norm calculation for k-support norm analysis is new.
Is this technique generalizable to other instances of atomic norm analysis, e.g., nuclear norm penalized estimation of low-rank matrices?
The paper is well-written, the proofs are clear and easy to follow.
  The paper is well-written and there is no gap in the mathematical proofs. However the scope of the problem is narrow: instead of providing analysis for general atomic norm analysis [Chandrasekaran et al, 2012 FOCM] unifying in a variety of linear inverse problems, the authors only consider sparse linear regression for which the key results are already available.
