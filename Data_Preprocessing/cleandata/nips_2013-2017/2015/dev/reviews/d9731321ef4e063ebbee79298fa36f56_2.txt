This paper presents a method for active model selection using a mutual information criterion. The main technical contribution is a way to approximate the MI criterion without having to re-fit the model for each candidate. The method is evaluated on the task of detecting noise-induced hearing loss with as few sound queries as possible.
Overall, this paper presents a promising and well thought out approach to the active model selection problem. The paper is readable and motivates the design choices well. The NIHL detection task is an interesting use of active model selection, and its introduction is a useful contribution of the paper.
One thing missing from the paper is experimental comparisons against prior approaches to active model selection, either on the NIHL task or on benchmarks where other methods have been successfully applied. In the experiment, the baseline [8] shows a pathology (focusing on fitting the more likely model) which other active model selection methods would presumably correct, so it would be interesting to see how the different approaches compare.
The NIHL task is a bit limited in that the positive examples are simulated from the model, which could lead model based methods to perform unrealistically well. This may be inevitable in the medical domain, though, and I don't immediately see a better way to set up the experiment.
 Overall, I would recommend acceptance because the paper is well written, the methods seem novel and well motivated, and the paper introduces a real-world medical task which may benefit from the proposed approach. The main thing missing is comparisons to other active model selection approaches. I'm not an expert on active learning, so I can't speak with confidence about the relationship to prior work.
