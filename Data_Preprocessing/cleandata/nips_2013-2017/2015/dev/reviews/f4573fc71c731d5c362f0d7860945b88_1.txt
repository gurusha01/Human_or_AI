The authors propose a method for incorporating underlying graph structure among users/items in a collaborative filtering setting. The novelty of this method is that it is the first method to both incorporate graph structure and deal with sparse data.
 The method itself is fairly straightforward and clearly explained. It amounts to block-coordinate ascent, solving a convex problem at each iteration. One potential methodological contribution is to solve for the the low-rank factors using conjugate-gradient methods to avoid slow matrix decompositions, but it's unclear whether this is the first time such an approach was proposed.
Connections are drawn to the nuclear norm minimization of Srebro and Salakhutdinov (2010), and the authors show that their method is equivalent to employing a weighted atomic norm, where the weights are derived from the graph structure. This connection allows them to derive a consistency bound on recovering the true low-rank matrix. The bound is specified in terms of a quantity \alpha_^* which is shown empirically to be much smaller for realistic matrices than the corresponding bound for matrix completion.
Finally, the method is validated on three real datasets and is shown to outperform standard matrix completion in that it is able to achieve a given RMSE in much less time.
The work is of high quality and clearly explained. I amn less confident of its originality but if this is indeed the first time the conjugate-gradient method embedded in the coordinate-ascent scheme was emplyed in a collaborative filtering setting, then this is a reasonably novel contribution. Overall, this seems to be a signficiant advancement in how further exploiting known structure in features to improve collaborative filtering models.
 This paper represents a substantial contribution to the growing body of work around leveraging underlying structure among users/items for collaborative filtering. The paper is well-written and the contributions are both theoretical (consistency bounds in terms of a quantity that is empirically verified to be tighter) and practical in nature (faster method by orders of magnitude, superior performance on real data sets).
