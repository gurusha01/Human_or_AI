The paper introduces an approach to estimate the partition function when doing lifted inference in statistical relational models. The paper is well written and clear and proposes a lifted version of the And/Or search space framework that, to the best of my knowledge, is novel.
In general, the ideas presented in the paper are sound.
 Nevertheless, the evaluation is a bit short and it fails to compare their approach to other approximations of the partition function. The authors do not include an analysis of the bounds of the approximation and a study of how it scales in general.
It is possible that their lifted And/Or framework can provide good reductions in the complexity of inference but their evaluation and results are too limited to tell. Nevertheless, this paper does introduce a novel algorithm that may prove useful for the NIPS community interested in lifted inference.
