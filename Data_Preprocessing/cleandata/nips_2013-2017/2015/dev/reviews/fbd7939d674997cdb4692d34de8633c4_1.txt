The paper is concerned with design of near optimal auction mechanisms where optimality is measured with respect to revenue. Auction theory has characterized these auctions as ones that assign the object to the bidder with highest virtual valuation. Nevertheless, this requires knowledge of the distribution Fi from which valuation vi is drawn from. Moreover, even with this knowledge the payment rule for these auctions can be extremely complicated to be used in practice. Instead, the authors propose a simple family of auctions dubbed t-level auctions which admit a simple payment rule. Moreover, in order to deal with the problem of not knowing
F_i, the authors propose doing empirical revenue maximization over this family of auctions.
 The main contribution of this work is showing that by letting t = O(\frac{1}{\eps})
and with a sample size in O(1/\eps^3), the empirical revenue maximizing t-level auction achieves revenue that is (1 - \eps)-optimal.
 The paper introduces an interesting connection between learning theory and auction theory. Recently this connection has been explored by several people and the authors provide a good review of this previous work. The paper is in general well written and although the concepts and proofs are basic for both machine learning and auction theory, it is an interesting connection that I believe should be explored more by the learning community.
 Here are some comments to improve the paper: (1) The explanation on pseudo-dimension is too long. Given that this a learning conference I believe that a simple reference to the definition is enough as most people know what this is.
(2) The explanation of equivalence classes is not entirely clear to me. Why most the levels induce the same permuation? It seems that the second condition is good enough.
(3) In the proof of lemma 3.5 I believe you mean \phi \in [0, \alpha] (4) It would be good to put in the appendix the reasoning behind equation (3) since the fact that expected revenue equals expected allocation of virtual valuations might not be a standard fact in the learning community.
 (5) First paragraph of the appendix : " bounded case, following ideas from This... " I am sure this sentence shouldn't be here.  This paper presents an interesting approach to the study of optimal mechanism design via the use of machine learning techniques.Results are correct and present an interesting connection between auction theory and machine learning.
