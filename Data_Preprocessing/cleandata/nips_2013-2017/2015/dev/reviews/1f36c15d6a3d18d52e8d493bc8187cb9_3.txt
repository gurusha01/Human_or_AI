It seems to be perfect (I did not understand the details, to be honest). I am wondering why the tester is good only for monotonic, log-concave, unimodal, and monotonic hazard rate. It would be pleasing to explain why.  Considering a novel use of the chi square statistic, the paper constructs a sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for class C and epsilon.
