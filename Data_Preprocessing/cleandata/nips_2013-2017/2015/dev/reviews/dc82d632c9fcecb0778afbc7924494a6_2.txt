The paper introduces lifted and/or schematics, which are an abstract representation of the PTP search space. Analyzing the schematic lets us quantify the size of the search space. This is of independent theoretical interest (although the theory is not quite there yet to provide deep insights), and is practically useful in the context of Rao-Blackwellized importance sampling.
I believe this type of work is important; we still lack understanding of lifted inference algorithms. The proposed schematics are not really simple enough to provide a whole lot of insight, but it's a move in the right direction. The presentation is okay, although I cannot verify many of the technical points with the time available to me.
Given that this is a theoretical paper, I wonder how powerful the framework is in terms of liftability. Can these schematics capture all known classes of models that are domain-liftable?
The paper misses the opportunity to relate to other similar techniques.
How are dtrees (used in recursive conditioning and knowledge compilation) related to and/or schematics?
How are first-order NNF circuits related to lifted and/or schematics? They look very similar, with counting nodes having a single child, which induces a summation when evaluated, and so on. There is some work on the complexity of evaluating partition functions from first-order NNF circuits, where the result is that it is exponential in the number of nested counting operations (existential quantifiers). This result seems related to the analysis in Section 4.
How does this relate to the first-order decomposition trees of Taghipour et al.? The footnote on page 3 says that these are not as tight: I would expect more details here (and perhaps an example of where the complexity differs).
I like the importance sampling algorithm that uses the theory in a meaningful way. It's very convincing. I know these experiments are preliminary, but I would still like more details on the setup. For example, I do not believe that 10% evidence on webkb leaves you with any symmetries to exploit. I suspect that the evidence predicates were chosen to maximize the remaining symmetries (only evidence on page class, not on links?). It would be good to clarify.
Typos: The thetai on line 105 should be a ti. With exchangeable variables on line 171, you mean exchangeable constants (the random variables after shattering are not fully exchangeable in general). Line 212: of depends.
  This is good work on a very hard problem. The theoretical analysis is very difficult to follow but makes sense at a high level, when you know the lifted inference literature. The sampling application is cute and makes the theory immediately useful.
