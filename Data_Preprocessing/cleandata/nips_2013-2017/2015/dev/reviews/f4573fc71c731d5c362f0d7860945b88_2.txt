Paper 1260 tackles the problem of matrix completion with side information represented as a graph. The authors claim that this is a general framework in that the side information can come from many different kinds of sources. Major contributions of this paper are scalable learning algorithm for matrix completition with graph structures, connecting it to existing works in matrix factorization literature, and verifying the proposed method theoretically as well as experimentally.
As the authors claim, this problem is widely applicable such as recommendation systems with social network information. Considering the size of such dataset, it is important to bulid a scalable algorithm as the authors proposed.
This paper is well-structured and well-written. It is good to have both theoretical analysis of consistency and experiments with real data. Also, it is useful to connect the proposed method in the context of wider convex optimization and noisy matrix approximation.
Regarding the experiment (Section 6): some baselines in Table 1 are too simple; no one might be interested in comparison with Global/User/Movie mean. I suggest comparing against more recent, state-of-the-art methods such as
Salakhutdinov and Mnih, Probabilistic Matrix Factorization [NIPS 2008], Mackey et al., Divide-and-Conquer Matrix Factorization [NIPS 2011], Lee et al., Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation [ICML 2013].
It is impressive that the proposed method runs in O(10^3) seconds with dataset in Table 2. However, to claim scalability, I recommend running the algorithm on larger dataset, such as Netflix or Yahoo Music. This way it is also possible comparing RMSE score with other methods as well.
Minor comments: 1) Why Figure 1 and Figure 2 have different format of x-axis? I recommend using format of Figure 2 (10^1, 10^2, ...) instead of plotting log(time) directly. Log-scale without specifying base is ambiguous. 2) Citations are not in NIPS format.  This paper presents GRALS, an efficient way of optimizing graph-regularized matrix completion problem. With some minor issues with experiments, I see this paper is generally well-written and clear.
