[light review] The authors might be interested in the paper "Achieving optimal misclassification proportion in the stochastic blockmodel" http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03772, and also "minimax rates of community detection in stochastic blockmodels" http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05313 [light review] Gives efficient algorithm to achieve optimal classification rate in stochastic blockmodel, this is currently an active area of research with many deep results. However, the paper is not very readable. There isn't even a clear description of the algorithms, although there might be more in the supplemental material. It feels like only minimal effort was spent converting a long paper into a shorter one.
