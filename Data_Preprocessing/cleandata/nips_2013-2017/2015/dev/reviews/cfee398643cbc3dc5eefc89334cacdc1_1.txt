This paper seems to provide new and deep results on recovering the cluster structure in the stochastic block model even if the number of clusters is unknown. However, once again, a possibly very good paper is impaired by quite bad writing (hence the 7 on QS). For instance, the notations needed to understand the results recalled in Section 1.1 are introduced in Section 2.1. Why would anyone do that? In addition the paper comes with 47 pages of supplementary material which shows that the NIPS submission is a summary of a full journal paper. I'm not sure NIPS is the correct venue for such submission, especially considering that it's in my opinion impossible to reconstruct the algorithms proposed in the paper based on the vague description it contains. One has to rely on the supplementary material to understand the algorithm.  Probably a very good paper, but badly written and not very adapted to the NIPS format (47 pages of supplementary material!).
