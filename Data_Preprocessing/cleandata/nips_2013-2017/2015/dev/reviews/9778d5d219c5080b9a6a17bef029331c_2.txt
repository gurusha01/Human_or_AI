This is a well conducted study, with impressive results, summarized in an overall well written paper.

I hope that the authors make their code available online should the paper be accepted.
 The authors describe an illuminant estimation method based on identifying the true cromaticity of a pixel from its luminance using the fact that natural illuminant chromaticities only take on a restricted set of values because of Planck's radiation law. They estimate a luminance-to-chromaticity classifier from a training set of natural images and use that in inference to obtain a distribution over illuminants that are consistent with the observed pixels. A global estimate of the scene illuminant is computed by aggregating the distributions over illuminants over all pixels.
