This paper attempts to show that the price of anarchy bounds already achieved via the smoothness property of games extends to results on the quality of learning outcomes in Bayesian games. To achieve that, the authors interpreted a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information where there are a large population of possible participants. Once this assumption done, two important results are shown: First the outcome converges to a form of Bayesian corase correlated equilibrium when all players use a form of no-regret learning in the considered stochastic game. Second, the considedred stochatic game is also smooth if the game or the mechanism is itself smooth. These two reslts show that the price of anarchy results obtained via the smoothness technique extend to outcomes of no-regret learning in Bayesian games. This paper is very hard to read and to evaluate; it is more convenient for the "Game Theory" community than for the "NIPS" one (as its references reflect). Futhermore, it seems not be written specifically for the NIPS conference, it is just a "cut and past" from a extended version. This is reflected by the last section where the authors are saying: "In this section, we analyze the convergence..." and nothing is specified about this convergence. Some questions, remarks and suggestions: (a) why the extra material just gives proofs of Th 10 and 13? How about other Ths/Lemmas? (b) why the correlated equilibrium is this one of Forges? (c) the Th 11 is not clear, do you mean it converges to BCCE? please elaborate more on that. (d) Selfish players are hard to manage, except when we add a central entity as is the case via the correlated EQ. With this sort of equilibrium, the problem is more easy to solve (in general) but does this reflect a realistic approach?
  The main result of this paper is to show that the price of anarchy bounds achieved via the smoothness property of games or mechanisms extends to results on the quality of learning outcomes in Bayesian games. The paper is more convenient for the "Game Theory" community than for the "NIPS" one.
