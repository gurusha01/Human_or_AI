This paper describes a generative model for structured output variables by extending the variational auto-encoder to a conditional model . The authors propose a few different models and demonstrate on a pixel labelling tasks on toy MNIST data as well as real world CUB and LFW data, showing good results.
Aside from a few typos the paper is well written and clear. It is however slightly unclear how a final pixel labelling is produced, so perhaps a quick explanation illustrating the use of section 3.1 for pixel labelling would be beneficial to readers. There are some very related missing references: [Deep Structured Output Learning for Unconstrained Text Recognition, ICLR 2015] and [Learning Deep Structured Models, ICLR 2015]. Interesting paper on conditional variational autoencoder framework for pixel labelling. Other structured prediction tasks would have been interesting to see as well as a clear expose of the inference process.
