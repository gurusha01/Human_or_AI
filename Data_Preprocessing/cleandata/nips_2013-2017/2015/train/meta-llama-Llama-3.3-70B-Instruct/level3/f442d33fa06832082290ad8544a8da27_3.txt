This paper proposes an unsupervised method for training sentence vector representations using a GRU encoder-decoder model. The approach, called skip-thoughts, is based on the idea of predicting the surrounding sentences of a given sentence, similar to the skip-gram model for word vector learning. The authors evaluate their method on eight tasks, including semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, and sentiment classification, and demonstrate that their sentence representations are robust and perform well across all tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the experiments are well-done, comparing results across a large variety of different problems. The use of a large corpus of novels, the BookCorpus dataset, for training the model is a good choice, as it provides a diverse range of texts and styles. The authors also propose a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen during training, which allows them to expand their vocabulary to a million words.
One of the strengths of the paper is the evaluation of the sentence representations on multiple tasks, which demonstrates their robustness and versatility. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. The use of visualization techniques, such as t-SNE, to visualize the sentence representations is also a nice touch, as it provides a intuitive understanding of the learned representations.
However, one potential weakness of the approach is that it relies on the assumption that a sentence is a single unit of thought, which may not always be the case. The authors suggest modifying the approach to use skip-sentence vectors, which could potentially capture more nuanced relationships between sentences.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely adopted. The authors demonstrate that their sentence representations are of high quality and can be used as a generic feature extractor for a wide range of tasks.
