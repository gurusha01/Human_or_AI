This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowd responses and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use Monte Carlo tree search and progressive widening to approximate the optimal policy. The system, called LENSE, is evaluated on three tasks: named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification.
The paper's main strengths are its novel approach to handling noisy crowd responses and its ability to balance latency, cost, and accuracy objectives in a principled way. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the system's behavior and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing cost and improving accuracy compared to baseline methods.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The example provided in the paper is abstract and difficult to follow, and using a specific query example with crowd responses would improve readability. Additionally, the terminology used in Tables 2 and 3 is inconsistent, which causes confusion. The placement of the related work section is also unclear, and it would be better to place it earlier in the paper to provide context for the proposed approach.
The paper's quality is good, with a clear and well-organized structure. The authors provide sufficient details about the system's implementation and evaluation, and the results are well-presented. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the approach and potential future directions.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which combines ideas from game theory, machine learning, and crowdsourcing. The approach is significant, as it addresses the problem of creating high-accuracy classifiers with zero labeled examples, which is an important challenge in machine learning.
The paper's significance is high, as it has the potential to impact various applications, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements, which could lead to more efficient and effective systems in these areas.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of machine learning and crowdsourcing. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the system's behavior and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing cost and improving accuracy. With some minor revisions to address the areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
