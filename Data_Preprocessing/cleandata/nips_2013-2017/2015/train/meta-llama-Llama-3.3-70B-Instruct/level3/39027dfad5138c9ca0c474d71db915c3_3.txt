This paper proposes a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in serial section electron microscopy (EM) images, leveraging a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture and a recursive training framework. The authors demonstrate significant improvements in boundary detection accuracy compared to existing 2D ConvNet architectures, and provide a detailed analysis of their approach.
The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and easy to understand. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work in the field, and their proposed approach is well-justified and supported by experimental results. The use of a hybrid 2D-3D ConvNet architecture is particularly innovative, as it allows the network to leverage both 2D and 3D contextual information to improve boundary detection accuracy.
The recursive training framework, which involves training a second ConvNet on the output of a first ConvNet, is also a key contribution of the paper. This approach allows the network to refine its boundary detection predictions and improve its overall accuracy. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the feature maps produced by their network, which helps to illustrate the effectiveness of their approach.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of additional experiments and analysis on the optimization of the training objective. The authors use a fixed learning rate and momentum, and do not explore the effects of different hyperparameters on the network's performance. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed approach to other types of images, such as video.
Overall, the paper is of high quality and makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and neuroscience. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of neuronal boundary detection in EM images, which could have important implications for our understanding of neural circuits and brain function.
