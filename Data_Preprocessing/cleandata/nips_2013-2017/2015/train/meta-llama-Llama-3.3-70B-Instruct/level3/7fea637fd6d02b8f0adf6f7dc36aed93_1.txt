This paper presents a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors that belong to the general Poisson-Kingman class. The authors introduce a hybrid sampler that combines the strengths of conditional and marginal samplers, allowing for efficient inference in a wide range of models. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of running time and effective sample size.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with Bayesian nonparametrics and MCMC methods. The authors provide a detailed introduction to the Poisson-Kingman class of models and their applications, as well as a comprehensive review of existing MCMC methods for these models. The proposed hybrid sampler is carefully motivated and described, and its advantages over existing methods are clearly explained.
The empirical evaluation of the proposed method is thorough and convincing, with comparisons to existing marginal and conditional samplers on a range of models and datasets. The results demonstrate that the hybrid sampler outperforms existing methods in terms of running time and effective sample size, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
The paper also discusses the limitations of the proposed method and identifies areas for future research, such as improving the mixing of the Metropolis-Hastings step and dealing with high-dimensional datasets.
