This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation, extending existing results from sub-Gaussian to sub-exponential design matrices and noise. The authors analyze the problem of norm-regularized estimation and provide bounds on the estimation error for various norms, including the `1 and group-sparse norms. The key insight is that the dependence on Gaussian width is replaced by the exponential width of suitable sets associated with the norm.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and their contributions. The technical sections are thorough, and the proofs are well-explained. The authors also provide numerical results on synthetic and real examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
One of the main strengths of the paper is the establishment of a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which allows for the extension of existing results to the sub-exponential case. The authors also provide a sharp upper bound for the exponential width in terms of the Gaussian width, which is a significant contribution.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The authors provide a unified framework for analysis of non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems.
* The paper extends existing results from sub-Gaussian to sub-exponential design matrices and noise, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The authors provide numerical results on synthetic and real examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and their contributions.
However, there are some areas that could be improved:
* The authors could provide more discussion on the implications of their results for practice, particularly in terms of the sample complexity and estimation error bounds.
* The paper could benefit from more comparisons with existing work, particularly in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
* Some of the technical sections could be clarified, particularly for readers who are not familiar with the area.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation. The authors provide a unified framework for analysis of non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems, and their results have important implications for practice.
