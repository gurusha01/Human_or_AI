This paper proposes a novel Bayesian optimization method, Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves an exponential convergence rate without the need for auxiliary optimization and δ-cover sampling. The approach leverages the idea of considering infinitely many possible bounds, rather than relying on a single estimated bound. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a regret bound that demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
The paper is well-written, with clear mathematical descriptions and a well-organized structure. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including pseudocode, and discuss the relationship between IMGPO and previous algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMGPO in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
However, there are some concerns regarding the originality and significance of the work. The idea of using Gaussian processes for optimization is not new, and the authors could have provided more discussion on how their approach differs from existing methods. Additionally, the use of a hierarchical partitioning scheme is similar to other algorithms, such as the SOO algorithm.
The authors could have also provided more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the value of Ξmax, and how it affects the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the algorithm could be discussed in more detail, as it is an important consideration for practical applications.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a clear and concise abstract, and the introduction effectively motivates the research question. The paper is well-organized, and the mathematical descriptions are clear and easy to follow.
