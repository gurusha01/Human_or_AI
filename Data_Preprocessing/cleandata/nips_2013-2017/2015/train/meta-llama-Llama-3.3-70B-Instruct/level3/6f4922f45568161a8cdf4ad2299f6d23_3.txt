This paper introduces a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors that belong to the general Poisson-Kingman class. The proposed hybrid sampler combines the strengths of conditional and marginal samplers, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the random probability measure while reducing memory requirements.
The paper is well-written, but sometimes challenging to follow for non-experts. The authors provide a clear introduction to the background and motivation of the research, as well as a detailed explanation of the proposed methodology. However, the paper could benefit from additional explanatory tools, such as tables or figures, to compare different MCMC variants and illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.
The novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of a new compact way of representing the infinite-dimensional component of the model, which enables efficient inference. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their hybrid sampler on various Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, showing improved performance in terms of running times and effective sample size compared to existing marginal and conditional MCMC samplers.
The results are promising and deserving of publication. However, the paper could be improved with enhanced readability and correction of minor details, such as unexplained symbols. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of their approach, as well as avenues for future research.
