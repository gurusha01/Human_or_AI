This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Isotonic Regression, providing fast provable algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression under weighted `p-norms. The authors' approach, which relates isotonic regression to a graph problem and utilizes fast SDD solvers, is reasonable and interesting, with notable ideas in proof formulation.
The paper is of high quality, with clear ideas, impressive results, and overall readability. The clarity of the paper is good, with well-defined objects and a clear statement of contribution. However, some intuition behind the complexity improvement would be beneficial to further enhance the reader's understanding.
The authors provide a unified, optimization-based framework for algorithms that provably solve the Isotonic Regression problem for `p-norms, with a rigorous performance guarantee. The results are significant, improving upon previous best-known algorithms for general DAGs and special graph families.
The paper also presents algorithms for `âˆž-norms and Strict Isotonic Regression, which are based on techniques from a recent paper by Kyng et al. The authors show that these algorithms can be computed in linear time and O(mn) time, respectively, which is an improvement over previous results.
The experiments demonstrate the practical efficiency of the algorithms, with average running times plotted for `2-Isotonic Regression on DAGs. The results show that the algorithms can be implemented efficiently and are scalable.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, including the use of SDD solvers and Interior Point Methods. The authors also provide a detailed comparison to previous results, highlighting the significance of their contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide fast and efficient algorithms for Isotonic Regression, which has numerous applications in various fields, including Operations Research, Signal Processing, and Statistics. The results have the potential to impact the field, enabling researchers and practitioners to solve large-scale problems efficiently.
