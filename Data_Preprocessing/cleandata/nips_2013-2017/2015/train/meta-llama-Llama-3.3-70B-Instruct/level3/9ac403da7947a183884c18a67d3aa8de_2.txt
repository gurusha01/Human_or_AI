This paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream, extending both input and output dimensions to a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. The authors design a multimodal architecture called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Network (CRCN), which integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. The CRCN model is trained on a large dataset of blog posts with associated images, and the authors demonstrate its superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives using quantitative measures and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The paper is technically sound, with rigorous proofs and a well-organized structure. However, it lacks experiments and could benefit from more illustrative figures to improve clarity. The originality of the CRCN model is limited, as it is constructed by merging existing models, although the work is highly non-trivial. The significance of the CRCN model is moderate, with potential impact on future work, particularly if accompanied by new results on causal identifiability or inference algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel approach for retrieving sentence sequences for an image stream
* A well-designed multimodal architecture that integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model
* Superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives using quantitative measures and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Limited originality, as the CRCN model is constructed by merging existing models
* Lack of experiments and illustrative figures to improve clarity
* Moderate significance, with potential impact on future work, particularly if accompanied by new results on causal identifiability or inference algorithms
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving sentence sequences for an image stream, which is a significant extension of existing work
* The CRCN model is well-designed and demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives
* The paper is technically sound, with rigorous proofs and a well-organized structure
Arguments con acceptance:
* The originality of the CRCN model is limited, as it is constructed by merging existing models
* The paper lacks experiments and illustrative figures to improve clarity
* The significance of the CRCN model is moderate, with potential impact on future work, particularly if accompanied by new results on causal identifiability or inference algorithms
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel approach for retrieving sentence sequences for an image stream and demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives. However, the authors should address the limitations of the paper, including the lack of experiments and illustrative figures, and provide more context on the significance of the CRCN model.
