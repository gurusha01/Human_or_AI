This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational statistics and machine learning by establishing a polynomial-time bound for sampling from a log-concave density with compact support using the projected Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm. The authors provide a new and interesting approach to solving the Isotonic Regression problem for weighted `p-norms, which has numerous applications in various fields, including operations research, signal processing, and learning.
The proof of the result is correct and contains an elegant argument using the Skorohod embedding. However, there are a few minor typos and suggestions for improvement. For instance, the authors could provide more context about the need for a projector to the compact set in addition to a first-order oracle for the PLMC algorithm. Additionally, the relationship between their work and H&R could be clarified, specifically regarding the requirement of a zeroth-order oracle versus sampling from the restriction of the distribution.
The notation and equations in the paper are generally clear, but some minor changes could be made to improve readability. For example, introducing only the variable x instead of the pair (x,phi) could simplify the notation. Furthermore, the authors could provide more precise references for certain results, such as the Khintchine inequality and the uniform distribution on a compact set being a stationary distribution for reflected Brownian motion.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the techniques and contributions. The experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithms, and the code is available online. The authors also discuss potential further applications of their work, including learning d-dim multi-index models and constructing Class Probability Estimation models.
