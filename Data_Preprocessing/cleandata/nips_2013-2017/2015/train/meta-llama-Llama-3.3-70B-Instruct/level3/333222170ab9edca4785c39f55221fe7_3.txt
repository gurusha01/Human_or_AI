This paper presents a novel approach to sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and signal processing. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that combines tensor contraction and convex optimization to recover the low-rank and sparse components of a corrupted tensor. The algorithm is based on a reduction of the tensor problem to a series of matrix decomposition problems, which are then solved using a convex relaxation.
The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees for exact recovery under certain conditions. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient algorithm for sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition
* A rigorous analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees for exact recovery
* Demonstrated effectiveness of the approach through numerical experiments
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from more explicit comparisons with existing methods for tensor decomposition, including a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and could be clarified or defined more explicitly
* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in tensor algebra and convex optimization, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of tensor decomposition and sparse recovery, and has the potential to be of interest to a wide range of researchers and practitioners.
