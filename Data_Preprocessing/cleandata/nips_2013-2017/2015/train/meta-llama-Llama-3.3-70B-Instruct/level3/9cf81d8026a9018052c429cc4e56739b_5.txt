This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models, specifically in the context of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. The authors introduce a new graph property, hierarchy width, which is shown to be a stronger condition than hypertree width, a commonly used property in graph algorithms. The main result of the paper is that Gibbs sampling mixes rapidly on factor graphs with bounded hierarchy width and factor weights.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and a thorough explanation of the technical results. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the hierarchy width property and its relationship to the mixing time of Gibbs sampling. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new graph property, hierarchy width, which provides a novel perspective on the behavior of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs.
* The thorough analysis of the relationship between hierarchy width and the mixing time of Gibbs sampling, including the proof of the main result.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world data.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work, particularly in the context of Gibbs sampling and factor graphs.
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in graphical models, and could be clarified or defined more explicitly.
* The experimental results, while promising, are limited to a specific application domain (knowledge base population) and may not be generalizable to other areas.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and provides a novel perspective on the behavior of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong and impactful paper.
