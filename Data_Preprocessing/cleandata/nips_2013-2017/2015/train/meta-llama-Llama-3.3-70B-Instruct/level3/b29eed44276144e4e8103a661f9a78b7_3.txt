This paper presents a novel approach to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for piecewise smooth energy functions with affine boundaries. The proposed method, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), modifies the traditional leapfrog dynamics to account for reflections and refractions at the boundaries of the energy function. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method, including proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance, which ensures that the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the target distribution.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the methodology and theoretical results. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in comparison to traditional HMC and Metropolis-Hastings, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The results show that RHMC can achieve higher effective sample sizes and lower worst mean absolute errors, making it a promising approach for probabilistic inference in complex models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and theoretically sound method for HMC sampling in piecewise smooth energy functions
* A thorough analysis of the method, including proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance
* Empirical evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in comparison to existing methods
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational costs associated with RHMC, particularly in terms of detecting the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries
* The experiments are limited to a specific type of energy function, and it would be useful to see evaluations on a broader range of models and datasets
* The paper could provide more insight into the relationship between RHMC and other existing methods for sampling from piecewise smooth energy functions
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on:
