This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use ideas from game playing to approximate the optimal policy. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed framework is novel and addresses a significant problem in machine learning, namely, learning from noisy crowds with high accuracy and low cost.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the stochastic game model, the utility function, and the approximation algorithm.
* The paper includes a comprehensive set of experiments on three different tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing cost and improving accuracy.
* The authors provide a clear and concise discussion of related work, which helps to situate the proposed approach within the broader context of machine learning and crowdsourcing.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor and include:
* The paper assumes that the crowd workers are noisy, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the noise model or its impact on the proposed approach.
* The authors do not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach or potential avenues for future work.
Overall, the paper is of high quality, and the proposed approach has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of machine learning and crowdsourcing. The paper is well-suited for publication at NIPS, and I would recommend acceptance.
Arguments for acceptance:
