This paper proposes a simple greedy strategy for the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem under the streaming model. The authors define a stochastic model for generating the input hypergraph and show that the greedy strategy can recover hidden co-clusters of items under certain conditions. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem, including a proof of the NP-completeness of the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem and a lower bound on the optimal value of the problem.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough analysis of the problem, and its experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm on several real-world datasets. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other online assignment strategies and offline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed algorithm.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The stochastic model for graph generation is interesting and novel, but its realism in practice is a concern, particularly the hidden co-clustering assumption. The authors should consider citing relevant papers that propose offline greedy algorithms for min-max graph partitioning and compare the performance of the streaming greedy algorithm with them.
Additionally, the paper has some minor issues, such as unclear notations in Algorithm 1 and a lack of clarity in comparing the performance of random partitioning with the global optimal. The authors should address these issues to improve the overall quality of the paper.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting and important problem, and the proposed approach has potential for asymptotical recovery of hidden clusters under certain conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the paper provides a good starting point for further research in this area.
