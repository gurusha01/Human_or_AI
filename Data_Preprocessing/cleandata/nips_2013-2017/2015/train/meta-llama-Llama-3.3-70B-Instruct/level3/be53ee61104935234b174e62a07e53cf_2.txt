This paper presents significant improvements to the algorithms for computing Isotonic Regression under weighted `p-norms. The authors achieve substantial reductions in computational complexity compared to existing algorithms, making their approach more practical for large datasets. The key innovation lies in the use of approximate solvers to accelerate the solution to isotonic regression, which is a crucial step in their Interior Point Method (IPM) framework.
The paper's strengths include its rigorous performance guarantees, the generality of its approach, and the potential for applications in various fields such as operations research, signal processing, and learning. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in practice, with average running times that are significantly faster than previous methods.
However, there are some concerns regarding the impact of the approximate solution, specifically the delta factor, on convergence for typical values of n. The authors should provide more insight into how this factor affects the accuracy of the results and whether there are any limitations to the applicability of their approach.
Additionally, a minor error is noted in the paper, where the condition $n\geq m-1$ should be $n \leq m-1$. While this error does not seem to affect the overall validity of the results, it should be corrected to ensure the accuracy of the presentation.
The authors' approach relies on using approximate solvers to accelerate the solution to isotonic regression with any norm. This is a significant contribution, as it enables the efficient computation of isotonic regression for a wide range of norms. The paper also provides a detailed comparison to previous results, highlighting the improvements achieved by the proposed algorithms.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to solving isotonic regression using approximate solvers. The authors combine existing techniques in a creative way, resulting in a significant improvement in computational complexity.

The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to impact various fields that rely on isotonic regression. The improved algorithms can be applied to large datasets, enabling faster and more accurate computations. The paper also provides a foundation for future research, as the IPM framework and approximate solvers can be extended to other problems.
