This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The algorithms, referred to as GoSta, are designed to efficiently estimate quantities that depend on pairs of observations, such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the within-cluster point scatter. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and analysis, including convergence rate bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases, respectively.
The paper is well-written, and the authors do an excellent job of introducing the problem, related work, and their approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to existing methods, such as U2-gossip. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of their algorithms with U2-gossip, highlighting the advantages of their approach in terms of convergence rate, memory, and communication costs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of novel gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics, which is a less investigated area in the context of decentralized estimation.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees and analysis, including convergence rate bounds, which demonstrates the rigor of the approach.
* The extensive experimental evaluation, which confirms the practical interest of the proposed algorithms and their superiority over existing methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a connected and non-bipartite graph, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The requirement of a global clock in the synchronous setting, which may not be realistic in some scenarios.
* The lack of discussion on the potential applications of the proposed algorithms beyond the two examples presented in the paper.
Overall, the paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their work. The proposed algorithms have the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness.
