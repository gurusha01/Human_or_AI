This paper proposes a novel approach called Principal Differences Analysis (PDA) for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. The method operates by finding the projection that maximizes the Wasserstein divergence between the resulting univariate populations. The authors also introduce a sparse variant of the method, called SPARDA, to identify features responsible for the differences.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology, including the formulation of the top-k multiclass SVM and its convex approximation. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying differences between cell populations in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and compare their approach to other methods, such as sparse linear discriminant analysis and logistic lasso.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle high-dimensional data and identify features that contribute to the differences between distributions. The authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the approach, including concentration results and sparsistency guarantees. The use of the Wasserstein distance as a divergence measure is also a nice touch, as it provides a natural dissimilarity measure between populations.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is the lack of comparison to other previous works due to implementation availability. The authors mention that they would like to see comparisons to certain previous works, but were unable to do so due to implementation issues. This is an important area for future work, as it would be useful to see how the proposed approach compares to other methods in the field.
Another potential area for improvement is the availability of the code. The authors mention that they will make the code public upon acceptance, but it would be useful to have the code available sooner, so that other researchers can build upon and compare to the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach. The experiment results are convincing, and the theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the methodology. With some additional comparisons to previous works and the availability of the code, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
