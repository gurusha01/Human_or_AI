This paper introduces a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The RPN is a fully-convolutional network that predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position, and is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012, with a frame rate of 5fps on a GPU.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough explanation of the RPN architecture and training procedure. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other region proposal methods, such as Selective Search and EdgeBoxes, and show that the RPN outperforms these methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the translation-invariance of RPN compared to other methods, such as Overfeat. Additionally, some parameters, such as n=3 and k=9, are set manually without further analysis or justification. The training procedure is also complicated and unstable, with questions raised about the consistency of results across multiple trials.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to region proposal generation, which is a significant contribution to the field of object detection. The use of a fully-convolutional network to predict object bounds and objectness scores is a new and innovative idea.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in object detection, which is the region proposal step. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed, making it a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results and compares the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of object detection and provides a thorough and well-written explanation of the proposed method. However, the authors should address the areas of improvement mentioned above to make the paper even stronger.
