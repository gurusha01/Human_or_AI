This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of their algorithms, showing that they outperform existing methods, such as U2-gossip. The paper is well-written, and the authors do a good job of motivating the problem and explaining their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of new algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, which is an important problem in machine learning and data mining.
* A thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms, including a comparison with existing methods.
* The use of a "phantom network" to model the data propagation and averaging steps, which is a novel and interesting approach.
* The provision of numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the network graph is connected and non-bipartite, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the communication and memory costs of their algorithms, which is an important consideration in decentralized settings.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithms.
* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors do a good job of explaining their approach and motivating the problem.
* Originality: The paper proposes novel algorithms and a new approach to modeling the data propagation and averaging steps.
* Significance: The paper addresses an important problem in machine learning and data mining, and the proposed algorithms have the potential to be widely used.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of:
* Providing a more detailed analysis of the communication and memory costs of the proposed algorithms.
* Including a more detailed comparison with existing methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
* Discussing the potential limitations and challenges of implementing the proposed algorithms in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
