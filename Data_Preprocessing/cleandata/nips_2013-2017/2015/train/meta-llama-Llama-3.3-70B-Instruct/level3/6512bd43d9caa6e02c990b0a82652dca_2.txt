This paper explores the concept of algorithmic stability and its relationship to generalization in the context of statistical computations with persistence diagrams. The authors define a notion of algorithmic stability equivalent to uniform generalization and examine its implications for various techniques. They provide theoretical justifications for popular learning strategies used to improve algorithmic stability, strengthening the understanding of generalization, input space, hypothesis space, and learning algorithms.
The paper is technically sound, with correct, simple, and easy-to-understand proofs, and well-founded claims based on theoretical results. However, the authors define stability on expectation, rather than with high-probability, which may limit the significance of the contribution. The paper is well-inserted in the literature, but the reviewer cannot assess its originality due to limited knowledge of related work in the area of stability.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and proofs, although some reviewers found it unclear, and the authors may need to improve its clarity. The reviewer raises questions about the relationship between the proposed definition of stability and existing definitions, as well as the possibility of obtaining high-probability bounds without fixing a specific algorithm.
The paper's contributions are solid and interesting, but limited by the algorithm-independence being only for expectation guarantees on stability, not high-probability guarantees. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, highlighting the advantages of their kernel-based method for two-sample hypothesis testing.
Arguments in favor of acceptance include:
* The paper provides a clear and well-motivated definition of algorithmic stability and explores its consequences for generalization.
* The authors provide theoretical justifications for popular learning strategies and strengthen the understanding of generalization, input space, hypothesis space, and learning algorithms.
* The paper is technically sound, with correct and easy-to-understand proofs.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The authors define stability on expectation, rather than with high-probability, which may limit the significance of the contribution.
* The paper's originality is unclear due to limited knowledge of related work in the area of stability.
* Some reviewers found the paper unclear, and the authors may need to improve its clarity.
* The paper's contributions are limited by the algorithm-independence being only for expectation guarantees on stability, not high-probability guarantees.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a solid contribution to the field, but may benefit from further clarification and improvement in terms of originality and significance.
