This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, which extends the Leurgans' Algorithm to solve a convex problem. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable, with a computational complexity of O(n^3), making it suitable for large-scale tensor decomposition tasks. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance, including exact recovery of the tensor components under certain conditions.
The paper is well-structured and clear, with convincing proofs and a comprehensible main concept. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, including numerical experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper also discusses potential extensions of the algorithm to higher-order tensors, block sparsity, and tensor completion.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to model low-rank and sparse tensors, which is a common problem in many applications. The algorithm's simplicity and low computational complexity make it an attractive solution for many practical problems. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The algorithm's originality is limited by its dependence on the existing Leurgans' Algorithm, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing algorithms. Additionally, the paper assumes a uniform dimension for the tensors, which may limit its applicability to real-world problems where tensors may have varying dimensions.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of tensor decomposition, and its algorithm has the potential to be widely used in many applications. The paper's strengths, including its simplicity, low computational complexity, and theoretical guarantees, make it a strong candidate for acceptance.
