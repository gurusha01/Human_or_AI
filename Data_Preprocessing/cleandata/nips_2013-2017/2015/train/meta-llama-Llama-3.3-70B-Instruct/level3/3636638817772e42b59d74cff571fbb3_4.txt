This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential. The authors establish a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which allows them to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain bounds on the exponential width. This is a significant contribution, as it enables the analysis of sub-exponential design matrices and noise, which is common in many application domains.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem setup, background, and contributions. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, making it easy to follow the arguments. The authors also provide experimental results to validate their theoretical findings, which is a nice addition.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to generalize existing results for sub-Gaussian design matrices and noise to the sub-exponential case. The authors show that the dependence on Gaussian width is replaced by the exponential width of suitable sets associated with the norm, which is a key insight. They also establish a stronger result for the RE condition for the Lasso and group-lasso problems, which is an important contribution.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more context on why sub-exponential design matrices and noise are important in practice. While they mention that sub-exponential distributions have heavier tails than sub-Gaussians, they could elaborate more on the implications of this for real-world applications. Secondly, the experimental results could be more comprehensive, with more detailed comparisons between the Gaussian and sub-exponential cases.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and relate them to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere. They also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, addressing the criteria described in the qualitative evaluation section. However, they could provide more detailed arguments for and against acceptance, highlighting the significance and impact of their contributions.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of norm-regularized regression and provides a novel framework for analyzing sub-exponential design matrices and noise. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
