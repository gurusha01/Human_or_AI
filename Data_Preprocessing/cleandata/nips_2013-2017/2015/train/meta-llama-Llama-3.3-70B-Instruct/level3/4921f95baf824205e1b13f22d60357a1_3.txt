This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation, particularly in the context of non-linear measurements. The authors provide a precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for estimating structured signals from non-linear measurements, which is a crucial problem in various applications. The main result of the paper shows that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as that of the corresponding linear measurements, with a scaling factor and noise variance that depend on the link function.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations, which demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions. The authors also provide a discussion of the relevant literature, highlighting the significance of their contribution and the connections to previous work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm, which is a widely used method in practice. The authors' results provide valuable insights into the behavior of the algorithm and can be used to guide the choice of parameters and the design of measurement systems. The paper also highlights the importance of considering non-linear measurements, which is a common scenario in many applications.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The analysis is restricted to a specific class of link functions, and it is not clear how the results would generalize to more complex scenarios. Additionally, the paper assumes that the measurement matrix has i.i.d. Gaussian entries, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors also mention that the optimal quantizer for q-bit compressive sensing is the Lloyd-Max quantizer, but the proof of this result is not provided in the paper.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise summary of the main ideas. The paper also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the approach and provides a list of arguments for and against acceptance. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the results.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation.
