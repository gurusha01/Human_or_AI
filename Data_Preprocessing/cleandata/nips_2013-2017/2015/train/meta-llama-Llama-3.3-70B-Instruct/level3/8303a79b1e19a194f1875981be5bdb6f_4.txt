This paper proposes a greedy algorithm for the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem in the streaming computation model. The problem is defined as partitioning a set of items into a given number of components such that the maximum number of distinct topics covered by each component is minimized. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, showing that it guarantees balanced asymptotic recovery of hidden clusters under certain conditions. The paper also presents experimental results, demonstrating that the greedy algorithm outperforms other online heuristics and even some offline approaches.
The strengths of the paper include its novel contribution to the field of hypergraph partitioning, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its experimental evaluation on real-world datasets. The algorithm proposed is simple and intuitive, making it easy to implement and understand. The paper also provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem definition, the algorithm, and the theoretical results.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The numerical evaluation of the algorithm is not extensive, and the authors could have provided more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Additionally, the paper assumes a specific model for the input data, which may not be realistic in all scenarios. The authors could have explored more general models or provided more discussion on the limitations of their model.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques from hypergraph partitioning and streaming computation. The paper provides a unique contribution to the field, and the authors have adequately referenced related work. The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach.
