This paper presents a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors belonging to the general Poisson-Kingman class. The proposed hybrid sampler combines the strengths of conditional and marginal samplers, offering a more efficient and comprehensive representation of the random probability measure. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through comparative simulation results, outperforming existing marginal and conditional MCMC samplers in terms of running times and effective sample size.
The paper is well-written, clear, and accessible, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the Poisson-Kingman processes, the hybrid sampler, and its implementation. The experimental evaluations are convincing, although somewhat simplistic, and the results are noteworthy.
The paper's originality is somewhat diminished by a similar construction presented at last year's NIPS, but it still offers valuable improvements. The research has significant implications for models with factorable likelihoods, a limited but important class of statistical models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient MCMC scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models
* A thorough introduction to the background and related work
* Clear and accessible writing
* Convincing experimental evaluations
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Somewhat simplistic experimental evaluations
* Limited originality due to a similar construction presented at last year's NIPS
* Potential challenges in dealing with certain values of Ïƒ and improving the mixing of the Metropolis-Hastings step
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and efficient MCMC scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models
* The approach has significant implications for models with factorable likelihoods
* The paper is well-written, clear, and accessible
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experimental evaluations are somewhat simplistic
* The paper's originality is somewhat diminished by a similar construction presented at last year's NIPS
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a valuable contribution to the field of Bayesian nonparametrics and MCMC methods. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses and limitations of their approach in future work.
