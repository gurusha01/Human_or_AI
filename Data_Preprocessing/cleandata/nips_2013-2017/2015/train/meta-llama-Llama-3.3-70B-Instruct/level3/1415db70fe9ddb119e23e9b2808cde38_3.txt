This paper proposes a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012, while significantly reducing the computational burden of region proposal generation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method. The experimental results are comprehensive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of their approach. The use of a simple alternating optimization scheme to train the RPN and Fast R-CNN is a key contribution, allowing for efficient and accurate object detection.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify region proposal generation and object detection into a single, end-to-end trainable network. This is achieved through the sharing of convolutional features between the RPN and Fast R-CNN, which reduces the computational burden of region proposal generation and improves object detection accuracy.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the RPN and Fast R-CNN share a common set of conv layers, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the RPN, which is an important consideration for real-time object detection applications.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on existing work in object detection and region proposal generation, but the authors' approach is novel and innovative. The use of a fully-convolutional network for region proposal generation and the sharing of convolutional features between the RPN and Fast R-CNN are key contributions that distinguish this paper from existing work.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to enable efficient and accurate object detection in real-time applications. The authors' method has the potential to be widely adopted in a range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to surveillance systems.
