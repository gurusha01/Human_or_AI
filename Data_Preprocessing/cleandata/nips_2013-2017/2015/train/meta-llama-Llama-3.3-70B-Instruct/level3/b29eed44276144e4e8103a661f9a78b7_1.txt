This paper introduces a new property of hypergraphs, called hierarchy width, to bound the mixing time in Gibbs sampling, addressing a hard problem in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The authors define hierarchy width for factor graphs and show that mixing time is exponential in hierarchy width and maximum difference in weights. They provide theoretical results demonstrating rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling for specific classes of template factor graphs. The paper is well-written, and the results are significant, as they provide new cases where Gibbs sampling can guarantee accurate results.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new graph property, hierarchy width, which is a stronger condition than hypertree width, and the provision of theoretical results showing rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling for graphs with bounded hierarchy width and maximum factor weight. The authors also exhibit a class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which have bounded hierarchy width, and demonstrate that Gibbs sampling on models instantiated from these templates mixes in polynomial time.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper raises questions about the handling of 0 values or near-determinism in potentials and the assumptions about the underlying distribution structure. The reviewer seeks clarification on the treewidth of hierarchical factor graph templates and the implications for approximate inference. Additionally, the paper's results are shown to hold for logical/ratio semantics, but the reviewer asks about the drawbacks of using these semantics over linear semantics.
The applicability of the results to real-world applications where only subgraphs are hierarchical is also questioned, and more details on the experiments section are sought. The paper proves that Gibbs sampling mixes in polynomial time on certain template factor graphs with hierarchical structure, but the reviewer would like to see more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the work.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a new graph property and provides novel combinations of familiar techniques. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper differs significantly from previous contributions. The significance of the results is also high, as they address a difficult problem in MCMC methods and provide new insights into the behavior of Gibbs sampling.
Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and the results are important and likely to be used or built upon by other researchers. The paper demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem and provides a significant advancement in the state of the art.
