This paper proposes a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The RPN is a fully-convolutional network that predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position, and is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals. The paper also introduces a simple alternating optimization scheme to train the RPN and Fast R-CNN object detection network to share convolutional features.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art region proposal methods. The results show that the RPN achieves competitive results with existing methods, while being significantly faster.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper lacks discussion on finding the initial solution for the RPN, which is crucial for the convergence of the algorithm. Additionally, the authors propose two algorithms, but do not provide practical guidance on which one to use in different scenarios. The choice of tuning parameters, such as $\hat s$ and $\lambda$, is also crucial, but the paper does not provide clear guidance on how to choose them in practice or their sensitivity to the results.
Furthermore, the decorrelated score test is not novel and has been previously developed, which should be cited and acknowledged in the paper. The main theoretical results rely on a large number of technical conditions, which may not be satisfied for all considered latent variable models and need further discussion. The paper combines existing results in a clever way, but it is unclear what is novel in this paper and why the application of existing tools is nontrivial, requiring more information on technical challenges.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to region proposal generation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in object detection, which is a crucial task in computer vision. The proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of object detection systems, making it a significant contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some improvements, it could be even stronger.
