This paper proposes a novel approach for generating 3D object proposals from a stereo image pair, leveraging features such as point cloud density and object height prior to predict "objectness" of a 3D cuboid proposal. The method is evaluated on the KITTI benchmark, outperforming competing baselines for oracle recall and object detection, particularly for "car" and "cyclist" object classes.
The paper's focus on 3D data is a positive aspect, as it has received less attention than 2D still images, and the approach's performance improvement is notable. However, the main ideas behind the paper may be perceived as incremental from a machine learning perspective, and the boost in performance may be more appreciated by the 3D vision community.
The use of a structured SVM is questionable, and it would be beneficial to compare its performance to a linear SVM with hard negative mining. Additionally, the paper's dependence on object class information is noted, and it would be interesting to evaluate the approach without using object class information.
Several technical questions and suggestions arise, including clarifying the input, parameterization, and assumptions made in the approach, as well as providing more details on ground plane estimation and non-maximum suppression. The paper's quality is good, with well-supported claims and a clear writing style. The originality of the approach is moderate, as it builds upon existing methods, but the significance of the results is high, as it advances the state of the art in 3D object proposal generation.
Arguments for acceptance include the paper's novelty, the quality of the results, and the potential impact on the 3D vision community. Arguments against acceptance include the incremental nature of the approach and the lack of comparison to other methods. Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are significant, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The introduction provides a good background and motivation for the work, and the methodology is well-explained. The experimental results are clearly presented, and the conclusions are well-supported. However, some minor suggestions for improvement include providing more details on the implementation and adding more visualizations to illustrate the results.
The originality of the paper is moderate, as it builds upon existing methods for 3D object proposal generation. However, the approach is novel, and the results are significant, making it a valuable contribution to the field. The significance of the paper is high, as it advances the state of the art in 3D object proposal generation and has the potential to impact the 3D vision community.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are significant, making it a strong candidate for acceptance. With some minor revisions to address the technical questions and suggestions, the paper has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field of 3D vision.
