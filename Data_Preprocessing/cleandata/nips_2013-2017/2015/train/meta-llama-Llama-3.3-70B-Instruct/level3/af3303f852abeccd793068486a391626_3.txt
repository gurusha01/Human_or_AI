This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence modeling by incorporating latent random variables into a recurrent neural network (RNN). The authors introduce a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) that combines the strengths of RNNs and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to model complex sequences. The VRNN is evaluated on several speech and handwriting datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform standard RNN models and capture highly structured sequences.
The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides a clear explanation of the proposed model and its components. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including visualizations of the generated samples and latent space analysis. The use of importance sampling to approximate the marginal log-likelihood is a nice touch, allowing for a more accurate comparison with other models.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to demonstrate the importance of temporal conditioning of the latent random variables. The authors show that the VRNN model with temporal conditioning outperforms the model without temporal conditioning, highlighting the benefits of incorporating temporal dependencies into the prior distribution.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and other approximate Bayesian inference methods. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the training time and computational requirements of the VRNN model, as this is an important consideration for many practitioners.
The paper also raises some questions about the choice of prior distribution and the use of simple spherical Gaussian priors. The authors could provide more justification for this choice and explore the use of more complex prior distributions in future work.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of sequence modeling and provides a useful framework for incorporating latent random variables into RNNs. The results are impressive, and the authors provide a clear and well-written explanation of the proposed model and its components. With some additional comparisons and analysis, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
