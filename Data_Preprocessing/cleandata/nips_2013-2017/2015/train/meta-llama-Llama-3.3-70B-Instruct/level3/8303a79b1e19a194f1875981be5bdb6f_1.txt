This paper proposes a novel modification to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), to handle non-differentiable probability distributions. The method introduces physically-inspired "reflections" and "refractions" of the trajectory when it intersects with the boundaries of polytopes, which are regions with affine boundaries. The authors prove that the reflection and refraction procedures satisfy the necessary volume-preservation properties, ensuring convergence to the target distribution.
The paper is well-written, and the algorithm is clearly motivated and explained. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including a proof of volume preservation and detailed balance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in reducing the number of rejected samples and improving the efficiency of probabilistic inference, particularly in high dimensions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and physically-inspired method for handling non-differentiable probability distributions
* A thorough analysis of the method, including a proof of volume preservation and detailed balance
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RHMC in improving the efficiency of probabilistic inference
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method requires the ability to detect the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which may be computationally expensive
* The authors do not provide a detailed discussion of the effects of reflections and refractions on rejection rates, which would be useful for understanding the trade-offs of the method
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference in a wide range of applications. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying theory and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work.
