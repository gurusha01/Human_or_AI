This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, addressing the crucial issue of overfitting in adaptive data analysis. The authors propose a novel approach to reusing a holdout set for validation in the adaptive setting, introducing two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which provide generalization guarantees and prevent overfitting to the holdout set.
The paper is well-written, with a clear and concise presentation of the main ideas, related work, and technical contributions. The authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem and its significance, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in adaptive data analysis.
The technical contributions of the paper are substantial, with the introduction of a new information-theoretic measure, approximate max-information, which unifies the generalization arguments from differential privacy and description length. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of approximate max-information, including its adaptive composition guarantees, which make it amenable to reasoning about the generalization properties of adaptively applied sequences of algorithms.
The experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms is convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of Thresholdout and SparseValidate in preventing overfitting to the holdout set. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the results, highlighting the significance of their approach and its potential impact on the field of machine learning.
