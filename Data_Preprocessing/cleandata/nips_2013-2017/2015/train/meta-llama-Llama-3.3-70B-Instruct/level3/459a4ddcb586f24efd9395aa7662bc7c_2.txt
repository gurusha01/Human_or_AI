This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Isotonic Regression, a shape-constrained nonparametric regression method. The authors propose improved algorithms for computing Isotonic Regression under weighted `p-norms, which have numerous applications in various fields, including Operations Research, Signal Processing, and Statistics.
The paper's main strengths lie in its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a unified, optimization-based framework for algorithms that provably solve the Isotonic Regression problem for `p-norms, combining conditional and marginal samplers to reduce memory requirements and increase mixing. The proposed algorithm, ISOTONICIPM, is based on an Interior Point Method (IPM) framework, which allows for fast and efficient computation of the Isotonic Regression.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the techniques and contributions. The writing is polished, making it easy to follow and understand the material. The authors also provide a detailed comparison to previous results, highlighting the improvements and advantages of their approach.
One of the paper's main weaknesses is the lack of extensive experiments, particularly on high-dimensional datasets, to demonstrate the method's effectiveness and memory reduction capabilities. While the authors provide some experimental results, they are limited to a specific setting, and more comprehensive experiments would be necessary to fully assess the algorithm's performance.
Another area for improvement is the presentation of the results. While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, such as the proof of Theorem 3.1, are dense and may be challenging to follow for non-experts. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the practical implications of their results and the potential applications of their algorithm.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, advancing the state of the art in Isotonic Regression. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be used in various applications, including data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of Isotonic Regression. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the lack of extensive experiments and the presentation of the results, to further improve the paper's quality and impact.
