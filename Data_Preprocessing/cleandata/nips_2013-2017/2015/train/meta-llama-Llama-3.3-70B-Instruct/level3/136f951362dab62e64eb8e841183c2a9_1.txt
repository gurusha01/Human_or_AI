This paper proposes a new method for high-dimensional structured estimation with norm-regularized estimators, such as Lasso, when the design matrix and noise are drawn from sub-exponential distributions. The authors establish results for the norm-regularized estimation problem for any norm, and their analysis holds for any distribution with heavier tails than sub-Gaussians. The paper's main contribution is the relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which allows for the extension of existing results on the computation of Gaussian widths to the sub-exponential case.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their contributions. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of their results. The experimental section is limited, but it provides some insight into the performance of the proposed method.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to generalize existing results for the sub-Gaussian case to the sub-exponential case. The authors provide a unified framework for analysis of non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides some interesting insights into the relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which could have implications for other areas of research.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The experimental section is limited, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments to validate the proposed method. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, particularly in the sub-Gaussian case. The authors also assume that the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential, which may not always be the case in practice.
