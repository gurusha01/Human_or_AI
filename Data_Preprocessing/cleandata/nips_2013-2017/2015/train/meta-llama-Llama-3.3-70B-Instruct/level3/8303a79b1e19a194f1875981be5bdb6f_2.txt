This paper presents a novel variation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for sampling from probability density functions (pdfs) with discontinuities or on a bounded domain. The proposed method, Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), modifies the traditional leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics to incorporate reflection and refraction at discontinuities, resulting in higher acceptance rates and effective sample size.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including a proof of the correctness of the method and its volume preservation property. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in comparison to baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it addresses a significant limitation of traditional HMC in handling non-smooth functions. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the method's properties and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. One concern is the computational cost of detecting the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which may be significant in high-dimensional settings. The authors could provide more discussion on the computational complexity of this step and its impact on the overall performance of the method.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from more examples and applications of RHMC to real-world problems, demonstrating its practical significance and potential impact. The authors may also consider comparing RHMC to other sampling methods, such as Gibbs sampling or slice sampling, to further establish its advantages.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of the methodology, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The paper also addresses a significant problem in the field of probabilistic inference and has the potential to make a substantial impact.
