This paper proposes a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in serial section electron microscopy (EM) images using a recursively trained 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture. The authors introduce several innovations, including the use of a deeper network, the incorporation of 3D filters, and a recursive training framework. The proposed architecture, VD2D3D, outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D ConvNet, N4, and demonstrates significant improvements in boundary detection accuracy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed description of their approach, including the network architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. The use of a recursive framework, where the output of a preliminary network is used as input to a second network, is a novel and interesting approach that shows promise for improving boundary detection accuracy.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with VD2D3D achieving a significant reduction in pixel-wise classification error and improved Rand F-scores compared to N4 and VD2D. The qualitative results also show that VD2D3D is able to correctly detect boundaries in ambiguous locations where 2D models fail.
The paper also highlights the potential of ZNN, a new implementation of 3D ConvNets that uses multicore CPU parallelism for speed, as a viable alternative to mainstream GPU-based deep learning frameworks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ZNN in training large networks and show that it can be used to perform additional computations, such as multi-level feature integration, to improve segmentation accuracy.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to neuronal boundary detection, demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, and highlights the potential of ZNN as a useful tool for deep learning applications. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed description of their approach, making it easy to follow and understand.
