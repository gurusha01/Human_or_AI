This paper presents a novel approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, extending the policy gradient method to the whole class of coherent risk measures. The authors provide a unified framework for both static and dynamic risk measures, allowing for a tractable algorithm with a quadratic runtime in the size of the graph. The results and analysis appear to be correct, with the proposed algorithm achieving lower error bounds in certain cases and matching the optimal bound on trees.
The paper's strengths include its ability to generalize and extend previous results, providing a more comprehensive understanding of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. The authors also demonstrate the significance of their approach through a numerical example, showcasing the importance of flexibility in designing risk criteria.
However, the paper's structure and organization are poorly executed, making it difficult to follow. The motivations for presenting intermediate results are unclear, and the discussion section introduces new information that could be better integrated throughout the paper.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.
* The authors provide a unified framework for both static and dynamic risk measures, which is a valuable addition to the existing literature.
* The results and analysis are correct and well-supported by theoretical and experimental evidence.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's structure and organization are poorly executed, making it difficult to follow.
* The motivations for presenting intermediate results are unclear, and the discussion section introduces new information that could be better integrated throughout the paper.
* The significance and originality of the paper's contribution may be limited by the reviewer's lack of expertise in the area.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to improve its clarity, organization, and presentation. The authors should work to clarify their motivations, integrate new information more effectively, and provide a more polished and readable manuscript.
