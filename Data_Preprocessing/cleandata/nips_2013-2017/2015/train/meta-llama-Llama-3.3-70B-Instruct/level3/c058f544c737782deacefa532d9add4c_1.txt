This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation, providing a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential. The authors establish a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which enables them to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain precise sample complexity bounds for sub-exponential designs.
The paper is well-written, and the results are clearly presented. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem, discussing the limitations of existing literature and the motivation for their work. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
The paper's originality lies in its presentation of a unified view of various Frank-Wolfe variants and their convergence proofs under weaker conditions than existing literature. The authors' use of generic chaining to establish a sharp upper bound for the exponential width of sets is a notable contribution.
The paper's significance is evident in its provision of a good reference for Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants and its establishment of new convergence guarantees. The results are interesting to the NIPS audience, as they advance the state of the art in high-dimensional structured estimation.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The authors could provide more descriptive overviews of the variants in the main text, rather than relegating them to the appendix. Additionally, the paper's clarity could be enhanced by including more intuitive explanations of the technical concepts and results.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.
The paper's clarity is good, but could be improved with more descriptive overviews and intuitive explanations. The organization is logical, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The paper's originality is high, as it presents a novel contribution to the field. The authors provide a unique perspective on the problem, and their use of generic chaining is a notable innovation.
The paper's significance is also high, as it provides a good reference for Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants and establishes new convergence guarantees. The results are interesting to the NIPS audience, and the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
