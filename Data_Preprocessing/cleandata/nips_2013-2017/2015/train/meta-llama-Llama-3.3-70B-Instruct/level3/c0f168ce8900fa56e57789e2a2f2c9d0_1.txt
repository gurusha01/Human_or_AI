This paper presents improved algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression of a given set of observations on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) under various weighted p-norms. The authors provide a unified framework for solving the Isotonic Regression problem for all weighted p-norms, with rigorous performance guarantees. The technical analysis in the paper is impressive, and the authors have made significant contributions to the field.
However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the paper lacks citations for stated facts, such as analyses of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and the importance of convexity for algorithms with provable guarantees. This makes it difficult to understand the context and relevance of the work.
Secondly, the results section only compares the performance of the algorithms to "volume estimation" benchmarks, without providing quantitative performance gains. The plots in the paper lack axis labels and error bars, making it challenging to interpret the results. Additionally, the absence of a conclusions section makes it difficult to understand the implications of the work and future directions.
Furthermore, the paper could benefit from clarification on the meaning of "singularities in the diffusion process" and a potential typo in the inequality of Lemma 3. The authors' theoretical analysis is commendable, but the paper would be stronger with more detailed explanations and justifications.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to solving the Isotonic Regression problem, its improved algorithms for `âˆž-norms and Strict Isotonic Regression, and its potential applications to various fields such as Operations Research, Signal Processing, and Learning. The authors have also made their implementation available, which is a significant contribution to the community.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The technical analysis is sound, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The work is original and makes significant contributions to the field, and the authors have adequately referenced related work.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The authors should provide more citations, clarify unclear concepts, and improve the presentation of their results. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
