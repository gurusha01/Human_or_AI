This paper presents a convex relaxation approach to learn the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model from ordinal data, with applications to collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the approach, including upper bounds on the error and a matching information-theoretic lower bound. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem, approach, and results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the MNL model, making it easy to understand for readers who may not be familiar with the topic.
* The paper presents a novel approach to learning the MNL model from ordinal data, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The authors provide thorough theoretical analysis, including upper bounds on the error and a matching information-theoretic lower bound, which demonstrates the optimality of the approach.
* The paper includes numerical experiments that validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from more empirical evaluation, including comparisons to other approaches and assessments of robustness to model mis-specification, particularly for the bundled choice modeling problem.
* The transition between the collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling sections could be improved, as it is not entirely clear how the two models are related.
* Some minor comments include clarifying the definition of S_{i,1} and providing more detail for claim (6), as well as correcting the statement about the rank of the de-meaned parameter matrix.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field. With some additional empirical evaluation and clarification of the presentation, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
