This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of their algorithms, establishing bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases, respectively. The paper is well-written and motivated, with a clear presentation of the problem statement, related work, and the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed algorithms, the thorough convergence analysis, and the experimental evaluation on real datasets. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their approach over the existing U2-gossip method, both in terms of convergence rate and practical performance. The paper also provides a clear and concise presentation of the theoretical results, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the topic.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of discussion on the computational complexity and communication costs of the proposed algorithms. While the authors mention that their approach has lower memory and communication costs compared to U2-gossip, a more detailed analysis of these aspects would be beneficial. Additionally, the authors suggest including run-times per iteration for both the proposed and U2-gossip methods to assess the practical utility of the approach, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the advantages of their proposed approach.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to enable efficient and robust decentralized computation of U-statistics, which has numerous applications in machine learning and data mining. The authors demonstrate the practical interest of their approach through experiments on real datasets, which shows the potential for impact in various fields.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of decentralized computation and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed approach. However, I suggest that the authors address the minor weaknesses mentioned above to further improve the paper.
