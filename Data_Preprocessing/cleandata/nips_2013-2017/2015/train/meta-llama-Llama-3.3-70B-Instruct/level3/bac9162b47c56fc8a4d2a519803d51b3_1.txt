This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating an unknown signal from non-linear measurements using the Generalized LASSO algorithm. The authors provide a precise analysis of the algorithm's performance, showing that it is asymptotically equivalent to a linear measurement model with scaled and noisy measurements. The paper's main contribution is a precise error prediction formula, which captures the role of the link function, the structure of the signal, and the regularizer parameter.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The paper also includes several numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed error prediction formula.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to generalize previous results on the Generalized LASSO algorithm to the case of non-linear measurements. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the relevant literature and demonstrate how their approach improves upon existing methods.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the practical implications of their results and how they can be used in real-world applications. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more numerical examples and simulations to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.
