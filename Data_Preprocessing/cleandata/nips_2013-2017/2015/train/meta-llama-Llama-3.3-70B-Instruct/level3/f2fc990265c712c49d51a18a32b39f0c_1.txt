This paper presents the HONOR algorithm, a hybrid optimization method that combines Quasi-Newton and gradient descent steps to efficiently solve non-convex sparse learning formulations. The algorithm is proven to converge to a Clarke critical point, which is a significant achievement in non-convex optimization. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of convergence, demonstrating that every limit point of the sequence generated by HONOR is a Clarke critical point.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to efficiently solve large-scale non-convex problems, outperforming comparable methods such as GIST. The algorithm's hybrid approach, leveraging second-order information from Quasi-Newton steps and gradient descent steps, allows for fast convergence on high-dimensional datasets. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence, which is typically challenging for non-convex problems.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The empirical evaluations, while demonstrating the algorithm's fast convergence, could be improved with additional experiments on datasets with local minima. This would help to further demonstrate the algorithm's ability to escape high error plateaus, which is often a challenge in high-dimensional non-convex problems.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the algorithm and its convergence analysis. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper lies in its hybrid approach, which combines Quasi-Newton and gradient descent steps to solve non-convex problems. The significance of the paper is high, as it provides a new and efficient method for solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems.
