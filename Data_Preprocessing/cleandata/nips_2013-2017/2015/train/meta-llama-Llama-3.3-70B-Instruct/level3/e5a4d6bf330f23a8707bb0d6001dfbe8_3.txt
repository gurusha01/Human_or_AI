This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of connectomics, specifically in the detection of neuronal boundaries in 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images. The authors propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with a recursive training framework. The resulting architecture, VD2D3D, outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D ConvNet, N4, and demonstrates improved accuracy in boundary detection.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The introduction effectively sets the context for the research, and the related work section provides a thorough overview of existing methods for neuronal boundary detection. The methodology section is detailed and easy to follow, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their novel contributions, including the use of 3D filters and the recursive training framework.
The results section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, including quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing methods. The authors demonstrate that VD2D3D outperforms N4 and VD2D, and provide visualizations of the boundary detection results to illustrate the improvements. The discussion section provides a thoughtful analysis of the results and highlights the potential of the proposed approach for future research.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposal of a novel architecture that combines 2D and 3D ConvNets with a recursive training framework
* The demonstration of improved accuracy in boundary detection compared to existing methods
* The provision of a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and results
* The discussion of the potential of the proposed approach for future research
However, there are some areas for improvement, including:
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for neuronal boundary detection
* The limited evaluation of the proposed approach on a single dataset
