This paper proposes a method for statistically treating persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data, by embedding probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using the "u-PSS kernel". The authors prove that the "u-PSS kernel" is universal with respect to the 1-Wasserstein metric, allowing for simplified calculations and comparisons of homological features. The paper is well-motivated, and the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams is an important one in the field of topological data analysis.
The paper is technically sound, and the proofs of the propositions are clear and well-explained. The experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in two-sample hypothesis testing. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and the significance of their contributions.
However, the paper is difficult to read due to its assumption of advanced knowledge in algebraic topology and functional analysis, and its lack of clear explanations and concise argumentation. The core contribution of the paper, the proof of proposition 2, is not significant enough, as it mainly combines existing definitions and results without introducing anything novel.
The field of topological data analysis is exciting and has many potential applications, and the result could lead to interesting implications if implemented with reduced complexity. The experiments and implementations illustrate the generality and diversity of the theoretical result, but the paper overall lacks theoretical and empirical content and has poor writing.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel method for statistically treating persistence diagrams.
* The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and the significance of their contributions.
* The experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper is difficult to read due to its assumption of advanced knowledge in algebraic topology and functional analysis.
* The core contribution of the paper is not significant enough.
* The paper lacks theoretical and empirical content and has poor writing.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with major revisions to improve the clarity and significance of the contributions. The authors should provide more background information and explanations for readers without advanced knowledge in algebraic topology and functional analysis, and they should highlight the novelty and significance of their contributions more clearly. Additionally, the authors should improve the writing and provide more theoretical and empirical content to support their claims.
