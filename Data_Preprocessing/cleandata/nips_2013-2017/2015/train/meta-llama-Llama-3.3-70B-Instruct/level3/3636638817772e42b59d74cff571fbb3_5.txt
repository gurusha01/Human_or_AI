This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation, providing a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential. The authors establish a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which enables them to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain precise sample complexity bounds for sub-exponential designs.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors demonstrate the performance of their proposed techniques through experiments on synthetic data. The results show that the estimation error decays slower for sub-exponential designs compared to Gaussian designs, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem, covering both the theoretical and experimental aspects.
* The relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths of sets is a significant contribution, as it allows for the extension of existing results to sub-exponential designs.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and provide insights into the behavior of sub-exponential designs.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The analysis is limited to sub-exponential designs, and it would be interesting to explore the extension of the results to other types of heavy-tailed distributions.
* The experiments are limited to synthetic data, and it would be beneficial to validate the results on real-world datasets.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation.
* The analysis is comprehensive and well-organized.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis is limited to sub-exponential designs, which may not be representative of all heavy-tailed distributions.
* The experiments are limited to synthetic data, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and provides a comprehensive analysis of the problem. However, I suggest that the authors consider extending their analysis to other types of heavy-tailed distributions and validating their results on real-world datasets in future work.
