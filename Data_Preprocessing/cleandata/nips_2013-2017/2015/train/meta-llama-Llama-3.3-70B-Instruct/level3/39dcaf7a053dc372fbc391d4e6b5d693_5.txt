This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized estimation of U-statistics in networks, which is a crucial problem in many distributed systems. The authors propose two randomized gossip algorithms, GoSta-sync and GoSta-async, that efficiently compute U-statistics by combining data propagation and averaging steps. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including convergence rate bounds and numerical experiments that demonstrate their superiority over existing approaches.
The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant effort to provide a clear and concise presentation of their work. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and provides a good overview of the related work. The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors have used a variety of tools, including phantom nodes, to analyze the convergence of their algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithms are novel and efficient, with improved convergence rates compared to existing approaches.
* The analysis is thorough and well-presented, providing a good understanding of the algorithms' behavior.
* The numerical experiments are convincing and demonstrate the practical interest of the proposed algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the network graph is connected and non-bipartite, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other decentralized estimation algorithms, which would be useful to understand the relative performance of their approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of decentralized estimation and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, and their work has the potential to impact a wide range of applications.
