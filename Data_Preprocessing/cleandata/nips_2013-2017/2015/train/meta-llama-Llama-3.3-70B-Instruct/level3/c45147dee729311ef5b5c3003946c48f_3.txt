This paper proposes a novel bidirectional recurrent convolutional network (BRCN) for multi-frame super resolution, which formulates the problem in a straightforward and sensible way using RNNs. The approach is a natural extension of deep convolutional networks for super resolution, building upon relevant recent work such as Dong et al.'s ECCV 14 paper. The paper provides a reasonable evaluation of the proposed method, making it acceptable for NIPS, with interesting aspects including the exploration of feedforward, recurrent, and conditional convolutions.
The strengths of the paper include its strong quantitative and visual results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BRCN approach for multi-frame super resolution. The proposed network is able to capture complex motions and achieve state-of-the-art performance, while also being orders of magnitude faster than other multi-frame SR methods. The use of bidirectional recurrent and conditional convolutions is a novel contribution, and the connection to temporal restricted Boltzmann machines is well-discussed.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The implementation of the approach in Python raises questions about the use of GPU acceleration, which could significantly impact the comparison with prior work and the method's overall performance. Additionally, the paper highlights accurate motion estimation as a traditional bottleneck for non-RNN based methods, which could be accelerated using GPU methods. The language issues present throughout the paper, including in the abstract and body text, need to be proofread and resolved by the authors.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach for multi-frame super resolution
* The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and significant speed improvements
* The connection to temporal restricted Boltzmann machines is well-discussed and provides a clear understanding of the proposed network
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The implementation of the approach in Python may not be optimized for performance
* The language issues present throughout the paper need to be addressed
* The comparison to prior work could be impacted by the use of GPU acceleration
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of multi-frame super resolution. With some revisions to address the language issues and implementation details, I would recommend accepting the paper for publication at NIPS.
