This paper proposes a novel gossip-style decentralized aggregation algorithm for computing higher-order statistics, including sample variance and correlation coefficients, across a network of nodes. The algorithm's key innovation is the use of a secondary state variable that represents each node's initial observation, allowing these observations to perform a random walk across the network. This approach enables the computation of U-statistics, which are essential for describing global properties of a statistical population.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence rate, establishing bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases, respectively. The authors also provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the superiority of their approach over existing methods, such as U2-gossip.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors should provide a clearer connection to existing work on gossip algorithms, such as the work by Dimakis et al. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on the induced distribution on edges from the "node wakes up, contacts neighbor" process, and more details should be provided on this aspect.
Furthermore, the authors should consider alternative approaches to the problem, such as allowing more memory at each node and using the contact process to flood values across the network. This could provide a useful comparison to their proposed algorithm. The authors should also explore related work on lifting constructions for accelerating gossip algorithms, such as the work by Jung, Shah, and Shin.
The analysis of gossip algorithms tends to make worst-case assumptions on the initial data distribution, which should be clarified in the problem statement and theorem. Moreover, the paper contains some minor errors and typos, such as directed graph implications and grammatical mistakes, which should be corrected.
In terms of experiments, the authors should include baseline comparisons and take a closer look at lifting constructions, such as LADA, to modify the related work. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of decentralized estimation, and with some revisions to address the aforementioned issues, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
