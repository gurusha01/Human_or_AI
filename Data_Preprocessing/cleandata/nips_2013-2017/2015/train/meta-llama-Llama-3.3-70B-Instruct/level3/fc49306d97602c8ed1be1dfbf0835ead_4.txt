This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence modeling by incorporating latent random variables into a recurrent neural network (RNN). The authors introduce a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) that models the dependencies between latent random variables across subsequent timesteps, allowing for more flexible and powerful modeling of complex sequences.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed model and its components. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the VRNN in modeling natural speech and handwriting sequences. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including a comparison with standard RNN models and an examination of the latent space.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to model complex sequences with a simple Gaussian distribution as the output function, whereas standard RNN models require more powerful output functions such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The authors also demonstrate the importance of temporal conditioning of the latent random variables, which allows the VRNN to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the motivation behind the proposed approach and the advantages of using latent random variables in sequence modeling. Additionally, the authors could provide more qualitative descriptions of the results, such as visualizations of the generated sequences or examples of the captured temporal dependencies.
The choice of likelihood in Eq. 8 is also questionable, and the authors could consider using a simpler loss function. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a comparison with other related models, such as kernel CCA, and an examination of the effect of varying the latent dimension on precision and runtime.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques, including RNNs and variational autoencoders. While the idea of using latent random variables in sequence modeling is not new, the authors' approach to modeling temporal dependencies between latent variables is original and contributes to the state-of-the-art in sequence modeling.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are impressive. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of sequence modeling.
