This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of their algorithms, establishing bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases, respectively. The paper is technically sound, with nontrivial results that establish interesting findings on recovering U-statistics from decentralized data.
The proof of Theorem 1 presents the core idea and is a crucial observation for follow-up research. The authors' approach is based on an original reformulation of the problem using "phantom nodes," which allows them to model the data propagation and averaging steps separately. The transition matrix of the system is well-defined, and the expected state evolution is clearly described.
However, there are some concerns regarding the paper's claims. The authors state that one sample suffices to achieve strong statistical guarantees, but the current proof does not support this claim due to an error in the bounding of the Frobenius norm of the error. Additionally, there are several small errors in the proofs in the Supplementary Material, including typos, undefined terms, and unexplained inequalities.
The authors' statement that their bound is minimax optimal is unclear, as it is not specified with respect to what class the minimax optimality is claimed. Furthermore, the definition of the Hessian in Line 323 is unclear and could benefit from further clarification.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, its thorough analysis of convergence rates, and its experimental evaluation on real datasets. The authors demonstrate the practical interest of their algorithms through comparisons with existing methods, such as U2-gossip.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new approach to computing U-statistics, which is a novel combination of familiar techniques. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions and adequately reference related work.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in decentralized estimation and computation. The authors' algorithms could be used in various applications, such as sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed computing.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results. However, the concerns regarding the paper's claims and errors in the proofs need to be addressed.
