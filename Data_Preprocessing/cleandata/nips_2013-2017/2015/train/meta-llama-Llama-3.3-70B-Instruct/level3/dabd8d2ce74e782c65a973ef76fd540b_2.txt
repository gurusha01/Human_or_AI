This paper proposes a new approach to inference for a low-rank matrix factorization model with ordinal data, specifically in the context of collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. The authors provide performance guarantees for their approach, including an upper bound on the resulting error with finite samples and a matching information-theoretic lower bound. However, it is unclear if the models used are new contributions or just the inference approach.
The quality of the theory is good, but the clarity of the paper is poor, requiring significant editing to address minor and major issues with the flow of ideas. The originality of the contribution is mediocre, as low-rank matrix factorization has been addressed from many angles before, making the contribution appear incremental.
The paper lacks comparison to other methods, either empirically or theoretically, and fails to discuss the implications of the contributions, making the practical impact unclear. The authors provide some numerical experiments, but these are limited and do not fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more context and comparison to existing work, as well as more extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the significance of the contribution. Additionally, the paper needs thorough editing for clarity, and the contributions should be compared to other methods on real or synthetic data to demonstrate their significance.
