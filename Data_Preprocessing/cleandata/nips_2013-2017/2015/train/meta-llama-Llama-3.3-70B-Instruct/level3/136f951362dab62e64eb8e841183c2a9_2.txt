This paper proposes a novel approach to high-dimensional structured estimation with norm-regularized estimators, such as Lasso, when the design matrix and noise are drawn from sub-exponential distributions. The authors establish results for the norm-regularized estimation problem under this assumption, which is a significant departure from the existing literature that relies on sub-Gaussian distributions.
The paper's main contribution is the relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which allows for the extension of existing analysis techniques to the sub-exponential case. The authors also obtain bounds on the estimation error and the regularization parameter, and provide experimental results to validate their theory.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, and their results have important implications for high-dimensional statistical estimation. The experimental results are also well-designed and provide strong evidence for the theory.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The writing could be improved, with some sections being dense and difficult to follow. Additionally, the authors could provide more context and motivation for the problem, as well as a clearer explanation of the significance of their results. The experimental results could also be more comprehensive, with additional comparisons to other methods and a more detailed analysis of the results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance.
