This paper proposes a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in serial section EM images using a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture. The authors introduce several innovations, including increased depth, the use of 3D filters, and a recursive training framework. The proposed architecture, VD2D3D, outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D ConvNet baseline, N4, and demonstrates significant improvements in boundary detection accuracy.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The use of visualizations and quantitative results effectively demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the biological inspiration behind their recursive framework, which adds a unique perspective to the work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its technical soundness. The authors provide a detailed description of their architecture and training procedures, making it possible for others to reproduce their results. The use of ZNN, a novel implementation of 3D ConvNets, is also a significant contribution, as it enables efficient training of large networks on multicore CPUs.
However, the paper's novelty and significance are somewhat limited by the fact that the results improve existing bounds only by small constant factors. While the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, it is not clear whether this will have a significant impact on the field of connectomics or other applications. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying the proposed architecture.
In terms of originality, the paper combines several existing techniques in a novel way, but the individual components are not particularly new. The use of 3D filters and recursive training is inspired by previous work, and the authors could have provided more context and comparison to existing approaches.
Overall, the paper is a solid contribution to the field of computer vision and connectomics, but its impact and significance could be further enhanced by more detailed analysis and comparison to existing work.
