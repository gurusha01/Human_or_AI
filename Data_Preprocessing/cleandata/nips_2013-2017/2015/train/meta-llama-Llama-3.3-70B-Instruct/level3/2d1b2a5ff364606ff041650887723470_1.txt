This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation, particularly in the context of non-linear measurements. The authors derive asymptotic guarantees for the generalized square-root LASSO applied to Gaussian measurements with optional non-linear transformation. The paper provides a precise characterization of the method's performance, which is a notable strength.
The authors' approach is well-motivated, and their results are carefully presented. The paper is well-written, despite containing several typos, especially in the proof section. The authors have done an excellent job of relating their work to previous research in the field, including the work of Brillinger and Plan and Vershynin.
The paper's main contribution is the derivation of explicit expressions for the estimation performance of the generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements. The authors show that the estimation performance of the generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear, with a scaling factor μ and noise variance σ^2. This result is a significant advancement in the field and has important implications for signal processing and estimation.
The paper also explores the application of the results to q-bit compressive sensing, which is a relevant and timely topic. The authors demonstrate how their results can be used to optimize quantization thresholds and levels, which is a critical problem in compressive sensing.
