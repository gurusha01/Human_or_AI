This paper proposes a novel approach to retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream, extending the traditional single-image single-sentence setup to a more realistic and challenging scenario. The authors introduce a multimodal architecture called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Network (CRCN), which effectively captures the relationships between a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. The CRCN model consists of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model, allowing it to learn the semantic relations between long streams of images and text.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear problem statement and solid techniques used to solve it. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the novelty of their own. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, using both quantitative measures (e.g., BLEU, top-K recall) and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the CRCN approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are some limitations and potential issues with the paper. The method for generating a sequence of natural sentences is reasonable but primitive, relying on direct association with training images and simple concatenation. The paper also lacks anonymity, as the authors appear to be the same as those in a referenced paper, and the dataset used has not been disclosed or described in detail. Furthermore, the proposed neural network model has a potential technical issue, with Equation (2) possibly being incorrect, implying a lack of full connectivity in the network.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The clarity of the paper is excellent, with a well-organized structure and clear explanations of the methodology and results. The originality of the paper is high, as it addresses a new problem and proposes a novel approach to solve it. The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to impact the field of computer vision and natural language processing.
