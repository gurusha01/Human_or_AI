This paper presents a novel approach to sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, a problem that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its applications in various fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and data analysis. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the concept of tensor contraction to reduce the problem to a series of sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition problems, which can be solved using well-established convex techniques.
The paper's strong points include its in-depth theoretical analysis, which provides rigorous guarantees for the algorithm's performance under certain conditions. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments, showcasing its ability to accurately recover the sparse and low-rank components of a tensor.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to extend the approach of Lemonnier et al. to deal with anytime influence bounds, providing strict theoretical bounds for information cascades. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's computational complexity, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For instance, the experiments could be more comprehensive, with additional cases and scenarios tested to further validate the algorithm's performance. The authors could also explore the application of their approach to other domains, such as image and video processing, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
