This paper proposes a novel approach to computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting using gossip algorithms. The authors introduce two algorithms, GoSta-sync and GoSta-async, which achieve faster convergence rates and lower memory and communication costs compared to existing methods. The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the theoretical analysis.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new approach to computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The provision of a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms, including convergence rates and bounds.
* The presentation of numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
However, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed:
* The experiment section is somewhat limited, and additional comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods would be beneficial to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach and its potential impact on the field.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The proposed approach is novel and significantly different from existing methods.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms, including convergence rates and bounds.
* The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experiment section is somewhat limited, and additional comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods would be beneficial.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach and its potential impact on the field.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, but with the suggestion that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly by adding more comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods and discussing the potential applications and impact of the proposed approach.
