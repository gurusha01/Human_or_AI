This paper introduces the HONOR algorithm, a hybrid optimization method for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The algorithm combines a quasi-Newton step with a gradient descent step, leveraging second-order information to accelerate convergence while ensuring theoretical guarantees. The paper provides a rigorous convergence analysis, demonstrating that every limit point of the sequence generated by HONOR is a Clarke critical point.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its components. The convergence analysis is thorough, and the authors address the challenges of non-convex optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HONOR, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms on large-scale datasets.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, as it proposes a new algorithm for non-convex sparse learning problems, and its thorough analysis, which provides a solid foundation for the method. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are convincing.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the relationship between HONOR and existing methods, such as DC programming and SparseNet. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the value of Ç«, and its impact on the algorithm's performance.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides sufficient information for the reader to reproduce the results. The authors demonstrate the importance of the problem and the potential impact of their method on the field.
