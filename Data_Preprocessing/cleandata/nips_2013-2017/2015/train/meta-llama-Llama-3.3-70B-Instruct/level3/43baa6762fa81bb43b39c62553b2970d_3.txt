This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, HONOR, for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The algorithm incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence and uses a hybrid optimization scheme to guarantee convergence. The paper provides a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that every limit point of the sequence generated by HONOR is a Clarke critical point.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The proposed algorithm is well-motivated, and the convergence analysis is detailed and convincing. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HONOR in solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient optimization algorithm for non-convex regularized sparse learning problems
* A rigorous convergence analysis, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the algorithm
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of HONOR in solving large-scale problems
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the applications and implications of the proposed algorithm
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and additional explanations or references could be helpful
* The experimental results could be further strengthened by comparing HONOR to other state-of-the-art algorithms and providing more detailed analysis of the results
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of optimization and machine learning. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses, the paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance.
