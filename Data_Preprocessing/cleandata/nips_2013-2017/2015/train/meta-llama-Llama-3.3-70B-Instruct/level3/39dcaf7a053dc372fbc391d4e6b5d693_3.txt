This paper proposes a novel deep convolutional network architecture for segmenting neurons in EM image stacks, introducing a new arrangement of filters in deep networks and incorporating 3D filters. The authors improve upon previous methods, achieving a substantial gain in accuracy through three innovations: increased depth, incorporation of 3D filters, and recursive training of convolutional networks. The paper is well-written, clear, and of good quality, making it a valuable contribution to the field of neuroscience.
The strengths of this paper include its novelty, particularly in the detailed architecture, and its potential to advance the state of the art in neuronal boundary detection. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including quantitative and qualitative results, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed 2D-3D ConvNet combined with recursive training. The use of ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks, is also a significant contribution, offering a viable alternative to mainstream GPU-based deep learning frameworks.
The weaknesses of this paper are relatively minor. While the authors provide a thorough discussion of their approach, some readers may find the technical details overwhelming. Additionally, the paper may benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the field.
