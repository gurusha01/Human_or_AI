This paper presents a novel approach for generating sentence sequences to describe image streams, leveraging a multimodal architecture called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Networks (CRCN). The CRCN integrates convolutional neural networks for image representation, bidirectional recurrent neural networks for sentence sequence modeling, and a local coherence model to ensure fluent transitions between sentences. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through quantitative evaluation and user studies on large collections of blog posts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the problem and related work, highlighting the novelty of the proposed approach. The architecture of the CRCN is well-explained, and the authors provide sufficient details about the training procedure and experimental setup.
The experimental results are impressive, with the CRCN approach outperforming baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of their approach and identifying areas for future improvement.
One of the key strengths of this paper is its ability to address a challenging problem in a novel and effective way. The authors' use of a multimodal architecture and local coherence model allows them to generate sentence sequences that are not only descriptive but also fluent and coherent. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the approach, using both quantitative metrics and user studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper. Some of the figures and tables could be improved for clarity, and there are a few typos and formatting errors throughout the text. Additionally, some of the related work could be more thoroughly discussed, particularly in the context of multimodal architectures and sentence generation.
