This paper presents a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential. The main contribution of this work is the establishment of a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which allows for the extension of existing analysis techniques from the sub-Gaussian case to the sub-exponential case.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem setup, background, and contributions. The theoretical results presented in the paper are interesting and well-presented, with powerful interpretations. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the recovery bounds for `1 and group-sparse norms, and the results are compared to the sub-Gaussian case.
However, the paper has some writing issues, including typos, missing punctuation, and undefined concepts, which hinder the reading experience, particularly from page 4 onwards. The description of the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe method is problematic due to repeated words, undefined concepts, and weird sentences.
The experimental section is weak, with figures that are hard to read and a lack of commentary on the corroboration of theoretical results. The paper lacks consistency in bibliography formatting and would benefit from a conclusions section and reorganization of certain sections, such as Section 4.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The problems or approaches presented in the paper are new, and the work differs from previous contributions. The results are important, and other people are likely to use these ideas or build on them.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the writing issues, improve the clarity of the description of the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe method, and strengthen the experimental section.
