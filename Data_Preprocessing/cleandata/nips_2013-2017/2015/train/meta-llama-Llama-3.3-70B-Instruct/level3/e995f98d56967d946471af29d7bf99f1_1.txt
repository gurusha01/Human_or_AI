This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use Monte Carlo tree search and progressive widening to approximate the optimal policy. The approach is evaluated on three tasks: named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification, and shows significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods.
The paper's strength lies in its simplicity and comprehensive empirical testing, with clear definitions of model and inference assumptions. The method shows significant empirical gains across several tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing cost and improving accuracy. However, the paper lacks comparison to other methods with similar goals, such as early-update perceptron with beam search and SEARN, which the authors dismiss as non-applicable. The reviewer disagrees with this dismissal, as these methods share similarities with the proposed approach.
The paper's approach is similar to SEARN and reinforcement learning algorithms, but with a key difference in learning the policy versus using a schedule. The results show improvement, but the parsing results are still behind state-of-the-art, and the speech results use a unique setup. The reviewer raises questions about the performance changes based on footnote 1 and the effect of flipping on a token level versus an example level.
The paper is well-written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a clear motivation for the work, a thorough explanation of the approach, and a detailed evaluation of the results. The paper also provides a good overview of related work, highlighting the differences and similarities between the proposed approach and existing methods.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also original, proposing a novel framework for on-the-job learning that differs from previous contributions. The significance of the paper lies in its ability to reduce cost and improve accuracy in real-world applications, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution, meeting the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The reviewer recommends acceptance, but suggests that the authors address the limitations and comparisons to other methods in future work.
