This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of their algorithms, demonstrating that they outperform existing methods. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of new algorithms for computing U-statistics, which is a significant contribution to the field of decentralized estimation.
* A thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms, including explicit data and network-dependent terms.
* Numerical experiments that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over existing methods.
However, there are some areas that require improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a brief explanation of the irrepresentability condition for learning Gaussian MRFs to improve clarity.
* The dependence of Theorem 3.5 on the condition in (3.4) should be clarified, and the authors should discuss how random initialization satisfies this condition.
* The paper contains potentially contradictory statements about learning a simple Gaussian MRF with one sample, which need to be qualified or corrected.
* There are a few typos that should be corrected to improve readability.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, which is a significant contribution to the field.
