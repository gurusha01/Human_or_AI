This paper presents a novel approach to statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. The authors propose a universal kernel for persistence diagrams, which enables the use of this topological summary representation in the framework of embedding probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The paper is well-written and clearly presents the main ideas, relating them to previous work in the field.
The proposed kernel, called the universal persistence scale-space (u-PSS) kernel, is a modification of the persistence scale space (PSS) kernel introduced in previous work. The authors prove that the u-PSS kernel is universal with respect to the metric dW,1, which is a significant contribution to the field. The universality of the kernel allows for a principled solution to the problem of two-sample hypothesis testing on persistence diagrams.
The experiments presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the u-PSS kernel in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic and real-world data. The results show that the kernel can detect statistically significant differences in the persistent homology of different groups, which is a promising application in various fields such as medical imaging and computer vision.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a universal kernel for persistence diagrams, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The clear presentation of the main ideas and their relation to previous work.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the u-PSS kernel in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The restriction of the set D to a compact metric space, which may limit the applicability of the kernel in certain scenarios.
* The lack of a clear guideline on how to choose the HKS time, which may affect the results of the experiments.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of topological data analysis and has the potential to impact various applications in medical imaging, computer vision, and other fields. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
