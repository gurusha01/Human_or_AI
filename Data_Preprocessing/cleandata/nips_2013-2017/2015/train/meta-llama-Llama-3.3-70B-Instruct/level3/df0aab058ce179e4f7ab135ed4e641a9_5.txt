This paper proposes a novel deep factor analysis model with posterior constraints, optimized using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a projection in the E-step. The introduction of posterior regularization to a deep factor analysis model and its solution using a projected EM algorithm is a significant contribution, being the first of its kind. The paper demonstrates consistent improvement over other unsupervised methods, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, the paper lacks clarity in Section 2, with complicated writing that could be simplified for better understanding. Additionally, the claimed speedup of the algorithm over the regular Newton method is unclear due to unexplained step computations and lacks comparative timing analysis with other methods.
The experimental results show mixed performance, with the proposed method exceling in reconstruction but not in sparsity, and demonstrating limited improvement in pre-training experiments, particularly on larger datasets like CIFAR. To solidify its claims of effectiveness, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive experiments on real and larger datasets.
The strengths of the paper include its novel contribution to the field of deep factor analysis and its ability to improve upon existing methods. The weaknesses include the lack of clarity in certain sections and the need for more comprehensive experiments. 
Arguments pro acceptance:
- The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of deep factor analysis.
