This paper proposes a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network (BRCN) for multi-frame super resolution, which extends the convolutional network into the temporal domain with feature maps dependent on time. The authors claim that their model can efficiently learn the temporal dependency for multi-frame SR and achieve state-of-the-art performance. 
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed model and its components. The use of bidirectional recurrent and conditional convolutions is a novel aspect of the paper, and the authors provide a good motivation for their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, with significant improvements over existing multi-frame SR methods.
However, there are some shortcomings in the paper. The authors do not provide enough detail on the pretraining process of the feedforward weights, which makes it unclear if this step is necessary for the model to work as intended. Additionally, the filter visualization section is not very illuminating, and the presence of ringing artifacts in some images is not adequately addressed. The paper also lacks citations for bidirectional RNNs and a clear motivation for the architecture.
The strengths of the paper include the novel use of bidirectional recurrent and conditional convolutions for temporal dependency modeling, which provides significant gains in performance. The model is also orders of magnitude faster than other multi-frame SR methods, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of clarity on dealing with edge effects, the non-illuminating filter visualization section, and the presence of ringing artifacts in some images. Additionally, the paper could provide more insight into why the method works well compared to existing methods.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a novel approach to multi-frame SR. However, the paper could be improved with more detail on the pretraining process, a clearer motivation for the architecture, and a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the approach.
