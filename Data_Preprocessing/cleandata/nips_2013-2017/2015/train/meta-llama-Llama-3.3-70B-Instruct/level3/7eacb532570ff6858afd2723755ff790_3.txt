This paper proposes a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) for object detection, which shares convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The RPN is a fully-convolutional network that predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position, and is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals. The authors also propose a simple alternating optimization scheme to train the RPN and Fast R-CNN object detection network to share convolutional features.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the RPN architecture, training procedure, and experimental results. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RPN in improving object detection accuracy and reducing computational cost. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the recall-to-IoU metric and compare their method with other state-of-the-art object detection systems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel RPN architecture that shares convolutional features with the detection network, reducing computational cost and improving object detection accuracy.
* The introduction of a simple alternating optimization scheme to train the RPN and Fast R-CNN object detection network to share convolutional features.
* The thorough analysis of the recall-to-IoU metric and comparison with other state-of-the-art object detection systems.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of analysis on the impact of violating the Plackett-Luce assumption, which could add significant value to the research.
* The limited evaluation of the RPN on other object detection datasets and tasks, which could demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method.
* The comparison with other state-of-the-art object detection systems is limited to a few methods, and a more comprehensive comparison would be beneficial.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed RPN architecture and training scheme are novel and effective. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the RPN in improving object detection accuracy and reducing computational cost. However, further analysis and evaluation on other datasets and tasks would be beneficial to demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the proposed method.
