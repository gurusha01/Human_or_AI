This paper proposes a multinomial logit model to describe user preferences in collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling contexts. The authors utilize a low-rank matrix to capture underlying preferences and provide a polynomial-time inference algorithm to learn the model from noisy observations. The algorithm overcomes the intractability of Maximum Likelihood estimation for the general MNL model.
The paper's strengths include:
1. Novel application of multinomial logit model: The authors apply the MNL model to collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling, which is a new and interesting direction.
2. Polynomial-time inference algorithm: The proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
3. Theoretical guarantees: The authors provide upper bounds on the error of the proposed algorithm and prove minimax-optimality, which demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness.
4. Identification of limitations: The authors acknowledge the weaknesses of the model and provide potential directions for future research.
However, there are some weaknesses:
1. Suboptimal dependence on dynamic range: The error bound's dependence on the dynamic range α is suboptimal, which may limit the algorithm's performance in practice.
2. Limited experimental evaluation: The paper lacks extensive experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, which would help to demonstrate the algorithm's practical effectiveness.
3. Assumptions on sampling model: The authors assume a specific sampling model, which may not always hold in practice.
To improve the paper, the authors could:
1. Tighten the error bound: Improve the dependence on the dynamic range α to make the algorithm more robust.
2. Conduct extensive experiments: Evaluate the algorithm on real-world datasets to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.
3. Relax assumptions on sampling model: Consider more general sampling models to make the algorithm more applicable to real-world scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. With some improvements, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
