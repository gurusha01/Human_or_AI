This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis, addressing the crucial problem of reusing a holdout set for validation in the adaptive setting. The authors propose two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting to the holdout set.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of adaptive data analysis and the need for reusable holdout sets. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithms, including theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify different techniques, such as differential privacy and description length, under a single framework of approximate max-information. This framework provides a new perspective on the problem of adaptive data analysis and enables the authors to derive generalization guarantees for adaptive sequences of algorithms.
However, the paper could benefit from more detailed discussions of certain technical terms, such as "birth-death bounded," to increase its accessibility to a broader audience. Additionally, the proof of Proposition 2 is unclear, and the equation f(\mathcal{R}) = \mathcal{S} may require further explanation.
The experimental validation is limited, and the authors could benefit from comparing their methods to other approaches, such as permutation tests or shape analysis, to demonstrate the superiority of their algorithms. Furthermore, the novelty of the paper is somewhat reduced by the recent publication of a similar kernel, and the experimental results do not demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas. The paper also presents a novel combination of techniques and addresses a significant problem in the field of adaptive data analysis.
