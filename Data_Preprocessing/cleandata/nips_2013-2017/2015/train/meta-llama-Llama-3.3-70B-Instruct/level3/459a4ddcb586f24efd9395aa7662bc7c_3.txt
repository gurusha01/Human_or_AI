This paper proposes a new sampler for mixture models based on homogeneous completely random measures, which combines the benefits of conditional and marginal samplers. The authors utilize results from Pitman's work to derive a Gibbs sampling scheme for Poisson-Kingman mixture models, demonstrating favorable performance in terms of runtime and effective sample size.
The paper is well-executed, clearly written, and provides an important tool for the Bayesian non-parametrics community, particularly for mixture models based on normalized CRMs. The key technical insight of the paper is representing the "surplus mass" as a variable in the sampler and obtaining its complete conditional distribution using Pitman's results.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and its significance, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper also provides a unique theoretical approach and is well-motivated by previous work in the field.
However, there are some potential weaknesses to consider. The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with Bayesian non-parametrics and mixture models, which may make it difficult for readers without a strong background in these areas to follow. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampler in practice.
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of Bayesian non-parametrics and mixture models. The proposed sampler has the potential to be a useful tool for researchers and practitioners working in this area.
