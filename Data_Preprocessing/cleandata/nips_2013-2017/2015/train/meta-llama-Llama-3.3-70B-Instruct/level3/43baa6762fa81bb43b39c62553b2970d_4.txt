This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, HONOR, for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The algorithm incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence and uses a hybrid optimization scheme to guarantee convergence. The paper provides a rigorous convergence analysis and demonstrates the efficiency of HONOR through experiments on large-scale data sets.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to handle non-convex problems, which is a challenging task in optimization. The use of second-order information and a hybrid optimization scheme are innovative and effective in improving convergence. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of HONOR over state-of-the-art algorithms, such as GIST.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The lack of proper context and related work, particularly in the area of convex demixing, makes it difficult to fully appreciate the contributions of the paper. The local incoherence condition, while interesting, is not testable in practice, which limits its usefulness. Additionally, the paper's use of a weighted norm is not clearly separated from existing knowledge, making it difficult to assess the novelty of the contribution.
The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thorough and well-presented. The convergence analysis is rigorous and provides a solid foundation for the algorithm. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of HONOR.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective optimization algorithm for non-convex regularized sparse learning problems.
* The convergence analysis is rigorous and provides a solid foundation for the algorithm.
* The experiments demonstrate the superiority of HONOR over state-of-the-art algorithms.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper lacks proper context and related work, particularly in the area of convex demixing.
* The local incoherence condition is not testable in practice, which limits its usefulness.
* The paper's use of a weighted norm is not clearly separated from existing knowledge, making it difficult to assess the novelty of the contribution.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the contributions are significant. However, the lack of proper context and related work, as well as the limitations of the local incoherence condition, are notable weaknesses. With some revisions to address these issues, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
