This paper proposes a novel approach to learning vector representations of entire sentences using an encoder-decoder model, which is trained in an unsupervised fashion using a large corpus of text. The model, called skip-thoughts, uses gated RNNs for encoding and decoding functions and is able to learn semantically meaningful and useful representations that can be used for training classifiers. The authors evaluate their model on eight different tasks, including semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, and sentiment classification, and show that it performs competitively or better than many existing systems.
The strengths of this paper include the novelty of the approach, the quality of the results, and the clarity of the writing. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their model and its components, and the experimental results are well-presented and easy to understand. The use of a large corpus of text and the evaluation on multiple tasks also demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the model.
However, there are also some weaknesses to the paper. One of the main limitations is the lack of clarity in the experimental results section, which makes it unclear if some numbers are from the literature or reproduced from scratch. This may affect the validity of the comparisons and the conclusions drawn from the results. Additionally, the gated RNN implementation of skip-thoughts has a potential weakness of being difficult to train, taking more than a week, and may not be more efficient than paragraph vectors in terms of inference time.
Another potential weakness is that the evaluation could be extended to include additional sentence pairs that demonstrate the improvement of skip-thoughts over the baseline, particularly in cases with poor lexical similarity but high semantic similarity. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a clear explanation of the model and its components. The results are also significant and demonstrate the potential of the model for a wide range of applications.

Arguments con acceptance:
* The lack of clarity in the experimental results section may affect the validity of the comparisons and the conclusions drawn from the results.
* The gated RNN implementation of skip-thoughts has a potential weakness of being difficult to train and may not be more efficient than paragraph vectors in terms of inference time.
