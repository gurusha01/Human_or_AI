This paper proposes a novel algorithm, HONOR, for efficient implementations of non-convex sparse learning formulations. The algorithm incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence without solving regularized quadratic programming, making it scalable to large-size problems with low computational complexity. The paper establishes a rigorous convergence analysis for HONOR, guaranteeing convergence even for non-convex problems through a hybrid optimization scheme. Empirical evaluation using large-scale datasets demonstrates that HONOR converges significantly faster than state-of-the-art algorithms, with potential to escape high error plateaus in high-dimensional non-convex problems.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to handle non-convex problems, which is a challenging task in optimization. The algorithm's fast convergence rate and potential extension to other sparsity-inducing penalties are notable aspects. The paper provides a thorough convergence analysis, which is essential for understanding the behavior of the algorithm. The experimental results are also impressive, showing that HONOR outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence speed.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The algorithm's performance may degrade when the parameter ǫ is increased, and the ratio of GD-steps adopted in HONOR increases. Additionally, the algorithm may converge slower than state-of-the-art algorithms when ǫ is large enough. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the QN-step and GD-step, and the impact of the parameter ǫ on the algorithm's performance.
