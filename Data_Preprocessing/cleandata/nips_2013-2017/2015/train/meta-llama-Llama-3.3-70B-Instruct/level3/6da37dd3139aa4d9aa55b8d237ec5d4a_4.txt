This paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised learning of generic sentence representations, called skip-thought vectors. The method is based on an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage, using a large collection of novels as training data. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of skip-thought vectors as an off-the-shelf sentence representation with linear classifiers across 8 tasks, including semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, and sentiment classification.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach, including the encoder-decoder model, the objective function, and the vocabulary expansion method. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the method, including comparisons with state-of-the-art models and baselines. The results show that skip-thought vectors perform well on all tasks considered, highlighting the robustness of the representations.
One of the strengths of the paper is the simplicity and scalability of the approach. The authors use a simple linear model on top of the skip-thought vectors, which makes it easy to reproduce and apply the method to other tasks. The paper also provides a good analysis of the results, including visualizations of the skip-thought vectors using t-SNE.
However, there are some limitations and potential weaknesses of the approach. One of the limitations is that the method relies on a large collection of novels as training data, which may not be representative of other domains or genres. The authors also assume that the sentences in the training data are contiguous, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the method may not perform well on tasks that require more nuanced or context-dependent representations.
Some potential areas for improvement include exploring other encoder-decoder architectures, such as deep encoders and decoders, and using larger context windows. The authors also mention the possibility of encoding and decoding paragraphs, which could potentially lead to even higher-quality representations.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable and useful. The strengths of the paper include its simplicity, scalability, and robustness, while the limitations and potential weaknesses provide opportunities for future research and improvement.
