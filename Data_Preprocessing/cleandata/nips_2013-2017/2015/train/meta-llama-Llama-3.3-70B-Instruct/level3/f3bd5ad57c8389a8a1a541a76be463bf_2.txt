This paper introduces a new approach to adaptive data analysis, focusing on the problem of reusing a holdout set for validation while avoiding overfitting. The authors propose two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting. The paper also introduces a new notion, approximate max-information, which unifies the generalization arguments that come from both differential privacy and description length.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are presented in a clear and concise manner. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms and their properties, including their generalization guarantees and composition properties. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in preventing overfitting and providing a valid estimate of classifier accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new approach to adaptive data analysis, which addresses the problem of reusing a holdout set for validation while avoiding overfitting.
* The proposal of two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting.
* The introduction of a new notion, approximate max-information, which unifies the generalization arguments that come from both differential privacy and description length.
* The thorough analysis of the algorithms and their properties, including their generalization guarantees and composition properties.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in preventing overfitting and providing a valid estimate of classifier accuracy.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the analyst has full access to the training set and the holdout algorithm only prevents overfitting to the holdout dataset. This assumption may not always hold in practice.
* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with existing approaches to adaptive data analysis, which would be helpful in understanding the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
* The experimental results are limited to a single scenario, and it would be helpful to see more extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in practice. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach in preventing overfitting and providing a valid estimate of classifier accuracy, and the introduction of approximate max-information provides a new perspective on the problem of generalization in adaptive data analysis.
