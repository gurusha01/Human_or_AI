This paper proposes a novel method for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling from piecewise continuous distributions, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC). The method modifies the traditional leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics to account for reflections and refractions at the boundaries of the distribution's support. The authors prove that RHMC preserves the correct stationary distribution and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and technical details of the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the volume preservation property of the RHMC algorithm, which is a crucial aspect of ensuring that the method produces samples from the correct distribution.
The experiments demonstrate that RHMC outperforms traditional HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings in terms of effective sample size, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the computational cost of RHMC and its improved performance.
The paper's strengths include its clear exposition, rigorous analysis, and convincing experimental results. The method has the potential to be widely applicable in various fields where piecewise continuous distributions are encountered.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the computational cost of detecting the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which is a critical component of the RHMC algorithm. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments comparing RHMC to other sampling methods, such as Gibbs sampling or slice sampling, to further demonstrate its effectiveness.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and easy to follow. The method is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of probabilistic inference. The experiments are convincing, and the results are important for practitioners and researchers in the field.
