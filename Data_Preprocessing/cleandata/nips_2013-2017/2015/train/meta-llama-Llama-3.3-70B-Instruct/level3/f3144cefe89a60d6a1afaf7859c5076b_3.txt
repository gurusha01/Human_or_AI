This paper introduces the Principal Differences Analysis (PDA) framework for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. The method operates by finding the projection that maximizes the Wasserstein divergence between the resulting univariate populations. The paper is technically sound, providing an interesting alternative for counts data. However, the experimental evaluations are sloppy and lack supporting evidence, making it difficult to compare results and verify claims.
The connection between the proposed gamma units and rectified linear nonlinearities is interesting and worth discussing further. The non-linearities induced by gamma units appear to subsume the linear regime of rectified linear nonlinearity. The paper presents a Poisson gamma hierarchy for modeling counts data, utilizing a hierarchy of gamma distributions and clever augmentation tricks to develop a simple Gibbs sampler.
The paper has scalability concerns with its inference procedure, particularly with deeper architectures. The lack of discussion on computational issues, such as training time for 5-layer networks, and the failure to provide sufficient evidence for claims, such as the ability to generate interpretable synthetic documents from the trained network, are notable weaknesses.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness and the introduction of a novel framework for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. The use of the Wasserstein distance as a measure of dissimilarity between populations is a natural choice, and the development of a semi-definite relaxation for use with this distance is a significant contribution.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a new approach to analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of the Wasserstein distance and the development of a semi-definite relaxation are novel and worth discussing further.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and the results have the potential to be used in a variety of applications.
Overall, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses. While it presents a novel and technically sound framework for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions, it has scalability concerns and lacks sufficient evidence to support some of its claims. With further development and refinement, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
