This paper presents a novel Bayesian global optimization method, Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves an exponential convergence rate without the need for auxiliary optimization or δ-cover sampling. The algorithm combines the strengths of bound-based search methods and Gaussian process (GP) optimization, leveraging the information encoded in the GP prior to reduce the degree of unknownness of the semi-metric.
The paper is well-organized, with clear descriptions of the algorithm and its components. The authors provide a good illustrative example and a detailed explanation of the algorithm, making it easy to understand and implement. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of IMGPO in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The algorithm's ability to achieve an exponential convergence rate without auxiliary optimization or δ-cover sampling, making it a unique contribution to the field.
* The use of a bound-based search method that relies less on the estimated bound, allowing for more flexibility and robustness.
* The provision of a practically oriented analysis framework, enabling the understanding of why not relying on a particular bound is advantageous.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm's computational complexity, which may be higher than other methods due to the need to compute the upper confidence bound (UCB) for each iteration.
* The choice of hyperparameters, such as Ξmax, which may require careful tuning for optimal performance.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization, and the algorithm has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains. The authors have provided a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand.
