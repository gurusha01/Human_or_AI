This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation, providing a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential. The authors establish a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which enables them to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain precise sample complexity bounds for sub-exponential designs.
The paper is well-written and solid, with a clear introduction to the problem and a thorough explanation of the contributions. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the recovery bounds for `1 and group-sparse norms, and their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to generalize existing analysis techniques for sub-Gaussian designs to the sub-exponential case. The authors show that the dependence on Gaussian width is replaced by the exponential width of suitable sets associated with the norm, and they provide a sharp upper bound for the exponential width in terms of the Gaussian width.
However, the experimental part of the paper is somewhat weak, and the authors could benefit from comparing the performance of their approach with other methods. Additionally, the paper could be improved with more detailed proofs and a clearer explanation of the technical results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results, and their contributions are significant and original. The paper is well-suited for the NIPS conference, and it has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.
