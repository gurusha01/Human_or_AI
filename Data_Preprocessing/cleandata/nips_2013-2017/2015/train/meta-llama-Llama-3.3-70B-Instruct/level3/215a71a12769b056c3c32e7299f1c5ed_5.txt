This paper presents a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use Monte Carlo tree search and progressive widening to approximate the optimal policy. The system, called LENSE, is evaluated on three tasks: named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification, and achieves significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The technical core of the paper is sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance latency, cost, and accuracy objectives in a principled way. The use of Bayesian decision theory to trade off these objectives is a key contribution of the paper. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of their system, including the impact of crowd worker quality and the importance of using richer features to reduce the need for crowd supervision.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest exploring the application of the proposed method to larger datasets, such as ImageNet, to demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in more challenging settings. Additionally, the authors could consider providing more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach and its potential limitations in terms of scalability and real-time performance.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and crowdsourcing, and I would recommend it for acceptance. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its evaluation.
