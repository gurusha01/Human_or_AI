This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating an unknown signal from non-linear measurements. The authors extend the Generalized LASSO algorithm to handle non-linear measurements and provide a precise analysis of its performance. The main contribution of the paper is a precise evaluation of the asymptotic behavior of the error in the limit of large dimensions. The authors show that the error of the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as the error of the same algorithm when used under appropriately scaled noisy linear measurements.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance. The paper includes several numerical examples that illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a precise analysis of the algorithm's performance in the presence of non-linear measurements. The authors show that the error of the Generalized LASSO can be precisely predicted, and they provide a simple and efficient way to compute the optimal regularization parameter. The paper also includes a discussion of the related literature, which provides a clear context for the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One of the main limitations is that the analysis is asymptotic, and it is not clear how well the results will hold in finite dimensions. Additionally, the paper assumes that the measurement matrix has i.i.d. Gaussian entries, which may not be the case in practice. The authors also assume that the link function is unknown, which may not be the case in some applications.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance. The paper includes several numerical examples that illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity and organization. Some of the technical sections are dense and difficult to follow, and the authors could provide more intuition and motivation for the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related literature and the implications of the results.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field, and the results have the potential to be widely applicable. With some revisions to improve clarity and organization, the paper could be even stronger.
