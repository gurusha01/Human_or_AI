This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the efficiency of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for sampling from piecewise smooth distributions. The proposed method, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), modifies the traditional leapfrog dynamics to account for reflections and refractions at the boundaries of the distribution's support. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method, including a proof of its correctness and a demonstration of its improved performance over traditional HMC.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and its underlying principles. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in reducing the number of rejected samples and improving the overall efficiency of the sampling process.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and innovative approach to improve the efficiency of HMC for piecewise smooth distributions.
* A thorough analysis of the method, including a proof of its correctness and a demonstration of its improved performance over traditional HMC.
* Well-designed and informative experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in various settings.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method requires the ability to detect the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which can be computationally expensive.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for sampling from piecewise smooth distributions.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Monte Carlo methods and has the potential to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference in various applications.
