This paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream, extending both input and output dimensions to a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. The authors design a multimodal architecture called coherent recurrent convolutional network (CRCN), which integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. The approach directly learns from vast user-generated resources of blog posts as text-image parallel training data.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical details of the CRCN architecture are well-explained, and the experimental setup is thorough. The authors evaluate their approach using quantitative measures, such as BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR scores, as well as user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach for retrieving sentence sequences for an image stream, which is a more challenging and realistic problem than previous work on single-image sentence retrieval.
* The design of a multimodal architecture that integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model, which shows promising results in experiments.
* The use of a large dataset of blog posts with images, which provides a realistic and diverse setting for evaluating the approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns:
* The paper is quite long and dense, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow. Some sections, such as the related work section, could be condensed or summarized to improve the overall flow of the paper.
* The authors could provide more analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of the CRCN architecture and its components.
* The user study via Amazon Mechanical Turk is a good addition, but the authors could provide more details on the experimental design and the results, such as the number of participants, the instructions given to them, and the criteria used to evaluate the results.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and natural language processing, and the proposed approach shows promising results in experiments. However, some improvements in terms of clarity, analysis, and discussion of the results could make the paper even stronger.
