This paper presents a novel approach to sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, extending the work of Leurgans' algorithm for tensor factorization. The authors develop an efficient computational algorithm that reduces the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition via tensor contraction, allowing for the recovery of the constituent tensors. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance, including conditions for exact recovery and bounds on the incoherence parameters.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, technical soundness, and potential applicability to various machine learning tasks. The algorithm's ability to handle sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition is a significant contribution, and the theoretical guarantees provide a solid foundation for its performance. The paper is well-organized, and the notation is clear, making it easy to follow.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the tensor factors satisfy a "genericity" or "smoothness" assumption, which may not always hold in practice. Additionally, the algorithm's computational complexity, while efficient, may still be a bottleneck for very large tensors. The paper could benefit from more extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the algorithm's performance on real-world datasets and compare it to existing methods.
