This paper proposes a novel Gaussian Process (GP) optimization algorithm, called Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves an exponential convergence rate without the need for auxiliary optimization and Î´-cover sampling. The algorithm leverages the idea of considering infinitely many possible bounds, rather than relying on a single estimated bound, to improve the convergence rate.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of global optimization, and motivates the need for a new approach. The proposed algorithm is described in detail, along with its technical components, such as the use of hierarchical partitioning and the computation of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including a proof of its exponential convergence rate, and discusses the effects of the tightness of the UCB and the use of GP on the regret bound.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMGPO compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, including SOO, BaMSOO, GP-PI, and GP-EI, on a range of benchmark functions. The results show that IMGPO outperforms the other algorithms in general, although it can be slower than SOO.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement. The algorithm's scope is limited due to its inability to consider a large number of neighborhood connections and the presence of many approximations, which may affect its elegance and cleanness. Additionally, the experimental results are limited to a specific dataset, and it would be beneficial to test the algorithm on other popular datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of global optimization, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be useful in a wide range of applications. However, further work is needed to address the limitations and improve the algorithm's scalability and robustness.
