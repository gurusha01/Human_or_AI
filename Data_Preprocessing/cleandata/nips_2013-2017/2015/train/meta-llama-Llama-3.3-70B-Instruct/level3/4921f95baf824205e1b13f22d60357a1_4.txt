This paper provides a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation by extending the Generalized LASSO algorithm to handle non-linear measurements. The authors derive precise expressions for the asymptotic behavior of the error in the estimation of a structured signal from non-linear measurements, which is a crucial problem in many applications. 
The paper is well-written, and the authors have done an excellent job of motivating the problem, providing a clear overview of the contributions, and discussing the relevant literature. The technical results are sound, and the proofs are thorough and well-explained. The authors have also provided several examples and simulations to illustrate the accuracy of their predictions, which helps to build confidence in the results.
One of the key strengths of the paper is that it provides a unified framework for analyzing the performance of the Generalized LASSO algorithm under non-linear measurements. The authors show that the error in the estimation of the signal can be precisely predicted using a convex optimization program, which is a significant improvement over previous results that only provided upper bounds on the error.
The paper also has several interesting consequences, including the fact that the optimal quantizer for q-bit compressive sensing is the Lloyd-Max quantizer. This result is surprising, as the Lloyd-Max algorithm is typically used to minimize the mean squared error, not the error in the estimation of the signal.
