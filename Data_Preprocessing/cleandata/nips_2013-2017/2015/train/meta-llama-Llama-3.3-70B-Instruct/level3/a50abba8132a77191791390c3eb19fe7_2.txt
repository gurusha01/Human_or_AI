This paper presents a novel approach to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for piecewise smooth energy functions with affine boundaries. The proposed method, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), modifies the traditional leapfrog dynamics to account for reflections and refractions at the boundaries of the energy function. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method, including proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance, which ensures that the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the target distribution.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and its underlying principles. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in comparison to traditional HMC and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to generalize the work of Pakman and Paninski to arbitrary piecewise continuous distributions, without the need for a closed-form solution to the Hamiltonian dynamics. This makes the method more widely applicable and increases its potential impact on the field.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could discuss the limitations and potential drawbacks of the method, such as the increased computational cost of detecting intersections with polytope boundaries. Additionally, the experimental section could be strengthened by including more challenging domains and comparing the performance of RHMC to other state-of-the-art methods.
In terms of the reviewer guidelines, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method and its properties, and the writing is clear and easy to follow. The paper also presents a novel approach to HMC sampling, which is a significant contribution to the field.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of significance and impact. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in comparison to traditional HMC and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, it is not clear how widely applicable the method will be in practice. The authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and impact of the method, as well as its limitations and potential drawbacks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of HMC sampling, and with some additional work, it has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field.
