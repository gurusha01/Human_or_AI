This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use ideas from game playing to approximate the optimal policy. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
The paper's strengths include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The idea of using a stochastic game to model on-the-job learning is novel and interesting, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and their approach. The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements over baseline methods.
One of the paper's weaknesses is that it assumes a specific crowdsourcing setup, which may not be generalizable to other scenarios. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the differentiation of transform gates from simple initialization schemes, as mentioned in the reviewer guidelines.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The writing is polished, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work in the field.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and their approach. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
The paper's originality is one of its strongest aspects. The authors propose a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which combines ideas from game playing and crowdsourcing. The paper also provides a significant contribution to the field, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing cost and improving accuracy.
The paper's significance is also high. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in several experiments, and the results are impressive.
In conclusion, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of machine learning and crowdsourcing.
