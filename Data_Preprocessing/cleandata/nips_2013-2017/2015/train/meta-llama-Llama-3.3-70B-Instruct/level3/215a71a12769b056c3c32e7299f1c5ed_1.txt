This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use Monte Carlo tree search with progressive widening to approximate the optimal policy. The approach is evaluated on three tasks: named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification, and achieves significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results and discuss the implications of their work. However, there are some aspects that require clarification and improvement. 
Firstly, the modeling of the gate unit T with a standard sigmoid activation is unclear, and it would be helpful to provide more details on how backpropagation is performed in these networks. Additionally, the effect of initialization, particularly the use of constant negative biases, is unclear, and analyzing the performance with respect to the initial value of the bias could provide valuable insights.
Furthermore, the comparison to recent studies is unsatisfying due to unclear differences in experimental setups. The authors should clarify these differences to enable a more accurate comparison. Moreover, the use of "max" accuracies in tables is misleading, and reporting mean accuracy and standard deviation instead would provide a more statistically reasonable comparison.
From a learning theory perspective, it would be interesting to study how the gate units allow for propagating inputs through selective layers. This could provide a deeper understanding of the approach and its potential applications.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, and it is clear how this work differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the implications of their work.
The significance of the paper is evident, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results are important, and other people are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way and provides unique data, conclusions, and a theoretical approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the approach is novel and significant. However, some aspects require clarification and improvement, and addressing these issues could strengthen the paper.
