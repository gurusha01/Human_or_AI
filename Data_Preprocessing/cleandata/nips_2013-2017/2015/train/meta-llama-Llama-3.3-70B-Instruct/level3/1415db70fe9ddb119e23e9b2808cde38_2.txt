This paper proposes a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The authors introduce a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position, which can be trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals. The RPN is then unified with Fast R-CNN for object detection, using a simple alternating optimization scheme to train the two networks to share convolutional features.
The paper is well-organized, but some sections are dense and hard to follow, which could be improved with simplification for better reader understanding. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the RPN's performance, including ablation studies and comparisons with other region proposal methods. The results show that the RPN achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, while being significantly faster.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to address the computational bottleneck of region proposal computation in object detection systems. The authors demonstrate that their method can achieve state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012, while having a frame rate of 5fps on a GPU. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the recall-to-IoU metric, which is useful for diagnosing the proposal method.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of proposals and the IoU threshold for non-maximum suppression. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the importance of the truncation step in Algorithm 1 and the consequences of skipping it.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to region proposal generation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, which helps to contextualize their contributions. The paper's significance is evident in its ability to improve the efficiency and accuracy of object detection systems, which has important implications for real-world applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of object detection. With some minor improvements to clarity and discussion of hyperparameters, the paper could be even stronger.
