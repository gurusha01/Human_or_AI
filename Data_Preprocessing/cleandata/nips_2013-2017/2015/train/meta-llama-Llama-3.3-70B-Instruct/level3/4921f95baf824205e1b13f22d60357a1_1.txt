This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation, particularly in the context of non-linear measurements. The authors extend the classical work of Brillinger and recent results by Plan and Vershynin, providing a precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for estimating structured signals from non-linear measurements. The main result shows that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as if the measurements were linear, but scaled and noisy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and motivation. The technical contributions are substantial, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm, including a precise error prediction and a characterization of the optimal quantizer for q-bit compressive sensing.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A significant extension of previous results to the case of non-linear measurements, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the Generalized LASSO algorithm.
* A precise analysis of the estimation performance, including a characterization of the optimal quantizer for q-bit compressive sensing.
* A clear and concise presentation, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the measurement matrix A has i.i.d. Gaussian entries, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The analysis is asymptotic, and it is not clear how well the results generalize to finite-dimensional settings.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the arguments.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are substantial. The results have the potential to impact various fields, including signal processing, machine learning, and statistics. The paper is a valuable addition to the literature and deserves to be published in a top-tier conference or journal.
