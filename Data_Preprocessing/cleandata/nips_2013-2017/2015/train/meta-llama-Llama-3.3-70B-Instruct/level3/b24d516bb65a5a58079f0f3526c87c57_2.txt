This paper presents a novel approach to sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data analysis. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that modifies Leurgans' algorithm for tensor factorization, and provide theoretical guarantees for its performance. The algorithm relies on the notion of tensor contraction, which reduces the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a good introduction to the problem and its significance. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the contributions of their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, with a clear description of the algorithm and its theoretical analysis.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable, and the theoretical guarantees provide a clear understanding of its performance. The authors also provide numerical experiments to validate their approach, which demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The introduction could be improved with a clearer motivation for the problem and a more concise overview of the main contributions. Some of the technical sections are dense and require careful reading, and could benefit from additional explanations or examples. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work.
In terms of the key points to evaluate, the paper addresses most of them satisfactorily. The probability notation pij(t) is clarified as subprobabilities, and the term "hazard matrix" is distinguished from its use in other contexts. The range of Î±ij is explicitly stated, and the introduction's first paragraph is well-written. The reference [3] is correctly cited, and the proof of Lemma 3 is clear and well-explained. Equation (11) is well-defined, and Equation (12) is correct. The authors acknowledge recent work on theoretical foundations of influence models, and the paper's theoretical analysis is scientifically interesting and timely.
However, the experimental results could be more insightful and illustrative, and the authors could provide more discussion on the significance of their results and their potential impact on the field. Overall, the paper is well-written and technically sound, and makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and data analysis.
