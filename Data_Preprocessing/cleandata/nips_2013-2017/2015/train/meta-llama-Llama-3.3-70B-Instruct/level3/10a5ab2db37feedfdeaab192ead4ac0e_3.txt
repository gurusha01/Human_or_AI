This paper proposes a novel approach to batch learning from logged bandit feedback (BLBF) by introducing a self-normalized risk estimator that avoids the propensity overfitting problem inherent in the conventional unbiased risk estimator. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, called Norm-POEM, through extensive empirical evaluations on several multi-label classification problems.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the propensity overfitting problem and its consequences, and they convincingly demonstrate the benefits of their self-normalized risk estimator.
The significance of this paper lies in its development of a new training method that addresses a critical issue in BLBF, making it a valuable contribution to the field. The results show that Norm-POEM consistently outperforms the conventional estimator, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the reasons behind this improvement.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related works, such as SpikeProp, to highlight the uniqueness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the computational efficiency of Norm-POEM and its potential applications to other domains.
Overall, the strengths of this paper include its clear and concise writing, thorough analysis of the propensity overfitting problem, and convincing empirical evaluations. The weaknesses include the lack of comparison with other related works and limited discussion of computational efficiency and potential applications.
