This paper presents a novel Bayesian optimization method, called Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves an exponential convergence rate without the need for auxiliary optimization and δ-cover sampling. The algorithm leverages the idea of considering infinitely many possible bounds, rather than relying on a single estimated bound, to improve the convergence rate. The paper provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its relationship to previous work, including GP-UCB and SOO.
The strengths of the paper include its well-written and easy-to-follow presentation, as well as its ability to generalize previous work by avoiding δ-cover sampling. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMGPO in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms, including SOO, BaMSOO, GP-PI, and GP-EI.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The experimental section is limited to synthetic functions with a maximum dimension of 6 and does not include real-world experiments to illustrate the method's performance in practical scenarios. Additionally, the comparison with other methods is not comprehensive, as it only includes a few algorithms and does not provide a statistical comparison.
The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and its scalability to higher dimensions. While the authors mention that the algorithm can be used as a subroutine to scale up to higher dimensions with additional assumptions, this is not thoroughly explored in the paper.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its contributions. The paper also presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, which is a key aspect of originality.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel Bayesian optimization method with an exponential convergence rate, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The algorithm is well-explained and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experimental section is limited to synthetic functions and does not include real-world experiments.
* The comparison with other methods is not comprehensive and lacks statistical analysis.
* The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the algorithm.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with the suggestion that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly in terms of providing more comprehensive experimental results and analysis of the algorithm's computational complexity and scalability.
