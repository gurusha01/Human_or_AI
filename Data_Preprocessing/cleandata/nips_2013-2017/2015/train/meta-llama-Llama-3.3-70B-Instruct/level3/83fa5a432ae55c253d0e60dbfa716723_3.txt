This paper presents a novel approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning by extending the policy gradient method to the whole class of coherent risk measures. The authors provide a unified framework for both static and dynamic risk measures, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-written, clearly laying out the main ideas, and addresses a problem of interest to the community using a novel technique with sufficient theoretical and empirical validation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the related work in risk-sensitive optimization and reinforcement learning, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the need for a more general framework.
* The proposed approach is based on a solid theoretical foundation, using the Cramer-Wold device to ensure the existence of a linear projection that differentiates two distributions.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the static and dynamic risk measures, including the derivation of gradient formulas and the development of sampling-based algorithms for estimating the gradients.
* The paper includes a numerical illustration of the approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in a trading agent scenario.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the risk envelope is known in an explicit form, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, which could be a limitation in large-scale applications.
* The paper could benefit from more descriptive figures and a clearer explanation of the notation used throughout the paper.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.
* The approach is based on a solid theoretical foundation and is supported by empirical validation.
* The paper is well-written and clearly lays out the main ideas, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the risk envelope is known in an explicit form, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a significant contribution to the field and should be accepted. However, the authors should address the minor issues mentioned above, such as providing more descriptive figures and a clearer explanation of the notation used throughout the paper. Additionally, the authors should consider providing a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms and exploring the application of the approach to more complex scenarios.
