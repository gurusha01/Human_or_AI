This paper presents a method for statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data, by leveraging the theory of embedding probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The authors introduce a universal kernel, called the universal persistence scale-space (u-PSS) kernel, which enables a principled solution to two-sample hypothesis testing on persistence diagrams. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a good introduction to the problem and a thorough review of related work.
The main contribution of the paper is the proof of universality of the u-PSS kernel, which is a significant result in the field of topological data analysis. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the kernel in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic and real-world data, including 3D surfaces of lateral ventricles and corpora callosa. The experiments show that the kernel can capture salient shape features of the surface, leading to statistically significant differences in the persistent homology.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams
* A thorough review of related work in the field of topological data analysis
* A significant contribution to the field, namely the proof of universality of the u-PSS kernel
* Well-designed and informative experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the kernel
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The paper could benefit from clearer definitions and explanations of some technical terms, such as the parameters τ1, τ2, and τ
* Some sentences, such as the one at line 236, could be clarified for better readability
* The paper requires minor corrections, including typos and grammatical errors, to improve its overall quality and readability
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, a thorough review of related work, and a significant contribution to the field. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, with good explanations of the technical terms and concepts.
The paper's significance is also high, as it enables the use of persistence diagrams in a wide range of statistical techniques and learning methods. The paper's results have the potential to impact the field of topological data analysis and related areas, such as computer vision and medical imaging.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper to the conference, with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper's strengths, including its clear introduction, thorough review of related work, and significant contribution to the field, make it a valuable addition to the conference program.
