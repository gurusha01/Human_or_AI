This paper presents a novel Bayesian optimization method, Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves an exponential convergence rate without the need for auxiliary optimization and Î´-cover sampling. The authors propose a new approach that leverages the existence of an unknown bound encoded in the continuity at a global optimizer, rather than relying on a single bound given by the Gaussian Process (GP) prior.
The paper is well-written, didactic, and effectively uses graphs to explain the procedures, making it easy to understand. The theoretical and experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantage of the authors' approach. The algorithm is compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including SOO, BaMSOO, GP-PI, and GP-EI, and shows improved performance on several benchmark functions.
However, there are some technical errors and areas for improvement. The abstract formulation is somewhat redundant, and there are misplaced parentheses in some equations. Additionally, the reviewer is not familiar with GP and global optimization, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate the technical soundness of the paper.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach, clear explanations, and convincing results. The weaknesses include technical errors, redundancy in the abstract, and the potential for improvement in the division procedure. 
Arguments pro acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to Bayesian optimization.
- The theoretical and experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the advantage of the authors' approach.
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
Arguments con acceptance:
- The abstract formulation is redundant and contains technical errors.
- The reviewer is not familiar with GP and global optimization, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate the technical soundness of the paper.
- The division procedure could be improved, and the authors may want to consider alternative approaches.
Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the technical errors and areas for improvement, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
