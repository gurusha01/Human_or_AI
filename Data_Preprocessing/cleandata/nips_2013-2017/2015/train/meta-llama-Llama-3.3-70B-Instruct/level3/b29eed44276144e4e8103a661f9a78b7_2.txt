This paper proposes a new graph property called "hierarchy width" to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. The authors show that under suitable conditions on the weights, bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time. This is a significant contribution to the field, as Gibbs sampling is a widely used inference technique, but its theoretical guarantees are weak.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem, including a review of related work and a clear explanation of the limitations of existing approaches. They also provide a detailed description of their new graph property, hierarchy width, and demonstrate its effectiveness in bounding the mixing time of Gibbs sampling.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a theoretical guarantee for the mixing time of Gibbs sampling, which is a significant improvement over existing results. The authors also provide experimental results to validate their theory, including a real-world application to a paleontology task, where they achieve high-quality results that exceed those of human volunteers.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that the hierarchy width property may be difficult to compute in practice, which could limit its applicability. Additionally, the authors note that the hierarchy width of a graph is always larger than its hypertree width, which raises concerns about the implications of this new property.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The authors' use of a new graph property to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling is a novel and important contribution, and their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
