This paper proposes a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in serial section electron microscopy (EM) images, leveraging a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture and a recursive training framework. The authors demonstrate significant improvements in boundary detection accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods, including a 2D max-pooling ConvNet baseline.
The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and provides a thorough introduction to the problem of neuronal boundary detection in EM images. The authors provide a detailed description of their proposed architecture, including the use of 2D and 3D filters, recursive training, and a novel implementation of 3D convolutional networks called ZNN. The experimental results are comprehensive, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a newly acquired dataset of mouse piriform cortex images.
The strengths of this paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and significance. The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including comparisons to existing methods and visualizations of the feature maps. The use of ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks, is also a notable contribution, as it enables efficient training of large networks on multicore CPUs.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One notable omission is the lack of exploration of the potential application of the idea to the linear bandit case, an area with significant existing research on exploration distribution. Additionally, the authors could have provided more discussion on the potential limitations and challenges of their approach, such as the requirement for large amounts of annotated training data and the computational resources needed for training.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a good candidate for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and neuroscience. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of neuronal boundary detection in EM images, which is a critical step in the reconstruction of neural circuits.
