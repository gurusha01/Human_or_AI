This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-frame super-resolution (SR) using a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network (BRCN). The authors develop an evidence lower bound (ELBO) constructed by averaging over a data-generating distribution, which leads to impressive results on large data streaming applications. The BRCN model exploits three convolutions: feedforward convolution, recurrent convolution, and conditional convolution, to efficiently learn the temporal dependency for multi-frame SR.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed model and its components. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and orders of magnitude faster speed than other multi-frame SR methods. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the impact of model architecture on performance and visualize the learned filters of feedforward and conditional convolutions.
However, there are some areas that require clarification and improvement. For instance, the problem statement could be sharpened to set up the proposed procedure, and the claim that explicitly modeling time series incurs a heavy inferential cost needs to be supported with evidence or citation. Additionally, the potential error in the variational distribution and the tradeoffs of marginalizing over the population distribution versus conditioning on a sample should be addressed.
The results focus on prediction rather than parameter estimation, and it would be interesting to know if anything can be said about the parameter estimates. The F-ELBO provides a nice framework for understanding SVI, but the costs and benefits of using a generative model for averaging instead of the population distribution should be discussed.
Overall, the paper is original and provides a good justification for SVI, making it a significant and important contribution to the community. The proposed approach is innovative and has the potential to handle inference in streaming data scenarios, making it a highly significant and welcome addition to the community.
