This paper proposes a novel tensor decomposition algorithm that can handle sparse noise, making it a valuable contribution to the field of tensor decomposition. The algorithm's quality is decent, with a general and useful approach that can be extended to high-order tensors without significantly increasing computational cost. The paper's clarity is good, but it lacks optimization algorithm details and contains a mistake in the model description.
The proposed decomposition algorithm and its theoretical analysis are novel, showing originality in the approach. The algorithm's significance lies in its ability to provide a promising decomposition method that can be easily implemented and extended to more general tensor decomposition settings.
