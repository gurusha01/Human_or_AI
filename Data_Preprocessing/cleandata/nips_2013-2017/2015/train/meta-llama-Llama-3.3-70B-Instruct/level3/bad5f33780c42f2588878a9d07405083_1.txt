This paper introduces the concept of max-information, which connects differential privacy and description length-based adaptive data analysis, and develops new algorithms to advance the understanding of generalization error. The paper significantly advances the understanding of an important problem, blending theory and practice with a good balance of analysis and empirical results. The introduction of max-information enables new algorithms and approaches for adaptive data analysis, making the paper's originality and significance notable.
The paper's clarity is hindered by a dense main text, which could be improved by condensing or omitting some results and providing a more formal comparison to existing theorems. Additionally, minor issues include the need for corrections in notation and clarification in the experiment section. Suggestions for improving readability include highlighting key contributions and providing a clearer overview of the paper's organization.
The paper's strengths include its ability to unify differential privacy and description length-based approaches, providing a new perspective on the problem of adaptive data analysis. The adaptive composition theorem for max-information is a significant contribution, allowing for the obtainment of generalization guarantees for analyses in which some procedures are differentially private and others have short description length outputs.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper introduces a new concept, max-information, which has the potential to significantly impact the field of adaptive data analysis.
* The paper provides a unified framework for understanding differential privacy and description length-based approaches.
* The paper includes empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper's clarity could be improved, making it more accessible to a wider audience.
* Some minor issues, such as notation corrections and clarification in the experiment section, need to be addressed.
Overall, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis. With some revisions to improve clarity and address minor issues, the paper would be even stronger.
