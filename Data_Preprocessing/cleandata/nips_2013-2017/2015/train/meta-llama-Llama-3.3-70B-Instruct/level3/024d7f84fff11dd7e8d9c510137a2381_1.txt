This paper proposes a novel approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning by extending the policy gradient method to the whole class of coherent risk measures. The authors derive a unified formula for the gradient of static coherent risk measures and propose a sampling-based algorithm for cases without analytical solutions. They also develop a policy gradient theorem for Markov coherent risk measures, which relates the gradient to a suitable value function and a corresponding actor-critic algorithm.
The paper's main strengths are its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The unified derivation of policy gradients for coherent risk measures is a valuable contribution to the risk-sensitive decision-making literature. The proposed sample-based approximation scheme has potential, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its consistency guarantees.
However, the paper's clarity is hindered by its attempt to address multiple issues in a short space, particularly in Section 5. The authors could benefit from a narrower focus or expansion into a longer journal publication to provide more detailed explanations and examples.
The paper's significance is evident in its ability to generalize and extend previous results on risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. The authors demonstrate the importance of flexibility in designing risk criteria and provide a numerical example that showcases the benefits of their approach.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.
* The unified derivation of policy gradients for coherent risk measures is a significant contribution to the literature.
* The proposed sample-based approximation scheme has potential and is supported by consistency guarantees.
* The paper demonstrates the importance of flexibility in designing risk criteria and provides a numerical example to support its claims.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's clarity is hindered by its attempt to address multiple issues in a short space.
* The authors could benefit from providing more detailed explanations and examples to support their claims.
* The paper's focus on coherent risk measures may limit its appeal to a broader audience.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper due to its originality, technical soundness, and significance. However, I suggest that the authors revise their paper to address the clarity issues and provide more detailed explanations and examples to support their claims.
