This paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs, a widely used inference technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The authors introduce a new graph property, called hierarchy width, which is shown to be a stronger condition than hypertree width, a commonly used property in graph algorithms. The main result of the paper is that Gibbs sampling mixes rapidly on factor graphs with bounded hierarchy width and factor weights, providing a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of Gibbs sampling on a class of factor graphs.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical results are sound, and the proofs are well-organized and easy to follow. The authors also provide experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new graph property, hierarchy width, which provides a stronger condition for rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling than hypertree width.
* The provision of a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of Gibbs sampling on a class of factor graphs, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a strong background in graph theory and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The authors could provide more intuition and examples to help illustrate the concept of hierarchy width and its relationship to hypertree width.
* The experimental results, while promising, are limited to a few examples, and more extensive experiments would be necessary to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the technical results are sound. The introduction of hierarchy width as a new graph property and the provision of a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of Gibbs sampling on a class of factor graphs are significant contributions to the field. The paper is a good fit for the NIPS conference, and I would recommend acceptance.
