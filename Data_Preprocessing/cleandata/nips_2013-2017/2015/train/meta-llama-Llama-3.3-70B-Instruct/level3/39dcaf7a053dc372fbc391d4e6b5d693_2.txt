This paper proposes a novel composition of ConvNets with 2D and 3D filters to improve neural boundary prediction in sequential EM scans in Neuroscience. The method outperforms previous approaches using only 2D filters, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating 3D context in boundary detection. The paper employs previously suggested techniques, such as recursive composition of nets and 3D filters for 3D datasets, but lacks novelty in its approach.
The paper has several strengths, including the use of a deeper network architecture, the incorporation of 3D filters, and the adoption of a recursively trained architecture. These innovations lead to a substantial gain in accuracy, with the proposed VD2D3D architecture outperforming the baseline N4 architecture. The paper also provides a detailed description of the network architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics, making it easy to follow and reproduce the results.
However, the paper also has several weaknesses. The presentation quality could be improved, with some figures and captions lacking descriptive information. The paper also lacks references and details about the implementation of ZNN, which is crucial for reproducing the results. Additionally, the paper lacks self-consistency, with unclear descriptions and missing formulas, such as the description of the Rand index.
The paper is relevant to the field of Neuroscience and connectomics, and the proposed method has the potential to be applied to other types of anisotropic 3D images, including video. The use of ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks, is also a notable contribution.
