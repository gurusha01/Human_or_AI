This paper proposes a method for reusing a holdout set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm operating on a training set, while provably avoiding overfitting to the holdout set. The authors introduce two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses. The paper also formalizes and addresses the general problem of data reuse in adaptive data analysis, providing a new perspective on the problem through the notion of approximate max-information.
The strengths of the paper include its well-written and clearly structured presentation, as well as the quality of the proposed method, which is reasonably well-justified through experiments and theoretical analysis. The introduction of approximate max-information as a unifying concept for differential privacy and description length is a significant contribution.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The originality of the paper is limited due to the similarity of the average local factor assumption to AEP, which has already been published. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more thorough illustrations of models where the SEP/AEP assumption possibly fails. The regime where the SEP/AEP assumption fails is not fully explored, and the reviewer is concerned about the potential consequences of this limitation.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The significance of the paper lies in its contribution to the problem of adaptive data analysis, which is an important and timely topic in the field.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a novel method for reusing a holdout set, which is a significant contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis.
* The introduction of approximate max-information as a unifying concept for differential privacy and description length is a major contribution.
