This paper proposes a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network (BRCN) for multi-frame super-resolution (SR) of videos. The authors claim that their method can efficiently model temporal dependency in video sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include the novel use of bidirectional scheme, recurrent, and conditional convolutions for temporal dependency modeling. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with existing single-image and multi-frame SR methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The experimental results show that the proposed BRCN can achieve better performance and faster speed than existing multi-frame SR methods.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors do not provide a clear discussion on the practicality of their method for actual streaming data, which is a crucial aspect of video SR. The algorithm's requirement to record and repeatedly access the entire stream is not comparable to real streaming algorithms, and this limitation needs to be made more explicit. Additionally, the suggestion to generalize Bayesian inference for infinite data streams is interesting, but the authors lack comparisons on how to approach the problem in a Bayesian setting.
The method's claim to be a streaming algorithm is also questionable, as it may require resampling earlier data points again much later, defeating the purpose of streaming. The authors should provide more clarification on how their method can be applied to real-world streaming data.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in the novel use of bidirectional scheme, recurrent, and conditional convolutions for temporal dependency modeling. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate how their approach differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is that it addresses a difficult problem in video SR and provides a novel solution that achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results have the potential to be used in real-world applications, such as video enhancement and restoration.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the discussion on practicality and the comparison with Bayesian approaches.
