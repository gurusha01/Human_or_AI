This paper presents improved algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression of a given set of observations on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) under weighted `p-norms. The authors provide a unified framework for solving the Isotonic Regression problem for all `p-norms with p < ∞, achieving a time complexity of O(m^{1.5} log^2 n log (npw^p_{max}/δ)), which improves upon previous results. Additionally, they show that for `∞-norms, the Isotonic Regression problem can be solved in linear time, O(m), which is the best possible running time.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide improved time complexity bounds for Isotonic Regression under `p-norms, its simplicity, and its potential for practical applications. The authors also provide preliminary experimental results, demonstrating the efficiency of their algorithm in practice.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The experimental results are limited and lack comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The presentation of the paper could be improved, as some key components of the algorithm and analysis are missing from the main body. Furthermore, the paper contains typos and undefined notations, which may hinder understanding.
The theoretical contributions of the paper are incremental, building upon existing work on Interior Point Methods and approximate solvers for linear systems. The authors extend the results of Daitch and Spielman to `p-objectives and provide an improved analysis that only requires linear solvers with a constant factor relative error bound.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques from convex programming and graph algorithms to solve the Isotonic Regression problem. The authors' approach is distinct from previous work, which has focused on special graph families or specific norms.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact various fields, including Operations Research, Signal Processing, and Statistics. The improved algorithms for Isotonic Regression could lead to more efficient solutions for shape-constrained nonparametric regression problems, which are common in these fields.
Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field, but its presentation and experimental results could be improved. The authors should address the typos and undefined notations, provide more comprehensive experimental results, and consider comparing their algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods.
