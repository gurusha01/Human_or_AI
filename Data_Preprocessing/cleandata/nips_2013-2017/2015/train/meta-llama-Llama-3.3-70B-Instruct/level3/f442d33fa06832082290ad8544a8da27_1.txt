This paper proposes a novel approach to learning distributed sentence representations, called skip-thought vectors, using an encoder-decoder model trained on a large corpus of contiguous text. The model is trained to predict the surrounding sentences of a given sentence, and the resulting sentence vectors are shown to be highly generic and robust, performing well on a range of tasks including semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, and sentiment classification.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, approach, and results. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their model on multiple tasks, comparing it to state-of-the-art models and baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of skip-thought vectors as an off-the-shelf sentence representation, which can be used with linear classifiers to achieve competitive performance on various tasks.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to learn high-quality sentence representations without requiring task-specific supervision. The authors demonstrate that their model can learn to capture semantic and syntactic properties of sentences, and that the resulting vectors can be used as a generic feature extractor for various tasks.
However, there are some limitations to the approach. The pre-trained sentence vectors may be easy to use, but retraining the model may be challenging, similar to retraining word2vec. Additionally, the package on GitHub is incomplete, as it does not include the training part of the model. The model's long training time may also hinder users from retraining the vectors with their own domain-specific corpus.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel objective function that abstracts the skip-gram model to the sentence level, and demonstrates its effectiveness in learning high-quality sentence representations. The approach is also novel in its use of an encoder-decoder model to learn sentence representations, and its ability to learn generic representations that can be used across multiple tasks.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a generic sentence representation that can be used across multiple tasks, without requiring task-specific supervision. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of skip-thought vectors in capturing semantic and syntactic properties of sentences, and their potential to advance the state of the art in natural language processing tasks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and effective approach to learning distributed sentence representations, with a thorough evaluation and comparison to state-of-the-art models. The paper is well-written, and the results are significant and relevant to the field of natural language processing.
