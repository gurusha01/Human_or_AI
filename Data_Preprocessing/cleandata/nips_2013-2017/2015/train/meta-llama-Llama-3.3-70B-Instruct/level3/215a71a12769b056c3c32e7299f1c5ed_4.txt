This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use ideas from game playing to approximate the optimal policy. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, significance, and technical soundness. The proposed framework is a novel combination of ideas from online learning, active learning, and crowdsourcing, and it addresses a significant problem in the field of machine learning. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a well-motivated solution. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with baseline methods.
One weakness of the paper is that the analysis of the results could be more detailed. While the authors provide a summary of the results, they could provide more insight into why their approach performs better than the baseline methods. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work.
Another potential weakness is that the paper assumes a specific setting, where the system has access to a crowd of workers who can provide labels for the input data. While this setting is common in many applications, it may not be applicable to all scenarios. The authors could provide more discussion on how their approach could be adapted to other settings.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed framework is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
