This paper proposes a novel greedy method for streaming hypergraph clustering, aiming to minimize the maximum number of topics covered by a partitioning. The approach is designed for the streaming computation model, where items arrive online one at a time and must be assigned irrevocably to a component at their arrival time. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance under a probabilistic input model, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden co-clusters of items. The paper also presents an extensive empirical evaluation on real-world datasets, showing that the greedy strategy outperforms alternative approaches.
The strengths of this paper include its novel contribution to the field of hypergraph clustering, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand. The paper is well-motivated, and the problem of min-max hypergraph partitioning is clearly defined and relevant to various applications.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper's focus on the streaming computation model limits its applicability to batch settings, where more advanced algorithms may be available. Additionally, the authors' comparison to batch methods is limited due to computational time constraints, which may raise questions about the algorithm's scalability. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between the streaming and batch approaches.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, such as greedy assignment and Polya urn processes, to address the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem in the streaming computation model. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential impact on various applications, such as load balancing, community detection, and hypergraph clustering. The results are important, and other researchers and practitioners are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem.
