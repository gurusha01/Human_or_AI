This paper proposes a novel bidirectional recurrent convolutional network (BRCN) for multi-frame super-resolution (SR) tasks, which efficiently models temporal dependency in video sequences using convolutional recurrent transitions. The authors claim that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost compared to existing multi-frame SR methods.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their proposed network architecture. However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the authors could provide more details about motion-based methods and convolution for recurrent transition, which would be beneficial for unfamiliar readers. Additionally, they should provide prior work that uses convolution for recurrent transition to give a better understanding of the context.
The term "conditional convolution" is misleading, as it does not involve conditioning but rather a convolution from the previous time step input. The authors should consider renaming this term to avoid confusion. Furthermore, the explanation of the second hidden layer seems redundant and unnecessary, and the comparison to Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) appears sudden and unrelated. It would be better to introduce TRBM earlier in the paper to provide a clearer connection.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to modeling temporal dependency using convolutional recurrent transitions, which achieves better performance and faster speed compared to existing multi-frame SR methods. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their model, including quantitative and qualitative comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
However, the impact of this paper on the NIPS community is uncertain, as the proposed model may not be widely applicable to other areas of research. The authors should consider discussing potential applications and extensions of their work to other fields, such as image and video processing, computer vision, and robotics.
In conclusion, this paper proposes a novel approach to multi-frame SR tasks, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost. While there are some areas that require improvement, the paper's strengths make it a valuable contribution to the field. I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the mentioned concerns.
