This paper introduces a novel modification to the Leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), which is designed to handle piecewise continuous energies with affine boundaries. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including a proof that it preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine. The paper also presents an empirical evaluation of RHMC, demonstrating its improved performance over traditional Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and tuned Metropolis-Hastings (MH) on a heavy-tail piecewise model.
The strengths of this paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its thorough analysis of the proposed method. The authors provide a detailed proof of the volume preservation property of RHMC, which is a crucial component of the method's correctness. The empirical evaluation is also well-designed, with a clear comparison of RHMC to baseline HMC and tuned MH on a challenging model.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the method's applicability may be limited to piecewise continuous energies with affine boundaries. However, the authors argue that this is a common scenario in many applications, and the method's ability to handle such cases makes it a valuable contribution to the field.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on previous work by Pakman and Paninski, but extends it to arbitrary piecewise continuous distributions. The authors also provide a novel analysis of the volume preservation property of RHMC, which is a key contribution of the paper.
The significance of this paper lies in its potential to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference in models with piecewise continuous energies. The authors demonstrate that RHMC can outperform traditional HMC and tuned MH on a challenging model, particularly in high dimensions. This makes RHMC a promising method for applications where efficient sampling is critical.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The empirical evaluation is thorough, and the results demonstrate the potential of RHMC to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference.
