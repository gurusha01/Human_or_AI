This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating an unknown signal from non-linear measurements. The authors extend the Generalized LASSO algorithm to handle non-linear measurements and provide a precise analysis of its performance. The main contribution of the paper lies in the derivation of an asymptotically exact expression for the error of the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements.
The paper's strengths include its novel and effective architecture, extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and promise to release source code and dataset. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of relevant literature and a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The paper also includes a number of simulations and experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. Some of the statements in the paper are unclear or incorrect, such as the claim that a previous work has no mechanism for coherence between sentences. Additionally, some details are missing or unclear, such as the fine-tuning of the paragraph vector.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper after the authors address the issues with formulation, evaluation, and related work in their rebuttal. The authors should also make the promised changes and clarify certain points, such as the fine-tuning of the paragraph vector. Additionally, the authors may want to consider using a better metric, such as Meteor, to automatically evaluate the generated sentences. 
The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I believe that it has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of signal processing and machine learning. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors have provided enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. 
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to estimating an unknown signal from non-linear measurements, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a new perspective on the problem and offers a fresh insight into the analysis of non-linear measurements.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and the results have the potential to make a significant impact in the field of signal processing and machine learning. The paper also provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to the analysis of non-linear measurements. 
Overall, I believe that this paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and I recommend accepting it after the authors address the issues with formulation, evaluation, and related work in their rebuttal.
