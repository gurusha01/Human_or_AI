This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, providing a unified approach to handling coherent risk measures. The authors extend the policy gradient method to the whole class of coherent risk measures, which is widely accepted in finance and operations research. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the setting, definitions, and logical steps, making it easy to read for those not directly working in the area.
The theory presented in the paper seems to work, and the contribution is interesting and potentially useful for the community. The authors provide a general formula for the gradient of static coherent risk measures and propose a sampling-based estimator for the gradient. They also derive a new formula for the gradient of Markov coherent dynamic risk measures and develop an actor-critic style algorithm for solving the dynamic risk problem.
The paper has several strengths, including its ability to generalize previous results and provide a unified approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. The authors also provide a numerical illustration of their approach, which demonstrates the importance of flexibility in designing risk criteria. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper, including unclear definitions and formatting issues. Additionally, there may be potential errors in references that need to be addressed.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.
* The authors provide a unified approach to handling coherent risk measures.
* The paper is well-written and easy to read.
* The theory presented in the paper seems to work, and the contribution is interesting and potentially useful for the community.
Arguments against acceptance:
* Minor issues with unclear definitions and formatting.
* Potential errors in references.
* The paper may benefit from additional numerical illustrations or comparisons with other approaches.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to be useful for the community. However, the authors should address the minor issues and potential errors before publication.
