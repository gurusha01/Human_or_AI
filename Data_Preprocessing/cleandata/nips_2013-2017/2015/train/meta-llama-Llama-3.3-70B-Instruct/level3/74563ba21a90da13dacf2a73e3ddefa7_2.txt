This paper presents a novel approach to statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. The authors investigate the theoretical foundation of applying Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) based techniques in expressing topological invariances of persistent homology, focusing on the universality of potential kernel representation. The proposed approach is demonstrated via discriminative hypotheses testing, and the authors provide a comprehensive introduction to topological data analysis.
The paper's strengths include its thorough theoretical analysis, which provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on synthetic and real-world data. The use of a universal kernel enables a principled solution to the selected problem of two-sample hypothesis testing.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The authors only consider the solution of the heat diffusion problem as a source of kernel representation and do not explore other possibilities, such as discrete differential geometry. Additionally, the proposed approach is demonstrated via discriminative hypotheses testing, but it would be beneficial to check its performance against discriminative learning methods for confirmation. The authors also fail to clearly explain why the universality of a kernel helps in a learning problem, which can be addressed by showing its advantages in a family of problems.
To further improve the paper, the authors could reinterpret Proposition 2 and investigate properties of the manifold of positive semidefinite kernels to yield further generalization. They could also explore the use of other kernel representations, such as those based on discrete differential geometry, and compare their performance with the proposed approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, and the paper is technically sound. The proposed approach is novel and contributes to the field of topological data analysis. However, the significance of the results could be further emphasized by demonstrating the advantages of the proposed approach in a broader range of applications.
