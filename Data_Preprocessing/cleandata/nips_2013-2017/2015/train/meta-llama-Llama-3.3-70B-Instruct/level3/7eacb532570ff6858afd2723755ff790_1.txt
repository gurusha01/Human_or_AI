This paper proposes a novel approach to object detection by introducing a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network. The RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art object detection systems, achieving a frame rate of 5fps on a GPU while maintaining high detection accuracy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The use of a fully-convolutional network for region proposal generation is a novel and interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the recall-to-IoU metric, which is useful for understanding the proposal method.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify region proposal generation and object detection into a single, end-to-end trainable network. This is achieved through a simple alternating optimization scheme, which allows the RPN and detection network to share convolutional features. The authors demonstrate that this approach leads to improved detection accuracy and reduced computational cost.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the RPN, such as the specific architecture and hyperparameters used. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art object detection systems, such as YOLO and SSD.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their approach. The claims made in the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, providing a balanced view of the method's effectiveness.
The clarity of the paper is excellent, with clear and concise writing and well-organized sections. The paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and experiments.
The originality of the paper is high, as the authors propose a novel approach to object detection that combines region proposal generation and object detection into a single network. The paper also provides a unique perspective on the use of fully-convolutional networks for region proposal generation.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it demonstrates a significant improvement in object detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper has the potential to impact the field of computer vision, particularly in applications where object detection is a critical component.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.
