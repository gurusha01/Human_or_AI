This paper presents a novel approach to generating natural language descriptions for image streams, extending the traditional single-image single-sentence setup to a sequence of images and sentences. The proposed method, called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Networks (CRCN), integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and a local coherence model to capture the semantic relationships between images and text. The authors evaluate their approach on two large datasets of blog posts, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology, including the architecture of the CRCN model and the training procedure. The use of blog posts as a source of text-image parallel data is innovative and allows for the collection of a large dataset. The experimental results are thorough, including both quantitative metrics and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thorough evaluation, and the clear presentation. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, discussing the advantages and limitations of their method. The use of a local coherence model to capture the relationships between sentences is a key contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the quality of the generated text.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work, particularly in the area of multimodal neural networks. The authors mention several relevant papers, but a more thorough analysis of the existing literature would provide a better context for their contribution. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more visualizations and examples of the generated text, to help illustrate the quality and coherence of the output.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality.
