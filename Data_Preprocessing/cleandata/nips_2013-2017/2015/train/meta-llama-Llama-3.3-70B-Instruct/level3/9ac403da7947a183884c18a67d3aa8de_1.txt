This paper proposes a novel approach for generating sentence sequences to describe image streams, which is a significant extension of the traditional image captioning task. The authors introduce a multimodal architecture called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Network (CRCN), which integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and a local coherence model to capture the semantic relationships between images and text.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CRCN model in generating coherent and fluent sentence sequences, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines. The user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk further validate the quality of the generated text sequences.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the significance of the problem and its implications. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the design choices and hyperparameter settings of the CRCN model. The related work section is comprehensive, but some references seem to be missing, such as the work by Sadeghi and Lauritzen, and Wermuth.
The quality of the paper is good, but there are some typos, undefined symbols, and inconsistent notation that affect the clarity of the presentation. The authors could improve the readability of the paper by moving some of the proofs and technical details to a supplementary file, making room for more intuitive explanations and examples.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of techniques, including the use of bidirectional recurrent neural networks and a local coherence model, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a large-scale dataset, which is a notable achievement.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and the proposed solution. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and natural language processing.
