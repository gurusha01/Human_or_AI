This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation by extending existing results from the sub-Gaussian setting to the sub-exponential setting. The authors provide a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential. The main result shows that the error/sample complexities bounds are similar to the usual Gaussian setting, with an extra log factor resulting from the transition to exponential width.
The paper is well-written and organized, and the technical quality is high. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the background and preliminaries section provides a thorough overview of the relevant concepts and techniques. The main results are presented in a clear and logical manner, and the proofs are rigorous and well-explained.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain bounds on the exponential width of sets. The authors establish a sharp upper bound for the exponential width of a set in terms of its Gaussian width, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of the RE condition, including a bound based on the exponential width of the error set and a stronger result for the Lasso and group-lasso problems.
However, the paper may be considered a minor extension of earlier results for a general audience. The authors build on existing work by Negahban et al. and Rudelson & Zhou, and the techniques used are not entirely new. Additionally, the paper is limited to isotropic measurements, and it would be interesting to see an extension to the non-isotropic sub-Gaussian case.
The experimental results provided in the paper are useful in illustrating the theoretical findings, but they are limited to a specific setting and do not provide a comprehensive comparison between sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential measurements. It would be beneficial to include more extensive experiments to assess the sharpness of the authors' main result.
In terms of the criteria for evaluation, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and significance. The technical quality is high, and the paper is well-written and organized. The results are significant, and the paper provides a meaningful extension of earlier results. However, the originality of the techniques is unclear, and the paper may be considered a minor extension of earlier results.
