This paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream, extending both input and output dimensions to a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. The authors design a multimodal architecture called coherent recurrent convolutional network (CRCN), which integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. The approach directly learns from vast user-generated resources of blog posts as text-image parallel training data.
The paper is clearly written, making it easy to understand the proposed method. The work is novel in providing a CRCN approach for image stream description, although it builds upon previously proposed tools and methods. The significance of the paper lies in its proposal of a CRCN-based inference method, which could be a useful toolbox for the community if the software package is released.
However, the quality of the experiments is questioned due to the choice of weak baselines that do not consider state transition or trajectory information. The paper lacks comparison with other existing inference methods, such as sampling approaches like Fast MCMC sampling for Markov jump processes. Additionally, the authors could have considered discretizing the time horizon as a simpler alternative to the proposed method, which could work just as fine in most problems.
The results show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art candidate methods, including log-bilinear multimodal models and recurrent convolutional models, using both quantitative measures and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The user studies validate that annotators prefer the results of the proposed method to those of baselines, especially when the query image stream is longer.
In conclusion, the paper presents a novel approach for image stream description, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. However, the experiments could be improved by considering stronger baselines and alternative methods. The paper's significance lies in its contribution to the development of multimodal architectures for image and text analysis.
