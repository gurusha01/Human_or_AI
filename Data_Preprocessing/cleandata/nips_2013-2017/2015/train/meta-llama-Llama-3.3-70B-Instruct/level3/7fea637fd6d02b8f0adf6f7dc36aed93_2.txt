This paper presents a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors belonging to the general Poisson-Kingman class. The authors introduce a hybrid sampler that combines the strengths of conditional and marginal samplers, allowing for efficient inference in a wide range of models. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new compact way of representing the infinite dimensional component of the model, which reduces memory and storage requirements. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their hybrid sampler, comparing it to existing marginal and conditional MCMC schemes. The results show that the hybrid sampler outperforms the existing methods in terms of running times and effective sample size (ESS) in most cases.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison of their method to other existing methods, such as variational inference or sequential Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, the authors mention that there are some values of σ for which their novel sampler is unable to perform inference, which could be a limitation of the method.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of a new hybrid MCMC scheme that combines the strengths of conditional and marginal samplers. The authors also provide a novel way of representing the infinite dimensional component of the model, which reduces memory and storage requirements. The paper is significant because it provides a general-purpose tool for inference in a wide range of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and efficient MCMC scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their hybrid sampler, comparing it to existing methods.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison of their method to other existing methods.
* There are some values of σ for which the novel sampler is unable to perform inference, which could be a limitation of the method.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper because it presents a novel and efficient MCMC scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their method. However, the authors should address the limitations of their method and provide a more comprehensive comparison to other existing methods in future work.
