This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis, addressing the crucial problem of reusing a holdout set for validation in the adaptive setting. The authors propose two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting to the holdout set.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of their approach and algorithms. The technical contributions are sound, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods through a simple synthetic experiment.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify different techniques, such as differential privacy and description length, under a single framework of approximate max-information. This framework provides a new perspective on the problem and allows for adaptive composition guarantees, making it amenable to reasoning about the generalization properties of adaptively applied sequences of algorithms.
However, there are some areas that require clarification. For instance, the phrase "total multiplicities are bounded by N" is unclear, and it would be helpful to specify whether it refers to the maximum multiplicity of any point or the sum of multiplicities of off-diagonal points. Additionally, the paper downplays the requirements on bounded persistence and multiplicities, which is a serious limitation. The authors should consider adding a discussion to alert non-expert readers of potential issues.
The presentation of Figure 2 is also confusing due to its 3D view, and replacing it with 2-dimensional colormaps would better show the symmetric functions. Furthermore, the concept of 0-dimensional features recovering two holes in Section 4.1 is unclear, and the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the meaning of 0-dimensional features and their relation to 0-dimensional homology.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation, and their approach is novel and significant. The paper is well-suited for the NIPS conference, and the authors have adequately referenced related work.
