This paper proposes a novel method for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling from piecewise continuous distributions, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC). The authors introduce a modification to the leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics, which detects intersections of the trajectory with discontinuities and reflects or refracts the momentum to compensate for the change in energy. The method is shown to preserve the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the volume conservation property of the RHMC algorithm, which is a crucial aspect of HMC. The experimental results demonstrate that RHMC outperforms baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings in terms of effective sample size, particularly in high dimensions.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the authors should clearly explain how their method improves upon existing stochastic optimization methods and related mini-batch optimization techniques. Secondly, the comparison of the method to only its variants is insufficient, and the authors should use existing methods as baselines for experiments. Finally, while the paper is well-written, the authors need to explicitly highlight their novel contributions in a crowded field of stochastic optimization.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. However, the authors could provide more context and background information on the problem of sampling from piecewise continuous distributions and the existing methods.
The originality of the paper is high, as the authors propose a novel method for HMC sampling from piecewise continuous distributions. The paper also provides a unique combination of techniques from physics and machine learning. However, the authors could provide more discussion on the related work and how their method differs from existing approaches.
The significance of the paper is high, as the proposed method has the potential to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference in a wide range of applications. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a heavy-tail piecewise model, which is a challenging problem in machine learning.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The authors should provide more context and background information, clearly explain the improvements over existing methods, and highlight their novel contributions.
