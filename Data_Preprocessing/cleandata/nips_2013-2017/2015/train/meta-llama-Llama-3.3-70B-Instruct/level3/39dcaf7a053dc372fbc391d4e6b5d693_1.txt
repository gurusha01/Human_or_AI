This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of connectomics, specifically in the detection of neuronal boundaries in 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images. The authors propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, VD2D3D, which combines the strengths of 2D and 3D convolutional networks to improve segmentation accuracy. The architecture is recursively trained, with the output of a 2D network (VD2D) serving as input to a 3D network (VD2D3D), allowing for the integration of pixel-level contextual information and low-level features.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology, including the use of ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks that utilizes multicore CPU parallelism for speed. The experimental results demonstrate a substantial gain in accuracy over the state-of-the-art, with the proposed architecture outperforming the baseline N4 network and the VD2D network.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel CNN architecture that combines 2D and 3D convolutions, which is well-suited for the anisotropic nature of serial section EM images.
* The use of recursive training, which allows for the integration of contextual information and low-level features, leading to improved segmentation accuracy.
* The evaluation of the proposed architecture on a new serial section EM dataset from the mouse piriform cortex, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper, including:
* The lack of experiments on a larger variety of datasets, which would help to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach.
* The reliance on a specific implementation of 3D convolutional networks (ZNN), which may limit the reproducibility of the results.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of connectomics, and the proposed architecture has the potential to revolutionize the automation of EM segmentation. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges associated with neuronal boundary detection and propose a novel solution that addresses these challenges.
