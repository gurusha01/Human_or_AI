This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of their algorithms, demonstrating that they outperform existing methods, such as U2-gossip. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of new algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* A thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms, including a comparison with existing methods.
* The provision of numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical interest of the proposed algorithms.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the network graph is connected and non-bipartite, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to explore the performance of the algorithms in more general network settings.
* The authors mention that their methods can be extended to the situation where nodes contain multiple observations, but this is not fully explored in the paper. Further investigation of this scenario could be beneficial.
* The comparison with U2-gossip is primarily theoretical, and it would be useful to include more numerical comparisons to demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed algorithms.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The writing is clear and concise, making it easy to follow.
