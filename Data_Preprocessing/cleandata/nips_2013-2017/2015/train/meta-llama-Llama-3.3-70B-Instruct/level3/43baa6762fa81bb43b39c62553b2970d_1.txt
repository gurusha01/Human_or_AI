This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, HONOR, for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The algorithm incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence and uses a hybrid optimization scheme to guarantee convergence. The paper provides a rigorous convergence analysis and demonstrates the effectiveness of HONOR through experiments on large-scale data sets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm, HONOR, is shown to converge significantly faster than state-of-the-art algorithms, such as GIST, on large-scale data sets.
* The hybrid optimization scheme used in HONOR allows for the incorporation of second-order information, which can greatly speed up convergence.
* The paper provides a rigorous convergence analysis, which is a significant contribution to the field of non-convex optimization.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The analysis is complicated, and the significance of the results may not be immediately clear to readers without a strong background in non-convex optimization.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the choice of parameters, such as Ç«, and how they affect the performance of HONOR.
* The comparison with other algorithms, such as SparseNet and DC-PN, is limited, and it would be helpful to see a more comprehensive comparison.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of non-convex optimization and provides a promising new algorithm for solving large-scale sparse learning problems. However, the analysis and presentation could be improved to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
