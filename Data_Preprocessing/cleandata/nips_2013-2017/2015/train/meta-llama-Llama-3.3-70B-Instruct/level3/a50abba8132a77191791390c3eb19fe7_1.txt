This paper presents a modification of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), for sampling from piecewise smooth energy functions with affine boundaries. The authors introduce a new method for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics on such functions, which incorporates reflection and refraction at the boundaries. They prove that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on HMC and its limitations when dealing with piecewise smooth functions. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the physical motivation behind their method, which is inspired by the behavior of Hamiltonian dynamics in physical systems.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the volume preservation property of their method, which is a crucial component of the proof of correctness. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through numerical experiments, which show that RHMC outperforms traditional HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings in terms of effective sample size.
The paper has several strengths. First, the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method, making it easy to understand and implement. Second, the numerical experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in a variety of settings. Third, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of their method, which provides a strong foundation for its use in practice.
However, the paper also has some limitations. First, the method requires the ability to detect the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which can be computationally expensive. Second, the authors do not provide a comparison with other methods that are specifically designed for piecewise smooth functions, such as the method proposed by Pakman and Paninski. Third, the authors do not discuss the potential limitations of their method in terms of its applicability to more complex models or its robustness to model misspecification.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all of the criteria. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
