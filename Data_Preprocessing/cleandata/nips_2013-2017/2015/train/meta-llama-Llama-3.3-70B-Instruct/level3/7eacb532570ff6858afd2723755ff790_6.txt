This paper introduces a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the RPN architecture, which is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The paper also presents a simple training scheme that alternates between fine-tuning for the region proposal task and fine-tuning for object detection, allowing the RPN and Fast R-CNN to share convolutional features.
The strengths of this paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized explanation of the RPN architecture and its training scheme, making it easy to follow and understand. The paper also presents comprehensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 detection benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RPN in improving region proposal quality and overall object detection accuracy.
One of the weaknesses of this paper is that it assumes the existence of a Condorcet winner, which may be too restrictive. Additionally, the paper focuses on the Plackett-Luce model, which may not be the most suitable model for all scenarios. However, the authors provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the advantages of their approach over other methods, such as Selective Search and EdgeBoxes.
The originality of this paper lies in its proposal of a novel RPN architecture and its training scheme, which enables the sharing of convolutional features between the region proposal and object detection tasks. The paper also provides a unique combination of familiar techniques, such as fully-convolutional networks and alternating optimization, to achieve state-of-the-art object detection accuracy.
The significance of this paper is evident in its potential to advance the state of the art in object detection. The RPN architecture and its training scheme can be applied to various object detection tasks, and the paper's results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving region proposal quality and overall object detection accuracy.
