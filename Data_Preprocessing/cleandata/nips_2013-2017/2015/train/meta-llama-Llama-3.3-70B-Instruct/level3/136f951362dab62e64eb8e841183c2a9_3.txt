This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing high-dimensional structured estimation problems with sub-exponential design matrices and noise. The authors establish a relationship between the Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which enables them to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain bounds on the exponential width. This is a significant contribution, as it allows for the analysis of sub-exponential designs, which are commonly encountered in many application domains.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem setup, contributions, and technical results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the background and related work, which helps to contextualize their contributions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, showing that the error decay is slower for sub-exponential designs compared to Gaussian designs.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing various norms, including the `1 norm and group-sparse norms. The authors also establish a stronger result for the RE condition for the Lasso and group-lasso problems, which is a significant contribution.
However, there are some concerns regarding the theoretical part of the paper, specifically Eq. (8) and Theorem 2. The parameter used for maximization and the boundedness of \rho* could be further clarified. Additionally, the authors may want to consider adding SVD++ as a baseline in the experiments to improve the quality of the evaluation.
Overall, the paper has significant impact potential, as time-sensitive recommendation can be a valuable application in many domains. The authors' contributions are novel and well-motivated, and their approach has the potential to be widely adopted.
