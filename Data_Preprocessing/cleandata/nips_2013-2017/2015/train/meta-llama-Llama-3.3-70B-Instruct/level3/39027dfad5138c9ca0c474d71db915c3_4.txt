This paper presents a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in serial section electron microscopy (EM) images using a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture. The authors propose a recursive training framework, where a preliminary boundary map generated by a 2D ConvNet is used as input to a 3D ConvNet to refine the boundary detection. The use of 3D context and recursive training leads to significant improvements in boundary detection accuracy compared to previous 2D ConvNet architectures.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the biological inspiration behind their recursive framework, which is based on the interplay between neurons in the primary and higher visual cortical areas. The use of ZNN, a new implementation of 3D ConvNets, allows for efficient training of very deep networks and enables the authors to explore new architectures.
The results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods, with a significant reduction in pixel-wise classification error and improved Rand scores. The qualitative comparison of boundary detection results also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing false detections and improving boundary accuracy.
However, there are some minor errors and areas for improvement. For example, in Table 1, the use of "delta > 0" should be rescaled to [-1,0] like in the CRM approach. Additionally, the feedback in "batch learning from logged bandit feedback" should be considered a random variable rather than a deterministic function to account for noisy labeling. The setup in equation (1) should include an additional expectation over the randomness of delta to be more general. There are also some notation inconsistencies and a typo in the optimization problem.
Despite these minor issues, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of connectomics and image segmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other types of anisotropic 3D images, such as video, and the recursive framework can be used for any image labeling problem. The use of ZNN also opens up new possibilities for efficient training of deep networks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to neuronal boundary detection, with significant improvements in accuracy and a clear potential for impact in the field. The minor errors and areas for improvement can be addressed in a revised version of the paper.
