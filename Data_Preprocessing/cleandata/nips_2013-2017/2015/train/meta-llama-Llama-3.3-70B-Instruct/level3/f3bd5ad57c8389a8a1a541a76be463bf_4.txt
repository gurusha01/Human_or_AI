This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of overfitting in adaptive data analysis, where a holdout set is reused multiple times to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm. The authors propose two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting to the holdout set.
The paper explores connections with related algorithms and provides a nice discussion on the topic. The extensive set of experiments demonstrates the practicality of the algorithm, making a convincing argument for its use. However, the paper has some weaknesses in its presentation, with some sloppiness in the use of terms such as "computation" and "memory". The description of SEP is unclear, particularly regarding the number of iterations and convergence. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on certain concepts, such as what is meant by "converges in expectation" and the proof of Theorem 1 is incomplete.
The claim in section 4.4 requires a special assumption and is not true in general, which affects the storage of messages to latent variables. There are also errors and inaccuracies in the paper, including the description of ADF and the procedure in Appendix B.2. Despite these weaknesses, the paper presents an elegant modification of EP that reduces memory requirements but at the cost of reduced accuracy and sometimes more computation.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. The introduction of approximate max-information as a new information-theoretic measure is a significant contribution, as it unifies the generalization arguments that come from both differential privacy and description length.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of overfitting in adaptive data analysis.
* The proposed algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, are simple and practical, and have been demonstrated to be effective in experiments.
* The introduction of approximate max-information is a significant contribution to the field.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper has some weaknesses in its presentation, including sloppiness in the use of terms and unclear descriptions of certain concepts.
* The paper lacks clarity on certain concepts, such as what is meant by "converges in expectation".
* There are errors and inaccuracies in the paper, including the description of ADF and the procedure in Appendix B.2.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the weaknesses in presentation and clarity, the paper has the potential to be a high-quality contribution to the field.
