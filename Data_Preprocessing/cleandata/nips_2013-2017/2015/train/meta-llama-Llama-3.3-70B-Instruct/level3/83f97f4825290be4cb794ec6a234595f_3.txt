This paper addresses the problem of min-max hypergraph partitioning in the streaming computation model, where items arrive online one at a time and each item must be assigned irrevocably to a component at its arrival time. The authors propose a greedy assignment strategy and show that it can recover a hidden co-clustering of items under a natural set of recovery conditions. The paper also reports results of an extensive empirical evaluation, which demonstrate that this greedy strategy yields superior performance when compared with alternative approaches.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The problem definition and the proposed algorithm are clearly explained, and the theoretical analysis is thorough and well-supported by experimental results. The authors also provide a good overview of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a theoretical guarantee for the recovery of hidden clusters, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors use a novel proof technique based on a two-step reduction to Polya urn processes, which is interesting and well-explained. The experimental evaluation is also comprehensive, covering a range of real-world datasets and comparing the proposed algorithm with several alternative approaches.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One of the main limitations is that the proposed algorithm is designed for a specific type of input, namely a random bipartite graph with hidden co-clusters. It is not clear how well the algorithm would perform on other types of inputs, and the authors do not provide any theoretical guarantees for such cases. Additionally, the algorithm requires a significant amount of memory to store the assignments of previous items, which could be a limitation in practice.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by providing a theoretical guarantee for the recovery of hidden clusters in the streaming computation model. The proposed algorithm is also novel and different from existing methods, which makes it a valuable addition to the literature. However, the problem of min-max hypergraph partitioning has been studied before, and the authors build on existing work in the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a theoretical guarantee for the recovery of hidden clusters, which is an important problem in many applications, such as data mining and machine learning. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice, which makes it a valuable contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field and provides a thorough and well-supported analysis of the proposed algorithm. However, I would suggest that the authors address the limitations of the paper, such as the requirement for a specific type of input and the memory requirements of the algorithm, in future work.
