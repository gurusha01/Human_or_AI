This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, HONOR, for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The algorithm incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence and uses a hybrid optimization scheme to guarantee convergence. The paper provides a rigorous convergence analysis, demonstrating that every limit point of the sequence generated by HONOR is a Clarke critical point.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its convergence analysis. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HONOR in solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms such as GIST.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel optimization algorithm that incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence
* A rigorous convergence analysis that demonstrates the convergence of the algorithm to a Clarke critical point
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm may require careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the value of Ç«, to achieve good performance
* The computational cost of the algorithm may be higher than that of other algorithms, such as GIST, due to the use of second-order information
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization and sparse learning, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely used in practice.
