This paper presents a novel approach to learning the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model from ordinal data, with applications in collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. The authors extend the Generalized Lasso to non-linear measurements and Gaussian design, providing precise explicit expressions of the error estimation. They confirm the accuracy of their predictions with many special cases, including the Lasso, the group Lasso, and the nuclear norm.
The paper builds upon the work of Plan and Vershynin, expanding on several novel aspects, such as explicit expressions of the performance estimation error. The application of the Generalized Lasso to the design of optimal quantizers in q-Bit CS and its relation to the Lloyd-Max quantizer is insightful and noteworthy.
The authors provide a nice piece of work with well-written content, although the treatment is somewhat unbalanced due to lack of space. The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The notation is standard, and the authors provide sufficient background information for the reader to understand the context and the contributions of the paper.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, such as the Generalized Lasso and the MNL model, to address a new problem. The authors provide a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to learning the MNL model from ordinal data.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of personalized recommendation systems and revenue management. The authors' findings show that asymptotically, the estimation performance of the Generalized Lasso with non-linear measurements is the same as if the measurements were linear and noisy.
