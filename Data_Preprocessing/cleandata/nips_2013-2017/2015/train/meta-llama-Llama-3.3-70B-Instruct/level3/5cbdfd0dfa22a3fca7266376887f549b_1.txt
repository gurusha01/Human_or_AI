This paper proposes a modified Leurgans' algorithm for decomposing sparse and low-rank tensors, which is a computationally expensive task. The algorithm is efficient and scalable, relying on the notion of tensor contraction to reduce the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance and demonstrates its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and efficient algorithm for order 3 tensors, as well as its ability to provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance. The paper also demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness through numerical experiments, showing that it can accurately recover the low-rank and sparse components of a tensor.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One concern is the scalability of the algorithm for large-scale tensor decompositions, as it requires eigenvalue decompositions and solving convex matrix optimization problems. The paper could benefit from more numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, particularly for larger tensors and higher ranks. Additionally, the paper could provide more clarification on how the convex matrix optimization problem (6) is solved in the implementation.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees, as well as a detailed description of the numerical experiments. However, there are some typos and formatting errors throughout the paper that could be improved.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of tensor decomposition, providing a efficient and scalable algorithm for decomposing sparse and low-rank tensors. With some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
