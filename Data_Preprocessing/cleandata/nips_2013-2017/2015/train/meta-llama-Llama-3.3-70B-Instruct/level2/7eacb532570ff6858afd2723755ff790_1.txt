This paper presents a novel approach to online rank elicitation based on pairwise comparisons under the assumption of a Plackett-Luce model. The authors propose constructing a surrogate probability distribution over rankings using a sorting procedure, specifically QuickSort, which preserves the pairwise marginals of the Plackett-Luce distribution. This approach allows for efficient exploitation of the stochastic transitivity properties of the Plackett-Luce model.
The paper makes two main claims: (1) the proposed algorithm, PLPAC, can find a PAC-item (an item that is almost as good as the optimal one) with a sample complexity of O(M log M), and (2) the algorithm PLPAC-AMPR can find an approximately most probable ranking (AMPR) with a sample complexity of O((M log M) max(1/(2ε(i)))^2 log(M/ε(i))). 
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental studies. The theoretical analysis shows that the budgeted QuickSort algorithm preserves the pairwise stability property, which is essential for the correctness of the proposed algorithms. The experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, such as INTERLEAVED FILTER, BEAT THE MEAN, and RankCentrality.
