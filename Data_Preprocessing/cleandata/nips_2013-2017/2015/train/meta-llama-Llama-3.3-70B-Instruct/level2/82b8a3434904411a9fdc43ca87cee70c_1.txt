This paper proposes a novel framework for computing a lower bound of cross-validation (CV) errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which can be used to provide a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions. The authors introduce a new CV error lower bound that can be computed using a finite number of solutions obtained by arbitrary algorithms, making it easy to apply to common regularization parameter tuning strategies such as grid-search or Bayesian optimization.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed framework and its advantages. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in finding theoretically guaranteed approximate regularization parameters with reasonable computational costs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed framework provides a theoretical guarantee on the choice of the regularization parameter, which is a significant improvement over current practices.
* The framework can be applied to a wide range of problems, including those with non-convex loss functions.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its implementation.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational cost of the algorithm can be high, especially when the approximation quality ε is close to 0.
* The algorithm may not be suitable for very large datasets, as the computational cost increases with the size of the dataset.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other existing methods for regularization parameter tuning, which would be helpful in evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the proposed framework has the potential to be widely adopted in practice. However, further research is needed to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm and to extend it to multiple hyper-parameters tuning setups.
