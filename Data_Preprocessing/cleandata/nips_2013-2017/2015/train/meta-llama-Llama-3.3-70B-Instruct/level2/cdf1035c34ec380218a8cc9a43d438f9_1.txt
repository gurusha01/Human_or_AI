This paper presents an online algorithm for classifying the vertices of a graph based on the probability distribution of an Ising model isomorphic to the graph. The algorithm predicts the label with maximum marginal probability in the limit of zero-temperature with respect to the labels and vertices seen so far. The authors provide a mistake bound analysis of their algorithm and compare it to existing approaches.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the algorithm is optimal on trees, matching the results of [1]; (2) the algorithm has a quadratic cumulative computational complexity; and (3) the algorithm provides a per-cluster bound that improves on existing bounds in many natural cases.
The support for these claims is provided through a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance on various types of graphs, including trees, clusters, and general graphs. The authors use the Picard-Queyranne graph to capture the combinatorial structure of the set of minimum-cuts and provide a mistake bound guarantee for their algorithm.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The use of the Picard-Queyranne graph is a novel contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing the algorithm's performance.
