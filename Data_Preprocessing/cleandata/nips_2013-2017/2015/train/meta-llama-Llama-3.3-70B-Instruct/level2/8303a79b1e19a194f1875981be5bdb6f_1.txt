This paper presents a novel modification of the Leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), for sampling from piecewise continuous energies. The authors introduce a method to detect intersections of the trajectory with discontinuities and reflect or refract the momentum to compensate for the change in energy. The paper proves that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine and demonstrates its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
The main claim of the paper is that RHMC improves upon traditional Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) by reducing the number of rejected samples, particularly in high dimensions. The authors support this claim through a detailed analysis of the volume preservation property of the reflective leapfrog dynamics and experimental results on a heavy-tail piecewise model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and theoretical results. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in comparison to baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of sampling from piecewise continuous energies
* A detailed and rigorous analysis of the reflective leapfrog dynamics and its volume preservation property
* A thorough experimental evaluation of the method on a challenging model
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method requires the ability to detect the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which may be computationally expensive in some cases
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the method and its potential limitations
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and demonstrates the potential of RHMC for efficient probabilistic inference in complex models.
