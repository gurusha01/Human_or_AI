This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics in a decentralized setting. The main claim of the paper is that these algorithms achieve faster convergence rates and lower memory and communication costs compared to existing approaches. The authors support their claims with theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on real datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of decentralized computation of U-statistics. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a good overview of existing gossip algorithms and their limitations. The proposed algorithms, GoSta-sync and GoSta-async, are well-motivated and clearly described.
The theoretical analysis of the algorithms is sound, and the authors provide convergence rate bounds for both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The use of "phantom nodes" to model the data propagation and averaging steps is a clever technique that allows for a more tractable analysis. The authors also provide a comparison with the U2-gossip algorithm, which highlights the advantages of their approach.
The numerical experiments are convincing, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms on two real-world datasets. The results show that GoSta-sync outperforms U2-gossip in terms of average relative error and variance, and that the performance gap widens as the size of the graph increases.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposed algorithms are novel and well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise description of their approach.
* The theoretical analysis is sound, and the authors provide convergence rate bounds for both synchronous and asynchronous settings.
* The numerical experiments are convincing, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms on real-world datasets.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The authors could provide more discussion on the practical implications of their results and the potential applications of their algorithms.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other existing algorithms, including those that are not based on gossip protocols.
* The authors assume that the network graph is connected and non-bipartite, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to see how the algorithms perform in more general settings.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of decentralized computation, and their algorithms have the potential to be widely used in practice.
