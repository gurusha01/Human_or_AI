This paper proposes a novel framework for recommending items at the right moment and predicting the next returning time of users to existing services. The authors connect self-exciting point processes and low-rank models to capture the recurrent temporal patterns in user-item consumption pairs. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed framework can effectively capture the temporal dynamics of user-item interactions, and (2) the authors' optimization algorithm can efficiently learn the model parameters. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its superior scalability and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
