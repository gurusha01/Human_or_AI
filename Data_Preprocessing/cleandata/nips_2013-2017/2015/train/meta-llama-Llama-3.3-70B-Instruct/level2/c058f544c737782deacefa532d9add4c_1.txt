This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization algorithm, a popular method for constrained convex optimization. The authors highlight and clarify several variants of the FW algorithm, including away-steps FW, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW, and Wolfe's minimum norm point algorithm. They provide a unified convergence analysis, showing that all these variants enjoy global linear convergence under a weaker condition than strong convexity of the objective.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithms, their intuition, and the proof techniques used to establish the convergence rates. The use of geometric quantities, such as the pyramidal width, to characterize the condition number of the constraint set is a novel and interesting contribution.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the connections and differences between their contributions and existing results. The experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on two real-world applications, showcasing their linear convergence and outperforming the original FW algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Unification of FW variants: The authors provide a unified convergence analysis for several FW variants, highlighting their similarities and differences.
2. Novel geometric quantities: The introduction of the pyramidal width and its relation to the condition number of the constraint set is a significant contribution.
3. Empirical evidence: The experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real-world applications.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Technical complexity: The paper assumes a strong background in convex optimization and linear programming, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
2. Limited discussion of limitations: While the authors mention some limitations of their approach, a more detailed discussion of the potential drawbacks and future research directions would be beneficial.
Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of convex optimization, providing a comprehensive analysis of the FW algorithm and its variants. The authors' use of geometric quantities to characterize the condition number of the constraint set is a novel and interesting approach, and their empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
