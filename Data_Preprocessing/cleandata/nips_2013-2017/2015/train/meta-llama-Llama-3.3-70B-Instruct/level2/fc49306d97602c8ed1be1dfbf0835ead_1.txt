This paper proposes a novel kernel-based method for cross-domain instance matching, which is a crucial task in various applications such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining. The authors introduce a new data representation that assumes each feature in different domains is associated with a latent vector in a shared latent space, enabling the measurement of similarity between features across domains. The proposed method employs the framework of kernel embeddings of distributions to represent instances as distributions of latent vectors and learns the latent vectors by minimizing the difference between distributions of paired instances.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method, related work, and experimental results. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various cross-domain datasets, including multilingual Wikipedia articles, documents and tags, and images and tags. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods, including canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), kernel CCA (KCCA), and bilingual latent Dirichlet allocation (BLDA).
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is novel and addresses the limitation of existing methods in handling non-linear relationships between features across domains.
* The use of kernel embeddings of distributions provides a flexible and efficient way to represent instances as distributions of latent vectors.
* The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various datasets.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the features in different domains are represented as bag-of-words, which may not be applicable to other types of data.
* The proposed method requires careful selection of hyperparameters, including the dimensionality of the shared latent space, regularizer parameter, and Gaussian embedding kernel parameter.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method shows promising results. With some further refinement and extension, the method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of cross-domain instance matching tasks.
