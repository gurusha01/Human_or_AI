This paper presents improved algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression of a set of values on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) under various weighted p-norms. The authors provide a unified framework for solving the Isotonic Regression problem for all weighted p-norms, with rigorous performance guarantees. The paper also presents algorithms for `∞-norms and Strict Isotonic Regression, which are shown to be more efficient than previous results.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. The authors present an algorithm, ISOTONICIPM, that solves the Isotonic Regression problem for all weighted p-norms in time O(m1.5 log2 n log n/δ), which improves on the previous best time bounds.
2. The authors present an algorithm for `∞-norms that runs in expected time O(m), which is the best possible running time.
3. The authors present an algorithm for Strict Isotonic Regression that runs in expected time O(mn), which improves on the previous best time bound.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of correctness and running time bounds. They also present experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms in practice.
