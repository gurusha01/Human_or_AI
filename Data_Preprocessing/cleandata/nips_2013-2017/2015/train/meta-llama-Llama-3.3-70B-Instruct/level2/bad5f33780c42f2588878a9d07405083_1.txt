This paper addresses the problem of overfitting in adaptive data analysis, where a holdout set is reused multiple times to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm. The authors propose two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting to the holdout set.
The paper makes several significant contributions. Firstly, it formalizes the problem of preserving statistical validity in adaptive data analysis and provides a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout set. Secondly, it introduces a new information-theoretic measure, approximate max-information, which unifies the generalization arguments that come from both differential privacy and description length. This measure quantifies how much information has been learned about the data by the analyst and provides a way to control the risk of overfitting.
The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including their guarantees and limitations. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in preventing overfitting and providing a valid estimate of classifier accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough analysis of the algorithms, and its demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The paper also provides a good review of related work and clearly explains the significance of the contributions.
The weaknesses of the paper include its technical complexity, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow. Additionally, the paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with differential privacy and description length, which may not be familiar to all readers.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes significant contributions to the field of adaptive data analysis and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the paper provides a good review of related work.
