This paper presents a convex relaxation approach to learn the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model from ordinal data, with applications in collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of their approach, including an upper bound on the error and a matching information-theoretic lower bound. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors propose a convex relaxation approach to learn the MNL model from ordinal data, (2) they provide an upper bound on the error of their approach, and (3) they show that this bound is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. The authors support their claims with theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.
The paper has several strengths. First, the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the MNL model and its applications, making it easy for readers to understand the context and significance of their work. Second, the authors' theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-motivated, providing a clear understanding of the performance guarantees of their approach. Third, the authors provide numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of their approach, which helps to build confidence in their theoretical results.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. First, the authors' approach is limited to the MNL model, which may not be suitable for all applications. Second, the authors' theoretical analysis relies on several assumptions, such as the low-rank structure of the preference matrix, which may not always hold in practice. Third, the authors' numerical experiments are limited to a few synthetic datasets, which may not be representative of real-world applications.
In terms of usefulness, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of recommendation systems and revenue management. The authors' approach can be used to learn the MNL model from ordinal data, which can be used to make personalized recommendations and optimize revenue. However, the authors' approach may not be directly applicable to all applications, and further research is needed to extend their results to more general settings.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to learning the MNL model from ordinal data. The authors' convex relaxation approach is a new and innovative way to learn the MNL model, and their theoretical analysis provides a clear understanding of the performance guarantees of their approach.
In terms of field knowledge, the paper demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant literature in the field of recommendation systems and revenue management. The authors provide a clear and concise review of the existing approaches to learning the MNL model, and they motivate their approach by highlighting the limitations of existing methods.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recommendation systems and revenue management, and the authors' approach has the potential to be widely applicable. While the paper has some weaknesses, the authors' theoretical analysis and numerical experiments provide a clear understanding of the performance guarantees of their approach, and their results are likely to be of interest to a wide range of researchers and practitioners.
