This paper presents a novel Markov chain, called projected Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), for sampling from a log-concave distribution restricted to a convex body. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the chain, including its convergence in total variation distance to the target distribution. The main result shows that for an appropriately chosen step-size and number of iterations, the chain converges to the target distribution in polynomial time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their contribution. The technical arguments are sound, and the use of elementary concepts from stochastic calculus is a nice touch. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as hit-and-run and lattice walk, and highlight the advantages of their proposed chain.
The experiments presented in the paper are preliminary but encouraging, suggesting that LMC may be a competitor to hit-and-run in practice. However, more extensive experiments are needed to fully evaluate the performance of LMC.
Here are some arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pro:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting Markov chain for sampling from log-concave distributions.
* The analysis is thorough and well-done, providing a clear understanding of the chain's convergence properties.
* The experiments are promising, suggesting that LMC may be a useful tool in practice.
Con:
* The paper assumes a convex body and a log-concave distribution, which may limit its applicability to more general settings.
* The choice of step-size and number of iterations may require careful tuning in practice.
* More extensive experiments are needed to fully evaluate the performance of LMC and compare it to existing methods.
Overall, I think this paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. The authors have presented a novel and interesting Markov chain, and their analysis is thorough and well-done. While there are some limitations and areas for future work, the paper provides a solid foundation for further research and development.
Quality: 8/10
Clarity: 9/10
Originality: 8/10
Significance: 8/10
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should consider adding more extensive experiments and comparisons to existing methods to further evaluate the performance of LMC. Additionally, they may want to discuss potential limitations and areas for future work in more detail.
