This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation, particularly in the context of non-linear measurements. The authors extend the classical work of Brillinger and recent results by Plan and Vershynin to provide a precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for estimating structured signals from non-linear measurements. The main claim of the paper is that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear, with a scaling factor and noise variance that depend on the link function.
The support for this claim is provided through a series of theoretical results, including Theorems 2.1 and 2.2, which establish the asymptotic equivalence of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements to the Generalized LASSO with linear measurements. The authors also provide specific results for sparse, group-sparse, and low-rank signal recovery, demonstrating the accuracy of their predictions through numerical simulations.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough discussion of the relevant literature. The technical results are presented in a clear and organized manner, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The use of notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a helpful summary of the main contributions and results in the introduction.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as they provide a framework for understanding the behavior of the Generalized LASSO algorithm in the presence of non-linear measurements. The results have implications for a wide range of applications, including signal processing, image processing, and machine learning.
The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the field, and the authors are aware of the relevant literature and recent advances in the area. The references provided are comprehensive and relevant, and the authors properly cite the work of other researchers in the field.
The novelty of the paper lies in its ability to provide a precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for non-linear measurements, which is a significant improvement over existing results. The authors' use of the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT) framework allows them to derive tight bounds on the estimation error, which is a key contribution of the paper.
The completeness of the paper is evident, as the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of the modeling assumptions, the technical results, and the numerical simulations. The authors also provide a clear and concise conclusion, summarizing the main contributions and results of the paper.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the results are asymptotic and may not hold for finite sample sizes. However, the authors provide numerical simulations that demonstrate the accuracy of their predictions for a range of sample sizes.
Overall, this is a well-written and technically sound paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation. The authors' use of the CGMT framework and their ability to derive tight bounds on the estimation error make this paper a valuable addition to the literature.
