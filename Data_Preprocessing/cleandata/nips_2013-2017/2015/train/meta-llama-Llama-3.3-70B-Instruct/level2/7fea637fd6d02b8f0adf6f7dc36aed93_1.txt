This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and online learning, introducing a class of no-regret algorithms with recency bias that achieve faster convergence rates to approximate efficiency and coarse correlated equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games. The authors demonstrate that these algorithms, which satisfy the Regret bounded by Variation in Utilities (RVU) property, can lead to faster convergence rates of O(1/T) for the average welfare and O(T^3/4) for individual regret, improving upon the previously known worst-case rates.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed presentation of their main results. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the authors provide proofs for their key propositions and theorems. The paper also includes an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms, which demonstrates their effectiveness in practice.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to generalize previous results to the more challenging case of arbitrary multi-player normal-form games. The authors also provide a black-box reduction that preserves the fast rates in favorable environments while maintaining robustness to adversarial opponents.
The paper has several implications for the field, including the computation of correlated equilibria and the understanding of agent behavior in complex multi-player games. The authors also identify several interesting directions for future research, such as the convergence rates for vanilla Hedge and the convergence of players' strategies.
In terms of the review criteria, the paper scores highly on:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide clear explanations of their results and techniques.
* Originality: The paper presents a significant contribution to the field, introducing a new class of algorithms and providing a rigorous analysis of their properties.
* Significance: The paper has important implications for the field, and the results are likely to be of interest to a wide range of researchers.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of:
* Usefulness: While the paper provides a clear explanation of the algorithms and their properties, it could be helpful to include more discussion on the potential applications and practical implications of the results.
* Field knowledge: The paper assumes a strong background in game theory and online learning, and some readers may find it challenging to follow the technical details.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to influence future research in game theory and online learning.
