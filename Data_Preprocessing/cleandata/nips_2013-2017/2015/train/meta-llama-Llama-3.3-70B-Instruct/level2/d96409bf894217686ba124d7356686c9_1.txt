This paper proposes a novel approach to deep structured output learning, specifically for semantic image segmentation, by directly learning message estimators in message passing inference for Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed method, called CNN message learning, is efficient and scalable, especially for cases with a large number of classes, (2) it achieves impressive performance on semantic image segmentation, and (3) it provides a new direction for learning deep structured models.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors demonstrate that their approach eliminates the need for expensive inference steps in traditional CRF learning, making it more efficient. They also show that the network output dimension for message estimation is the same as the number of classes, which reduces the number of network parameters and makes it more scalable. The experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other recent CNN-based methods.
