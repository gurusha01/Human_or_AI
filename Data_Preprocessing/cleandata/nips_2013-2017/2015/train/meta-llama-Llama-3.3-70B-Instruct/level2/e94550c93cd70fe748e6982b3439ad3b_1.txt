This paper introduces Variational Consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a novel class of data-parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that adaptively choose the aggregation function to achieve a closer approximation to the true posterior. The authors formulate the choice of aggregation function as a variational Bayes problem, allowing for nonlinear aggregation functions and structured aggregation functions applicable to non-vectorial inference problems.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work and the contributions of their approach. The technical content is sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the variational optimization problem, including the derivation of a relaxed entropy term and the proof of blockwise concavity of the variational objective.
The empirical evaluation of VCMC on three inference problems demonstrates its advantages over existing approaches, including Consensus Monte Carlo (CMC) and Gaussian averaging. The results show that VCMC improves moment estimation and reduces errors in posterior approximation, especially in high-dimensional settings.
The paper has several strengths:
1. Novel approach: VCMC introduces a new perspective on data-parallel MCMC, formulating the aggregation function as a variational Bayes problem.
2. Theoretical foundations: The authors provide a thorough analysis of the variational optimization problem, including the derivation of a relaxed entropy term and the proof of blockwise concavity.
3. Empirical evaluation: The paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of VCMC on three inference problems, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
1. Computational efficiency: The optimization step in VCMC can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential solutions, such as data minibatching and adaptive step sizes.
2. Choice of aggregation function: The performance of VCMC depends critically on the choice of aggregation function family. The authors provide some guidance on this choice, but further research is needed to develop more general and effective aggregation functions.
3. Comparison to other methods: While the paper compares VCMC to CMC and Gaussian averaging, it would be useful to compare it to other data-parallel MCMC methods, such as asynchronous variants of Gibbs sampling.
In conclusion, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian computation, introducing a novel approach to data-parallel MCMC that has the potential to improve the scalability and accuracy of Bayesian inference. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper provides a solid foundation for further research and development.
