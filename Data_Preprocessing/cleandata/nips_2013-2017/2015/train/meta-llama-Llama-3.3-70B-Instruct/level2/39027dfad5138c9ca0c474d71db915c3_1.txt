This paper proposes a novel approach to batch learning from logged bandit feedback (BLBF) by introducing a self-normalized risk estimator that avoids the propensity overfitting problem inherent in the conventional unbiased risk estimator. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, called Norm-POEM, through extensive empirical evaluations on several multi-label classification problems.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the conventional unbiased risk estimator suffers from propensity overfitting, which can lead to severely biased risk estimates; (2) the self-normalized risk estimator provably avoids this problem; and (3) Norm-POEM, a learning algorithm based on the self-normalized estimator, achieves significantly improved generalization performance compared to the conventional approach.
The support for these claims is strong. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the propensity overfitting problem and demonstrate its existence in various datasets. They also provide a detailed derivation of the self-normalized risk estimator and show its theoretical advantages over the conventional estimator. The empirical evaluations are comprehensive and well-designed, demonstrating the effectiveness of Norm-POEM in various settings.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the differences between their approach and existing methods.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of BLBF algorithms in various applications, such as online advertising and recommendation systems.
