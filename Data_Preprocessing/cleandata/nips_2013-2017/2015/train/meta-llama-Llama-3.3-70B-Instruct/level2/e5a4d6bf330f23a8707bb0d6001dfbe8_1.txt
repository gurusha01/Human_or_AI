This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problems by introducing a novel approach called Implicit eXploration (IX). The authors challenge the common belief that explicit exploration is necessary to achieve high-probability regret bounds and demonstrate that IX can achieve strong results without this undesirable component.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of the IX strategy and its application to various bandit problems. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the authors provide several theorems and lemmas to support their claims.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Novel approach: The IX strategy is a new and innovative approach to achieving high-probability regret bounds in non-stochastic bandit problems.
2. Theoretical guarantees: The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees for the performance of IX, including high-probability bounds for various bandit problems.
3. Empirical evaluation: The authors conduct a simple experiment to demonstrate the robustness of IX and its superior performance compared to existing algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Limited scope: The paper focuses primarily on non-stochastic bandit problems and does not explore the applicability of IX to other settings, such as linear bandits.
2. Parameter tuning: The authors acknowledge that tuning the IX parameter may be challenging in practice, which could limit the applicability of the approach.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider:
1. Extending the scope: Exploring the applicability of IX to other settings, such as linear bandits, and investigating its potential benefits in these contexts.
2. Providing more guidance on parameter tuning: Offering more guidance on how to tune the IX parameter in practice, or developing adaptive methods for setting this parameter.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and has the potential to impact the development of new algorithms and approaches in this area.
