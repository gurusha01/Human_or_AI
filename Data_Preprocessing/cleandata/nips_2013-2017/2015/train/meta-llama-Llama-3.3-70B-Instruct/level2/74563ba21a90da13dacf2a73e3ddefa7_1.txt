This paper presents a novel approach to statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. The authors propose a universal kernel on persistence diagrams, which enables the use of kernel-based learning techniques, such as support vector machines and two-sample hypothesis testing. The kernel is constructed by modifying a previously introduced kernel, and its universality is proven using a theorem from the literature.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background material, including persistent homology and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a universal kernel on persistence diagrams, which enables the use of kernel-based learning techniques.
* The provision of a clear and concise introduction to the background material.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The restriction of the set of persistence diagrams to a compact metric space, which may limit the applicability of the approach.
* The lack of a clear guideline on how to choose the heat kernel signature time, which may affect the results of the experiments.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of topological data analysis, and the authors demonstrate the potential of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data. The paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are sound.
