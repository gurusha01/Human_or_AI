This paper introduces a novel Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The RPN is a fully-convolutional network that predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position, and is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals. The authors propose a simple alternating optimization scheme to train the RPN and Fast R-CNN object detection network to share convolutional features.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the RPN-based method achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012, while being significantly faster than existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed RPN architecture is novel and effective, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the design choices and motivations.
* The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in object detection and deep learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the experimental results, such as the comparison with OverFeat, could be more thoroughly explained and motivated.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of object detection. The proposed RPN architecture is novel and effective, and the experimental results demonstrate its potential for improving object detection accuracy and speed.
