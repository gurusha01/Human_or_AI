This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with progressive widening to approximate the optimal policy. The system, called LENSE, is evaluated on three tasks: named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification.
The paper's main claims are that LENSE can achieve high accuracy while reducing cost by more than an order of magnitude compared to full human annotation, and that it outperforms other baselines, including online learning and threshold-based approaches. The authors support these claims with experimental results, which show that LENSE achieves an F1 score of 88.4% on the NER task with a significant reduction in cost.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The use of MCTS with progressive widening is a novel contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in approximating the optimal policy. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.
The paper's strengths include its novelty, clarity, and thoroughness. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The use of real-world datasets and crowdsourcing platforms adds to the paper's credibility and relevance.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the crowd workers are noisy, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of the noise model. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches in the field. The authors also do not discuss the potential limitations of their approach, such as the need for a large number of crowd workers or the potential for bias in the crowd's responses.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to on-the-job learning. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
