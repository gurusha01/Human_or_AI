This paper presents a novel extension to Expectation Propagation (EP), called Stochastic Expectation Propagation (SEP), which addresses the significant memory overhead of EP when applied to large datasets. The authors propose SEP as a method that maintains a global posterior approximation, similar to Variational Inference (VI), but updates it in a local way, similar to EP. The key idea is to tie the approximating factors, allowing for a significant reduction in memory consumption.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to EP and its limitations. The derivation of SEP is well-motivated, and the algorithm is clearly presented. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between SEP and other existing methods, including ADF, VMP, and SVI.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEP in reducing memory consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy with EP. The results on Bayesian logistic regression, mixture of Gaussians clustering, and probabilistic backpropagation show that SEP performs similarly to EP, and in some cases, even outperforms it.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise introduction to EP and its limitations
* A well-motivated derivation of SEP
* A thorough analysis of the relationship between SEP and other existing methods
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of SEP in reducing memory consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy with EP
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The theoretical understanding of SEP and its convergence properties is limited, and further work is needed to fully understand the algorithm
* The experimental results are mostly focused on synthetic datasets, and more experiments on real-world datasets are needed to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of SEP
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of approximate Bayesian inference, and SEP has the potential to become a widely used method for large-scale Bayesian learning. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of SEP in reducing memory consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy with EP, and further work is needed to fully explore the potential of this algorithm.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated extension to EP
* The algorithm is clearly presented, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the relationship between SEP and other existing methods
Arguments con acceptance:
* The theoretical understanding of SEP and its convergence properties is limited

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the limitations of the paper, including the limited theoretical understanding of SEP and the need for more experiments on real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more details on the implementation of SEP and its scalability to larger datasets.
