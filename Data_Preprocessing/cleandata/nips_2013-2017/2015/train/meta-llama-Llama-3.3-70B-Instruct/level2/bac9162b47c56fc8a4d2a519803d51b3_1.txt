This paper presents a novel approach to knowledge tracing, a well-established problem in computer-supported education, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The authors propose a formulation called Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which applies flexible RNNs to model student learning and predict future interactions. The main claims of the paper are: (1) DKT achieves a 25% gain in AUC over the best previous result on a knowledge tracing benchmark, (2) it does not require expert annotations, and (3) it can discover latent structure in the data.
The paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results on three datasets: simulated data, Khan Academy data, and the Assistments benchmark dataset. The authors demonstrate that DKT outperforms previous methods, including Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and other dynamic probabilistic models. The results show that DKT can accurately predict student performance, discover exercise relationships, and improve curricula.
The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides sufficient details for reproducibility. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach, including the requirement for large amounts of training data, and discuss potential directions for future research.
The significance of this work lies in its potential to improve personalized learning and education. The authors demonstrate that DKT can be used to power intelligent curriculum design, discover latent structure in the data, and provide unique insights into student learning. The results have important implications for education research and practice, and the authors' plan to test the efficacy of DKT in a controlled experiment with Khan Academy is a promising direction for future work.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant improvement over previous methods in knowledge tracing.
