This paper presents a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images. The authors propose a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture, which combines the strengths of 2D and 3D filters to leverage both local and contextual information. The network is trained recursively, with the output of a preliminary 2D ConvNet serving as input to a subsequent 3D ConvNet. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a new dataset of serial section EM images from the mouse piriform cortex.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by experimental results, which demonstrate significant improvements in boundary detection accuracy over existing 2D ConvNet architectures. The use of 3D filters and recursive training enables the network to effectively utilize contextual information and reduce false positives. The authors also introduce ZNN, a new software implementation for 3D ConvNets that leverages multicore CPU parallelism for efficient training.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the problem domain and a detailed description of the proposed approach. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their method, including quantitative and qualitative results, and discuss the potential applications of their approach to other image labeling problems.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, technical soundness, and significance. The proposed approach represents a significant improvement over existing methods, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results. The paper also demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant literature and provides proper citations.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors could provide more details on the training procedures and hyperparameter tuning, as well as a more comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed approach.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of connectomics, and their approach has the potential to be widely adopted. With some minor revisions to address the limitations mentioned above, the paper could be even stronger.
