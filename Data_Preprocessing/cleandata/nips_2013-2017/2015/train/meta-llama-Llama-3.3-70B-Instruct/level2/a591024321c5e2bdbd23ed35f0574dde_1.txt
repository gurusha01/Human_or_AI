This paper presents a novel approach to learning Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs) using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms. The authors address the challenge of efficient parameter learning in CT-HMMs, which is essential for modeling disease progression from irregularly-sampled clinical measurements. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed EM algorithms can efficiently learn CT-HMM parameters, enabling the modeling of complex disease progression patterns.
The support for this claim comes from the theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a comprehensive framework for CT-HMM learning, which leverages recent approaches for evaluating end-state conditioned expectations in Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) models. They also analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithms and compare their performance with existing methods.
The paper demonstrates the usefulness of CT-HMMs in modeling disease progression using two real-world datasets: glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease. The results show that CT-HMMs can outperform state-of-the-art methods in predicting disease progression and provide valuable insights into the underlying disease mechanisms.
