This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture called "highway networks" that allows for unimpeded information flow across many layers, inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks. The authors propose to modify the architecture of very deep feedforward networks to include adaptive gating units, which regulate the information flow and enable the training of extremely deep networks using simple gradient descent.
The main claims of the paper are that highway networks can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), without suffering from the difficulties of training deep networks, and that they can generalize well to unseen data. The authors support these claims with experimental results on several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrating that highway networks can achieve competitive or better performance than state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the highway network architecture and its components. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of the transform gates and the routing of information in the network.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed architecture, the thorough experimental evaluation, and the clear presentation of the results. The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of a more detailed comparison with other methods for training deep networks, such as residual networks, and the limited analysis of the computational cost of the highway network architecture.
In terms of the criteria for evaluation, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the highway network architecture and its components. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the experimental results. The paper is also original, as it proposes a novel architecture for training deep neural networks.
The paper scores moderately on significance, as the results are impressive, but the authors could have provided a more detailed analysis of the implications of the highway network architecture for the field of deep learning. The paper scores well on usefulness, as the proposed architecture has the potential to be useful for a wide range of applications, including image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-evaluated architecture for training deep neural networks. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the highway network architecture and its components. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of the transform gates and the routing of information in the network.
