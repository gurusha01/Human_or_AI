This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic for link prediction and clustering in networks, under the stochastic blockmodel formulation. The authors show that common neighbors can extract clusters with high probability when the graph is dense enough, and can do so even in sparser graphs with the addition of a "cleaning" step. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) common neighbors can solve link prediction and local clustering problems in the semi-dense regime, and (2) with the addition of a cleaning step, common neighbors can also solve these problems in the semi-sparse regime. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for these claims, and support them with empirical results on simulated and real-world data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the stochastic blockmodel, the common neighbors heuristic, and the cleaning step. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the authors provide a detailed proof of their main results. The empirical results are also convincing, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various datasets.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) a clear and well-organized presentation, (2) a rigorous theoretical analysis, and (3) convincing empirical results. The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the assumption of a stochastic blockmodel, which may not always hold in practice, and (2) the requirement of a cleaning step in the semi-sparse regime, which may add computational complexity.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network analysis, and provides a useful heuristic for link prediction and clustering. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and rigorous presentation of their results.
