This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of supervised metric learning, providing both upper and lower bounds for the distance-based and classifier-based frameworks. The authors show that the sample complexity scales with the representation dimension when no assumptions are made about the underlying data distribution, but can be improved by leveraging the structure of the data distribution. They introduce the concept of metric learning complexity, which characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, and provide sample complexity rates that are finely tuned to this complexity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of metric learning and its importance in machine learning. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the related work in the field. The empirical evaluation is also well-designed, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of norm-regularization in improving the performance of metric learning algorithms in high-noise regimes.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of supervised metric learning, including both upper and lower bounds for the distance-based and classifier-based frameworks.
* The introduction of the concept of metric learning complexity, which provides a new perspective on the problem of metric learning.
* A thorough discussion of the related work in the field, including a comparison with existing results and an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
* A well-designed empirical evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of norm-regularization in improving the performance of metric learning algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a strong background in machine learning and metric learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions of the paper.
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a few datasets and algorithms, and it would be interesting to see a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of metric learning, and the authors provide a thorough and well-motivated analysis of the problem. The empirical evaluation is well-designed, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
