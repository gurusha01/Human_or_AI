This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, HONOR, for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The main claims of the paper are: (1) HONOR incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence, (2) it provides a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex problems, and (3) it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in empirical studies.
The support for these claims is strong. The authors provide a detailed convergence analysis, which is a significant contribution to the field. The analysis shows that every limit point of the sequence generated by HONOR is a Clarke critical point, which is a desirable property for non-convex optimization problems. The empirical studies demonstrate that HONOR converges significantly faster than state-of-the-art algorithms, such as GIST, on large-scale data sets.
The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is evident, as it can be applied to a wide range of sparse learning problems, including logistic regression and least squares problems. The algorithm's ability to incorporate second-order information and its carefully designed hybrid optimization scheme make it a valuable tool for solving large-scale non-convex problems.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, as it builds upon existing work on non-convex optimization and sparse learning. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature and provide proper citations. The novelty of the work lies in the proposed algorithm's ability to efficiently solve non-convex regularized problems, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
The completeness of the paper is satisfactory, as it provides a detailed description of the algorithm and its convergence analysis. The empirical studies are also well-designed and provide valuable insights into the algorithm's performance.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the algorithm's performance may degrade when the parameter ǫ is set to a large value. However, the authors provide a clear discussion of this issue and suggest that setting ǫ to a small value is always safe to guarantee fast convergence.
Overall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it makes a significant contribution to the field of non-convex optimization. The proposed algorithm, HONOR, has the potential to become a widely used tool for solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems.
