This paper investigates the robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem, which aims to decompose an observed matrix into the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse error matrix. The authors propose a refined analysis of robust PCA, which captures how robust each entry of the low-rank matrix is to error corruption. The main claim of the paper is that the local incoherence parameter, defined by localized μ0 and μ1 for each entry of the low-rank matrix, determines the condition that each local Bernoulli error corruption parameter should satisfy.
The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the support for the claims, including theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The authors introduce a new weighted norm, denoted by lw(1), which involves the information of both localized μ0 and μ1, and establish concentration properties and bounds associated with this norm. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the robustness of PCP to error corruption not only depends on the number of errors but also depends on how errors are distributed over the matrix.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the results. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a detailed proof of the main theorem. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work, which provides a good context for the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A refined analysis of robust PCA, which captures the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix
* A new weighted norm, denoted by lw(1), which involves the information of both localized μ0 and μ1
* A thorough evaluation of the support for the claims, including theoretical analysis and numerical experiments
* A clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the results
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the error corruption probability is non-uniform over the matrix, which may not be the case in practice
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other robust PCA methods, which would be useful to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach
* The paper does not discuss the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which is an important consideration in practice
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of robust PCA, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the robustness of PCP to error corruption. However, further research is needed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in practice and to compare it with other robust PCA methods.
