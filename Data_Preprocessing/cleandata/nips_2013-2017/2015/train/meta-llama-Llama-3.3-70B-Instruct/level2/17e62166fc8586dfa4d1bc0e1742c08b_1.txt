This paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream, extending the traditional single-image single-sentence generation task to a more complex and realistic scenario. The authors introduce a multimodal architecture called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Network (CRCN), which integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. The CRCN model is trained on a large dataset of blog posts with images, and its performance is evaluated using both quantitative measures and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The paper's main claims are: (1) the proposed CRCN model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating sentence sequences for image streams, and (2) the integration of the coherence model with the BRNN significantly improves the performance. The authors support these claims with extensive experiments, including quantitative results and user studies, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the architecture of the CRCN model and the training procedure. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the differences between their approach and previous work.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective approach for generating sentence sequences for image streams
* The integration of a coherence model with a BRNN, which significantly improves the performance
* The use of a large dataset of blog posts with images for training and evaluation
* The comprehensive evaluation of the approach using both quantitative measures and user studies
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the CRCN model, which may make it difficult to train and optimize
* The reliance on a large dataset of blog posts with images, which may not be readily available for other applications
* The potential limitations of the coherence model, which may not capture all aspects of sentence coherence
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and natural language processing, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including image captioning, visual storytelling, and human-computer interaction.
