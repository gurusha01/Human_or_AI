This paper presents a novel approach to the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem in the streaming computation model. The authors propose a greedy algorithm that assigns items to components based on the number of topics they have in common with each component. The algorithm is shown to have a recovery guarantee, meaning that it can recover hidden co-clusters of items in probabilistic inputs subject to certain conditions.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the problem definition, the proposed algorithm, and the theoretical analysis. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the differences between their approach and existing methods.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The proposed algorithm is simple and efficient, making it suitable for streaming computation with limited memory.
* The recovery guarantee provides a theoretical foundation for the algorithm's performance.
* The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm on real-world datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations:
* The recovery condition requires a specific set of parameters (e.g., the number of clusters, the probability of topic assignment), which may not be met in all scenarios.
* The algorithm's performance may degrade if the input data does not conform to the assumed probabilistic model.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other streaming algorithms for hypergraph partitioning.
To improve the paper, the authors could:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the recovery condition and its implications for the algorithm's performance.
* Investigate the robustness of the algorithm to variations in the input data and parameters.
* Compare the proposed algorithm with other streaming algorithms for hypergraph partitioning, including those that do not rely on probabilistic models.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of streaming computation and hypergraph partitioning. The proposed algorithm and recovery guarantee provide a valuable foundation for future research and applications.
