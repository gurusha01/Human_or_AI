This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation, extending existing results from sub-Gaussian to sub-exponential design matrices and noise. The authors provide a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems. The main claims of the paper are: (1) the sample complexity and estimation error bounds for sub-exponential designs are log p worse compared to the sub-Gaussian case, and (2) a stronger result exists for the Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition for the Lasso and group-lasso problems, with the same order of sample complexity as the sub-Gaussian case.
The support for these claims is thorough, with a detailed analysis of the relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths of sets, which is a crucial ingredient in the proof. The authors leverage existing results on Gaussian widths and provide new insights into the exponential width, establishing a sharp upper bound for it in terms of the Gaussian width. The paper also presents a comprehensive analysis of the RE condition, providing two different approaches to obtain sample complexity bounds, one based on the exponential width and the other based on the VC-dimension of linear predictors.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as they provide a foundation for analyzing high-dimensional statistical problems with sub-exponential designs, which are common in many application domains. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear, making it easy to follow the arguments. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature, citing key papers and providing a thorough discussion of the contributions.
