This paper presents an efficient algorithm for sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and signal processing. The authors propose a novel approach that modifies Leurgans' algorithm for tensor factorization and relies on the notion of tensor contraction to reduce the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed algorithm can exactly recover the sparse and low-rank components of a tensor under certain incoherence conditions, and (2) the algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
The support for these claims is strong. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a discussion of the incoherence conditions required for exact recovery. They also present numerical experiments that demonstrate the algorithm's ability to recover the sparse and low-rank components of a tensor in a variety of settings.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high. The algorithm has potential applications in a range of fields, including machine learning, signal processing, and data analysis. The authors also discuss several extensions to the algorithm, including its application to higher-order tensors, block sparsity, and tensor completion.
The paper reflects a good understanding of the field and the relevant literature. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, and they demonstrate a strong understanding of the technical concepts involved.
The novelty of the work is significant. The authors propose a new approach to sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition that is distinct from existing methods. The algorithm's use of tensor contraction to reduce the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition is a key innovation.
The completeness of the paper is good. The authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its analysis, and they demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments. The paper could be improved by providing more discussion of the algorithm's limitations and potential extensions.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors. They discuss the need for incoherence conditions to hold for exact recovery and the potential for the algorithm to fail in certain settings.
Overall, the paper is well-written and clearly presented. The authors provide a strong argument for the effectiveness of their algorithm, and they demonstrate its potential for application in a range of fields.
