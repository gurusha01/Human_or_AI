This paper proposes a novel high-dimensional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for inferring high-dimensional latent variable models. The algorithm incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation and provides a framework for testing hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals for low-dimensional components of high-dimensional parameters. The paper makes two main contributions: (1) a novel high-dimensional EM algorithm that converges at a geometric rate and achieves an estimator with a near-optimal statistical rate of convergence, and (2) a decorrelated score test for testing hypotheses related to low-dimensional components of high-dimensional parameters.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work and compares the proposed approach with existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and addresses the challenge of high-dimensional latent variable models.
* The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including convergence rates and statistical guarantees.
* The paper applies the proposed framework to a broad family of high-dimensional latent variable models, including Gaussian mixture models and mixture of regression models.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the sparsity parameter is known, which may not be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional latent variable models. The proposed algorithm and theoretical guarantees are novel and address an important challenge in the field. The paper is suitable for publication in a top-tier conference or journal.
