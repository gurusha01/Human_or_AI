This manuscript proposes a recurrent convolutional neural network approach for semantic image segmentation, leveraging contextual relationships. The methodology essentially combines elements from [13], which utilizes a similar RCNN for object recognition, and [4], inspiring the multi-scale pipeline. While the paper's technical novelty may be limited (with Section 3.1 bearing resemblance to prior works, potentially warranting clearer acknowledgement; the combination itself can be viewed as a novel aspect), the execution is commendable, with clear and concise writing, and a thorough evaluation against state-of-the-art methods. Incorporating recent studies or additional evaluations, as suggested below, could further enhance the manuscript. The technique demonstrates superior performance on the Sift Flow and Stanford Background datasets, outperforming existing methods with a restricted number of training samples. Parameter ablation studies are also conducted to a certain extent, and the method exhibits efficiency.
Detailed comments:
- The related work section could benefit from a sharper focus, as the distinctions between the proposed method and closely related works are not always transparent.
- Evaluations on the PASCAL VOC dataset could be included, as it is a common benchmark for recent segmentation studies.
- Line 276 lacks clarity and should be revised for better understanding.
- Table 1 only considers \gamma \in {0,1}; including experiments or plots with varying gamma values would provide more comprehensive insights.
- The layout on page 7 could be improved by reducing the interleaving of text, plots, and tables.
- The model mentioned in line 387 should be added to the table, possibly with a footnote indicating different training data or a line break.
- Further qualitative analysis, if feasible, would be a welcome addition.
- The following recent work appears to be missing, with the first one achieving even stronger results on the Stanford Background dataset:
  - Feedforward semantic segmentation with zoom-out features by Mohammadreza Mostajabi, Payman Yadollahpour, and Gregory Shakhnarovich from the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago
  - Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks by Shuai Zheng, Sadeep Jayasumana, Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Vibhav Vineet, Zhizhong Su, Dalong Du, Chang Huang, and Philip Torr.
The manuscript presents a well-executed and principled combination of existing techniques, with convincing results that could be further strengthened by additional studies, as outlined above.
