This manuscript addresses the problem of Isotonic Regression using l_p norms as the error metric and presents efficient algorithms with provable guarantees for this context. By leveraging concepts from the literature on nearly linear-time Solvers for Symmetric Diagonally Dominant (SDD) systems, the authors devise fast algorithms for this setting.
Quality: The paper is of high caliber, exhibiting overall readability, clear exposition of ideas, and noteworthy results.
Clarity: 
The manuscript maintains good clarity, with well-defined objects and a clearly articulated contribution. However, it would be beneficial if the authors provided insight into the underlying reasons for achieving improved complexity in the isotonic regression context. Specifically, an explanation of the key concepts that facilitated this advancement would enhance understanding. The paper is engaging, and the connection between isotonic regression and graph problems is well-founded. The utilization of fast SDD solvers to derive implementable algorithms with theoretical bounds is a compelling approach. Furthermore, the authors' proof formulation incorporates innovative ideas, making the paper a compelling read.
