This paper tackles the challenge of generating 3D object proposals from a stereo image pair captured by an autonomous driving vehicle. The authors propose a novel set of features for a 3D cuboid, leveraging point cloud data and ground plane information derived from the stereo images. These features, which include point cloud density, free space, object height prior, and relative object height, are used to inform the "objectness" of the 3D cuboid proposal, albeit with a dependence on object class knowledge. A structural SVM is employed to predict the "objectness" of the proposal, followed by bounding box and orientation regression for final object detection.
The approach is evaluated on the KITTI benchmark, where it demonstrates superior performance to competing baselines in terms of oracle recall and object detection accuracy.
The strengths of this paper include its focus on 3D data, a relatively underexplored area, and its ability to outperform existing baselines, including those that incorporate 3D information. The paper is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the approach, while also acknowledging relevant prior work. The importance of generating high-quality object proposals for object detection is well-established, and this paper makes a valuable contribution to this endeavor.
However, some readers may perceive the core ideas presented in this paper as incremental from a machine learning perspective. The significance of the performance boost may be more readily appreciated by the 3D vision community.
Several aspects of the paper warrant further clarification or exploration. For instance, the use of a structured SVM in Section 3.4 could be justified, and a comparison with a linear SVM using hard negative mining would provide a useful point of reference. Additionally, the paper's reliance on object class information sets it apart from other object proposal methods, which are often class-agnostic. An evaluation of the approach without using object class information, such as by removing object height from the feature vector, would be informative.
Other specific comments include the need for clarification on the input data, specifically that it is a calibrated stereo image pair, and the dependence on ground plane estimation. The parameterization of t in the paragraph starting at Line 142 should be explicitly stated, and the assumption that boxes are grounded and/or parallel to the ground plane should be acknowledged. The notation in Equations (1) and (4) could be improved for clarity, and the potential assumption of well-segmented objects in 3D (i.e., no overlap or intersection) should be validated. Furthermore, the ground plane estimation method should be described in sufficient detail to enable reproducibility, and the setting of C in Section 3.4 should be specified.
Ultimately, my assessment is based on the paper's demonstrated improvement in oracle recall for "car" and "cyclist" object classes on the KITTI benchmark.
