The manuscript is well-justified and clearly presented, with the efficacy of the proposed approach demonstrated through experiments on two datasets, where performance is assessed using the average relative AUC error. A comparative analysis with the baseline U2-gossip method reveals significant improvements across diverse graph scenarios. Furthermore, the paper provides convergence guarantees for the proposed method. However, to comprehensively evaluate the practicality of the approach, it would be beneficial to include the runtime per iteration for both the proposed method and U2-gossip, as substantially slower iteration times for the proposed method could limit its usefulness. The work contributes to the development of synchronized and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for U-statistics computation.
