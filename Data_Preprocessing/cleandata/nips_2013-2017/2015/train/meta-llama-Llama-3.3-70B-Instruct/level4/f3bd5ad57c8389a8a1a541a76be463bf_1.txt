This paper presents an intriguing concept, but to resonate with NIPS readers, it necessitates two significant revisions. 
Firstly, the experimental nature of the paper should be explicitly acknowledged, accompanied by an in-depth analysis. The experiments ought to clearly delineate the strengths, such as handling large datasets, and weaknesses, including thorough comparisons and failure cases.
Secondly, editorial refinement is essential. Crucial sections require more detailed explanations, and the experimental study should meticulously motivate the setup and discuss results with technical precision, aligning with the expectations of a NIPS reader.
Several specific points warrant attention:
- The use of approximate KL as a metric in Bayesian Probit Regression is unclear; comparing means and variances of parameter estimates to Stan/NUTS might be more straightforward.
- Figure 3(c) compares SEP with K=1 to DSEP with K=10, which seems inconsistent.
- The switch to the F-norm metric in the Mixture of Gaussians section is unexplained, and simulating data where EP fails could provide valuable insights into SEP's behavior.
Upon reaching Section 5.3, the presentation of the first two experimental sections is somewhat disappointing, failing to illuminate the nature of SEP, particularly its failure modes. The investigation into minibatch sizes is limited, and the focus on small datasets contradicts the paper's main motivation of scaling EP.
Section 5.3 needs a significant overhaul, with the experimental setup requiring more than a cursory citation. The discussion lacks technical detail, relying on vague terms, and the results could be more comprehensively analyzed.
Figure 3(b) mentions DAEP without explanation, and Figure 2's contribution to the paper is questionable, potentially being replaced by an expanded explanation of Sections 3 and 4.1 to enhance clarity.
The idea presented is original, addressing EP's memory constraints in a novel way. However, the proposal's simplicity may prompt NIPS readers to seek a deeper understanding of its efficacy.
Minor specifics include grammatical corrections and clarifications, such as the inconsistent capitalization of "mixture" and the absence of citation [25], which raises concerns about the paper's references.
In its current form, the paper's empirical narrative is somewhat unsatisfying, but with revisions to refresh the empirical section, clarify the narrative, and address the mentioned concerns, it has potential for acceptance in a future submission.
