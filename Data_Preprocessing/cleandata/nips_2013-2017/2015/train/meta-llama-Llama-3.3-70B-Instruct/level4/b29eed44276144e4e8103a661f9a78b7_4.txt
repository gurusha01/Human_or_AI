This paper presents two primary contributions: (1) the introduction of a new concept, hierarchy width, which can be utilized to establish bounds on the mixing time of Gibbs sampling in factor graphs, provided that the factor graph parameters are bounded, and (2) the development of a novel relational modeling language designed to generate factor graphs that facilitate rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling.
Additionally, the paper offers a minor contribution through its empirical evaluation, demonstrating the practical applicability of the theoretical findings to real-world scenarios.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and engaging to read. One potential area for further exploration is the examination of "Blocked Gibbs sampling" and "Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling" to determine their impact on reducing hierarchy width. Conversely, it would be interesting to investigate whether hierarchy width can serve as a strategy for constructing blocks and Rao-Blackwellising the Gibbs sampler, as discussed in relevant literature, including works by Venugopal and Gogate (UAI 2013), Hamze and de Freitas (UAI 2004), and Bidyuk and Dechter (Journal of AI Research, 2007). The paper's introduction of hierarchy width for factor graphs, along with its bounded parameters requirement, enables the derivation of novel bounds on Gibbs sampling's mixing time, making it a well-written and significant contribution with strong experimental support.
