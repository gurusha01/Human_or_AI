This paper presents a remarkably thorough examination of sample complexity in metric learning, offering several significant advantages over existing research in this field, as the authors have noted. 
Notably, the authors have provided a comprehensive analysis of key cases, including both "distance-based" and "classifier-based" frameworks, which effectively illustrate the dependence on dimensionality and the impact of noisy or uninformative dimensions.
The clarity and accuracy of the paper are evident, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Given the scarcity of research in this area within the metric learning community, publication of this work is warranted.
Although the experimental results are somewhat limited, this is not a major concern, as the paper's primary focus is theoretical.
A few observations are worth mentioning: the use of the ||M^T M||_F^2 regularizer has been explored in prior work, such as "Metric Learning: A Survey" (section 2.4.1), and a discussion of these efforts would be beneficial.
Additionally, it is worth noting that ITML and LMNN can be viewed as already incorporating regularization on the M matrix, with ITML typically applying LogDet regularization on M^T M and LMNN applying weighted trace norm regularization on M^T M. 
The choice of these methods for adding the proposed regularization may not be optimal.
Furthermore, the initialization of ITML with a rank-one metric, combined with the LogDet regularizer's preservation of rank, may lead to a low-rank solution, which could be undesirable, assuming the experimental setup is correctly understood.
However, these points are relatively minor and do not detract from the paper's overall quality, which provides a clear and effective examination of sample complexity for metric learning. 
This paper presents important results regarding the sample complexity for Mahalanobis metric learning and is a worthwhile addition to the metric learning literature, deserving of publication.
