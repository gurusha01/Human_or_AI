This review provides a brief assessment of the paper, highlighting several areas that require clarification or improvement.
* The statement "total multiplicities are bounded by N" in Section 3's second paragraph is ambiguous, as it is unclear whether it refers to the maximum multiplicity of any point or the sum of multiplicities of off-diagonal points. A clearer explanation would be beneficial.
* The paper appears to downplay the significance of bounded persistence and multiplicities, which is a notable limitation. This is particularly relevant when considering the application of the presented theorem to relate persistence diagrams of smooth functions to those obtained from finite approximations. A discussion of these potential issues would be helpful to alert non-expert readers.
* Figure 2's 3D representation of the function on the plane is confusing and could be improved by using 2-dimensional colormaps, as the functions' symmetry is not immediately apparent.
* The explanation of 0-dimensional features recovering two holes in Section 4.1 is unclear, and it is uncertain how this is achievable without using extended persistence. The terminology and methodology employed in this section require further clarification to avoid confusion.
* Despite these areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to establishing statistical foundations for persistent homology, applying kernel methods to map persistence diagrams to scalar functions over a plane, and demonstrating the universality and practical utility of the resulting kernel. The results are substantial and important, warranting recommendation for publication.
