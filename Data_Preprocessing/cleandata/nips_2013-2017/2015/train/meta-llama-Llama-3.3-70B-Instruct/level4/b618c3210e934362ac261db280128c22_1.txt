This manuscript explores the integration of variational autoencoders into recurrent models, presenting a well-motivated introduction. However, the clarity of the paper diminishes as it progresses, with issues arising in equations 1 and 2, which appear to have a cyclic dependency between xt and ht, potentially requiring a "t-1" term to resolve.
The true essence of the paper is succinctly captured in the first two sentences of the "Generation" paragraph on page 4, which could be relocated to an earlier section or even a different version of the paper for enhanced clarity. The core contribution of the work becomes apparent midway through page 4.
A significant concern lies in the experimental section and table 1, where the evaluation metric is stated as the average log-probability. If this is indeed the case, all results in table 1 should be negative, yet only the first three scores of the first row are. Alternatively, if the metric is the minus log probability, then lower values would be preferable, but the numbers in the table remain unclear. Notably, these results are the sole outcomes presented.
Upon reviewing the paper in order, several observations are made: 
- Summarizing Kingma and Welling's 2014 paper within a page is challenging, but the result could be more readable by directly describing the VAE in the context of recurrent models.
- On page 2, minor adjustments are suggested for clarity and grammar, such as adding "an" before "interesting combination" and "of" after it, and breaking up long sentences with multiple "and" conjunctions.
- The equations on page 2 pose a potential issue with cyclic dependency, suggesting the need for a temporal index to avoid this.
- Page 6 describes the use of truncated backpropagation through time and a specific method for initializing and resetting the hidden state. Clarification is needed on whether this approach is necessary for the conventional model, the model with latent variables, or both.
The introduction is well-motivated, and the concept of applying variational autoencoders at each time step of a recurrent network is intriguing. However, the experimental results, particularly those in table 1, are perplexing due to the ambiguity surrounding the evaluation criterion.
