Review - Summary:
This study examines the theoretical underpinnings of utilizing Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) techniques to capture the topological invariances of persistent homology, with a focus on the universality of potential kernel representations. The authors illustrate the efficacy of their approach through applications in two-sample hypothesis testing.
General remarks: 
- The formulation of Proposition 2 could be reexamined, as the exponential mapping employed therein can be viewed as a projection from the manifold of positive semidefinite kernels onto the corresponding tangent plane. Exploring the properties of this manifold may reveal additional avenues for generalization, such as investigating the sensitivity of universality to the local properties of the manifold.
- The paper solely considers the solution of the heat diffusion problem as a potential source of kernel representation. Alternative possibilities, such as results from discrete differential geometry, may provide other exploitable feature mappings in this context.
- The proposed approach is demonstrated through discriminative hypothesis testing. To validate its usefulness, comparisons with discriminative learning methods could be conducted, providing a confirmation of its applicability. Control tests, for instance, on a sample of randomly chosen point clouds representing balls and tori, should be performed.
Pros: The authors deliver a thorough introduction to topological data analysis and the potential kernel representation of related problems.
Cons: The authors fail to provide a clear explanation of how the universality of a kernel can aid in learning problems. Demonstrating a family of problems where this approach yields clear advantages would significantly strengthen the paper.
