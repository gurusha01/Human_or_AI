It is worth noting that the quantities p_ij(t) are actually subprobabilities, as their integral over the interval [0, ∞) is less than 1.
The terminology "hazard matrix" has been used by Daneshmand et al. [ICML '14] to denote a distinct concept related to observed cascades, and it would be beneficial to acknowledge this difference and provide clarification.
In Section 4.1, the authors should explicitly specify that αij belongs to the interval [0, 1) to ensure that pij(t) constitutes a (sub)probability.
The introductory paragraph could be significantly improved in terms of writing quality.
The reference [3] is cited as an early work on influence maximization; however, it actually addresses a different problem.
The proof of Lemma 3 would benefit from a more explicit description, particularly in relation to the functions f(x), g(x), and μ(x) within the problem setting. This would facilitate a clearer understanding of the concept of "right positive correlation," which is not formally defined.
In the proof of Lemma 4, Equation (11) lacks clarity regarding the variables a and x in the inequality ln(1 - ax) ≥ ln(1 - a)x, which should be explicitly defined for better comprehension.
In Equation (12), it appears that fi(s) on the right-hand side should be replaced with fj(s).
Recent studies have focused on establishing the theoretical foundations of influence models, including sample complexity results for the recovery of such models, as seen in the works of Daneshmand et al. (ICML 2014) and Pouget-Abadie et al. (ICML 2015). Although these studies differ from the present work, acknowledging them would provide context on the ongoing interest in theoretical analyses of influence models.
The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of contagion diffusion in networks, developing a novel non-asymptotic upper bound on the influence of any source set and a lower bound on the critical time for a contagion to become supercritical. Their analysis utilizes the Laplace Hazard matrix, a concept based on previous work that depends on network structure and edge probability distributions. The authors apply their bounds to several well-known diffusion models and validate their results with experimental evaluations on synthetic data, although the experiments could provide more insightful findings.
The problem addressed is scientifically interesting and timely, with no prior work on influence bounds for continuous-time diffusion networks to the best of my knowledge. The paper is mathematically sound, but the experimental results could be more illustrative.
