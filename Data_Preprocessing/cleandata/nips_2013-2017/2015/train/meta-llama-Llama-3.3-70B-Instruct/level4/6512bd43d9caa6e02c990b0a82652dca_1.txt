Summary of Paper ======================================== 
This paper explores the relationship between algorithmic stability and generalization performance in learning algorithms, building upon existing notions of stability [6,11,13,14] that have been linked to generalization performance and learnability [14]. 
Previous work, such as [12], has demonstrated that for bounded loss functions, the generalization of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is equivalent to the probabilistic leave-one-out stability of the learning algorithm. Furthermore, [14] established that a problem is learnable in Vapnik's general setting of learning if and only if there exists an asymptotically stable ERM procedure.
The current paper introduces a probabilistic notion of stability and shows that it is both necessary and sufficient for the training losses to converge to test losses uniformly for all distributions in Vapnik's general setting of learning. Additionally, it provides discussions on interpreting this stability notion in terms of function class capacity or population size.
Questions ======================================== 
- The utility of the paper's main result is unclear, particularly in scenarios where uniform convergence does not hold. 
- Can the authors provide an example of a learning problem where uniform generalization is impossible, yet the training errors of a stable algorithm converge to the test errors?
- Is it not possible to achieve a similar result using the findings of [14], which establish that learnability is equivalent to the existence of a stable Asymptotic Empirical Risk Minimizer (AERM)? By leveraging the population and empirical risk functionals and applying the Hoeffding inequality, one can derive a bound on the difference between the population risk of an AERM and its empirical risk, effectively recovering the result the paper aims to demonstrate.
- Why should the difference between training and test errors be of interest when the primary focus is on learnability and test error, given that [14] already links learnability to the existence of uniformly RO-stable asymptotically empirical risk minimizers?
- A detailed discussion comparing the paper's contributions to previous results is necessary.
- The paper fails to connect its notion of stability to existing notions of algorithmic stability, such as uniform RO-stability [14], which have been used to establish similar results.
- Section 5.1 lacks formal statements and specific results, missing an opportunity to theoretically analyze the dropout method.
- Sections 5.2 and 5.3 introduce concepts like Effective Sample Size (ESS) and a new way to calculate the VC dimension without properly instantiating them or demonstrating their utility and connection to other capacity notions.
Quality ======================================== 
The paper's potential contributions are obscured by a lack of clear discussion and context within existing literature. The motivation for bounding the difference between training and test errors, especially when uniform convergence is not achievable, is not well-established.
Clarity ======================================== 
The paper is well-written.
Originality ======================================== 
While the paper utilizes established techniques from information complexity, such as the data processing inequality, its introduction of stability via the total variation distance between distributions appears novel and interesting.
Significance ======================================== 
In its current form, the paper may not significantly excite the learning theory community, given that algorithmic stability is already known to be equivalent to learnability. The results in Section 5 are not well-instantiated, making it unclear if they offer novel insights. The main contribution lies in establishing a connection between algorithmic stability and generalization performance, but the paper does not effectively link itself to existing research in the area.
