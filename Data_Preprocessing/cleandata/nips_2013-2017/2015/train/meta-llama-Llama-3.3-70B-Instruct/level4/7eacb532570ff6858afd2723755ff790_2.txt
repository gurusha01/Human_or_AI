In the context of dueling bandits under the PL model assumption, the authors tackle two key objectives: identifying an approximate best arm and determining an approximate ranking of the arms. These tasks are intimately connected to estimating the pairwise marginals of the underlying PL model, which the authors achieve through an early-stopped adaptation of the QuickSort algorithm, termed Budgeted QuickSort. This approach enables the development of algorithms with a sample complexity of O(M log^2 M). The authors conduct experiments to compare the sample complexity of their proposed algorithms against existing state-of-the-art methods.
However, the problem statement lacks clear motivation, a concern exacerbated by the absence of experiments utilizing real-world datasets. Nonetheless, the proposed algorithms are commendable for their simplicity, and the accompanying theoretical analysis appears sound. Although the proofs in the appendix were not thoroughly examined, the results presented seem plausible. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the selection of the method for constructing confidence intervals in PLPAC, such as an assessment of the algorithm's sensitivity to this choice.
The paper's organization is logical and generally easy to follow. It is somewhat unusual, however, to find an algorithm (AMPR-PLPAC) relegated to supplementary material. Despite the significant gain in sample complexity over existing algorithms, the problem's motivation remains unclear, giving the impression of a niche issue. This perception is reinforced by the exclusive use of synthetic data in the experiments. The algorithm itself is intriguing, and the theoretical support is comprehensive, yet the lack of real-world applicability and motivation detracts from the overall impact.
