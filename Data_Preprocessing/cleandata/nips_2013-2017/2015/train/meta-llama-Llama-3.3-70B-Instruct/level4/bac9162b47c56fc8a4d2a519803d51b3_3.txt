This manuscript presents an application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including both simple and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variants, to predict student performance based on prior achievements. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement over the baseline method, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). Additionally, the paper includes a preliminary investigation into curriculum enhancement and an examination of the interrelations between exercises.
The methodology employed is straightforward to comprehend, owing to the clarity of the writing and the relative simplicity of the techniques utilized. While some may view the lack of complexity as a drawback, it can also be seen as a strength. The paper offers a novel application of established methods to a pre-existing problem, yielding a significant enhancement that is likely to have a considerable impact on the field of computer-assisted education. Although the contribution may be perceived as less influential from a machine learning perspective, the paper is well-structured, clearly written, and presents notable results in the context of computer-assisted education, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
