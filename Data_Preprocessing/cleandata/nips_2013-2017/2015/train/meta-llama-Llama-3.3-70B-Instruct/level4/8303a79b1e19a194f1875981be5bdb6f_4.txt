UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL: I appreciate the authors' efforts in addressing my concerns. The additional numerical results provided in the supplement enhance the paper's overall quality. Despite this, I have decided to maintain my initial score of 7.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: This paper presents a novel application of a modified leapfrog integrator to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, facilitating sampling from piecewise continuous probability distributions with affine discontinuity boundaries. By leveraging reflection and refraction of the simulated trajectory at boundary intersections, the approach builds upon existing concepts used in constrained multivariate Gaussian distributions. Although its applicability may be limited to specific problem domains, the method's intuitive simplicity and potential usefulness are notable. However, the numerical evaluation could be more comprehensive, suggesting the need for further extension in a future submission. Additionally, several typographical errors require correction.
A key consideration is the potential for extending this approach to accommodate non-affine discontinuity boundaries. Beyond the computational challenges of intersection calculations, it is essential to explore the feasibility of generalizing the method to more complex boundaries.
Detailed comments and questions include:
- Section 3 could benefit from an explanation of the refracted momentum's form, potentially by mentioning the relationship K(p') = K(p) - Î”U.
- In Equation (3), it appears that the upper triangle, excluding the top-left corner elements, should also be zero.
- Line 363 contains a definition of WMAE that lacks normalization by k.
- Footnote 2 on page 7 could be expanded to discuss the sensitivity of tuning parameters (L and eps) and possibly include supplementary numerical results to bolster the argument.
The core concept of the paper, a modified leapfrog integrator for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in piecewise continuous distributions with affine boundaries, is straightforward yet potentially valuable for specific problem classes. Nevertheless, a more extensive numerical assessment is warranted.
