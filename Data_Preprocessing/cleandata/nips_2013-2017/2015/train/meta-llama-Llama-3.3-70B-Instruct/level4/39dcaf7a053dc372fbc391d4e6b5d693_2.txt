The authors propose a novel approach to enhance neural boundary prediction by combining a ConvNet with 2D filters and another with 3D filters. This architectural design is motivated by the anisotropic nature of sequential EM scans commonly used in Neuroscience, where the x-y plane differs from the z-axis. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the previous method, which relied solely on 2D filters, making this approach crucial for the intended application.
However, the presentation could be refined for better clarity and flow. The methodology builds upon established techniques, including the composition of neural networks and the application of 3D filters to 3D datasets.
Despite its potential, the paper has several shortcomings. Frequent references are made to an implementation known as ZNN, purportedly crucial for efficiency in terms of network size and data volume, yet no reference or sufficient details are provided to facilitate reproduction. It is recommended that concise details about the essential implementation aspects and plans for software release be included. Without this, the paper lacks precision in its description of ZNN's development, relying on general design choices that are not adequately explained. Figure captions also require more descriptive information to ensure understanding.
Specifically, line 80 lacks a reference for ZNN, leaving the reader unclear about its nature. Line 177's description of the Rand index is insufficient; including the necessary formula would enhance clarity. Section 3 fails to provide a detailed understanding of ZNN, necessary for reproducing the results. More precise details or a reference to where such information can be found would be beneficial. The color code for Figure 3 is not provided. There is an inconsistency in terminology, such as the use of "net1" and "net2" in Figure 1, which is not maintained throughout the paper. The term "recursive" might be misleading, as it implies the repeated application of the same network, whereas the composition of different networks (vd2d and vd2d3d) with shared initial layers is described.
The paper's relevance to the field is acknowledged, though it leans more towards applied research. Overall, improvements in presentation and the provision of more detailed information are necessary to enhance the paper's quality and reproducibility.
