This manuscript proposes and validates a reasonable adaptation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for probability density functions (pdfs) characterized by discontinuities or defined on a bounded domain, assessing both its correctness and performance via simulation.
The approach leverages the simulation of refraction and reflection phenomena arising from Hamiltonian dynamics, thereby yielding improved proposal distributions in the vicinity of discontinuities and resulting in enhanced acceptance rates and a higher effective sample size (ESS).
An additional illustrative example demonstrating a scenario where computing intersections is not necessary or beneficial would be a valuable inclusion.
It would also be beneficial to discuss the types of high-dimensional pdfs for which this method may be less suitable or ineffective, providing a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability and limitations.
