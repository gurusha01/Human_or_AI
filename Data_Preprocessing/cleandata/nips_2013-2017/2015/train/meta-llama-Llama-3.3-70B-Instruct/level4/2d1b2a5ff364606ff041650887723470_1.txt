Response to Authors' Rebuttal:
My assessment of the manuscript remains largely unchanged after considering the feedback from fellow reviewers and the authors' rebuttal. Although I may not be fully conversant with the existing body of work on single index models and sufficient dimension reduction, which could imply overlooking relevant prior research. The authors successfully establish asymptotic guarantees for the generalized square-root lasso when applied to Gaussian measurements, which may undergo transformation by an unknown nonlinear function. These findings are noteworthy as they offer a detailed insight into the method's performance. The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, despite containing a notable number of typographical errors, particularly within the proof sections.
