This manuscript presents a novel approach to Bayesian modeling of data streams by introducing the population posterior distribution and demonstrating how stochastic optimization can be employed to obtain a suitable approximation. The proposed framework and algorithm are applied to latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixture models using text and geolocation data, yielding improved performance over existing methods in certain cases.
Overall, the core concept of the paper is intriguing and aligns well with the scope of NIPS. However, there are several aspects that require further discussion to enhance clarity and completeness.
Firstly, the authors consistently use the term "Bayesian modeling" throughout the paper, but the title incorrectly refers to "Bayesian inference," which is not the focus of this work. The title should be revised to reflect the accurate terminology.
Additionally, the notation in Equations 3 and 4 for local variables is confusing, as it implies optimization towards the expectation of a population average, whereas these variables are specific to individual data points. A clearer notation system would be beneficial to avoid potential misunderstandings.
The step-size for gradient ascent is not explicitly introduced in the algorithm, which could lead to confusion. Furthermore, the paragraph around line 153 contains contradictory statements regarding the optimization of the F-ELBO and its relationship to minimizing the KL divergence, which requires clarification.
The experiments section provides a brief discussion on the Î± parameter, but its significance in controlling the level of uncertainty in the approximate posteriors warrants earlier introduction, particularly since it is essentially a function of dataset size.
The convergence properties of the algorithm and the implications of this convergence are not adequately addressed. The authors' argument that model mismatch is a limitation of existing methods relies on the assumption that researchers believe their models converge to the data-generating distribution as more data becomes available, which may not be a universal perspective.
The experiments are well-executed and convincing, but some discussion on why SVB performs worse would be beneficial. It is also essential to provide the actual step-size schedules used and to investigate the sensitivity of the results to these schedules. Including error bars and specifying the number of replicates for permuting the data order would enhance the robustness of the results.
Minor comments include the presence of numerous typos that need correction and the absence of future work discussions in the "Discussion and Future Work" section, which should be included to provide a comprehensive overview of potential avenues for further research.
In conclusion, this paper proposes an innovative method for Bayesian modeling of streaming data and would be a valuable addition to the NIPS proceedings. Addressing the concerns regarding clarity and presentation would significantly enhance the manuscript's overall quality and impact.
