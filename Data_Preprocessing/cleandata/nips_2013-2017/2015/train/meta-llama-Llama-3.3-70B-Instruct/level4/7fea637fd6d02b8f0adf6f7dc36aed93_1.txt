The authors present a theoretical examination of accelerated convergence in multi-player normal-form games, extending methods traditionally applied to two-player zero-sum games. This is complemented by an empirical assessment using the 4-bidder simultaneous auction game as a test case.
The manuscript is clear and features noteworthy theoretical and empirical findings. One potential enhancement could be the inclusion of a broader range of parameters, specifically varying the number of players (n) and possibly other relevant factors (m), in the performance evaluation. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of Hedge and Optimistic Hedge algorithms beyond the 4-bidder scenario. Overall, the paper delivers robust theoretical contributions alongside compelling experimental results, particularly in the context of the 4-bidder simultaneous auction game.
