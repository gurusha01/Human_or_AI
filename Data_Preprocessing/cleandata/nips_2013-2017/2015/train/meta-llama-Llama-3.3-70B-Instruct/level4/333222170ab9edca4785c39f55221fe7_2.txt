This paper presents a compelling comparison between classifier accuracy and human performance, with notable results in Table 2, where the LENSE system surpasses the 3-vote baseline but falls short of the 5-vote baseline, highlighting an intriguing trade-off between the efficiency of de-noising crowd responses through additional consensus versus the LENSE system's approach. However, the example provided in the paragraph starting at Line 154 is somewhat abstract and challenging to comprehend, suggesting that a concrete query example with realistic crowd responses and timeframes could enhance readability. Furthermore, the inconsistent terminology in Tables 2 and 3, where the threshold baseline is alternately referred to as entropic and threshold, may cause confusion. The placement of related work in Section 5 is also unclear. Nevertheless, the problem tackled by this paper - creating high-accuracy classifiers from zero labeled examples, with a focus on handling noisy crowd respondents and optimizing timing and latency - is a significant one, and the introduction of timing and latency optimization factors brings a fresh perspective to the topic, despite some opacity in the explanations. As stated in Line 086, Figure ??, the novelty of this approach lies in its ability to address these challenges in a unique and interesting way.
