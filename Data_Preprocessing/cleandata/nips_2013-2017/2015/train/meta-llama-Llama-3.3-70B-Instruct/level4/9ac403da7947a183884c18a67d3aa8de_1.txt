The authors address the challenge that arises when bidirected edges (<->) and undirected edges (-) coexist in a loopless mixed graph by introducing a novel construct called the segregated graph (SG), which ensures that bidirected and undirected edges never intersect, thereby preserving all conditional independencies among the observed variables.
I appreciate the novelty of this concept, but my enthusiasm is tempered by the paper's lack of clarity, which in turn affects its overall quality. Furthermore, the significance of the problem being tackled is not adequately addressed. To elaborate, the following points are noteworthy: 
 Clarity: The authors provide a helpful overview of the broader context before delving into specifics, which enhances understanding to some extent. However, upon closer examination of the details, clarity is compromised due to the presence of typos and undefined or undeclared symbols. Adhering to notations used in recent, well-known publications such as [4], [1], and [2*] would significantly improve readability.
* Quality: The paper's quality suffers due to clarity issues. Additionally, relocating most proofs to a supplementary file could free up considerable space (approximately 2-3 pages), suggesting that more content could be incorporated to enhance the paper.
* Originality: The concept presented is original and commendable.
* Significance: The importance of the addressed problem is only briefly mentioned (in lines 128-129) with a slightly more detailed discussion in the conclusions.

Following the reviewers' feedback and considering the authors' response, I have increased my evaluation score by one step. This paper introduces segregated graphs as a solution to a specific problem in loopless mixed graphs where bidirected and undirected edges intersect.
