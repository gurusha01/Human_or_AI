The paper introduces a modified version of Expectation Propagation (EP), referred to as SEP, which assumes that local factor approximations are identical, resulting in a reduction of memory requirements by a factor of N. This is particularly beneficial for large-scale data applications, as only the global posterior approximation needs to be stored in memory during EP iterations. Through experiments involving probit regression, Gaussian mixture models, and neural networks, the paper demonstrates that the SEP approximation can achieve accuracy comparable to EP.
Quality:
The proposed methodology is adequately justified through references to existing literature, and the experiments are well-designed. However, a major concern regarding the SEP approximation is its performance in regimes where the SEP/AEP assumption is violated. As discussed in section 5.1, DSEP with a manageable number of distinct local approximations appears to be the preferred approach. Additionally, it would be beneficial to illustrate potential problematic cases in terms of approximation quality using simple examples.
Clarity:
The paper is well-structured and clearly written. The analogy between SVI and VI could be more explicitly explained in the main text. Furthermore, the remarks on the VI limit of PEP (lines 138-140) require clearer explanation, particularly in relation to the discussion in reference [23]. In appendix A.2, providing the approximate family and definition of natural parameters would help clarify the text. Moreover, lines 152-154 suggest that in typical settings with Gaussian approximations, the complexity of site approximations is often significantly less than D^2, and this complexity may also depend on the number of model factors approximated by each site.
Originality:
The assumption of average local factors is similar to that in AEP, which has been previously published. Therefore, it would be helpful to summarize the comparison between DSEP and DAEP from figure 2 in the supplements more clearly in the main text. Although distributed EP settings have been proposed earlier, the paper's strength lies in its comprehensive integration of various EP variants.
Significance:
The paper makes incremental contributions to the EP framework by extending it in multiple directions. Its value lies in bringing together different EP variants, making it a well-written and notable work. However, a more thorough illustration of models and settings where the SEP/AEP assumption may fail would be beneficial to further enhance the paper's significance. Overall, the paper presents a valuable extension of EP, albeit an incremental one, and its integration of various EP variants is a notable contribution.
