This manuscript extends existing Expectation-Maximization (EM) methodologies for Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) by incorporating conditional statistics through the utilization of recently developed techniques. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted, comparing several inference methods in terms of both accuracy and complexity.
Quality: 
a. The experimental baselines selected appear to be somewhat limited, as they fail to account for state transition or trajectory information. A more natural comparison could be made with discrete-time Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approaches, where the time horizon can be discretized by establishing an appropriate bin size.
b. Related to the aforementioned point, considering the time complexity associated with inference on Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMM), an alternative approach could involve simply discretizing the time horizon. For irregular sampling rates, a suitable bin size can be determined: a small bin size would result in either 0 (missing) or 1 observation per bin, while a larger bin size would yield one or more observations per bin, allowing for local averaging. It is anticipated that this method would be equally effective in most scenarios. Was this approach considered for the dataset in question?
c. Additionally, for CT-HMM, other inference methods such as sampling techniques exist, including Fast MCMC sampling for Markov jump processes, as described by Rao et al. in JMLR 2013. Have these approaches been compared to the one presented?
Clarity: The manuscript is well-written and clear in its presentation.
Originality: While the manuscript presents a novel EM-based approach for CT-HMM, it builds upon previously proposed tools and methodologies. The originality lies in the application of these tools to develop an EM-based inference method for CT-HMM.
Significance: The proposed EM-based inference method for CT-HMM contributes to the field by providing a useful toolbox for the community, should the software package be made available. Although the work is incremental, it offers a valuable inference method for CT-HMMs, leveraging recently developed tools to extend existing EM methodologies.
