This paper explores the crucial concept of influence maximization, which has significant implications in various fields, including epidemiology, computer networks, and marketing. The authors utilize the CTIC model, a widely accepted framework for capturing temporal behavior in cascade processes. Evaluating the quality of results poses a challenge, and previous research has highlighted the importance of the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix in deriving a tight bound for influence in general graphs. The authors build upon this foundation by introducing a method to determine anytime influence bounds, categorizing contagions as sub-critical or super-critical, and establishing a lower bound for super-critical contagions. They demonstrate the applicability of their approach to several contagion models, with comprehensive proofs provided. The experimental results, although promising on synthetic datasets, would benefit from an assessment of the model's scalability on large, real-world graphs. Overall, the paper is well-structured and effectively communicated, but its limitations lie in its novelty and the lack of evaluation on real-world datasets, which may impact its overall significance.
