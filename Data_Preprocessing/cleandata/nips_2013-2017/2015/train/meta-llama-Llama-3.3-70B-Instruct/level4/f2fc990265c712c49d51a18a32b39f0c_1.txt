This manuscript introduces the HONOR algorithm, a novel approach applicable to a broad range of non-convex sparse learning formulations. 
The HONOR method integrates a Quasi-Newton step with a standard gradient descent step to approximate the objective function without directly evaluating the Hessian for the Quasi-Newton step, leveraging L-BFGS for scalability in large-scale objectives. The authors demonstrate that any limit point of convergence for the algorithm is a Clarke critical point of the objective, with the generated sequence converging to this limit point.
Convergence analysis for non-convex problems is notoriously challenging. 
This paper achieves a rigorous analysis of convergence to a proven limit point, guaranteed to be a Clarke critical point, which is a significant contribution. The mathematical analysis presented is thorough and appears to be correct. It would be interesting to explore whether this methodology can be extended to more generalized non-convex objectives.
The empirical evaluation is well-founded, with experiments examining the decrease in objective value over time across various large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. The results indicate that the algorithm converges faster than comparable methods. Further investigation, such as analyzing the algorithm's performance on a dataset with known local minima (potentially synthetic), would provide additional insights. Guidance on selecting parameters, particularly Î³, to ensure faster convergence would also be beneficial. 
This work focuses on a specific type of regularized non-convex problem common in machine learning, proposing a hybrid algorithm that combines second-order information via Quasi-Newton steps with gradient descent steps based on a computationally efficient condition. The authors provide an extensive convergence analysis, highlighting the complexities introduced by non-convexity, and prove convergence to a Clarke critical point. Notably, their analysis has implications for broader non-convex scenarios.
