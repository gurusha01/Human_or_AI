Review- 81 : To enhance clarity, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of current motion-based methods, particularly for readers lacking familiarity with these techniques. -It is essential to investigate whether this work is the first to utilize convolution for recurrent transition in any problem domain, and if not, relevant prior works should be cited. -The terminology "conditional convolution" may be misleading, as it implies a conditioning mechanism that is not present; instead, it simply involves convolution from the previous time step's input. 180: The detailed explanation of the second hidden layer seems redundant and could be omitted.
3.2 The comparison to TRBM in a dedicated section appears abrupt and without prior context. If TRBM is a crucial related work, it should have been introduced earlier in the paper. The proposed model presents a novel sequence-based approach to video super-resolution, distinguishing itself by replacing fully connected recurrent transitions with convolutional recurrent transitions and incorporating an additional convolutional transition from the previous time step's inputs. This results in improved performance at a lower computational cost. As an application paper in computer vision with noteworthy results, it was engaging to read. However, its potential impact on the NIPS community is uncertain, and it might find a more receptive audience at a computer vision conference.
