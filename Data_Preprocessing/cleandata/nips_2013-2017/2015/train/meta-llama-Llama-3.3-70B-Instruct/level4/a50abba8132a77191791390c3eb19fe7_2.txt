Review - Comments:
- The concept of employing non-uniform sampling and correcting via importance sampling is not novel, as evidenced by prior work such as [1], which reports a speed-up of 3x. Notably, these earlier approaches utilized error-based probability selection instead of Li; a discussion or comparison of this methodology, particularly in practical scenarios where Li may be unknown, would be beneficial.
- In the spirit of Leon Bottou's emphasis on acknowledging limitations, it would be enlightening to explore the constraints and potential inapplicability of the proposed method.
- The release of open-source code accompanying the paper would significantly enhance its impact and is highly recommended.
- The experimental section and accompanying figures are the most lacking aspects of the paper, warranting a thorough revision. Specifically, plots should be augmented with error bars, clearly indicate the number of runs averaged, and feature improved labeling (e.g., distinguishing between SVRG and full batch in top plots). The test-error plot's resolution is insufficient for readability; considering a log-scale representation may be beneficial. These suggestions also apply to the appendix figures. The absence of difference between uniform sampling and Lipschitz sampling in experiment 3 is perplexing. While logistic regression serves as a suitable initial domain, exploring more challenging domains in future work would be valuable.

This paper presents a solid and important contribution to variance-reduced gradient descent, introducing novel ideas, explaining them with clarity, and establishing convergence rates for its proposed variants. However, the experimental section is the paper's primary weakness.
