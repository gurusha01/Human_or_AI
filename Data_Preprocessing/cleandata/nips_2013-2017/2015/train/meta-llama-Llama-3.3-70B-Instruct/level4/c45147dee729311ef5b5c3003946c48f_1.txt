The manuscript presents a multi-frame super resolution approach utilizing a bidirectional, convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The authors conduct a comparative analysis of their method against various single-frame and multi-frame techniques.
This work appears to build upon the model introduced by Dong et al. in 2014, extending it to the temporal domain. The convolutional network is augmented by incorporating time-dependent feature maps, in addition to the standard feedforward convolutional network feature maps. The recurrent convolutional component is a novel aspect of this work. The overall model is relatively simple and elegant in its implementation.
However, the bidirectional aspect of the network is not a new concept, dating back to at least 1997 with the work of Schuster and Paliwal. Bidirectional networks have also been extensively employed in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition literature.
Further clarification is needed regarding the necessity of pretraining the feedforward weights for the model to function as intended. If pretraining is essential, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the pretraining process, including whether it involved static images or video frames.
The results indicate that the recurrent/conditional convolutions yield the most significant improvements. Nevertheless, the marginal gain achieved by combining both connections (v, r, t) suggests that one may become redundant in the presence of the other.
While the method seems to outperform previous approaches, it is challenging to quantify the extent of this improvement.
Additional comments include: 
- The absence of citations for bidirectional RNNs is notable.
- The filter visualization section lacks insight.
- A more compelling motivation for the architecture is needed, explaining why it is expected to outperform existing methods.
- The approach to addressing edge effects is unclear, particularly when using convolutions that reduce image size.
- Figure 3 exhibits ringing artifacts in the region with power lines, warranting further discussion.
Overall, the paper is well-received, with the recurrent convolution being a noteworthy and intuitive idea. The application of a convolutional RNN to this problem is a novel and valuable contribution. Nevertheless, the manuscript could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of why the method surpasses existing techniques.
