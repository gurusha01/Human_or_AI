The paper presents a novel greedy approach for clustering streaming hypergraphs, aiming to minimize the maximum number of topics covered by a partition. The proposed algorithm is straightforward, and the authors provide a proof that it performs well under a balance assumption on the data, asymptotically revealing the underlying partitioning. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons with other simple algorithms on real datasets, where it achieves superior results in terms of normalized maximum load.
However, it is acknowledged that the new technique could not be compared to batch methods on real datasets due to computational time constraints. A potential experiment could involve applying the method to smaller datasets or subsets of the existing datasets, which may yield interesting insights, even if the new method may not be expected to outperform batch techniques. Notably, the comparison would still provide valuable information on the performance gap between the proposed method and batch techniques.

Overall, the paper introduces a new greedy method for streaming hypergraph clustering, which is shown to be effective in practice and performs well under balance assumptions. By extending the traditional batch setting to the streaming model, this work represents a natural progression in the field, and the proposed method appears to be a viable solution.
