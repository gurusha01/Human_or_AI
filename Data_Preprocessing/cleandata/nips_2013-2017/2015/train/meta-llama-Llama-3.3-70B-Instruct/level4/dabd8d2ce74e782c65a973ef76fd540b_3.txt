The authors propose a multinomial logit (MNL) model to characterize user preferences, which operates under two contexts: (a) collaborative ranking, where a low-rank matrix is utilized to capture underlying preferences, and (b) bundled choice modeling, where the low-rank structure reveals how item pairs are matched. The random utility model is employed to establish bounds.
A key contribution of this paper is the development of a polynomial-time inference algorithm, which addresses the intractability of Maximum Likelihood estimation for the general MNL model. Although there is scope for improvement, this work can serve as a stepping stone for more efficient and general approaches.
The authors' acknowledgment of the model's limitations (e.g., above equation 10) can actually facilitate progress in this field. This paper demonstrates that the convex relaxation of nuclear norm minimization is minimax optimal, providing an upper bound on the error with finite samples and a corresponding lower bound, thereby showcasing the model's potential.
