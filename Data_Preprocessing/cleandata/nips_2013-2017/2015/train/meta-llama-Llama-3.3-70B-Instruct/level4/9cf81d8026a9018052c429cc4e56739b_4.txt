This review is relatively brief. Notably similar approaches include those by Shuai Zheng et al., available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03240. It would be beneficial to incorporate reference [15] into the results table, potentially marked with a distinction to indicate variations in training data.
The manuscript applies a recurrent neural network method, originally designed for object detection [13], to the tasks of scene labeling and semantic segmentation. While the proposed approach surpasses baseline performances, it falls short of achieving state-of-the-art results. To enhance clarity, the authors should establish more explicit connections between their work and existing research in semantic segmentation, both conceptually and quantitatively, and in terms of differences in methodology. This could involve comparisons with leading approaches in semantic segmentation tasks and datasets, such as those listed at http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/leaderboard/displaylb.php?challengeid=11&compid=6.
