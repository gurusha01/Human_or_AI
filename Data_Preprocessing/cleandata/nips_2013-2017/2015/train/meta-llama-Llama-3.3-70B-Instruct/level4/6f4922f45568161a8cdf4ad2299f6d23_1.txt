A novel approach utilizing a covariance-controlled Nose thermostat is proposed to facilitate sampling from a target distribution when the likelihood calculation becomes intractable due to an excessively large number of terms in the product-form likelihood.
This study leverages significant foundational work in molecular dynamics, notably by Leimkuhler, and contributes meaningfully to the growing body of literature in this field. 
Although the experimental evaluations could be more comprehensive, the final DBM presented is noteworthy.
Quality: This research demonstrates a robust application of molecular dynamics principles to tackle a pressing issue in machine learning, yielding a valuable contribution.
Clarity: The paper's writing is lucid, devoid of unnecessary complexity, making it an accessible and straightforward read.
Originality: While a similar concept with fixed covariance was introduced at the previous NIPS conference, building upon Skeel's work, this paper enhances and expands on that foundation. This development does not detract from the paper's merit, as it offers a substantial and worthwhile addition.
Significance: The area of research addressed by this paper holds considerable promise, particularly for models characterized by factorable likelihoods, albeit a limited class of statistical models.
