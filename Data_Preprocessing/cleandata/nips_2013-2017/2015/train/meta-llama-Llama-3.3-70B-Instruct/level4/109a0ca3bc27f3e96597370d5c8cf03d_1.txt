This paper presents a recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network designed to generate an object's appearance from various pivoting viewpoints based on a single 2D image. The authors assess their model's performance by generating images of faces and chairs from rotated viewpoints and conduct additional experiments to investigate the benefits of curriculum learning, evaluate disentangled representations through cross-view object recognition, and explore class interpolation with chairs.
While the proposed model is well-detailed and presented, its performance evaluation falls short. The experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed RNN model rely heavily on qualitative assessments, with visualizations that could be improved by scaling figures to a suitable size for better readability. Incorporating quantitative performance measures with appropriate error metrics for comparison with state-of-the-art results would provide more insightful evaluations than qualitative assessments alone.
The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with minor grammatical errors, such as the one found on line 124, where "rotate" should be replaced with "rotated". However, the paper's significance is largely undermined by the limited scope of experimentation and analysis. Expanding the experiments to include more datasets beyond Multi-PIE and Chairs would be beneficial, as would demonstrating the model's capability to render rotated viewpoints for a diverse range of objects, making the network architecture less object-specific. Furthermore, exploring the model's ability to handle non-repeating object rotation trajectories that deviate from a static axis would be an interesting avenue to pursue. Although the paper introduces a novel and intriguing deep learning approach for rendering objects from different rotational viewpoints given a single 2D image, it lacks substantial experimentation and relevant analysis to fully establish the model's significance and potential for achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to geometry-based approaches, as mentioned on line 51.
