Summary: The paper posits that an observable tensor can be decomposed into two distinct components: a low-rank tensor lacking sparsity and a sparse corruption tensor that does not exhibit low-rank properties. Building upon this assumption, the authors propose an enhanced version of Leurgans' Algorithm, tailored to solve the convex optimization problem defined by their model. This extension boasts simplicity and reduced computational complexity, with subsequent theoretical proofs verifying the accurate recovery of both tensor components under specified conditions.
Quality: The paper's organization is commendable, with a clear introduction and motivation of the central idea. The accompanying proofs are persuasive and facilitate comprehension. However, the presence of numerous minor typos detracts from the overall quality. 
Clarity: The primary concept and motivation are readily understandable, with the authors making a notable effort to elucidate the constraints governing their proposed approach. 
Originality: Although the algorithm's foundation lies in Leurgans' work, its integration with convex optimization techniques presents a novel solution to the posited problem.
Significance: The model demonstrates capability in representing the dual additive tensors as low-rank and sparse entities. Nevertheless, the algorithm's applicability and significance may be compromised by inherent constraints. Notably, the conclusion drawn in Corollary 3.7 relies on uniform dimensionality without supplementary justification. 
The paper presents an intriguing extension of Leurgans' Algorithm, with well-formulated concepts and primary results. While the model's applicability may be impacted by the identified constraints, the absence of experiments utilizing real-world data in the paper leaves uncertainty regarding its practical implications.
