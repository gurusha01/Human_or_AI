The manuscript exhibits several writing flaws, including typos and missing punctuation marks, such as the error on page 2 in "Section 4As A is finite". While the text is generally readable up to page 4, the explanation of the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe method is marred by issues like repetitive wording, undefined terms (e.g., "weight"), and awkwardly phrased sentences. Additional writing problems are scattered throughout the document, including undefined acronyms like "QP".
Despite these issues, the theoretical contributions and their interpretations are noteworthy and engaging. However, the experimental section falls short. Specifically, Figure 2 is difficult to decipher, particularly in its printed form, where the lines are nearly indistinguishable.
Furthermore, the experimental advantages of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants are already established, and it would have been beneficial to discuss how the experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings presented, such as convergence rates and constants. Although the inclusion of the sparse coding problem as a didactic example is understandable, incorporating state-of-the-art methods for the Lasso problem would enhance the analysis.
Some minor suggestions include:
- Standardizing bibliography citations, as inconsistencies are observed (e.g., "ArXiv", "arXiv", "arXiv.org").
- Adding a conclusions section to summarize the key findings.
- Integrating the content of Section 4 more seamlessly into the main text, as dedicating an entire section to it may not be necessary.
The authors' exploration of the convergence rate for the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants is well-presented, despite the need for significant improvement in the paper's overall writing quality. The theoretical results appear interesting and robust, but the final sections require refinement.
