This paper presents a novel approach to modeling student learning in MOOCs using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically evaluating the system's ability to predict student success or failure on given exercises. The authors propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN architecture, demonstrating its performance superiority over the standard Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) method.
The article is a well-documented application of knowledge tracing, with LSTM RNNs offering a significant advancement in the field. The dataset and baselines used are relevant, and the authors' decision to provide their code in the supplementary material is commendable, although a README file would have facilitated easier usability.
However, the paper's organization could be improved, with the definition of knowledge tracing in subsection 1.1 feeling isolated and better suited for a separate section. Additionally, section 4 appears disjointed and could be integrated into the introduction and related work sections.
The choice of Area Under the Curve (AUC) as an evaluation metric is unclear, and it would be beneficial to understand why accuracy was not relied upon instead. Although Figure 3 presents accuracy, the motivation behind using AUC is not explicitly stated, and it does not appear to be the standard metric in knowledge tracing.
Section 6.2, along with the supplementary material, offers interesting insights, and it would be valuable to explore potential methods for quantitatively evaluating this task. 
In conclusion, this article is engaging, well-written, and presents a significant breakthrough in performance, making it a suitable candidate for publication in NIPS.
