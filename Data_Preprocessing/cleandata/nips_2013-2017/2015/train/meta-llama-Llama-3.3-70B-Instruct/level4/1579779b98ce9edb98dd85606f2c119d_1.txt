Following careful consideration of the rebuttal and discussion with fellow reviewers, I reaffirm that this paper warrants publication due to its sophisticated methodology and potential to stimulate further research in related areas. Although the experimental outcomes are somewhat underwhelming, I believe the current evaluation is justified, as more compelling results would likely have led to an even higher rating. The paper presents a lucidly written proposal for a nonconvex relaxation approach to globally optimize decision trees with a predefined structure, showcasing an elegant methodological framework. However, the experimental results fail to fully live up to expectations. A potential refinement could involve discarding the final split in each tree after global optimization and then optimizing the split and leaf node using conventional methods, which may yield improved outcomes. Furthermore, it is crucial to assess whether global optimization tends to increase overfitting, a consideration that warrants thorough evaluation.
