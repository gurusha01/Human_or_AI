This paper proposes a neural network architecture that leverages the parametric form of Conditional Random Field (CRF) potentials to make marginal predictions. By directly fitting this form to minimize training error, the authors achieve empirical success on a notable benchmark. However, I found the presentation of the work to be partially misleading, as the cost function appears to prioritize pixel-wise errors over structured prediction, and no actual CRF model is fitted.
In my understanding, "structured CRF prediction" implies a joint distribution over labels given an input, enabling the generation of plausible joint label configurations or the reporting of the most probable labeling. The "Intersection over Union" score, on the other hand, seems to focus on maximizing the score by predicting the most probable label for each pixel independently, rather than considering joint plausibility.
The work learns a predictive model that maximizes performance, rather than a CRF model that learns a joint distribution. It is unclear whether the "messages" in this paper correspond to realizable or likely factors. While the idea is intriguing and appears to be a useful heuristic for setting the output layer of a neural network, I found some of the framing to be misleading and confusing.
Specifically, the claim that "message learning" allows for the explicit incorporation of the expected number of inference iterations into the learning procedure (line 332) seems unsubstantiated, as only one iteration is implemented. Additionally, there are several typos and incorrect word endings throughout the paper, such as "massage" instead of "message" (line 54), "potenials" (line 66), "sematic" (line 120), and "convlutional" (line 265).
The rebuttal does not alter my assessment: this paper does not perform structured prediction as claimed, but rather achieves accurate pixel-wise labeling. The approach can be viewed as a clever way to set the output layer of a neural network for labeling pixels, inspired by the parametric form of CRF messages, but it does not actually fit a structured prediction model.
