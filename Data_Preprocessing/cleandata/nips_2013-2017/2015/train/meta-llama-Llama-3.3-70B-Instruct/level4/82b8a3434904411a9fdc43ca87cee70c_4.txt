A fundamental challenge in machine learning involves determining the optimal regularization parameter for a model, typically achieved through cross-validation. This paper introduces a novel approach to analytically derive bounds on validation error. The methodology involves calculating lower and upper bounds for the dot product of the model parameter and each validation instance as a function of the regularization parameter, given a solution for a different regularization parameter. These instance-level bounds are then aggregated to obtain bounds on the overall validation error. A pivotal contribution of the paper is Lemma 1, which outlines the computation of these bounds. Although the proof of this lemma is relegated to the appendix, providing an intuitive explanation within the main text would significantly enhance the reader's understanding of this core concept. The appendix-based proof appears to heavily rely on the convexity of the regularized loss function, which may limit the applicability of the method, albeit being more general than previously presented approaches. Additionally, the paper assumes an L2 prior on the model parameter and focuses exclusively on tuning a single hyper-parameter. While the results seem correct, a detailed verification of the proofs was not conducted. The text is well-written, with the caveat that key insights, such as the intuition behind Lemma 1, could be more prominently featured. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of optimizing the regularization parameter using the proposed error bounds and highlight the significance of having such bounds available. The topic is relevant to the NIPS community, and the findings are interesting, although they may be too specialized to garner broad attention. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution by providing analytical bounds for cross-validation error and demonstrating their utility in efficient parameter optimization.
