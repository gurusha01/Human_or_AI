This manuscript offers a theoretical foundation for the common neighbors heuristic in link prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering clusters under the stochastic blockmodel for dense graphs, and with an additional cleaning step, for sparser graphs. The underlying problem can be viewed as clustering a stochastic blockmodel realization with weak edge dependencies, a scenario that, to my knowledge, has not been previously explored, yet is amenable to established proof techniques. The paper is well-written and provides a valuable theoretical justification for a heuristic that, if widely used in practice without prior theoretical backing, makes this work a significant contribution to the field.
