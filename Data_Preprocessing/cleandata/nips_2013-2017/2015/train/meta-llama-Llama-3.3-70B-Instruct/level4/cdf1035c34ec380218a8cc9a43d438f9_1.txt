This paper presents an online binary vertex classification approach over a graph, where the learner is initially given a graph $G$ and, in each round, a node is selected, possibly adversarially, and the learner must provide a label from $\{0,1\}$. The true label $y_t$ is then revealed by nature. The learner's prediction is based on the Ising model as the temperature parameter approaches 0, but since this is computationally intractable, the authors propose an approximate scheme using Picard-Queyranne (PQ) graphs to preserve the combinatorial structure of minimum cuts. The learner then makes predictions by playing an online game on the PQ graph, with the authors providing a mistake bound for the algorithm. Notably, when the graph is a tree, the mistake bounds are comparable to those of the TreeOpt algorithm.
Although I found the paper to be engaging, it was challenging to read due to its poor organization and writing. The problem setup and description are scattered throughout the first two sections, making it difficult to follow. A concise, bullet-point list summarizing the basic problem would be beneficial. Additionally, including an informal proof outline and high-level results in one of the initial sections would improve clarity. The use of the 0-Ising model as a benchmark is natural, despite being intractable. The comparison between the proposed algorithm and TreeOpt is promising, and the reduction to PQ graphs and the PQ prediction game is both interesting and novel.
Overall, I believe this work merits publication due to its interesting problem formulation and practical applications. However, the algorithm's time complexity, which is quadratic in the number of vertices, limits its suitability to small to medium-scale problems.
