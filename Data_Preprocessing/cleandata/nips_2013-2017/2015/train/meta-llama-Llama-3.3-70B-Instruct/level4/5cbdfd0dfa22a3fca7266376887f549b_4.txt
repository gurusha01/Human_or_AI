In this manuscript, the authors present a novel approach to addressing a tensor factorisation problem, where a given tensor Z is decomposed into a low-rank component X and a sparse component Y. To achieve this, they define two matrix subspaces, T{U,V} and T{V,W}, which describe the span of the tensor after contraction along the 1st or 3rd mode, respectively. The sparsity of the tensor after contraction along a particular mode is characterised by the union of support sets of the extracted matrix slices. The authors introduce incoherence parameters based on L_{inf} norms to control the sparsity, aiming to produce 'diffuse' spectra rather than sparse ones.
The authors extend the simultaneous diagonalisation technique by contracting the tensor along modes 1 and 3 using randomly chosen vectors a and b from a uniformly distributed unit sphere. This process yields a set of eigenvalues, which are then paired to form a set of equations that can be solved for the corresponding eigenvectors. To impose low-rank and sparsity constraints, the authors apply simultaneous diagonalisation to the contractions of X and Y, respectively, and utilise the nuclear norm for X and the \ell_1 norm for Y, ultimately solving equation 6. This subproblem is well-explained in reference [10], specifically equation 1.3.
The evaluation of the proposed method involves generating 50^3 dimensional non-symmetric tensors Z, composed of low-rank X and sparse Y, according to the distributions described in the paper. The authors present the likelihood of recovering tensors X and Y from Z with respect to sparsity and true tensor rank r.
The strengths of this submission include: 
- An intriguing non-symmetric tensor factorisation/decomposition problem
- An interesting extension of the existing simultaneous positive-definite matrix diagonalisation problem [18]
- A novel approach to imposing low-rank and sparsity-related constraints on contractions, building upon problem [10]
However, there are some weaknesses:
- The submission would benefit from additional evaluations beyond figure 1
- The last steps of the algorithm in section 2 could be described more clearly
- The proofs are somewhat challenging to follow
Major comments:
1. This paper is highly interesting, as it extends several concepts, including simultaneous diagonalisation for a set of matrices, to low-rank and sparse matrix recovery, and applies these methods to third-order non-symmetric tensors. The mathematical foundations of these methods appear convincing.
2. The simultaneous diagonalisation in [18] highlights the issue of using a single projection vector, which can lead to zeroing some eigenvalues. The authors of [18] propose random projections to mitigate this issue. It is unclear whether the authors of this submission perform multiple contractions, and how this affects the stability of diagonalisation, particularly for non-symmetric tensors, which require solving for three sets of eigenvectors.
3. The evaluations of the proposed algorithm seem limited, and it would be convincing to see experiments on non-synthetic data. Additionally, some of the guarantees provided in section 3 could be illustrated in the experimental setting, such as the behaviour of v3 and v1 outside of the guaranteed regime from corollary 3.4.
This paper is likely to be of interest to the community researching higher-order tensors, as it presents a clear and original contribution, despite relying heavily on prior developments.
