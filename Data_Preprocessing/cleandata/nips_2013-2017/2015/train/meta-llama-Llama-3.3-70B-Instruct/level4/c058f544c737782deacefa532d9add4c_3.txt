Although the paper's primary focus is theoretical, its experimental component is somewhat lacking. To strengthen the presentation, it would be beneficial to not only demonstrate the enhanced performance of the various Frank-Wolfe variants considered, but also to provide insight into the scenarios in which these variants become practically competitive with alternative methods, particularly for problems that can be addressed by multiple approaches, such as unconstrained l1-regularized regression.
This paper is a valuable contribution, offering theoretical foundations for several enhancements to the Frank-Wolfe algorithm family, including some that have been empirically shown to significantly accelerate convergence but previously lacked theoretical backing. The paper appears to be well-structured and clearly written, with only a few minor errors that can be easily rectified through meticulous proofreading by the authors.
