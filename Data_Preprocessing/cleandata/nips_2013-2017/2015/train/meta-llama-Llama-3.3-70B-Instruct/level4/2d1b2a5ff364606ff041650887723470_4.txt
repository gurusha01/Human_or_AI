This manuscript explores linear estimation in the context of nonlinear link functions, drawing inspiration from the work of Plan and Vershynin. It delves into the asymptotic estimation error utilizing generalized lasso for arbitrary link functions where \mu is not equal to 0. Notably, the research reveals that the asymptotic error remains consistent, regardless of whether the link function is linear or nonlinear, as demonstrated in Theorem 2.1.
Theorem 2.1 is predicated on the assumption that the linear measurement vector is sampled from a normal distribution, a condition that may be overly restrictive in certain scenarios. The authors should provide a justification for the necessity of this assumption in supporting their conclusion.
Several questions arise from this work: 1. What methodology should be employed to select a regularizer based on the set \kai, which contains \(x_0\)? Although the paper discusses the assumption of a convex regularizer, it appears that this specific issue remains unaddressed. 2. Given that the results indicate equivalence between nonlinear and linear measurements, yet the conclusion involves dependencies on \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\), which characterize the difficulty of estimation from the nonlinear function \(g\), it would be insightful to understand the authors' perspective on the necessity of these dependencies.
Additionally, there are notable omissions in the references. 1. Research on single index models and sufficient dimension reduction has explored linear vector/subspace estimation under unknown link functions, yet this area is not reviewed in the paper. 2. A recent publication by Yi et al., titled "Optimal linear estimation under unknown linear estimation," presents a novel algorithm for sparse recovery, including cases where the link function has a \(\mu\) of zero. This study establishes the equivalence of high-dimensional linear estimation with linear and nonlinear link functions under appropriate conditions, supported by both theoretical proofs and empirical results. Overall, this is a well-crafted paper that presents intriguing findings.
