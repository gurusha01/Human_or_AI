This manuscript addresses the challenge of calculating average statistics in a decentralized setting. Although the proposed algorithm is straightforward and may not introduce substantial new concepts, the accompanying proofs are thorough and well-established. 
A notable limitation of this work is the absence of comparisons to established baseline metrics. It is likely that multiple intuitive baseline approaches could be devised using randomized algorithms, and incorporating these into the experimental framework would be beneficial. The paper tackles an intriguing problem, but its assessment is compromised by the lack of robust evaluation and the omission of baseline comparisons.
