The paper presents a novel approach to time-sensitive recommendations based on user activities, distinguishing itself from existing methods by addressing the issue of time-varying user preferences. Additionally, it tackles the prediction of a user's next return time. The authors employ an efficient optimization algorithm for learning, which is demonstrated through experiments on one synthetic dataset to showcase scalability and two real datasets of moderate size.
However, it is questionable whether time-varying user preferences are a widespread issue. Analyzing the real datasets used in the experiments could provide evidence to support this claim. If such variations exist, it would be beneficial to understand whether they are primarily driven by factors like the release of new popular content or other patterns.
The motivation behind predicting a user's next return time is unclear. It would be helpful to provide a clear rationale for this prediction before presenting it as a contribution. Furthermore, an explanation of how a web company could utilize this prediction and its potential applications would be valuable.
Some straightforward baselines for predicting return times, such as using the last time delay or the most frequent time delay, were not evaluated. Predicting the exact return time may be overly challenging; instead, focusing on simpler tasks like forecasting whether a user will have a short (1-5 days), medium (5-14 days), long (14-33 days), or very long (>33 days) delay before using the service again could be more feasible.
In the experimental section, it was difficult to gauge the significance of the performance improvement compared to SVD. Is the enhancement substantial (order of magnitude) or modest? Would the user notice the difference? How do these recommendations compare to suggesting popular items, a baseline that can be particularly hard to beat, especially if popular items are updated daily?
Minor comments include:
1) A typo in the last paragraph of page 3: "and is abel to capture" should be "and is able to capture".
2) The first paragraph of section 2 abruptly introduces retweets and link creation in social networks without references, causing confusion. It would be better to rephrase.
The paper addresses two problems – time-sensitive recommendations and user return time – without adequately motivating their relevance or the potential impact of solving them. Several baselines and analyses are missing, as detailed below. Overall, the paper is acceptable but marginal.
