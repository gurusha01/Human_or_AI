This paper presents a novel approach to learning messages in message-passing inference using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), achieving state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation task. 
It is worth noting that a similar concept of learning messages in one-step message-passing inference has been explored in [12], albeit with a different application to pose estimation. Although the mathematical formulation and details differ, the underlying idea of leveraging CNNs to learn messages, rather than potentials, shares a common thread. However, this paper lacks a clear acknowledgement of this existing work and a discussion on its distinctive contributions.
Upon closer examination, the proposed approach computes the final score vector for each pixel by summing the scores from each factor-to-pixel message, with each message being generated by a separate deep network. This methodology bears a resemblance to an ensemble of multiple models trained with different initializations. In contrast, most competing methods (with the exception of ContextDCRF, which faces a similar issue) rely on a single network for prediction, suggesting that an ensemble model could serve as a natural baseline for comparison. The authors are encouraged to explore this avenue.
Considering these points, the originality and significance of the paper are somewhat questionable. Nevertheless, the paper's clarity and mathematical descriptions are commendable. Despite these reservations, the idea of learning messages using CNNs is intriguing and timely, and the state-of-the-art results warrant consideration for acceptance. The concept of training a CNN to predict messages is well-articulated, although it is essential to disentangle the ensemble effect arising from the use of multiple networks and to contextualize this work within the broader literature, including [12], which also explores direct message learning using CNNs for a distinct task.
