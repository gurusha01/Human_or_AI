The authors have built upon the successful segmentation algorithm from the ISBI 2012 challenge, referred to as Base2D in their manuscript, by introducing two significant enhancements. Leveraging recent advancements in convolutional neural networks (convnets) for image recognition, they have modified the base architecture to be deeper, utilizing smaller convolutions. The output of the 2D network is then employed to initialize a 3D network, resulting in further refinement of segmentation accuracy.
Regarding the quality of the manuscript, it is evident that the authors have made a substantial contribution to the state of the art in addressing a complex and crucial problem. Their experiments incorporate a range of metrics, including both subjective and quantitative assessments, to demonstrate the efficacy of their approach. However, it would be beneficial to see the inclusion of experiments on a more diverse range of datasets, as well as larger datasets, given the importance of scalability in connectomics applications. Furthermore, future studies should strive to provide a more comprehensive comparison with other methods, including those beyond the ISBI 2012 winner and recent advancements, such as the one presented in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04304.pdf.
The manuscript is well-organized and clearly presented, with a lack of dense mathematical derivations due to the architecture being a straightforward combination of existing components. The figures are thorough and well-structured, effectively conveying the key concepts.
In terms of originality, the authors have successfully imported ideas from other application areas, demonstrating the value of generalizing these concepts beyond their original domain. Additionally, some ideas are inspired by the understanding of the biological visual system. While the individual components of the architecture may not be highly innovative or complex, this can be seen as a strength, as it will facilitate adoption by practitioners in the field.
The significance of this manuscript lies in its potential to contribute to the automation of EM segmentation, which could revolutionize the field of neuroscience. Although this study presents an incremental advance, any improvements in efficiency are valuable to the community and worthy of sharing. The authors propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture for segmenting connectomics data and provide compelling evidence of its superiority in addressing this challenging and important problem.
