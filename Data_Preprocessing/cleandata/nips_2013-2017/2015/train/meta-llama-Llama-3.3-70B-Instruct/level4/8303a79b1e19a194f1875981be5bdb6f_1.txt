SUMMARY
This paper proposes a modification to Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which sample from a probability distribution by simulating the evolution of a physical system with an augmented state space. The method involves integrating Hamiltonian equations of motion, but encounters difficulties when the energy function is non-differentiable. To address this, the authors introduce physically-inspired "reflections" and "refractions" of the system's trajectory when it crosses a discontinuity in the energy function, which occurs at the boundaries of certain polytopes. The reflection or refraction depends on the momentum component of the state, and the authors demonstrate that these procedures preserve volume, ensuring convergence to the target distribution.
QUALITY
The proposed modification is a useful contribution to Hamiltonian MCMC, particularly for piecewise-differentiable target distributions, which are common in practice. However, it would be beneficial to extend the method to handle more general boundary types, beyond affine hyperplanes.
CLARITY
The algorithm and its motivation are clearly presented, and the proof of volume preservation is well-explained. Nevertheless, additional discussion on the impact of reflections and refractions on rejection rates would be helpful, including both qualitative and quantitative analyses.
ORIGINALITY AND SIGNIFICANCE
The application of physically-based reflection and refraction to Hamiltonian MCMC appears to be a novel and useful idea. While the current work establishes its correctness under specific conditions, further research is needed to extend its applicability. The proposed method has the potential to improve the efficiency of Hamiltonian MCMC by reducing rejection rates and enhancing mixing speeds, particularly for distributions with non-differentiable boundaries.
