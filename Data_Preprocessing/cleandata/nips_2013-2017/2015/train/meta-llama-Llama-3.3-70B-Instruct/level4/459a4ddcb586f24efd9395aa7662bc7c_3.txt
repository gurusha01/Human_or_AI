This paper presents a novel sampling approach for mixture models utilizing homogeneous completely random measures, combining the strengths of two existing sampler classes. By integrating the benefits of conditional samplers, which exhibit faster mixing times, and marginal samplers, capable of exact representation of infinite objects with finite memory, the proposed hybrid sampler offers a robust solution. Leveraging Pitman's research on Poisson-Kingman partitions and size-biased sampling, the authors derive a Gibbs sampling scheme tailored to Poisson-Kingman mixture models. The performance of the proposed sampler is demonstrated to be superior to existing conditional and marginal samplers in terms of runtime and effective sample size. 
The development of mixture models based on normalized completely random measures has been a focal point of increasing interest within the Bayesian non-parametrics community. The sampler introduced in this paper constitutes a valuable contribution to this field. A crucial technical advancement lies in the representation of "surplus mass" as a variable within the sampler, facilitating the derivation of its complete conditional distribution through the application of Pitman's findings on the joint distribution of weights and total mass in a completely random measure. The clarity of exposition and significance of the work underscore its importance to the Bayesian non-parametrics community. Overall, the paper delivers an efficient sampling method for a model class that has garnered significant attention recently, distinguishing itself through clear execution and writing, and providing a vital tool for the community.
