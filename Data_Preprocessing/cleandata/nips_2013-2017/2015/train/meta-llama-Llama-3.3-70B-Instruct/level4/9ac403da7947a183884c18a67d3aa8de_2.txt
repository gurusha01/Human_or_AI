This paper presents segregated graphs (SGs) as a type of graphical model defined over observed variables, incorporating undirected, directed, and bidirected edges. Bidirected edges signify the presence of a common latent parent, whereas undirected edges represent a bidirectional causal relationship between variables, indicating that one variable can cause another or vice versa. The overall structure of SGs appears to integrate elements of Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs) and Markov Random Fields (MRFs).
A key characteristic of SGs is the absence of partially directed cycles, and the restriction that certain edge types cannot intersect. These constraints enable a factorization of the joint distribution into a combination of ADMG and MRF factors. The authors demonstrate how to orient specific edges in cases where they intersect in the original model, while preserving conditional independencies, which constitutes a significant technical contribution.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically rigorous, with all claims substantiated by thorough proofs. Although it lacks experimental results, the authors provide illustrative examples of causal interactions that can be effectively modeled using SGs.
The clarity of the paper is compromised by its density and the complexity of some proofs, which necessitated the creation of supplementary diagrams to facilitate understanding. The inclusion of additional figures could enhance the presentation and improve readability.
Regarding originality, while SGs are constructed by merging existing models, the work is highly non-trivial and demonstrates considerable technical skill. However, the novelty of SGs is somewhat limited by their foundation in established models.
The significance of this work is moderate, as the impact of SGs may be limited in isolation. Nevertheless, they could potentially contribute to future research, particularly if accompanied by new results on causal identifiability that cannot be expressed using existing models, or the development of an inference algorithm for a specific parametric family. Overall, this is a high-quality paper that introduces SGs as a novel graphical model, offering a unique approach to specifying causal relationships.
