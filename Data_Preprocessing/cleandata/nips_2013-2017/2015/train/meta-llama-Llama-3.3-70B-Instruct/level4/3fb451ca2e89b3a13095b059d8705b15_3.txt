The manuscript is generally well-structured and clearly presented. 
The introduced algorithm offers a moderate enhancement, with more pronounced improvements in certain scenarios, over traditional glasso and robust methods, accompanied by theoretical guarantees of consistency. This study tackles the challenge of estimating precision matrices using sparsity-inducing approaches. Building upon the classical glasso framework, the authors propose a novel algorithm that incorporates weighted data points, resulting in a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, they develop two distinct algorithms. Although the non-convex nature of the problem leads to local minima solutions, the authors provide a theoretical justification demonstrating that any local minimum achieves certain consistency properties.
