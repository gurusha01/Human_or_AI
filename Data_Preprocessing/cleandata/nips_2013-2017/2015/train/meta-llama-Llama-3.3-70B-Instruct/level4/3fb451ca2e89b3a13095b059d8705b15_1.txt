The paper proposes a robust method for inferring sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), providing theoretical guarantees for the estimated models even when the estimates correspond to local optima of the objective function.
The paper is well-organized and clearly presented, introducing the problem and then presenting the objective function (3) and a reasonable optimization approach, Algorithm 1. Since the objective function is bi-convex but not convex, the authors do not attempt to find a global minimum, instead providing theoretical guarantees for any local minimum under certain conditions. Section 3 offers some insight into when these conditions are met. The paper also includes experiments using both synthetic and real data.
The use of equation (3) is a reasonable approach to handling outliers and noise, and the theoretical guarantees are a significant advantage. However, it is challenging to see a substantial improvement over existing techniques for practical problems, despite the authors' commendable comparison to a range of alternative methods. The results in Figure 1 show that the proposed method is competitive but not significantly superior. Nevertheless, performing slightly better than alternatives while providing theoretical guarantees is a notable contribution.
Some minor points require attention: the definitions of \tau{1}, \tau{2}, and \tau should be clarified, as they are only defined in the supplementary material. The sentence at line 236 is unclear, specifically the phrase "choose a parameter from [a] quantity." Several minor errors were also noted, including typographical errors at lines 51, 123, 125, 242, 277, 278, 285, 286, and 291, as well as a subscript error at line 365. Additionally, "gaussian" should be capitalized to "Gaussian" at line 463.
Overall, the paper presents a method with useful theoretical guarantees and competitive empirical performance.
