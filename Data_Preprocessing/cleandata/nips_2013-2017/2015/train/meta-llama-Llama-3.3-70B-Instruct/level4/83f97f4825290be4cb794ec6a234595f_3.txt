Overall, this paper is well-received due to its focus on a significant problem and its effective blend of theoretical and empirical findings. Several key points are worth noting:
1) To provide a more comprehensive context, the authors should acknowledge that their problem is a specific instance of submodular load balancing, a topic extensively explored in 'Submodular approximation: sampling-based algorithms and lower bounds' by Svitkina and Fleischer.
2) The proposition regarding arbitrary partitions (Proposition 2) aligns with existing knowledge on general submodular functions, as previously discussed in the aforementioned reference by Svitkina and Fleischer.
3) Another pertinent study is 'Graph Partitioning via Parallel Submodular Approximation to Accelerate Distributed Machine Learning' by Mu Li et al., which examines the min-max hyper-graph partitioning problem in a streaming context. This work recognizes the problem as an example of min-max submodular data partitioning, also known as the submodular load balancing problem. The authors present both theoretical results and demonstrations using real-world data, offering valuable insights into this area of research.
