This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to achieving test error guarantees by integrating screening techniques with approximate regularization paths, a truly innovative and unexpected combination. Although the current results are limited to binary linear classification, they may serve as a valuable foundation for extending to more complex machine learning models. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, with promising experimental results.
To enhance clarity, it would be beneficial to explicitly differentiate between definitions of epsilon-approximate solutions in terms of training error and validation error to prevent confusion. Additionally, considering rephrasing 'epsilon-approximate regularization parameter' to 'epsilon-approximate optimal regularization parameter' could improve precision.
A more detailed discussion on the theoretical complexity of the proposed method as a function of epsilon is warranted. Specifically, assuming naive and equal-spaced selection of C values, the authors should elaborate on the implications for interval size. This could also serve as an opportunity to explore the connection between path methods for training error and the approach presented in the paper.
Minor corrections include: replacing "the" with "this" on line 61 and correcting "soluitons" to "solutions" on line 264. Overall, this paper introduces a novel method for computing guarantees on cross-validation error across the entire regularization path, marking a crucial first step towards developing more robust hyperparameter search methods with test error guarantees.
