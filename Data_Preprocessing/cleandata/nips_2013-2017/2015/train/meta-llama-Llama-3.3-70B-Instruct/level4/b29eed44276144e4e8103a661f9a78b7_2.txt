This paper introduces a novel graph property, "hierarchy width", which serves as a bound for the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. 
A concern arises from the observation that the hierarchy width of a graph consistently exceeds its hypertree width. 
Intuitively, it would seem that achieving polynomial time exact inference should be more challenging than obtaining a polynomial mixing time for sampling. 
However, the reality appears to be the opposite, prompting the question of why sampling proves to be significantly more difficult than exact inference. 
As one of the lighter papers to review, this work proposes the new graph property of "hierarchy width" to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor models. 
The theoretical contributions of this paper appear to be crucial for gaining insight into the characteristics of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs.
