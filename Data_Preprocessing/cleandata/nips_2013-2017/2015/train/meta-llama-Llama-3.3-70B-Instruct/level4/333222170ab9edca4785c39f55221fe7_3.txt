This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that leverages both crowdsourced labels and an incrementally trained model to tackle prediction problems. The core concept involves heavily relying on crowd inputs during the initial stages, learning from the acquired labels, and gradually reducing the reliance on crowd inputs as the model becomes more confident. This is achieved through a sophisticated formulation of the problem as a stochastic game, where the system and the crowd are modeled as players, and the system issues queries to elicit responses, maximizing expected utility.
The system's utility is computed using a simulation dynamics model, which predicts the probability of true labels, crowd responses, and response times given the input, query, and time. However, the introduction of continuous time makes the optimization problem intractable, and an approximation based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and TD learning is employed. The authors conduct experiments on several tasks, including named entity recognition, sentiment recognition, and face identification, comparing their model to multiple baselines, such as majority vote, online learning, and a "threshold" baseline that removes the continuous time dependency.
The results show that the proposed model outperforms most baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, although the "threshold" baseline achieves comparable performance with lower latency in some cases. The authors also demonstrate that their model requires fewer crowdsourced labels over time, given a sufficiently strong model, and that it can leverage crowd expertise more effectively than online learning.
This paper presents a highly original and significant contribution to the field, with impressive results and a well-motivated approach. However, the introduction of continuous time complicates the discussion and algorithmic mechanics, and its benefits are not entirely clear. The paper would benefit from a clearer development of the core method without continuous time, with the addition of continuous time presented as an extension. Additionally, the authors could provide more clarity on the performance of the "threshold" baseline, which is shown to be strong in many cases.
There are also several minor issues with the presentation of results, including missing data for the 5-vote case in some tables and figures, and inconsistent reporting of latency values. Furthermore, some minor comments on the method description include the need for clarification on the deadline used in the experiments, the distribution in equation (2), and the notation in equation (5).
Overall, this paper presents a novel and interesting approach to hybrid learning, and its acceptance is recommended. However, addressing the issues with clarity and presentation would improve the paper's impact and facilitate wider adoption of the technique.
