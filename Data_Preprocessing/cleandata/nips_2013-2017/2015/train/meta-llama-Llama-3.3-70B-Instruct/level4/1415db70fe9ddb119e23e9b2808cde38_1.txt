The manuscript examines Expectation-Maximization (EM) in a high-dimensional context, presenting convergence results and developing an inference procedure. 
To enhance the clarity of the initial solution, the authors should elaborate on the conditions under which the initial parameter, $\beta^{\rm init}$, can be determined to fulfill the requirement specified on line 60 of page 2.
The paper proposes two distinct algorithms, but it lacks practical guidance on selecting the most appropriate one for a given scenario.
The choice of $\hat s$ and $\lambda$ in practical applications, as well as the sensitivity of the results to these tuning parameters, requires further discussion. It is also essential to investigate whether these parameters can be chosen in a data-dependent manner, as the selection of tuning parameters is crucial in the existing literature on high-dimensional inference for achieving favorable sampling properties.
The decorrelated score test appears to be identical to the one presented in [*]. This similarity should be acknowledged and cited accordingly, rather than being overlooked. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine whether any novel developments are required to apply the existing inference procedure in the current context.
The primary theoretical results are contingent upon a multitude of technical conditions. The authors should provide a discussion on whether these conditions are satisfied for the latent variable models under consideration.
The paper builds upon [2] by extending it to a high-dimensional setting and applies the work of Ning and Liu [*] to the problem of inference. Although the paper combines existing results in an innovative manner, it is essential to clearly articulate what constitutes the novel contributions of this work and why the application of existing tools is non-trivial. Given that the submitted paper serves as an introduction to the extensive supplementary material, it should provide more insight into the technical challenges involved in establishing the main results.
