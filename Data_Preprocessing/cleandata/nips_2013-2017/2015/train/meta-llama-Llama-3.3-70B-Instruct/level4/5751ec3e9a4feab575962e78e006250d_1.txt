Update after author feedback and discussion: Unfortunately, the authors' response has not adequately addressed my concerns, prompting a decrease in my score. A crucial issue remains unaddressed: the method's practical feasibility for real-world streaming data applications. As I comprehend the algorithm, it can re-sample earlier data points, which implies the need for continuous storage and repeated access to the entire data stream. This limitation significantly deviates from the capabilities of genuine streaming algorithms and should be explicitly acknowledged. The proposal to extend Bayesian inference to infinite data streams is intriguing. However, I had expected a more thorough comparison of alternative Bayesian approaches that could be achieved by modifying the model. The method's classification as a streaming algorithm is also questionable, as it may necessitate re-sampling initial data points at a much later stage, which contradicts the typical characteristics of streaming data processing.
