Review Summary:
The field of topological data analysis examines the geometric structure of a dataset using algebraic topology methods, with persistent homology and persistence diagrams being valuable tools. However, statistically analyzing these diagrams is computationally expensive and challenging. To overcome this, researchers embed probability measures on the space of persistence diagrams into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, leveraging the regularity and abundance of methods in Hilbert spaces. This embedding is achievable with a "universal" kernel via the "mean map." The paper proves that a modified version of the recently introduced "PSS kernel," called the "u-PSS kernel," is "universal" with respect to the 1-Wasserstein metric [Prop 2]. This enables the comparison of homological features between samples without directly computing persistence diagrams, reducing the task to kernel evaluation.
Major Negative Points:
- The paper is difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with algebraic topology or functional analysis, despite a background chapter, as it assumes familiarity with advanced notions and results without providing further explanation.
- Key definitions, argumentations, and calculations from other papers are sketchy or omitted.
- The core argument is not presented in a concise, chronological manner, but rather is scattered throughout the paper, interspersed with secondary information, making the text confusing at times.
- The primary contribution, the proof of Proposition 2, essentially boils down to proving that (\mathcal{S},d_{W,1}) is a compact metric due to Theorem 1. In this reviewer's opinion, the contribution is not significant, as the author primarily combines existing definitions and results without introducing novel concepts.
Positive Points:
- Topological data analysis is a new and exciting field with many interesting applications, and the result appears promising. Algebraic topology, though powerful, is not frequently used due to its computational complexity, so a result leading to reduced complexity implementations could have diverse and interesting implications.
- The experiments and implementations effectively demonstrate the generality of the theoretical result and its diverse applications.
Final Conclusion: 5/10 (weak rejection). The paper lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical content, and the writing could be improved.
