This manuscript proposes a CNN-CRF framework for structured prediction, where CNN messages are learned explicitly for inference purposes. However, several issues need to be addressed, as outlined below:
(1) The inclusion of a schematic illustration would facilitate a clearer understanding of the overall methodology, as the current description of the proposed components' roles is unclear. Additionally, the equations could be simplified to enhance intuitiveness.
(2) The proposed method's applicability appears to be restricted, as it can only accommodate a limited number of neighborhood connections and relies on numerous approximations. This lack of algorithmic elegance and simplicity is a concern.
(3) The experimental evaluation is limited to the VOC dataset, which is insufficient for a NIPS submission. To demonstrate the method's broader applicability, results on other popular datasets for structured labeling, such as OCR and POS, should be provided.
In general, the proposed method is overly complex, making it difficult to discern its specific benefits. Although the approach of learning message passing in CNN-based CRF models for structured prediction is promising, and the reported results show improvement over the state-of-the-art on the PASCAL VOC image labeling dataset, the method's scope remains somewhat limited, and the solution seems intermediate.
