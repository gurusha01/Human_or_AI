Review- Summary:
The authors introduce a novel MCMC approach for a broad category of Bayesian nonparametric models, specifically Poisson-Kingman random probability measures. They provide an overview of the model class, the generative process, and the key insight that enables the development of an MCMC inference routine. Additionally, they discuss existing methods for similar models, including marginal and conditional samplers, and compare their proposed sampler to these standard approaches in terms of effective sample size and computational time.
- Quality
This manuscript presents a significant contribution to the development of inference methods for a highly general class of models. The technical aspects of the paper appear to be sound, and the authors provide a sufficient review of existing methods and their relationship to the proposed approach.
- Clarity
However, the paper's clarity is compromised, potentially due to the imposed page limit. Notably, the notation used in the generative procedure outlined in Section 2.1 is particularly challenging to decipher, which is unfortunate given the importance of this section in understanding the authors' contribution.
- Originality
To the best of my knowledge, the development of a sampler for this broad class of models represents a novel contribution.
- Significance
If the ideas were presented more cohesively, this paper could serve as a valuable reference and review for this type of sampler. The concept has the potential to be highly impactful, but its presentation may hinder its reach.
Comments:
- Incorporating a figure or diagram to illustrate the generative process (specifically the stick-breaking construction) and highlighting its distinction from the standard Dirichlet process stick-breaking construction of Ishwaran and James would greatly enhance the readability of Section 2 and the overall methodological contribution. 
This paper demonstrates technical soundness and potential impact but requires significant improvement in the presentation of its ideas to fully realize its potential.
