The authors present an examination of the Robust PCA problem in the context of sparse corruption adhering to a non-uniform Bernoulli distribution. A key finding is that, under such non-uniform conditions, the likelihood of successful recovery at high probabilities hinges on the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix. Specifically, it is observed that matrix entries exhibiting local incoherence possess a greater capacity to withstand errors.
The analysis leverages existing concepts from the literature, including the golfing scheme, and extends these to encompass both random and fixed sign settings. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the robust PCA problem by offering novel insights.
However, several aspects of the work warrant further clarification to enhance the reader's comprehension of its contributions. Notably, significant advancements have been made in convex demixing, as detailed in reference [1], which outlines general geometric conditions facilitating the recovery of the form S+L. These developments are substantially more comprehensive, underscoring the need to juxtapose the current specific results with this broader body of research. Furthermore, while the local incoherence condition presents an intriguing concept, its practical applicability is limited by the lack of a clear method for testing it in given problems.
The paper's analysis is founded on the weighted norm, an approach that, in itself, holds interest. Nevertheless, several conclusions drawn from this norm can be traced back to reference [9], highlighting the importance of distinguishing between established knowledge and the novel contributions of the current paper. Without such differentiation, the advancements may be perceived as incremental.
The implications of the research for cluster matrices are noteworthy, and the experimental component is satisfactory. An interesting avenue for further exploration could involve examining robust PCA following centering to determine if qualitatively different outcomes are obtained.
Key observations include:
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and accessible.
- The inclusion of numerous experiments enhances the paper's validity.
Weaknesses:
- The results are not adequately contextualized within the existing literature on related topics.
- The work draws substantially from previous results, which may lead to the perception that the contributions are incremental.
