This paper examines the common neighbor heuristic for link prediction in graphs, providing a theoretical analysis of its consistency across various graph classes. The authors also introduce a cleaning step to enhance performance on sparse graphs, which is empirically evaluated using simulated and real-world data. The problem addressed is highly relevant, and the theoretical framework appears to be mathematically rigorous. However, the practical implications remain uncertain due to experimental limitations.
A key concern is that the proposed algorithm relies on several unknown parameters, including the link probability of clusters and cluster sizes. The significance of these parameters and their impact on the algorithm's performance when not optimally chosen are not adequately explained. Furthermore, the cleaning step's effectiveness is demonstrated for semi-sparse graphs, but its consequences when applied inappropriately are not explored, which is crucial given the difficulty of determining sparsity in practice.
The assumption of equal cluster sizes seems overly restrictive, and while the authors suggest this could be relaxed, it is unclear how this would affect the analysis. Relaxing this assumption likely introduces additional unknown parameters, necessitating further clarification. An experiment demonstrating the algorithm's performance with skewed cluster sizes would be beneficial.
Sections 3 and 4 are perplexing due to a lack of clear structure, introducing and intertwining various concepts without clear connections or purposes. For instance, the formulae presented seem disconnected from the surrounding text, and the relationships between subsections such as "current approaches," "common neighbors," and "dependence" are obscure.
Minor issues include a potential copy-and-paste error, the need for clarification on technical terms like "eigenvectors of the graph" and abbreviations such as "w.h.p" and "WLOG," and slight wording adjustments for clarity.
Following the rebuttal, while the authors have addressed concerns regarding algorithm parameters, the necessity of the cleaning step, and cluster numbers, Sections 3 and 4 remain confusing. The score has been adjusted accordingly, with a recommendation for the authors to improve the presentation, clarify the structure, and elaborate on these issues to enhance the paper's quality. The paper's strengths include a solid theoretical analysis of a popular approach, but it is hindered by presentation issues, experimental shortcomings, and questionable practical relevance.
