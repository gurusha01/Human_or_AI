This manuscript presents a novel approach to Bayesian global optimization that eliminates the necessity for d-cover sampling or auxiliary optimization procedures. 
The paper's structure effectively highlights its primary contributions in the main body, facilitating a clear understanding of the proposed method. 
A notable example in section 3.2 serves as a useful illustration of the algorithm, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of its functionality. 
Furthermore, section 3.3 offers a detailed, programmatic explanation of the algorithm, which will be beneficial for future implementations and replications. 
The experimental results are also noteworthy and demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. 
Moreover, the authors successfully integrate concepts from the Bayesian global optimization literature, both with and without continuity estimation, into their work. 
The introduction of Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO) as an algorithm for Bayesian optimization, which does not require auxiliary optimization or d-cover sampling, is a significant contribution. 
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a substantial contribution to the NIPS community, offering a valuable addition to the existing body of research in Bayesian global optimization.
