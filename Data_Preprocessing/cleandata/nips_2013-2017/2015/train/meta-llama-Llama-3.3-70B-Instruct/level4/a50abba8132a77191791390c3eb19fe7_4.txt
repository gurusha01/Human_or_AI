This paper presents several approaches to accelerate the SVRG algorithm, including increasing the batch size, combining SGD and SVRG, and introducing a novel minibatching scheme.
Specific comments: 1. An empirical comparison with a finely calibrated SGD implementation would be a valuable addition. 2. The derivation of the results for the "time to reach Eest + Eopt" for FG and SVRG is unclear, particularly as E_est should only be dependent on 'n', scaling as O(1/n) when alpha equals 1. The emergence of log^2(1/epsilon) and d^2 in the results is not well-explained. Overall, this is a compelling paper that explores multiple enhancements to the SVRG method.
