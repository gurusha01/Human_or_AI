This manuscript introduces a novel upper bound for the mixing time of Gibbs sampling, which is applicable to discrete factor graphs of arbitrary structure. 
In contrast to earlier specialized results, this bound offers a more general framework. However, the bound is not sufficiently tight for quantitative applications, and instead, the authors utilize it qualitatively to provide insights into the mixing behavior of certain real-world networks.
The paper is well-structured and presents a diverse range of methods for analyzing mixing times, with notable details included in the appendix. 
Section 4 explores the relationship between the mixing time of Ising models and hierarchy width, although this assessment remains qualitative rather than quantitative. 
It is worth noting that a theorem from [10] (p201) suggests that the maximum degree, rather than hierarchy width, may be the more relevant factor. 
A visualization of the figure with the maximum degree on the axis would be beneficial for further understanding. 
The authors claim that exact inference is infeasible for real-world networks, as stated on line 418, implying that these networks have high tree-width. 
To strengthen the analysis, the paper should report the tree-width of these networks and compare it to hierarchy width and factor weight. 
Furthermore, it would be useful to examine whether Theorem 2 provides meaningful bounds for real-world networks. 
The related work section appears somewhat disjointed, as many of the cited papers do not focus on mixing time. 
A more targeted approach would be to cite existing research on bounds for mixing time in factor graphs. 
In particular, tighter bounds for special graphs have been established in prior work, such as the bound used by Liu and Domke (2014) in "Projecting Markov Random Fields for Fast Mixing" (Xianghang Liu, Justin Domke, NIPS 2014, http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1119). 
Additionally, there are minor errors in Section 2.1, including the use of 'q' instead of 'Q' in the equations and a typo referencing 'figure 2(a)' instead of 'figure 2(b)'. 
Overall, the manuscript presents new theoretical insights into Gibbs sampling in a clear and thought-provoking manner, although the theory is primarily used in a qualitative context.
