I am curious about the potential trade-offs resulting from the discretization of the time interval (Section 3.1) and whether this approach yields exact results. Similarly, I wonder what implications this discretization would have if applied to Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs).
The overall writing style of the paper is quite dense, which may hinder readability.
A significant portion of the paper (up to line 235, spanning 4.5 pages) is dedicated to explaining prior art, which seems excessive.
In Section 5.1, the results based on simulated data show that the mean of observations from each state is 1.0 apart, with a standard deviation of σ=0.25. Given that the states are 4σ apart, the results from this section exhibit minimal noise. I question how this outcome demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to CTMC.
Additionally, the error metric "2-norm error" is not clearly defined; I assume it refers to the state sequence. As mentioned earlier, it is unclear where the errors in the states originate from.
In Section 2, which provides background information, it would be beneficial to clarify the relative contributions of references [8, 9, 10, 12, and 13] to facilitate a deeper conceptual understanding of the topic for the reader.
A recent paper that should be cited and discussed is "Fast MCMC sampling for Markov jump processes and extensions" by V. Rao and Y. W. Teh (Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2014). This paper proposes two inference schemes for continuous-time hidden Markov models (CT-HMMs) by extending recent inference methods for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). The algorithmic contribution is somewhat novel, and the applications are relevant and moderately novel, particularly in the context of disease progression modeling for the NIPS community. My primary concerns regarding this paper lie in its writing quality and the quality of the results presented.
