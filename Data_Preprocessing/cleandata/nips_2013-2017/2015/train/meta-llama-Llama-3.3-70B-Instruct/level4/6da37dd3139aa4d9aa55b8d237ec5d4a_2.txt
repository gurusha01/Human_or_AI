This manuscript introduces a novel approach to object proposal generation, leveraging stereo-derived depth data to identify potential bounding boxes for pedestrian, car, and cyclist detection in autonomous vehicle applications. The method commences by extracting a point cloud from stereo image pairs and defining a scoring function based on a set of features operating on this point cloud. Notably, the weights within this scoring function are object-specific and are learned through a structured SVM framework. During inference, the scoring function is evaluated across all possible windows that conform to prior expectations of being road-bound. Subsequently, a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) is employed to score the proposed bounding boxes, ultimately detecting the objects of interest.
The proposed method is extensively evaluated on the KITTI dataset, yielding favorable results for the detection of pedestrians, cars, and cyclists when compared to established baselines. The concept presented is intriguing, particularly given the community's interest in enhancing object detection capabilities for self-driving cars, which suggests it would resonate with the audience. The achieved results are indeed commendable.
Typically, object proposal algorithms operate in a category-agnostic manner, with object detection algorithms subsequently evaluating all proposals to identify specific objects. In contrast, this paper's use of object-dependent weights in the scoring function blurs the line between object proposal and detection. The scoring function's inability to effectively rank detected boxes necessitates the use of an RCNN to refine detections and improve average precision. Therefore, it might be beneficial to clarify this distinction within the paper. Furthermore, acknowledging the existence of various 3D object detection algorithms that could serve as additional baselines, such as those utilizing RGBD data for object detection, could enhance the manuscript.
While the results are impressive, the technical innovation presented appears somewhat limited, primarily involving the introduction of depth-based features, exhaustive search during inference, and learning via structured SVM. To strengthen the manuscript, evaluating the method on an additional dataset to demonstrate the generalizability of the features across different datasets would be advantageous. The primary strength of the paper lies in its achievement of excellent detection results for pedestrians, cars, and cyclists on the KITTI dataset. However, the technical novelty, although contributing to the field, seems restrained.
