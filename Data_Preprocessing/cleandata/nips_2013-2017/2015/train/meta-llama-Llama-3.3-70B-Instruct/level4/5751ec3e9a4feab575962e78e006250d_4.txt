This paper presents the development of an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that is constructed by averaging over a data-generating distribution, which leads to impressive results in large data streaming applications.
In terms of quality, there are a few suggestions for improvement. For instance, the phrase "the standard approach to probabilistic modeling" could be rephrased as "the standard approach to Bayesian probabilistic modeling" to provide clarity. Additionally, the notion that Bayesian posteriors become overconfident with more data is initially perplexing, as this is a desirable property of Bayesian inference procedures. However, it is later clarified that the procedure aims to be robust to model specification in a different manner. The claim that explicitly modeling time series incurs a heavy inferential cost could be supported with a citation or evidence. There is also a potential error in the variational distribution in the F-ELBO, with a possible misplaced parenthesis and missing beta. The authors may want to comment on the tradeoffs of marginalizing over the population distribution versus conditioning on a sample from it.
The results primarily focus on prediction rather than parameter estimation, which is suitable for streaming data applications. However, it would be interesting to know more about the parameter estimates, particularly given the goal of maximizing the ELBO or F-ELBO. The F-ELBO provides a nice framework for understanding stochastic variational inference (SVI), but it is unclear what the costs and benefits are of using the generative model for p(X) as an averaging distribution instead of the population distribution.
In terms of clarity, it would be helpful to specify exactly where the problems identified in the introduction lie. The statements regarding Bayesian updating on data streams could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, "The first problem with Bayesian updating on data streams is that Bayesian posteriors will become overconfident" and "The second problem with Bayesian updating on data streams is that the data stream might change over time, causing..."
The paper is original and provides a good justification for SVI. The significance of the paper lies in its innovative approach to handling inference in streaming data scenarios, making it a welcome addition to the community. Despite some questions about the procedure, the paper is a significant and important contribution to the field.
