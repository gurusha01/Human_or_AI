The incorporation of hidden variables in Bayesian networks and chain graphs introduces additional complexity to the processes of parameter learning and inference. However, mixed graphical models can mitigate this issue by utilizing bi-directed edges to eliminate hidden variables while maintaining the conditional independencies inherent to DAG or chain graph representations. Nevertheless, upon applying the latent projection operation to mixed graphs to remove hidden variables, the convergence of bi-directional and undirected edges can occur, leading to challenges in model factorization.
To address this, the concept of segregated graphs is introduced, which aims to preserve the conditional independencies among non-latent random variables in the original DAG or chain graph while avoiding the intersection of undirected and bi-directed edges at any node.
In terms of clarity, the introduction of the paper presents notations that are not explained until the background section, which can hinder the readability of the manuscript.
Regarding significance, it is challenging to assess the impact of the paper without the inclusion of a practical, real-world example and its subsequent evaluation.
A minor error was noted on line 099, where "...B1,Y1..." should be corrected to "...B1,Y2...". The proposed segregated graphs offer a potential solution by preserving conditional independencies among non-latent variables in Bayesian networks or chain graphs, eliminating latent variables without creating nodes where undirected and bi-directed edges converge. Although this approach holds promise, its practical implications and effectiveness are not demonstrated through a concrete example or experimental evaluation, making it difficult to fully appreciate its significance.
