Overall, I found the paper to be compelling, despite some challenges in following the narrative at certain points. The authors successfully transition from a process-based interpretation to a generative model interpretation, consistently emphasizing the primary objective of their proposed methodology. With the addition of comprehensive experiments, I believe this paper has the potential to be outstanding.
The authors have addressed my experimental concerns in their rebuttal, and I expect these details to be incorporated into the final version. The paper introduces a Hybrid MCMC sampler for the Poisson-Kingman mixture model, which leverages the strengths of both conditional and marginal samplers. The authors assert that this approach reduces memory requirements while enhancing mixing. My primary concern lies in the experimental evaluation, as the paper only presents results on a uni-dimensional dataset without investigating the method's performance on higher-dimensional or larger datasets. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimentation demonstrating the significance of the claimed reduction in memory requirements, which is a key motivation for adopting this method. This limitation prevented me from assigning a higher score of 7. I would appreciate it if the authors could provide further commentary on this issue.
