The discussion and annotations surrounding the primary equation, (2), appear to be inaccurate or misleading: 
an expectation is typically defined as a quantity of the form $\sum f(x) p(x)$, where $f(x)$ represents the expected quantity and $p(x)$ denotes the probability measure. 
In equation (2), it is evident that the loss is not the expected quantity. Consequently, the subsequent comment on page 2, second paragraph, which suggests that equation (2) exhibits an "anomaly" due to its non-invariance to loss translation, is technically flawed. Furthermore, Example 1, which relies on this incorrect assumption, understandably does not hold. 
From a practical perspective, the estimator in equation (2) is sensitive to its denominator, $pi$, which can be zero if the sample has never been observed in the prior. In contrast, the modified estimator in equation (7) appears to be an improvement in principle, as the effects of $pi$ are mitigated through the double denominator. 
I hope the authors will consider revising their commentary if the paper is accepted. 
The experimental results demonstrate that Norm-POEM outperforms POEM on all datasets and is comparable to a CRF using full multi-label information. This paper proposes an approach to "counterfactual learning", a specialized scenario within multi-label learning, where instead of receiving ground-truth annotations with 0/1 labels for each class, only the label for one class (i.e., bandit feedback) is provided. However, this serves as a preliminary justification. In essence, the paper aims to improve upon the POEM estimator, recently introduced in reference [1] at ICML 2015. Overall, I find the paper convincing and worthy of publication, although I have raised several remarks in the comments to authors section.
