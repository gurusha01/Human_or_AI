Summary: This manuscript explores the Generalized Lasso under non-linear measurements and Gaussian design, leveraging the concept that non-linear observations can be approximated as noisy linear observations. By extending the work of Plan and Vershynin [17] into an asymptotic regime, the authors derive novel, precise, and explicit error estimation formulas. The validity of their predictions is substantiated through various special cases, including the Lasso, group Lasso, and nuclear norm. Furthermore, the application to designing optimal quantizers in q-Bit Compressed Sensing (CS) and its connection to the Lloyd-Max quantizer offers valuable insights.
Quality: The work presented is of high quality and contributes meaningfully to the field.
Clarity: While the manuscript is generally well-written, there is an imbalance in the treatment of certain topics, likely due to space constraints that prevent the inclusion of all necessary details.
Originality: Building upon the foundation laid by Plan and Vershynin [17], this paper introduces several novel aspects, notably the explicit expressions for performance estimation error, which are new contributions to the field.
Comments:
1) On Page 4, line 193, it is noted that the regularized and penalized versions are equivalent, provided there is an appropriate correspondence between them.
2) The caption of Figure 1 contains a minor error, where 'n=768' should be typeset as '$n$=768' for consistency.
3) A typographical error is present on Page 5, line 247, at the beginning of the sentence 'When ...'.
4) On Page 5, line 294, the term 'proximal function' is more accurately known in convex analysis as the Moreau envelope of index $\tau$. The current notation may cause confusion, as 'prox' typically refers to the proximal point or operator, not the Moreau envelope. It is suggested that the notation be adjusted for clarity.
5) Regarding Assumption 1 on Page 5, providing a more formal interpretation using results from variational analysis could offer additional insight.
6) To maintain precision, the authors should refrain from referring to the Generalized Lasso as an algorithm within the text. More accurately, it is a convex program or, adopting terminology common in Compressed Sensing, a decoder.
7) The experimental section demonstrates the application of the Generalized Lasso to non-linear measurements and shows how the theorems predict the estimation error. Essentially, this work proves that asymptotically, the estimation performance of the Generalized Lasso with non-linear measurements equals that of linear and noisy (Gaussian) measurements. The authors provide novel explicit expressions for the estimation error and validate their findings through multiple special cases, including the Lasso, group Lasso, and nuclear norm, with insightful applications to q-Bit CS and the Lloyd-Max quantizer.
