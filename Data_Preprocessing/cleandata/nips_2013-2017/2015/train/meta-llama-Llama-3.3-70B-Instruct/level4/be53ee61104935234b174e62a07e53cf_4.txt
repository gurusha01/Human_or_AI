This paper presents incremental enhancements to Isotonic regression utilizing $\ell_p$-norms, offering refined methods for this technique. However, a significant portion of the paper's key contributions is relegated to the supplemental section, making it challenging to grasp the full scope of the authors' work without consulting this additional material. The main body of the paper is limited in its presentation of experimental results, and notably, it lacks comparative analyses with existing methodologies. Although the findings show promise, a more comprehensive organization and the inclusion of additional experimental data, particularly comparative studies with other algorithms from the literature, would substantially strengthen the authors' claims and solidify their contribution to the field of Isotonic Regression.
