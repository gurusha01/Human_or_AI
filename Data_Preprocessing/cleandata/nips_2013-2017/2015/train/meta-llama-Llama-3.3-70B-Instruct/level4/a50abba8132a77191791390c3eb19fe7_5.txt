This manuscript presents multiple strategies to enhance the convergence speed of the stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) method, a widely recognized stochastic gradient approach. 
The paper is well-organized and clearly articulated, making it straightforward to comprehend the authors' arguments. It commences with a concise introduction to the SVRG method, followed by a detailed explanation of three distinct approaches aimed at improving its convergence speed.
A pivotal proposition is initially presented, demonstrating that SVRG does not necessitate a highly accurate approximation of the total gradient of the objective function required by the SVRG algorithm. Leveraging this proposition, the authors derive a batched SVRG algorithm that achieves the same convergence rate as the original SVRG. Furthermore, they propose a hybrid stochastic gradient/SVRG approach and provide a corresponding convergence proof. As an alternative acceleration technique, they suggest a speed-up method for the Huberized hinge-loss support vector machine.
In addition to the acceleration strategies and their convergence analysis, the authors extend their analysis to regularized SVRG algorithms, presenting propositions that establish the convergence of mini-batching strategies. The efficacy of their methods is validated through comprehensive simulations, which demonstrate notable improvements.
Aside from a few minor suggestions outlined below, the manuscript is found to be satisfactory and does not require significant revisions. 
Minor Comments: 
* The right-hand side of the inequality on line 77 should include an expectation.
* The question marks appearing in the first line and the middle of page 10 should be corrected.
The subject matter of the paper aligns with the interests of the NIPS community, and both the analysis and simulation results are of high quality.
