Summary of paper:
Historically, matrix completion and robust PCA via nuclear norm minimization shared similar assumptions for successful recovery, including incoherence of the low-rank matrix and uniform randomness in samples or errors. However, a recent breakthrough demonstrated that matrix completion can be achieved through the same convex methods even with non-uniform sampling, provided it is adapted to local coherence. This paper extends this result to robust PCA, showing that exact recovery is possible when errors are non-uniformly random and adapted to local coherences.
Quality:
The result is likely to be significant and of interest to the field. Although the techniques employed are novel and build upon recent matrix completion analysis using local coherence, they are not entirely unprecedented. The experimental results, however, are not thoroughly convincing due to the construction of low-rank matrices with similar local coherences. A more robust evaluation could be achieved by introducing matrices with diverse local coherences, potentially through pre- and post-multiplication with diagonal matrices featuring a wide range of diagonal elements.
Clarity:
The paper is well-written, but its dense nature may pose a challenge to readers due to the complexity of the subject matter.
Originality:
The paper contributes original results by applying the recent understanding of local coherence in matrix completion to the context of robust PCA with non-uniform errors. This extension is a notable innovation in the field.
Significance:
Given the numerous applications of robust PCA, any improvement in its understanding is substantial. While the paper does not introduce a new method, it provides a more refined analysis of an existing popular approach. The empirical significance may be somewhat limited, but the theoretical implications are noteworthy. To further demonstrate the practical impact, it would be beneficial to explore specific examples where non-uniformity naturally occurs and leads to improved recovery, such as in graph clustering problems with clusters of varying sizes. The paper presents intriguing findings on the capability of standard robust PCA algorithms to recover from non-uniform errors adapted to local matrix coherences, with the analysis following recent trends and incorporating innovative elements.
