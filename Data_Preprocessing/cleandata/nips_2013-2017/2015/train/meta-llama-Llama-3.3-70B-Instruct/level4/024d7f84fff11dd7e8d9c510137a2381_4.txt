The authors address the problem of determining policy parameters that minimize a specified risk measure, considering a broad class of risk measures defined by properties such as convexity, monotonicity, and translation invariance. Their approach utilizes a dual representation of coherent risk measures as a convex hull of probability distributions, where the risk of a random variable is calculated as the maximum expected value within this hull. By assuming the family of coherent risk measures has bounded maximum derivatives of the convex hull's borders (M-Lipschitz continuity), the authors derive the optimal policy parameters analytically with respect to the risk measure and propose a general gradient estimation algorithm for both static and dynamic cases.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, allowing a non-expert in risk-sensitive optimization to follow the explanations. The primary contribution lies in the unified analysis of a general class of risk measures, encompassing most well-known measures, which is deemed a significant contribution. However, further empirical analysis of the proposed gradient algorithm would enhance the paper's impact.
Several points require clarification or additional consideration: 
1. The roles of $P_{\theta}$ and $\ksi$ in the preliminaries section need clearer explanation.
2. Equation 2 appears to be the definition of a convex envelope; its restrictive nature compared to Theorem 2.1 warrants explanation.
3. A comment on how the analysis extends to distributions over continuous variables would be beneficial.
4. Mentioning the role of the smoothness of constraint functions in proving Theorem 4.2 in the paper would add clarity.
Overall, this is a strong theoretical paper offering a general framework for risk-sensitive decision-making. While the results are compelling, verification of the proofs is necessary.
