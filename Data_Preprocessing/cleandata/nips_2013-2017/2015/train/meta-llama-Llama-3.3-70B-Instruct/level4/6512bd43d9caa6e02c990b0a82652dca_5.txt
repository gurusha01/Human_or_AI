== SUMMARY ==
This paper establishes that a specific notion of algorithmic stability in learning algorithms is a necessary condition for achieving "uniform generalization". Algorithmic stability is defined probabilistically, implying that the hypothesis output by a randomized learning algorithm should have diminishing dependence on any single example as the training set size increases. Uniform generalization refers to the existence of a minimum training size where the difference between empirical and expected losses is uniformly bounded across all parametric loss functions and data distributions. This condition is stronger than regular generalization, which only requires asymptotic boundedness for a given loss function. The main theorem is interpreted to explain the benefits of methods like dimensionality reduction and dropout, analyze the relationship between domain size and algorithmic stability, and connect algorithmic stability to VC dimension.
Overall, this is a well-crafted and insightful theory paper, with well-placed examples that connect the theory to practical applications. The implications of the main theorem are interesting, particularly the analysis of the effective size of the domain. While the writing is generally good, minor polishing is needed (as detailed in the comments). However, the paper's impact may be limited for practitioners due to the lack of actionable takeaways or proposed new techniques.
== HIGH-LEVEL COMMENTS ==
The term "inference process" in the abstract is misleading, as it typically refers to prediction rather than learning. Clarification or avoidance of this term would improve the paper. It would also be interesting to explore whether stability in the predictor's inference is necessary for generalization.
The main result relies on subtle distinctions between "learnability", "consistency", "uniform convergence", and "(uniform) generalization". The discussion of these concepts could be clearer, and examples illustrating their importance would be helpful. The characterization of "learnability" via excess risk is unconventional and should be explicitly attributed to its source.
The application of the data processing inequality in Theorem 1's proof is confusing. The Markov chain construction and the role of Z_trn need clarification, as the inequalities seem to rely on a different relationship than stated in Lemma 1.

- Lines 19 and 50: "new novel" should be simplified to "new".
- Line 25: "justification to" should be changed to "justification for".
- Lines 34-44: The tutorial-like introduction to machine learning may be too basic for the intended audience.
- Line 40: "such two objectives" should be rephrased as "these two objectives".
- Line 50: The phrase "example to such approach" should be revised to "example of such an approach".
- Line 52: The word "subtle" may not be the best choice; a more precise term could be used.
- Line 55: "such rich theories" should be changed to "these rich theories".
- Line 80: "such result" should be replaced with "this result".
- Line 107: The definition of generalization for a learning algorithm, rather than a hypothesis class, is unconventional and requires a citation.
- Line 197: "we define stability" should be revised to "we define the stability".
- Line 302: The word "bleak" may be too strong; a more nuanced term could be used.
- Line 312: "such notion" should be changed to "this notion".
- Line 422: "vanish" should be corrected to "vanishes".
- Line 424: "choice of the" should be simplified to "choice of".

== POST-RESPONSE ASSESSMENT ==
While the paper's technical soundness and theoretical insights are commendable, its practical impact may be limited due to the lack of novel techniques or actionable recommendations. The relationship between stability and generalization has been established for over a decade, making the high-level message less groundbreaking. Nonetheless, the paper is well-written and offers an interesting theoretical perspective, warranting recommendation for acceptance. The result that algorithmic stability is a necessary condition for uniform generalization is technically sound, albeit somewhat confusing, and the presentation is good, despite the potential lack of practical impact.
