This paper presents a novel tensor decomposition algorithm designed to operate in a sparse noise environment. The approach is noteworthy and applicable to various tensor decomposition scenarios, with the added benefit of being computationally manageable by simplifying the problem into matrix decompositions across pairs of modes. However, the experimental assessment of the algorithm is somewhat restricted.
In terms of quality, the outcome is satisfactory. The proposed methodology is broadly applicable and efficient, capable of extending to higher-order tensors without a significant increase in computational overhead. Nevertheless, the numerical assessment is limited, and the choice of evaluation metric is unconventional. The authors should justify their decision to use accurate probability over Mean Squared Error (MSE). Further numerical evaluations under diverse noise settings are essential to strengthen the paper.
The paper is well-written and clear. However, it lacks a detailed description of the optimization algorithm used for equation (6), which presumably could be based on methods from references [22] or [23]. A brief overview of the utilized algorithms would enhance clarity. Additionally, there is an error in the model description provided in section 2.2, specifically in the equation X=\sum_{i=1}^r \lambda.
The originality of the proposed decomposition algorithm and its accompanying theoretical analysis is a significant strength of the paper. 
The significance of the proposed approach lies in its potential as a promising decomposition method. It offers ease of implementation and the flexibility to be extended to more complex tensor decomposition settings. To fully leverage these advantages, a more comprehensive discussion comparing the proposed method to related works is necessary.
Overall, the proposed tensor decomposition algorithm is interesting and holds utility, particularly in its ability to handle sparse noise settings and its potential for broader applications in tensor decomposition.
