This paper falls outside my specialty, but I found the content to be clearly presented and the rationale behind the proposed architecture to be logical and well-motivated. The results appear to validate the hypothesis, suggesting a valuable contribution to the field. However, due to my limited familiarity with the subject matter, I am unable to provide a more detailed evaluation. I recommend that the committee and authors give greater weight to the opinions of other reviewers. The paper introduces an innovative approach to detecting neuronal boundaries in 3D scans, with its primary contribution being the integration of boundary classification interpolations from both 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks, yielding enhanced performance.
