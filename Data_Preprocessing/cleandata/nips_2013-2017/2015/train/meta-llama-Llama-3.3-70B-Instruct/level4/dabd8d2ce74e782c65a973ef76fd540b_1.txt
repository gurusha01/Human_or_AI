The authors present an analysis of statistical preference learning methods for ordered data, establishing recovery guarantees under the condition of a low-rank underlying parameter matrix. The manuscript is well-structured and effectively addresses key technical concerns, although it falls short in providing adequate empirical assessment. The results rely on the concept of restricted strong convexity, based on fairly standard assumptions. Moreover, the authors provide both upper and lower bounds for their analysis, indicating that the proposed sample complexity is nearly optimal under the given assumptions.
The manuscript integrates models for collaborative ranking and bundle choice modeling within the framework of collaborative preference learning. However, the transition between these two models seems somewhat disjointed, and the authors might have benefited from focusing on a single problem class. 
I recommend that the authors consider supplementing their work with additional experimental evaluations. For example, comparing the proposed approach empirically to other existing methods would be beneficial in assessing real-world performance and evaluating the robustness of the proposed approach to model mis-specification. Notably, the bundled choice modeling problem lacks experimental evaluation, which further supports the suggestion to focus on one problem class.
Minor comments include: On line 124, clarification is needed regarding the definition of S{i,1} when l is indexed from 1, as v{i,0} is undefined. The claim in equation (6) requires further explanation for clarity. Additionally, line 288 notes that removing the row mean generally increases the rank of Theta by 1; thus, the results in Fig 1 should be revised or it should be demonstrated that the rank of the de-meaned parameter remains unchanged. 
Overall, while the manuscript provides a solid theoretical foundation, the inclusion of more empirical results would significantly enhance its impact, given the practical nature of the field.
