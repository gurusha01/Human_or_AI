This manuscript builds upon the foundation established in the NIPS'14 paper [17] by deriving upper bounds for the maximum influence and lower bounds for the time to reach the critical point of diffusion across networks. A key innovation lies in the utilization of the Laplacian Hazard matrix, which incorporates the Laplace transform of the transmission rate function, effectively extending the hazard matrix concept presented in [17]. This approach enables a relationship to be established between the extent of influence, quantified by the number of infected nodes, and the spectral radius of the Laplacian Hazard matrix.
The authors further illustrate the applicability of their framework by examining specific scenarios characterized by distinct transmission probabilities over time, including constant, exponential, and SI/SIR models. The introduced insight and the ensuing bounds constitute a novel contribution. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly presented.
Although the accompanying proofs appear plausible, they have not been thoroughly verified. Due to the complexity of the arguments and the potential for misunderstandings, the confidence in this evaluation is accordingly modest. Nonetheless, this work represents a theoretical advancement that not only offers novel bounds but also demonstrates their tightness through simulation, suggesting potential applications in algorithm development and experimental design, although these aspects are not explored within the paper itself.
