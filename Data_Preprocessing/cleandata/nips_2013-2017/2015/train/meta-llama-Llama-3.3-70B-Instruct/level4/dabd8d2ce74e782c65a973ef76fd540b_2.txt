This paper presents a novel approach to inference for low-rank matrix factorization models with ordinal data, along with an additional application. However, it is unclear whether the authors' contribution lies solely in the inference approach, specifically nuclear norm minimization, or if the application of MultiNomialLogit (MNL) models to these problems is also a contribution.
The authors provide theoretical performance guarantees for their approach but fail to demonstrate its effectiveness using real or synthetic data. The theoretical foundations appear to be sound, indicating a good quality of work. Nevertheless, the clarity of the paper is compromised due to significant editing issues, both minor and major, affecting the flow of ideas within sections.
The discussion of the implications of the contributions is lacking. The originality of the work is mediocre, as low-rank matrix factorization has been extensively explored from various angles, making the contribution seem incremental. The significance of the paper is poor, primarily because it does not compare its method to established matrix factorization techniques, either empirically or theoretically.
Several detailed points require attention. For instance, the abstract contains awkward phrasing, such as "A popular discrete choice model of multinomial logit model captures..." The sequence of ideas in the introduction is convoluted, starting with motivating applications but then focusing solely on theoretical contributions without justification for their importance or impact on applications.
Furthermore, there are editing mistakes, such as the lack of a comma after "applications" and inconsistent capitalization of "MultiNomialLogit model." The use of parallel structure in lists is also inconsistent. The introduction could be improved by focusing on a single, novel example, such as bundling, and saving the other example for the experiments or results section.
The contribution section lacks clarity regarding whether MNL models have been applied to ordinal low-rank matrix factorization before. It is crucial to clarify if the novelty lies in the application of MNL to ordinal data or in the new inference approach for existing models.
The practical implications of the theorems and their corollaries in Sections 3 and 4 are unclear and could be highlighted through empirical results or clearer explanations. The single figure provided does not significantly enhance understanding, and the introduction of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) seems abrupt and not ideally suited for rank-based item recommendation.
The discussion section reads like a future to-do list rather than providing a clear takeaway for the reader. The paper needs thorough editing to improve clarity and should include comparisons with other methods using real or synthetic data to justify the contributions and their potential impact.
