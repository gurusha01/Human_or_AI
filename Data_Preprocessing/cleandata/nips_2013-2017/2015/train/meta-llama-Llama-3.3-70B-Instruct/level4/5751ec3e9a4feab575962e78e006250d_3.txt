This paper presents a population Bayesian inference approach for stream data, aiming to enhance model flexibility through the introduction of a population distribution and population posterior. The authors propose stochastic population variational inference for learning model parameters. 
Experimental results are provided, comparing the performance of the proposed method with stream VB and stochastic VB. However, several concerns require attention: 
1) A clearer justification for the necessity of incorporating a population distribution is needed to strengthen the methodology.
2) The paper suggests that population VB can capture changes in the data stream, but it is unclear how it differs from SVI when all data points are treated equally from the current dataset. Furthermore, the sampling procedure's ability to capture current stream changes without prioritizing recent data points is questionable.
3) While the population distribution and additional parameters may yield a more flexible model, this increased complexity comes at the cost of higher computational overhead due to the sampling procedure and the need for additional parameter tuning. The authors should provide quantitative comparisons of computation times for all three methods across the datasets and offer guidance on selecting the parameter.
4) The inferior performance of population VB compared to stream VB on the Twitter dataset warrants explanation, as the proposed population Bayesian inference methodology lacks technical rigor.
