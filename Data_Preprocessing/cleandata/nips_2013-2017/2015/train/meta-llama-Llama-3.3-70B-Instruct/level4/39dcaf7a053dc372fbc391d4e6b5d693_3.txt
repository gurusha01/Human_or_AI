This paper presents a novel deep convolutional network architecture for segmenting neurons in EM image stacks, distinguished by its unique filter arrangement in deep networks and the incorporation of 3D filters. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and of high quality. The authors demonstrate an improvement over existing methods, and the application of this research has significant implications for the field of neuroscience. Although the paper may not introduce groundbreaking new concepts beyond its detailed architectural design, its overall contribution warrants presentation. The novelty, while subtle and residing in the specifics, contributes to a solid paper that enhances the current state of knowledge in the field.
