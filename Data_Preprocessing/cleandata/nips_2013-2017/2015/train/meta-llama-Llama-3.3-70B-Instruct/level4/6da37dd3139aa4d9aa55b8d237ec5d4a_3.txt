The 3D object proposal problem has received relatively limited attention compared to its 2D counterpart, and this paper makes a significant contribution by developing an effective approach tailored to this task, which distinctly diverges from conventional 2D methods such as superpixel grouping, as exemplified by Selective Search.
In terms of evaluation, the paper successfully compares its approach to state-of-the-art methods. However, a notable omission is the lack of evaluation in 3D space, as all detections are assessed using 2D bounding boxes, despite the paper's focus on 3D object proposal.
Although the paper concentrates on leveraging contextual models specific to autonomous driving, it would be intriguing to explore the generalizability of this approach to other domains, such as indoor RGB-D scanning. The underlying task shares similarities, and the paper's utilization of object size priors, ground plane, free space, point cloud densities, and distance to the ground would remain highly relevant in general indoor RGB-D scenes. Nevertheless, indoor scenes pose additional challenges, including increased clutter and a broader range of object categories. Applying the proposed approach to indoor RGB-D scenes would also facilitate a more equitable comparison with MCG-D, which is designed for indoor RGB-D scans and does not employ similarly strong domain-specific contextual models. Consequently, extending the approach to indoor RGB-D scenes would substantially enhance the paper. The development of a novel and effective 3D object proposal approach, distinct from popular 2D methods like Selective Search, is a significant achievement. To further strengthen the paper, I recommend incorporating 3D evaluation and demonstrating the approach's generalizability by applying it to indoor RGB-D scans.
