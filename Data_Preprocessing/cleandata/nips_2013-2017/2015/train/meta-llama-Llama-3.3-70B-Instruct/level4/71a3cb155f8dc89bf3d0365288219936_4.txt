This manuscript is well-organized and clearly presented, with meticulously defined notation, making it a delightful read. The theoretical framework builds upon existing work, notably extending the alternating projection algorithm for conventional precision matrix estimation. A key takeaway is the established equivalence between the tensor normal distribution and a multi-dimensional normal distribution, specifically vec(T)~ N(vec(0); ΣK ⊗...⊗ Σ1), which warrants greater emphasis to facilitate understanding, particularly for readers familiar with standard precision matrix estimation results. However, a notable limitation is the lack of compelling motivation for the adoption of this more complex, albeit refined, model in practical scenarios. Despite this, I advocate for the paper's acceptance due to its significant theoretical contributions. The authors propose an alternating minimization algorithm that yields local optima for the precision matrices of a tensor normal distribution, effectively generalizing the standard sparse precision matrix estimation problem. Overall, I recommend acceptance based on the paper's technical merits and contributions to the field.
