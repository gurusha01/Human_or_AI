The authors examine a risk-averse Markov decision process framework, incorporating both static and dynamically consistent risk measures. A key contribution of this work is the derivation of the gradient form for both dynamic and static settings.
This paper builds upon previous studies that focused exclusively on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), offering a broader perspective. Although this extension is relatively modest, it constitutes a useful addition to the field. The findings can be seen as a straightforward extension of policy gradient methods in risk-neutral contexts.
The manuscript is well-structured, clearly written, and accessible to readers. The mathematical results appear to be accurate, based on my assessment.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include:
- In Theorem 2.1, the notation $\xi P_\theta$ may be perplexing. It might be beneficial to consult Theorem 6.6 in reference [26] and adopt a similar notation for clarity.
- On line 141, there is a minor typo ("enevlop" instead of "envelope").
- In Section 3, it would be helpful to note that Markov decision processes with Markov risk measures are generally tractable. The intractability of the problem presented in this paper stems from the policy parametrization, rather than the risk measure itself. Overall, the paper presents a solid, albeit minor, extension of existing research, providing a valuable contribution to the field.
