This manuscript builds upon existing research by providing a precise characterization of the statistical performance of the l2-lasso in the context of single-index models, while also relaxing the conventional Gaussian assumption on the prior distribution of x_0. This contribution is valuable to the field of lasso-type estimators, offering insights into their asymptotic behavior.
The manuscript is well-written; however, several points warrant attention:
1. As noted by Brillinger (1982), the single-index model can be equivalently represented as a linear model with a scaled unknown signal and non-standard noise. Although this connection is rigorously established in Appendix A, it would be beneficial to mention it in the main text to provide heuristic justification for the statement in the blockquote on line 140, enhancing the manuscript's clarity.
2. The focus of the manuscript is on the l2-lasso, also referred to as the square root-lasso. A key advantage of the l2-lasso over the more commonly used l2^2-lasso is that the "oracle" value of the regularization parameter is independent of the noise variance (sigma), which is typically unknown. The results presented could shed light on the practical implications of this advantage, specifically whether the justification for preferring the l2-lasso over the l2^2-lasso holds in practice.
Overall, the manuscript contributes meaningfully to the literature on the asymptotic behavior of lasso-type estimators by extending the analysis of the l2-lasso to single-index models.
