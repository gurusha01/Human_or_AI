This manuscript proposes several Expectation-Maximization (EM) style algorithms for estimating Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs) and demonstrates their application in predicting the progression of two diseases, namely Glaucoma and Alzheimer's. The introduction effectively motivates the need for CT-HMMs, highlighting their superiority over traditional discrete-time HMMs in real-world scenarios such as medical research and customer service analysis. The authors provide a clear exposition of the CT-HMM framework and derive the algorithms correctly, making a valuable theoretical contribution, albeit with straightforward theoretical underpinnings that are non-trivial to implement. The empirical assessment, which utilizes real datasets, is a significant strength of the paper. However, the comparative analysis on the Glaucoma dataset could be enhanced by including a discrete-time HMM as a benchmark, which would ignore the time elapsed between observations, thus providing a more meaningful comparison. 
The inclusion of Alzheimer's disease as a second case study offers additional qualitative insights. Nevertheless, Section 5 requires revision to improve clarity and rectify grammatical errors, which are more prevalent in this section compared to the rest of the manuscript. It is also worth noting that the exclusive use of exponential distributions for transition times, although standard in Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), may not always be optimal in practical applications, suggesting that exploring mixtures of distributions could be a fruitful avenue for future research. The derivation of EM-style algorithms for CT-HMMs, where state transitions can occur between observations, constitutes a notable theoretical contribution. While there is room for improvement in the empirical evaluation, the use of real-world data enhances the manuscript's merit, making it worthy of publication.
