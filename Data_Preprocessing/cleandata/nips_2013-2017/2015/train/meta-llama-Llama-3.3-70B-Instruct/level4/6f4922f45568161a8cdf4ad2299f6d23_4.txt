This paper, titled "Covariance-Controlled Adaptive Langevin Thermostat for Large-Scale Bayesian Sampling," introduces a novel approach to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling for Bayesian inference, specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of stochastic gradient sampling methods. By building upon previous work in scalable MCMC, the proposed method, known as the covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat, aims to reduce parameter-dependent noise, thereby accelerating convergence to the target invariant distribution of the Markov chain and generating beneficial samples more efficiently. The method is positioned for use in large-scale machine learning settings, particularly in Bayesian inference involving a large number of observations, similar to other stochastic gradient MCMC methods.
The experiments conducted on three distinct models—a normal-gamma model, Bayesian logistic regression, and a discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine—demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over two existing methods: stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) and stochastic gradient Nose-Hoover thermostat (SGNHT). However, it is noteworthy that the comparisons are limited to these two methods, suggesting a potential oversight in not including other recently developed mini-batch MCMC methods or methods that do not rely on stochastic gradients in the analysis.
One potential area for improvement lies in the presentation of results. For instance, Figure 1 includes inset "peaks" that contribute minimally to the understanding of the figure, appearing to offer only a slight zoom into the data already presented in the main figure. Furthermore, there are several instances where the writing could be clarified. The abstract contains sentences that are somewhat ambiguous, such as the mention of utilizing computational benefits of stochastic gradient methods without clear context. The introduction presents stochastic gradient methods in an unusual order, first discussing the collective existing methods and then delving into the specifics of the first developed method. Additionally, in Section 2, terms like "temperature" and "Boltzmann constant" are introduced without sufficient explanation, which could confuse a machine learning audience not familiar with these concepts.
In conclusion, while this paper makes a valid contribution to the field of stochastic gradient MCMC methods by combining the benefits of SGHMC and SGNHT and demonstrating improved performance, the advancements are somewhat incremental. The paper could be strengthened by including comparisons with a broader range of recently developed methods and refining the writing to enhance clarity and accessibility for the intended audience. The importance of developing better methods for scalable Bayesian inference is underscored, and this work represents a step in that direction, albeit with room for further expansion and refinement.
