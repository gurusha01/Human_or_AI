This study represents a logical progression of existing CNN-based object detection methods. However, several concerns need to be addressed:
1. The optimization process appears to involve only a single iteration of alternating optimization between the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN). This raises questions, as it implies that the proposals generated by the initial RPN iteration are optimal, which is unlikely to be the case.
2. When applying the pixel-wise sliding window to the top layer of the CNN, it is crucial to clarify the step size on the image layer. Given that the CNN undergoes multiple rounds of max-pooling, the top layer features are significantly downscaled compared to the input image. Consequently, the sliding window on the top layer may correspond to large steps on the image level, potentially leading to inaccurate bounding box locations.
3. The definition of $h_a$ in lines 173 and 174 requires clarification to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the methodology.
The proposed approach involves a two-stage object detection algorithm leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The initial stage, region proposal, adapts the traditional sliding window method to operate on the top-layer feature map of the CNN, termed as the Region Proposal Network (RPN). The second stage applies a fast R-CNN to the proposed regions. By sharing convolutional layers between the RPN and R-CNN and utilizing GPU acceleration, the algorithm achieves near real-time performance at 5 frames per second.
