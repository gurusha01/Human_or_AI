The paper introduces a novel formula for static coherent risks, enabling the analytical derivation of policy gradients for various common risk measures. Additionally, it presents a sampling-based algorithm for cases lacking analytical solutions and demonstrates consistency guarantees for policy gradient estimates. The paper also provides expressions for policy gradients of Markov coherent dynamic risk measures.
In terms of significance and quality, the unified derivation of policy gradients for coherent risk measures is a valuable and innovative contribution to the literature on risk-sensitive decision making. However, analytical solutions for Lagrangian saddle-points are limited to specific risk measures. The proposed sample-based approximation scheme offers a potential solution for general coherent risk measures by bypassing the need for analytical saddle-point derivations. Nevertheless, the paper lacks empirical evidence to support the viability of the proposed estimation scheme in practice. A comparative experimental analysis between sample-based and analytical policy gradients in different problems, such as CVaR, would be highly beneficial.
Regarding originality, the derived policy gradients appear to be novel in their general form, to the best of my knowledge.
The paper's clarity is generally good, but its overall clarity is compromised by the numerous issues addressed within the eight-page limit. Specifically, the presentation of dynamic risk policy gradients in Section 5 is overly concise, lacking algorithmic details and experimental evaluations, which hinders the reader's ability to assess the practical viability of the derived policy gradients. This content may be more suitable for a longer journal publication. Alternatively, focusing on static risk measures could make the paper more self-contained, allowing for more detailed and comprehensive empirical evaluations beyond the basic toy example provided. While the paper has potentially far-reaching results, the lack of thorough experimental evaluations makes it challenging to judge its merits. A narrower focus could help address the clarity issues stemming from space constraints.
