The authors present a method to determine sparse projection bases that optimize the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between distributions, a concept that has garnered limited attention in component analysis, with the notable exception of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as explored in [A]. They formulate a non-convex optimization problem and employ an alternating optimization technique to solve it. Experimental results indicate a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, although the importance of these experiments is somewhat difficult for me to assess fully. Following the rebuttal, I am convinced that this work meets the standards of NIPS and thus recommend its acceptance. The approach outlined in the paper, which seeks to maximize EMD between distributions through sparse projection bases, contributes to an area with limited prior exploration, utilizing an alternating optimization procedure. While the experiments demonstrate promising advancements, their full impact is challenging to evaluate. Nonetheless, I support the paper's acceptance.
