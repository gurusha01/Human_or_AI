This paper presents a novel approach to training neural networks with multiple stacked layers, introducing the concept of "information highways" to facilitate efficient learning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea, leading to improved classification accuracy. 
In terms of quality, the proposed concept appears to be innovative, and the experimental framework is robust. However, the analysis sections could benefit from a more diverse range of details or visual illustrations to enhance comprehension.
The paper's clarity is commendable, as the primary messages are conveyed effectively and are easily understandable. 
The originality of the proposed method is noteworthy, despite being an extension of existing neural network techniques. 
The significance of this work is evident, given the growing need to train increasingly deeper neural networks to achieve better outcomes in various application areas. 
The authors describe an effective methodology for training very deep neural networks using 'information highways', which involve establishing direct connections to higher layers. Although this approach builds upon prior techniques, such as cross-layer connections, the experimental evidence provided demonstrates its efficacy. The contributions made by this paper are novel and well-substantiated by empirical results.
