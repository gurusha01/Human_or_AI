This paper presents a novel approach to the rank elicitation problem in the dueling bandits setting, utilizing a (Budgeted) Quick-Sort algorithm that assumes observations follow a Plackett-Luce distribution. Theoretical and empirical analyses are conducted under this assumption, providing insights into the model's performance.
Although the overall concept is intriguing, several concerns arise, primarily regarding the model's restrictiveness. In comparison to related work on Dueling Bandits, the current model is analyzed under a stringent assumption of being generated from a Plackett-Luce model. Given that both theoretical and empirical analyses rely on this assumption, it is unclear how significant the impact will be in relation to existing algorithms. Investigating the model's robustness to minor deviations from the Plackett-Luce assumption, even through limited analysis or experimentation, would have substantially enhanced the paper's value, as real-world data rarely adheres to such a specific distribution. Additionally, incorporating ranking metrics to assess performance in the AMPR problem, beyond optimal recovery rate, would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of error patterns. The application of QuickSort to the dueling bandits problem is noteworthy; however, the limiting model assumptions raise questions about the approach's overall impact.
