This manuscript presents a straightforward greedy approach to addressing the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem within the context of a streaming model. It introduces a stochastic framework for generating input hypergraphs and demonstrates the necessary conditions for the asymptotic identification of latent clusters in hypergraphs produced by this model.
The investigation of this problem is both intriguing and significant. The proposed stochastic model for graph generation appears novel and captivating. It is noteworthy to observe that, under specific conditions, the min-max graph partitioning problem can be substantially recovered.
However, a primary concern revolves around the realism of the stochastic model employed for graph generation: Is the inherent co-clustering assumption regarding data generation reflective of real-world scenarios? Further justification for the natural applicability of this model to practical situations would be beneficial.
Additionally, the authors should consider citing a pertinent recent paper that explores the same min-max graph partitioning problem and proposes an offline greedy algorithm similar to the one presented in this work. The offline algorithm boasts a time complexity of O(k|E|), where k represents the number of partitions and |E| denotes the number of edges in the bipartite graph. A comparative empirical analysis between the streaming greedy algorithm and the offline greedy algorithm would be enlightening.

Minor observations include:
- Lines 168-171: The argument seems to suggest that random graph partitioning yields suboptimal performance. However, it only demonstrates a cost of (1-1/e)m without clarifying the global optimum.
- Description of Alg 1 (Lines 216-225): The notation used in Alg 1 is somewhat confusing. Initially, Si is defined as the assignment of items, implying that Si should represent the set of items in block i. Nevertheless, S_i appears to refer to the set of topics covered by items in block i within the algorithm description, which is perplexing.
This paper contributes by proposing a simple greedy strategy for the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem under the streaming model and defining a stochastic model for generating the input hypergraph, which demonstrates sufficient conditions for the asymptotic recovery of hidden clusters.
