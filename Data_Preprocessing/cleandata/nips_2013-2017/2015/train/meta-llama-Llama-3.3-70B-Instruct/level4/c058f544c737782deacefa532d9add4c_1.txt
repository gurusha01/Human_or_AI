This paper demonstrates the linear convergence of four variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm under relaxed conditions compared to existing research.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-structured and presents intriguing findings, making it a suitable contribution to NIPS as it significantly advances our understanding of the Frank-Wolfe procedure, which is gaining importance, particularly for submodular problems.
The clarity of the paper is commendable overall. However, for an 8-page NIPS version, it would be beneficial to include a descriptive description of the variants in the main text, reserving the precise algorithmic details for the appendix. Currently, the differences between the variants are somewhat difficult to discern, requiring the reader to refer to the text for clarification. The intuition section is notably useful.
Regarding originality, this paper's primary innovative contribution, in this reviewer's opinion, lies in its presentation of a unified perspective on various existing Frank-Wolfe variants and the provision of a unified proof of their convergence.
As for significance, this paper will serve as a valuable reference for Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants. Given the renewed interest in first-order methods that exploit problem structure within the machine learning community, this work could be of considerable interest to the NIPS audience. By establishing linear convergence for four Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants under weaker conditions than previously reported, the paper not only unifies existing results but also sets new convergence guarantees, thereby enhancing our understanding of these algorithms.
