This manuscript proposes a robust linear regression approach analogous to Least Trimmed Squares, but tailored for graphical lasso, aiming to enhance the original graphical lasso's resilience to outliers. 
The core concept revolves around improving the graphical lasso method to make it more robust against outliers. 
A significant theoretical contribution of this work is the analysis demonstrating that, despite the non-convex nature of the method with a biconvex objective, consistency results can be achieved for any local minimum, thus providing a robust foundation.
However, in Section C-4, the parameters tao1 and tao2 appear to be used without prior definition.
A notable weakness of the paper lies in its experimental results. 
Including sensitivity versus 1-specificity plots in the supplementary material, with both axes scaled from 0 to 1, would be beneficial for a more comprehensive evaluation.
As the plots currently stand, it is challenging to ascertain the extent of the trimmed graphical lasso's performance improvement. 
Upon examining the existing plots, it seems that the difference may not be substantial.
Furthermore, for the trimmed graphical lasso, the considered 100h/n ratios of 80, 85, and 90 imply a relatively low number of outliers.
A more compelling result would be to demonstrate that as the number of outliers increases, the trimmed graphical lasso's performance distinguishes itself more significantly from other methods, particularly the classical graphical lasso. 
This paper introduces the Trimmed Graphical Lasso method, which selectively trims less reliable samples to enhance robustness against outliers. 
The primary contribution is the provision of statistical guarantees for the consistency of the estimator. 
While the experimental results indicate competitiveness with existing methods, they fail to conclusively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
