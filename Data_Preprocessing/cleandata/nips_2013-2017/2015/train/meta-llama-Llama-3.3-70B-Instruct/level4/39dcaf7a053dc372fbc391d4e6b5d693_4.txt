This manuscript presents a novel 2D-3D convolutional neural network architecture for identifying neuronal boundaries in three-dimensional electron microscopic brain images. Unlike conventional convolutional networks, this approach leverages both 2D and 3D filters to capture information from EM image sequences. During training, a recursive strategy is employed to learn 3D features from 2D initialization, and Zero-inflated Negative binomial Network (ZNN) is utilized for enhanced computational efficiency. The methodology is validated on cortical images, yielding a lower error rate compared to base2D and VD2D models.
The manuscript is generally well-structured and clear, with the proposed methodology exhibiting innovation in neuronal boundary detection and potential applicability to other sequential data, such as video frames.
However, the experimental section requires strengthening. While the 2D-3D model outperforms 2D models in boundary detection accuracy, additional experiments, including comparisons with state-of-the-art boundary detection methods, are necessary.
Overall, the manuscript is engaging and well-written. Nonetheless, further comparisons with existing state-of-the-art techniques in neuronal boundary detection are essential to fully demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed methodology in this specific application domain.
