The authors assert that the effective receptive field of each unit increases as T becomes larger (Line 174, Page 4), which is unclear to me. When a static image is fed into the network, it is not apparent how the receptive field of each unit can expand with a larger T; a clarification on this point would be beneficial. The paper presents a recurrent convolutional layer designed to enhance the performance of CNNs in scene image parsing, with a technically robust algorithm and promising results.
