The authors present a concept termed "on the job learning", wherein annotators receive requests between example presentation and prediction output. 
Although the algorithm's functionality is well-explained for structured prediction tasks, where sequence elements are queried, its application to the face recognition task is unclear - specifically, whether the instance itself was being queried. In non-structured settings, the model does not propagate information between adjacent examples, which raises questions about the utility function's relevance.
The threshold baseline employs two parameters with unclear origins and arbitrary values. It would be beneficial to know the source of these values and the model's sensitivity to them.
An additional baseline, such as uncertainty sampling commonly used in active learning, could provide further insights.
The authors emphasize the distinction between this setting and active online learning; however, active learning can be adapted to this domain by treating the sequence as the active set. For instance, the model could be updated upon receiving responses and then output a prediction. While this approach may not capture the task's temporal aspects, it can leverage existing theory for selecting the query set. Overall, the framework appears novel, but some details are unclear, and its applicability seems limited.
