This manuscript exhibits some areas for improvement, including a redundant abstract formulation (line 49) and a misplaced parenthesis (line 72). Although the reviewer lacks expertise in Genetic Programming (GP) and global optimization, making the assessment somewhat speculative, the paper appears to be well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear didactic tone. The effective use of graphical illustrations enhances the explanation of the procedures. Theoretical and experimental results presented in the paper seemingly provide conclusive evidence of the superiority of the authors' approach, suggesting a strong contribution to the field.
