This paper demonstrates the universality of a modified version of a recently introduced kernel for persistence diagrams, a common tool for encoding the persistent homology of data. The universality of this kernel enables its application in kernelized hypothesis testing, which is utilized to investigate the topology of the underlying data space for both synthetic and real datasets.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, although it could benefit from being more self-contained. The content is sound and intriguing, as it explores the novel application of kernel methods to topological data analysis, with the exception of a recently published kernel that reduces the novelty of the current work. The experimental validation, however, does not provide sufficient insight into whether the proposed method improves upon the current state-of-the-art, as it lacks comparison with other existing methods. Nonetheless, the paper has the potential to stimulate interesting discussions within the NIPS community.
Completeness
A more in-depth discussion of topological data analysis, particularly focusing on persistence diagrams and Wasserstein distances, would be beneficial, as these topics are not widely covered at NIPS. The authors are encouraged to include this in the final version, potentially by condensing the current discussion of related work, which primarily focuses on the computation of means of persistence diagrams. Definitions of key terms, such as "birth-death bounded," should also be included to increase the paper's accessibility to a broader audience.
Proposition 2
The proof of Proposition 2 raises a question regarding the equivalence of f(\mathcal{R}) and \mathcal{S}, which may be attributed to the omission of the definition of "birth-death bounded."
Experiments
The inclusion of a comparison with other methods, such as permutation tests evaluating means or variances of datasets with respect to the Wasserstein distance, or a comparison to shape analysis of surfaces in Section 4.2, would be valuable. The current experimental validation does not provide clear evidence of the method's improvement over the state-of-the-art.
TYPOS
Line 094: "form" should be replaced with "from."
On page 3, the reference to [13] should be introduced when discussing MMD, as this is not a contribution of the paper.
Line 222: "an function" should be corrected to "a function."
Overall, the paper is interesting and well-written, proving the universality of a variant of a previously published kernel for topological data analysis. However, the novelty is somewhat limited, and the experimental validation lacks comparison with other methods.
