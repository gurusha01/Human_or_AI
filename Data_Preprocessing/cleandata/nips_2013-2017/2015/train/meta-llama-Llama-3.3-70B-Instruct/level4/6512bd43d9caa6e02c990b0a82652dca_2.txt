SUMMARY
This manuscript introduces a novel concept of algorithmic stability, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to uniform generalization, and explores its implications on various aspects of generalization, including techniques for controlling algorithmic stability, the richness of the hypothesis space, and the size of the input space.
CONTRIBUTIONS
* The paper proposes a notion of algorithmic stability that corresponds to uniform generalization, providing a foundation for understanding the relationship between stability and generalization.
* The authors offer theoretical justifications for popular learning strategies used to improve algorithmic stability, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that drive generalization.
* The work strengthens the understanding of generalization by elucidating the interplay between the input space, hypothesis space, and learning algorithm, laying the groundwork for future research on techniques to enhance generalization, such as hold-out set validation, regularization, and dimensionality reduction.
These contributions significantly advance the understanding of generalization and have the potential to lead to interesting future work that delves deeper into the mechanisms underlying various techniques used to increase generalization. The introduction of a stability notion equivalent to uniform generalization is a challenging task, and the paper's achievements in this regard are substantial.
SUPPORT
The proofs presented in the paper are correct, straightforward, and easy to follow, providing a solid foundation for the claims made. The theoretical results underpinning the justifications for techniques that improve generalization are well-founded, and the proof sketches are informative without disrupting the flow of the exposition.
TECHNICAL QUALITY
The manuscript is technically sound, with the consequences of the central results well-explored. Notably, the authors define stability in terms of expectation rather than high-probability bounds, which, while allowing for the derivation of low-probability bounds via Markov's inequality, raises questions about the feasibility of obtaining high-probability bounds without specifying a particular algorithm.
ORIGINALITY
Although the paper appears to be well-positioned within the existing literature, a comprehensive assessment of its originality is challenging due to limited familiarity with related work in the area of stability.
CLARITY
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and proofs that make this theoretically oriented work accessible. However, based on feedback from other reviewers, there may be room for improvement in terms of clarity to ensure that the content is universally understandable.
FOR THE REBUTTAL
The authors are requested to address the issue of expectation bounds versus high-probability bounds, specifically whether high-probability bounds can be achieved without fixing an algorithm, and to discuss the significance of the expectation bounds as a contribution. Additionally, commentary on the relationship between the proposed definition of stability and existing definitions, as raised by other reviewers, would be beneficial.
DETAILED COMMENTS
The proposed definition of stability is intriguing, as it can be interpreted as the algorithm's output not being overly dependent on any single example. However, its relation to existing definitions, such as those involving the removal or substitution of observations, warrants further exploration. The consideration of Shannon Entropy of the output hypothesis in algorithm design, as opposed to merely the size of the hypothesis space, is also noteworthy, particularly in light of challenges associated with bad ERM learners in multiclass classification scenarios.
The concepts presented in Definition 8 align with the losses used to demonstrate the necessity of stability for uniform generalization, prompting the question of whether this implies that classification, with its 0-1 loss, represents a particularly challenging problem from the perspective of stability and generalization.

POST-REBUTTAL REMARKS
The discussion highlights a limited understanding of the connections between different notions of stability, including stability by conditioning, observation elimination, and observation switching. The authors' definition appears to have been developed as a tool to achieve the desired results, and they should acknowledge the limited understanding of these connections. While the main result's algorithm-independence is a strength for expectation guarantees on stability, it does not extend to high-probability guarantees, which are often of greater interest. The conversion of expectation guarantees to high-probability guarantees through the use of hold-out set validation schemes is a known approach, and the authors should address this limitation. Despite these considerations, the contributions remain solid and interesting, though not as robust as algorithm-independent high-probability guarantees, which could be a direction for future research. The paper's well-written text and elegant proofs using simple techniques make it an exciting contribution to the field, albeit with some unaddressed limitations.
