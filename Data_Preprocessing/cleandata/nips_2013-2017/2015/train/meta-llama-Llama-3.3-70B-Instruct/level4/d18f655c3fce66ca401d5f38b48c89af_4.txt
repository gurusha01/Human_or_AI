This paper presents the EAMSGD algorithm, which achieves rapid convergence in distributed SGD by building upon prior works in distributed optimization and establishing a connection with deep learning models. The results obtained on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets are robust and well-presented.
The paper is of high quality, featuring innovative ideas and solid results.
In terms of clarity, the paper's structure is well-organized, but more direct and transparent formulations of the algorithm would enhance reader comprehension. For example, the various types of distributed SGD introduced at the beginning of Section 5 could be more clearly documented, potentially through the use of a table or a categorized list of available algorithms, which would further highlight the results.
Regarding originality, while the idea draws from prior classic works and is not entirely novel, its application to recent deep learning models and datasets is a new contribution.
The paper's significance is notable, given the growing importance of distributed deep learning in both industry and academia, making it a valuable resource for engineers and researchers.
The proposed elastic averaging method for distributed SGD yields promising results in empirical image classification experiments, supported by theoretical analysis and mathematical formulations inspired by ADMM. The research concept is innovative, and the results are solid and clearly presented. With some minor improvements to experimental details, this paper is recommended for publication at NIPS, offering a valuable contribution to the field.
