This paper presents a decentralized aggregation/averaging algorithm for computing higher-order statistics, such as sample variance and correlation coefficients, over pairs of observations distributed across a network of nodes. The proposed gossip-style algorithm is a valuable contribution to the literature, but it would benefit from a more thorough connection to existing approaches and ideas.
Overall, the paper is well-structured, but the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the algorithm's underlying mechanics, particularly the random walk behavior of the initial observations. Additionally, the authors should situate their work within the broader context of gossip algorithms, including a more comprehensive review of related research, such as the Dimakis et al. Proc. IEEE paper.
Several specific suggestions for improvement are offered. Firstly, the authors should clarify the induced distribution on edges resulting from the "node wakes up, contacts neighbor" process. Secondly, an alternative approach, where nodes flood their values across the network and store received observations, could be explored to compare its performance with the proposed method. This comparison would help evaluate the effectiveness of the averaging technique, especially when node memory is limited.
The authors are also encouraged to examine the literature on lifting constructions for accelerating gossip algorithms, which appears to be related to their proposed construction. Relevant references, such as the work by Jung, Shah, and Shin, as well as Li and Dai, should be consulted.
Furthermore, the analysis of gossip algorithms typically assumes a worst-case scenario for the initial data distribution. The authors should explicitly state their assumptions regarding the data distribution and provide guarantees on the error as a function of the initial data.
Minor corrections are also suggested, including revisions to the bipartite definition, grammatical corrections, and rephrasing of certain sentences.
Following the authors' feedback, the suggested clarifications and modifications are deemed satisfactory, and the initial score is revised upward. However, the authors are still advised to investigate lifting constructions, such as LADA, and modify the related work section accordingly. Moreover, baseline comparisons should be included in the experiments.
In conclusion, this paper presents a nicely formulated approach to extending gossip methods for computing complex statistics in distributed settings. Assuming the authors address the raised comments and make the necessary revisions, the paper is recommended for acceptance.
