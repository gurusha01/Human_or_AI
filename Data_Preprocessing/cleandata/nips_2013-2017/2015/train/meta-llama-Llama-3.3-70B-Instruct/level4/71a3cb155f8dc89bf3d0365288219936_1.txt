This paper examines the estimation of sparse graphical models, posing it as a nonconvex optimization problem that is addressed through an alternating minimization algorithm. The discussion encompasses the optimal statistical rate of convergence and the properties of consistent graph recovery. The presentation is clear and well-organized. However, several points require clarification:
(1) Regarding the sparsity of the solution Ω, the formulation of Problem (2.2) aims to promote sparsity in each precision matrix Ω_i. Nonetheless, the simulation section lacks results demonstrating sparsity. On page 8, lines 414-415, it is noted that "Tlasso tends to include more non-connected edges than other methods," which suggests that the computational results from Tlasso may not exhibit significant sparsity. An explanation for this observation would be beneficial.
(2) Concerning the initialization of Algorithm 1, as described on page 4, lines 206-210, the authors assert that the obtained estimators are relatively insensitive to the initialization choice. Yet, in the simulations, initializing with 1_mk yielded better numerical performance. It would be helpful to understand why this initialization method outperforms random initialization and to discuss the potential drawbacks of the latter approach.
