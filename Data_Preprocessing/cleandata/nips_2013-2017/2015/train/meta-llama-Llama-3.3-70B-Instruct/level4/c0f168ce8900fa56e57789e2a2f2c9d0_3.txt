The authors propose the projected Langevin Monte-Carlo (PLMC) algorithm for sampling from a log-concave density with compact support, establishing a polynomial-time bound for sampling with a specified accuracy, which is a novel and significant contribution to the theory of computational statistics and machine learning.
Upon reviewing the proof, excluding the supplementary material, I verified the details and found only minor typos. The proof is not only correct but also features an elegant argument utilizing the Skorohod embedding, which will likely be appreciated by those with a mathematical background.
Some minor suggestions include: 
- Adding a discussion on the necessity of a first-order oracle and a projector to the compact set for the PLMC algorithm.
- Clarifying the relationship between the tasks of requiring a zeroth-order oracle and sampling from the restriction of the distribution on segments in the context of H&R, as discussed in Section 1.2.
- Simplifying the introduction in Section 2.1 by only introducing x and removing the equation on line 184, replacing phi with x-w in the subsequent equation.
- Correcting minor errors, including "Dirac" instead of "dirac" on line 210, "paths" instead of "path" on line 225, replacing \bar WT with \bar Wt on lines 244 and Eq (3), and providing a precise reference for the Khintchine inequality on line 298.
- Providing a reference to support the claim that the uniform distribution on a compact set is a stationary distribution for the reflected Brownian motion on line 321.
Overall, this paper presents a valuable theoretical result on the computational complexity of sampling from a compactly supported distribution with a log-concave density using a first-order oracle, making an original contribution to an important topic that warrants further attention.
