The paper's objective is well-defined and its experimental findings are robust. Nevertheless, the presentation is somewhat convoluted, with several ambiguous sections that warrant clarification. Specifically: 
1. The translation-invariance of RPN is asserted, whereas [19] is not; the status of Overfeat in this regard remains unclear. 
2. A multitude of parameters are manually configured without exhaustive examination; for instance, the selection of n=3 and k=9 lacks justification. 
3. The training protocol appears intricate and unstable; it is unclear why the procedure was not repeated multiple times to ensure consistency. Were numerous settings explored before settling on the current configuration, which presumably yielded the optimal performance? 
The authors introduce a novel region proposal approach that leverages shared CNN features for object localization. This method incorporates a classification layer to distinguish objects from non-objects and a regression layer to predict object bounding boxes. By sharing feature computations with the object localization module, the proposed RCNN achieves a roughly 10-fold increase in speed compared to Fast RCNN, while also exhibiting slightly improved accuracy. To address the assumption of pre-defined regions in the object localization CNN's training procedure, the authors propose an alternative multi-stage training protocol.
