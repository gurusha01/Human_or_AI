This manuscript introduces a groundbreaking approach to address time-sensitive recommendation tasks by leveraging the low-rank structure of a user-item matrix in conjunction with the Hawkes process, yielding a distributed solution that outperforms current methodologies.
Quality: Overall, the manuscript adopts a rigorous methodology in modeling observations (such as ratings) through stochastic processes. However, several aspects warrant further clarification.
A primary concern lies in the theoretical framework, specifically Equation (8) and Theorem 2. It is unclear over which parameter the maximum is taken in Equation (8); assuming it is over ρ, there is a potential issue with ρ* being unbounded. Furthermore, Theorem 2 is not utilized in the experimental selection of ρ, which diminishes its significance.
An additional suggestion pertains to the experimental baselines. Considering SVD++ [17], the winner of the Netflix challenge and a highly effective algorithm for time-sensitive recommendations, as a baseline could enhance the manuscript's quality. Although the current baselines are satisfactory, incorporating SVD++ would provide a more comprehensive comparison.
Clarity: The manuscript is well-structured and straightforward to comprehend.
Originality: The work appears novel, particularly given the relatively recent emergence of time-sensitive recommendation as a distinct problem area.
Significance: Time-sensitive recommendation has the potential for significant impact. This manuscript's contribution of a novel algorithm, which captures low-rank structure in user-item matrices using the Hawkes process and is solvable in a distributed manner, achieving superior results to existing methods, underscores its importance and relevance in the field.
