It would be beneficial to clarify from the outset that complete model knowledge, as expressed in Equation 6, is a requirement. 
Sections 4 and 6 appear to be uneven in terms of their depth and coverage of topics. Notably, Section 4 fails to discuss the recurrent units that were highlighted in the abstract, which creates a discrepancy.
On line 405, the description of the neural network as stochastic is unclear, given that while the training data may exhibit stochastic characteristics, the network itself appears to operate deterministically.
Rebuttal ======== Thank you for providing additional context. Overall, the paper demonstrates potential but would profit from a restructuring to improve its flow and clarity.
