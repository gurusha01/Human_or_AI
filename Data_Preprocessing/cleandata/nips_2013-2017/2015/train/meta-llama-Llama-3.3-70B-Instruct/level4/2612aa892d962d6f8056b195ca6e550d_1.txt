The author presents a novel approach to integrating feedback gains into neural network policies, enhancing their resilience to disturbances and regression errors. By introducing a cost penalty for deviation, the method softly couples trajectory optimization and policy optimization, enabling the policy to learn simplified yet robust approximations of optimal trajectories that surpass those generated by MPC-based trajectory optimization alone. Although the paper utilizes advanced parallelization techniques to optimize tasks, this aspect is secondary to the primary focus. Ultimately, the trained feedback controllers are successfully applied to a wide range of robotic systems.
This manuscript is exemplary in its quality, clarity, and technical sophistication, yielding impressive results in its applications. The work is a masterful blend of graphics, control theory, and neural networks, culminating in the generation of controllers for diverse body morphologies and tasks. The presentation is outstanding, making it a truly inspiring contribution to the field.
