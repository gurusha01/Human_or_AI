This paper presents a novel generative sequence model that incorporates explicit latent stochastic variables to condition data generation, which can be informed by past events. A key contribution of this work is its extension of recent latent variable models to sequential data. The authors demonstrate the model's competitiveness with existing sequence models through experiments on multiple datasets. However, some assertions lack comprehensive evidence, and the experimental framework is largely proof-of-concept. Notably, the use of raw, unprocessed signals in the experiments limits the comparability of the results to state-of-the-art performances on these benchmark datasets.
