This manuscript explores the Robust PCA problem, where a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix coexist, and the leverage scores of the low-rank component and the non-zero probabilities of the sparse component vary across entries. The authors establish sufficient conditions for exact recovery, expressed in terms of local relationships between leverage scores and error probabilities.
The work aligns with prior research on matrix completion under similar non-uniform conditions, leveraging techniques such as golfing schemes and weighted norms developed in earlier studies.
A primary concern is the lack of clear applications for these results. Specifically, it is unclear what scenario would satisfy the conditions outlined in the paper, where error probabilities and leverage scores align. Unlike matrix completion, where observation probabilities can sometimes be controlled, error probabilities in this context are not controllable. Further discussion on potential applications would be beneficial.
The clustering problem mentioned in the paper presents a possible application area. Given the relationship between local incoherence and cluster sizes, it might be plausible that larger clusters could tolerate higher error probabilities. Deriving a corollary for this specific problem could provide clarity.
Additional suggestions include:
1. Formalizing the elimination or derandomization arguments for this non-uniform setting would enhance the manuscript.
2. The proof involves both \mu0 and \mu1; explicitly identifying where \mu_1 is necessary would improve the readability of the proof.
The manuscript builds upon previous work on matrix completion with non-uniform local incoherence, presenting theoretically sound results based on established techniques. However, the authors could strengthen the manuscript by providing a clearer motivation for the problem setting and exploring potential applications in more depth.
