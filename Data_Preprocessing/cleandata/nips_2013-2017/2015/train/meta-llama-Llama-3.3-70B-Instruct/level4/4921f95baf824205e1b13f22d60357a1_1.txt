This study proposes a heuristic approach for link prediction in graphs, leveraging common neighbours to facilitate a rapid procedure that can be readily implemented by various informatics systems. Despite being a heuristic method, its performance on real-world data is comparable to that of benchmark algorithms.
However, the main manuscript lacks self-containment, as understanding the proof sketches for Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 requires referencing definitions from the supplementary material, such as GOOD. Additionally, there are areas that require revision, including a sentence on page 2 that appears to be incomplete: "connect with probability $\gamma$. network has recently".
A potential error is noted on page 4, where the definition "CN(i,j) = {u | i ~ u ~ v}" may contain a typo, with "v" possibly needing to be replaced with "j". While I am not an expert in this field and therefore cannot provide a definitive assessment, this work appears to offer potential benefits in terms of speed, along with rigorous results on the applicability of the proposed link prediction heuristic. Nevertheless, some parts of the manuscript require consultation of the supplementary material to be fully understood.
