This paper introduces an innovative modification of the Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm, wherein the approach involves iteratively refining a global approximation of the target, rather than focusing on the refinement of individual approximating factors. This adjustment leads to a reduction in memory requirements and demonstrates favorable experimental performance in comparison to the standard EP method.
The concept presented is both useful and elegantly simple.
Quality: The overall quality is good, with the idea being particularly noteworthy.
Clarity: The paper is well-written, although there are a few minor typos that need correction.
Originality: To the best of my knowledge, this idea appears to be original.
Significance: The algorithm has the potential to be highly useful, with a wide range of possible applications.
Minor comments:
- Given that the convergence of the traditional EP algorithm is not guaranteed, it would be beneficial for the authors to discuss whether they have observed similar convergence issues with their modified version, referred to here as SEP.
- In the example related to Gaussian mixture clustering, the posterior distribution exhibits 4! modes. It is unclear whether the SEP approximation captures this property. Furthermore, Figure 4 is somewhat perplexing, and additional clarification would be appreciated to fully understand the implications of the results presented.
