This paper introduces novel approaches for learning parameters and conducting inference, either via Viterbi or forward/backward algorithms, in continuous-time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs) with non-uniformly distributed time points. The authors tackle the inference problem for the transition rate matrix Q by constructing a discrete-time inhomogeneous HMM and then applying two recently developed methods, Expfm and Unif from Hobolth & Jensen 2011, to obtain sufficient statistics for their Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. A detailed time complexity analysis for various algorithmic variants is presented in Table 1, followed by experimental evaluations on a synthetic dataset with 5 states and two disease progression datasets related to Glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
The strengths of the paper include its clear writing, the interesting computational and modeling challenges it addresses, and its relevance to the biomedical domain. The authors provide a solid mathematical foundation for their approach, building upon previous work by Hobolth & Jensen 2011. They also do an excellent job of explaining the biomedical datasets and questions, and relating their results to existing knowledge about the diseases.
However, there are some weaknesses. Firstly, the evaluation using synthetic data is insufficient. The choice of 5 states and 10^6 samples for training seems excessive and not representative of real-world problems. The difference between state emissions (as described in lines 319-320) appears too simplistic, which might explain why all variants of the algorithm perform similarly. More challenging settings and varying parameters could help reveal differences between the algorithms and provide a better understanding of their performance on real-world data. Secondly, Section 5.2 is somewhat obscure, particularly in its description of competing methods. Adding more details about these methods to the appendix could improve the clarity of this section.
Some minor comments include: Figure 2 is not self-contained and is referenced prematurely (line 40). There are also minor errors, such as "the rate the process" (line 91), "in only at" (line 161), and "to shown" (line 399). Additionally, the claim about binary search in Section 5.2 (lines 348-350) is unclear. Overall, the paper presents new methods for efficient parameter learning and inference in CT-HMMs and applies them to disease progression datasets, demonstrating its potential in the biomedical domain.
