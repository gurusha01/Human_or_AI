I would suggest that the authors provide a more in-depth comparison of their method to existing approaches, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative assessments of inter-frame quality, including aspects such as consistency and flickering.
== post rebuttal == A notable strength of the rebuttal is the authors' intention to make their model publicly available, and it would be beneficial for reproducibility if they also released their code. The paper proposes a novel and computationally efficient approach, evaluated extensively against related work and through ablation studies. To further enhance the evaluation, particularly given the video-based nature of the task, it would be advantageous to expand the qualitative analysis in Figure 5 to include a discussion and quantitative comparison, such as a consistency metric, to assess multi-frame quality.
