This paper, denoted as Paper 921, proposes a novel variant of the adaptive SGD method, termed "equilibrated gradient descent," for non-convex optimization problems. The authors claim that the equilibration preconditioner outperforms the Jacobi preconditioner both theoretically and empirically.
However, the experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm is limited to the MNIST and CURVES datasets, which are relatively simple tasks that do not provide significant insights into the algorithm's performance. To strengthen the paper, additional experiments should be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Furthermore, when using neural networks, the primary focus should be on test accuracies rather than training error (MSE). The comparison between the proposed ESGD and SGD is also insufficient, as it only considers the number of epochs. An additional figure with training time measured in minutes or hours would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithms' performance.
The paper's clarity is also a concern. Several ambiguities were identified: (1) In Algorithm 1, it is unclear whether the matrix $H$ should be recalculated at each iteration, and if so, a subscript should be added for clarity. Additionally, in the update of $\theta$ (line 277), it seems that $\sqrt{D / i}$ should be used instead. (2) In Section 4, the paper attempts to demonstrate that $D^{E}$ can significantly reduce the condition number $\kappa(D^{E-1}H)$, but this point should be explicitly stated. (3) The meaning of $D^{-1}=\Vert A{I,.}\Vert2$ (line 178) is unclear. (4) The expression $R(H,v)=...$ (line 267) appears to be a vector, whereas equation (11) is a scalar, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Given the lack of a theorem providing a convergence rate for the proposed ESGD, a more detailed explanation is necessary to support the algorithm's effectiveness.
In conclusion, this paper requires more convincing experimental results and a clearer explanation of the proposed ESGD to demonstrate its potential. A more comprehensive evaluation and clarification of the technical details would significantly strengthen the paper.
