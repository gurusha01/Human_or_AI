The authors present a solid idea and demonstrate that it jointly obtains a modest improvement over state-of-the-art on PASCAL 2012 segmentation. The idea is interesting; however, it is not particularly well presented in the text, and the authors could improve the clarity of their message. I would recommend the use of figures in the exposition to convey their convolutional approach, which corresponds to the current trends in the field. One aspect that still needs attention is the remaining ambiguity in certain sections. We have reviewed the paper carefully, and it performs well in terms of technical content, but the authors could further refine their presentation to make it more engaging and clear, thereby effectively conveying their message to the reader, and the convolutional neural network performs as expected.
