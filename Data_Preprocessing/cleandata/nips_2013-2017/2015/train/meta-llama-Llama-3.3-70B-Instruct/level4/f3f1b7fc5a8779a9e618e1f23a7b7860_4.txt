The author examines the regression problem, where the relationship between the response variable $y$ and the design matrix $X$ is given by $y = X \theta^ + \omega$, with the goal of recovering an estimate $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta^$ such that the $\ell_2$ norm of the difference between $\hat{\theta}$ and $\theta^*$ is small with high probability. This is achieved by solving a norm-regularized least squares regression problem. 
Considerable research has focused on this problem when $X$ and $\omega$ have subgaussian entries, where the required number of rows $n$ in the design matrix $X$ is related to the Gaussian mean width of the "error set" $A$. This submission extends this work to the case where $X$ and $\omega$ have subexponential entries, with $n$ related to the exponential width of $A$. Theorem 1 states that the exponential width is at most the Gaussian width times $\sqrt{\log p}$ for any subset $T$ of $\mathbb{R}^p$, which is a straightforward corollary of two theorems from Talagrand's book.
From a technical standpoint, the transition from the Gaussian case to the subexponential case is relatively minor, with Theorem 1 following directly from the cited theorems. While the submission may not offer a significant technical contribution, it is still valuable. However, the introduction could benefit from more motivation, particularly in justifying the importance of considering subexponential entries in the design matrix. In cases where the design matrix can be chosen, it is often possible to select subgaussian entries, which require fewer measurements. The question then arises as to whether there are compelling examples where the design matrix is fixed and its entries can be modeled as subexponential, which is not adequately addressed in the introduction.
Additional comments on the submission include several technical corrections and clarifications. For instance, the statement that subexponential distributions have heavier tails than subgaussian distributions is not entirely accurate, as there are distributions with heavier tails that still have all moments existing. Furthermore, the definition of $A$ is not clear until later in the text, and the inequality for $\lambda_n$ is confusing. The claim that the upper and lower bounds of equation (4) hold for any $g$ with subgaussian decay is also incorrect, as the lower bound only holds for Gaussian decay. Similar issues arise in the supplementary file, where the result is incorrectly stated to be applicable to any process with a concentration inequality like equation (16), when in fact the lower bound is only true for the case of exactly exponential entries.
