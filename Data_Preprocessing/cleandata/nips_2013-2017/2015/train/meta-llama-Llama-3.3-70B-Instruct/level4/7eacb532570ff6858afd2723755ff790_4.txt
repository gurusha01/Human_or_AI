The authors present an algorithm for eliciting rankings over alternatives based on their parameters in the Plackett-Luce model, utilizing a quick sort-guided approach with bounded sample complexity.
This paper is exceptionally well-structured and provides a significant contribution to a pertinent and naturally occurring problem. To further enhance the work, it would be beneficial to establish a lower bound on sample complexity within the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework for the problem at hand. The primary reason for not assigning a higher recommendation stems from the existence of [1], which appears to establish a substantial portion of the conceptual foundation for the model and problem under consideration. Overall, the paper is well-written and offers a substantial, albeit not groundbreaking, contribution to the field of elicitation under the Plackett-Luce model.
