The paper presents a novel top-k hinge loss formulation for top-k classification, extending the multiclass SVM framework by utilizing the sum of the k largest components as a convex approximation of the ideal top-k loss. An efficient optimization algorithm is introduced, and connections to prior research are explored. The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in comparison to existing baselines.
1. Notably, the authors were unable to compare their method to [25, 8] due to the unavailability of implementations, which would be a valuable addition to the paper.
2. It would be beneficial if the authors could make their code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.
Overall, the paper offers a concise and effective formulation of top-k multiclass SVM, yielding promising results.
