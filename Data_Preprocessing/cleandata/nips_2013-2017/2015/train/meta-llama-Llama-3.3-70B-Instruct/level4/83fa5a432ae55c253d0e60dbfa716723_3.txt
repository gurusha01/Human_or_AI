The authors' methodology is rooted in the "Cramer-Wold device", a concept that guarantees the existence of a linear projection capable of distinguishing between two distributions. By directly applying the Wasserstein metric to samples from both distributions, the authors demonstrate the favorable theoretical properties of this approach under certain conditions, such as bounded domain variables. Furthermore, they extend their analysis to distributions that differ in only a few dimensions by exploring sparse projections, which leads to a non-convex computational problem. To address this, the authors propose a relaxation using a semidefinite program and additional pre-processing steps to estimate a solution. The methodology is validated through empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets, including a bioinformatics application.
The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates its core ideas. It tackles a community-relevant problem using an innovative technique, backed by thorough theoretical and empirical validation.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include: enhancing figures with more descriptive captions and legends to improve interpretability and make them more self-explanatory. Additionally, considering the term "Cramer-Wold theorem" instead of "Cramer-Wold device" might be beneficial, as it appears to be more standard in the field, except in reference [10].
For future research directions, the current theoretical findings focus on sample complexity in relation to the optimal linear projection. It would be valuable to investigate the relationship between the induced divergences and standard divergences calculated directly from the high-dimensional distributions. This could provide clarity on the distributional convergence implied by the Cramer-Wold Theorem. The proposed technique for differentiating distributions, based on the maximal univariate Wasserstein divergence between projections of the underlying variables, offers a novel solution. Overall, the paper addresses a significant problem with a fresh approach and robust validation, making it a meaningful contribution.
