This paper presents a novel point process collaborative filtering model that effectively captures the temporal and recurrent relationships between users and items. The model represents the event density for each user-item pair as the sum of a constant intensity and a self-exciting intensity, which is dependent on past events. This is achieved through the computation of two sets of intensity by two sets of user and item latent vectors, respectively. An optimization algorithm is derived for parameter estimation, and empirical studies demonstrate the proposed method's advantage over commonly used alternatives.
However, there is room for improvement in the experimental studies. For instance, considering a simple ensemble of STiC and SVD as a baseline would be beneficial, as the authors argue that existing methods are unable to recommend entirely new items, a limitation that SVD can address. Additionally, the sensitivity of the results to the bandwidth parameter σ in the γ function used for the self-exciting process warrants further investigation. The selection process for important hyperparameters, such as the dimension of the latent vectors, for both the baseline methods and the proposed method, is not clearly outlined. 
Providing more detailed characteristics of the two real-world datasets used would also enhance the paper. Given the focus on temporal structure, including simple statistics such as the number of recurring events per user/item pair and the irregularity of the temporal patterns would be insightful.
The overall quality of the paper is satisfactory but could be improved. The presentation suffers from language, typo, and grammar issues, which hinder clarity. 
The originality of the proposed method lies in its innovative combination of point process and latent factor models, making it an interesting contribution.
The significance of both the problem addressed and the method proposed is notable, with good practical value. The paper's demonstration of the proposed method's advantage through empirical studies, despite areas for improvement, underscores its potential impact. Overall, with enhancements to experimental studies and presentation, the paper could offer a more compelling contribution to the field.
