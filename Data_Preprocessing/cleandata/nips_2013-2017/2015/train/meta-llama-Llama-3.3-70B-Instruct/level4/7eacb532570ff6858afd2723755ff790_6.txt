The authors provide a thorough explanation of the existing literature on online preference-based mechanisms, focusing on PAC-item and AMPR preference-based approximations as objectives for the dueling bandit ranker problem. By leveraging the fact that pairwise comparisons generated by the QuickSort algorithm in a stochastic setting align with the pairwise marginals of the Plackett-Luce model, the authors propose a Budgeted Quick-sort based algorithm. Although the concept appears straightforward, its originality is not entirely clear. The elimination strategy employed for both PAC and AMPR problems, which involves eliminating items significantly outperformed by others, seems logical. For the AMPR problem, the authors estimate the Copeland score for each item, and a key contribution of the paper is the provision of sample complexity bounds for both PAC and AMPR. The results from synthetic data largely align with the theoretical bounds. However, the assumption of a Condorcet winner is somewhat restrictive, leading the authors to concentrate on the Plackett-Luce model, which ensures its existence. The paper's main contribution lies in utilizing a budgeted Quicksort variant to derive surrogate probability distributions over rankings, exploiting the transitivity properties of Plackett-Luce by aligning Quicksort's pairwise marginals with those of the Plackett-Luce model.
