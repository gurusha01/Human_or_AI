This manuscript introduces novel Gossip algorithms for calculating U-statistics, exhibiting a faster convergence rate than existing state-of-the-art methods, such as the U2-Gossip algorithm proposed by Pelckmans and Suykens in 2009. Notably, the proposed algorithms also operate effectively in asynchronous environments, which is a more realistic setting. The experimental results provide further evidence of the superiority of the proposed algorithms over existing ones.
The paper is well-structured, with a clear motivation for the problem and a thorough positioning of the authors' work within the context of existing literature. Upon examination, the proposed algorithms appear to be innovative and offer superior convergence and cost efficiency, including reduced memory and communication requirements, when compared to the U2-Gossip algorithm. Additionally, the algorithms' ability to function in asynchronous settings is a significant advantage.
The authors provide both theoretical guarantees and analyses, as well as extensive empirical evaluations using two datasets, which are compared to baseline methods. This comprehensive approach further reinforces the paper's contributions. Overall, the manuscript presents a significant advancement in Gossip algorithms for U-statistics computation, demonstrating improved convergence rates and functionality in realistic asynchronous settings, with thorough theoretical and empirical validation.
