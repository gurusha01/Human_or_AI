The proposed algorithm achieves substantial reductions in computational complexity compared to existing methods. However, I have some reservations regarding the impact of the approximate solution provided by the delta factor on convergence, particularly for typical values of n. 
A minor correction is needed: in section 1.1, the condition stated as $n\geq m-1$ appears to be incorrect and should be revised to $n \leq m-1$. The authors' approach in this paper utilizes approximate solvers to accelerate the solution process for isotonic regression with arbitrary norms.
