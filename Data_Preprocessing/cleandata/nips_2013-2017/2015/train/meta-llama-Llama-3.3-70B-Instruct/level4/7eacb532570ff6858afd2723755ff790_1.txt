The following suggestions are proposed for improvement:
- The paper would benefit from an explicit statement regarding the pairwise marginals of the Plackett-Luce model, specifically that they correspond to a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) distribution.
- In Remark 5, it is noted that the bound referenced in [25] pertains to exact recovery, whereas the bound presented in the paper is for approximate recovery; this distinction should be clearly articulated.
- Throughout Section 9.1, the notation for set membership should be corrected to use "\in" instead of "=" or "[".
- On page 7, the last line contains a minor error, where "horizontal" should be replaced with "vertical".
- An additional experiment in Section 9.2 could involve comparing the proposed algorithm with rank centrality in terms of the fraction of times an ε-optimal ranking is recovered (for some ε > 0), rather than focusing solely on the non-optimal recovery fraction; this could provide insight into whether the algorithm offers improved sample complexity in such scenarios.
This paper addresses the problem of identifying the most probable ranking, or the top-ranked item, from an underlying Plackett-Luce distribution, using active queries of pairwise comparisons. The authors propose algorithms for both full ranking identification and top-ranked item identification, leveraging a budgeted quicksort procedure that preserves pairwise comparison probabilities under the Plackett-Luce distribution. The paper provides query complexity bounds for both settings and presents experiments demonstrating the outperformance of the top item identification algorithm over recent proposals under the Plackett-Luce model. However, the full ranking algorithm does not surpass a simple passive sampling algorithm using uniform sampling, leaving room for the design of more effective active algorithms. The paper is exceptionally well-written, with interesting results and meticulously designed experiments.
