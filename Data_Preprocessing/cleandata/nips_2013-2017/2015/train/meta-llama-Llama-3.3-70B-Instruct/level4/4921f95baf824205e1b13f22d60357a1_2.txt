This manuscript examines the efficacy of the common neighbors heuristic in link prediction and local clustering within the stochastic blockmodel framework, with a focus on a query node. The authors theoretically demonstrate that the common neighbors heuristic can reliably extract clusters with high probability when the graph exhibits sufficient density, and that its performance can be enhanced in sparser graphs through the incorporation of a cleaning step.
The overall quality of the manuscript is satisfactory. In terms of clarity, it is adequate, although certain sections are challenging to comprehend. The authors conclude by comparing the performance of SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN to state-of-the-art algorithms using real-world datasets, revealing that SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN still underperform relative to Spectral Clustering and Katz. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide insight into the reasons underlying this disparity, potentially attributing it to the real-world networks not aligning closely with the theoretical assumptions presented. Further discussion, analysis, and experimentation in this regard would be valuable. The study proposed in this manuscript is highly intriguing, and overall, the work appears reasonable and convincing.
