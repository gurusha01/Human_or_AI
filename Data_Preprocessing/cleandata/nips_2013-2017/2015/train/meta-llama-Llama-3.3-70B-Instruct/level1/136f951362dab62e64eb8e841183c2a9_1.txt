This paper proposes a novel framework for time-sensitive recommendation and returning-time prediction by connecting self-exciting point processes and low-rank models. The authors model the occurrences of user-item consumption events as a self-exciting Hawkes process and develop an efficient algorithm to estimate the model parameters via convex optimization. The algorithm blends proximal gradient and conditional gradient methods, achieving an optimal O(1/t) convergence rate and scaling up to problems with millions of user-item pairs and hundreds of millions of temporal events.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their work, discussing the limitations of existing recommendation techniques and the importance of capturing temporal dynamics in user behavior. The proposed framework is novel and well-justified, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the model and its properties.
The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the superior predictive performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the convergence of their algorithm and its scalability.
The strengths of the paper include:
* Novel and well-justified framework for time-sensitive recommendation and returning-time prediction
* Efficient algorithm with optimal convergence rate and scalability
* Comprehensive experimental evaluation with positive results
* Clear and well-written presentation
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a specific form for the triggering kernel, which may not be suitable for all applications
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the model to hyperparameters
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed framework
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed framework is novel and well-justified. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the proposed model. The paper is a strong candidate for acceptance.
