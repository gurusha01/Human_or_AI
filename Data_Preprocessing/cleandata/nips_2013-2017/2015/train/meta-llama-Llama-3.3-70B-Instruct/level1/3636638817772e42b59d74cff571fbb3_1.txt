This paper proposes novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for decentralized estimation of U-statistics in networks. The authors establish convergence rate bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases, respectively, with explicit data and network-dependent terms. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including a comparison with existing work, and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach through numerical experiments on real datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of new algorithms for decentralized estimation of U-statistics, which is a less investigated area.
* The provision of convergence rate bounds with explicit data and network-dependent terms, which provides insight into the performance of the algorithms.
* The comparison with existing work, specifically U2-gossip, which highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.
* The numerical experiments on real datasets, which demonstrate the practical interest of the proposed algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a connected and non-bipartite graph, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The requirement of a global clock for the synchronous algorithm, which may not be feasible in all scenarios.
* The lack of discussion on the communication and memory costs of the algorithms, which is an important consideration in decentralized settings.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces new algorithms for decentralized estimation of U-statistics, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The convergence rate bounds provided are informative and provide insight into the performance of the algorithms.
* The numerical experiments demonstrate the practical interest of the proposed algorithms.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumptions made in the paper, such as the connected and non-bipartite graph, may not always be valid in practice.
* The requirement of a global clock for the synchronous algorithm may not be feasible in all scenarios.
* The lack of discussion on the communication and memory costs of the algorithms is a significant omission.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of decentralized estimation and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithms. However, the assumptions made and the lack of discussion on communication and memory costs are limitations that should be addressed in future work.
