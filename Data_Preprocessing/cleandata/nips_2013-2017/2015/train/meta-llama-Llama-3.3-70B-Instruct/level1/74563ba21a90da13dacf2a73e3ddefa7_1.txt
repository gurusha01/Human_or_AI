This paper presents a novel approach to statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. The authors leverage the theory of embedding probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and introduce a universal kernel on persistence diagrams, which enables a principled solution to two-sample hypothesis testing. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background material, including persistent homology and RKHS embedding of probability measures.
The main contribution of the paper is the proof of universality of a variant of the persistence scale space (PSS) kernel, which is a crucial property for a well-founded use in the context of probability measure embeddings. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including the analysis of 3D surfaces of lateral ventricles and corpora callosa.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the authors provide a thorough review of related work, including previous approaches to statistical treatments of persistent homology. Secondly, the paper is well-organized, and the authors clearly explain the technical details of their approach. Thirdly, the experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in real-world applications.
However, there are some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement. Firstly, the paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with persistent homology and RKHS, which may make it challenging for readers without a strong background in these areas to follow. Secondly, the authors could provide more discussion on the choice of the kernel scale and the heat kernel signature time, as these parameters seem to have a significant impact on the results. Thirdly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, including a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to statistical computations with persistence diagrams.
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background material.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications.
* The paper is well-organized and well-written.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with persistent homology and RKHS, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
* The authors could provide more discussion on the choice of the kernel scale and the heat kernel signature time.

Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of topological data analysis and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to strengthen their paper.
