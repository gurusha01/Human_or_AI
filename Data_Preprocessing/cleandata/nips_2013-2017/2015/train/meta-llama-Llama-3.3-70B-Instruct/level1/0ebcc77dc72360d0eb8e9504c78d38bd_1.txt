This paper presents a novel Bayesian optimization method, called Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves an exponential convergence rate without the need for auxiliary optimization and Î´-cover sampling. The authors relate their work to previous research in Bayesian optimization, including GP-UCB and SOO algorithms, and highlight the limitations of existing methods.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the technical details of the algorithm. The use of a Gaussian process (GP) prior and the concept of infinite-metric exploration loss are well-motivated and clearly explained. The authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including a regret bound, and demonstrate the effectiveness of IMGPO through experiments on several benchmark functions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel approach to Bayesian optimization that addresses the limitations of existing methods.
* The paper provides a clear and well-organized explanation of the algorithm and its technical details.
* The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including a regret bound, which demonstrates the effectiveness of IMGPO.
* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of IMGPO over other state-of-the-art algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm may be computationally expensive due to the need to compute the GP posterior and the infinite-metric exploration loss.
* The authors assume that the objective function is a black-box function, which may not be the case in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the algorithm to these parameters.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical analysis and experimental results.
