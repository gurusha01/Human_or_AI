This paper presents a novel approach to online rank elicitation based on pairwise comparisons, assuming that the rankings follow a Plackett-Luce distribution. The authors propose a surrogate probability distribution over rankings based on a sorting procedure, specifically QuickSort, which preserves the pairwise marginals of the Plackett-Luce distribution. They develop two algorithms, PLPAC and PLPAC-AMPR, to find the most probable item and ranking, respectively. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms' performance and sample complexity, as well as experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results. The use of a sorting-based surrogate distribution is an innovative idea, and the analysis of the algorithms' performance is thorough and well-supported by theoretical results and experimental evidence.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to online rank elicitation based on a sorting-based surrogate distribution.
* The development of two algorithms, PLPAC and PLPAC-AMPR, with theoretical guarantees on their performance and sample complexity.
* The provision of experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a Plackett-Luce distribution may not always hold in practice, and the algorithms' performance may degrade if this assumption is violated.
* The use of a budgeted version of QuickSort may introduce some bias in the pairwise marginals, although the authors provide theoretical results showing that this bias is limited.
* The experimental results are limited to synthetic data, and it would be interesting to see how the algorithms perform on real-world data.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online rank elicitation and provides a novel approach to this problem. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental evidence, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
