This paper presents a novel approach to achieving high-probability regret bounds in non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problems without explicit exploration. The authors propose an implicit exploration (IX) strategy, which allows for a remarkably clean analysis and improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of the standard multi-armed bandit framework.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are easy to follow. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of their technique by deriving improved high-probability bounds for several well-studied variants of the non-stochastic bandit problem, including bandits with expert advice, tracking the best arm, and bandits with side-observations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel and elegant solution to a long-standing problem in the field, which is achieving high-probability regret bounds without explicit exploration.
* The paper is well-organized, and the technical sections are easy to follow.
* The authors demonstrate the flexibility of their technique by applying it to several variants of the multi-armed bandit problem.
* The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm, EXP3-IX, outperforms existing algorithms in terms of regret and robustness.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of why explicit exploration is not necessary for achieving high-probability regret bounds.
* The paper assumes that the learning rate and IX parameters are deterministic, which may not be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing algorithms, which would be helpful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning and multi-armed bandits. The authors' approach is novel, elegant, and well-motivated, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of their algorithm.

Rating: 8/10
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide a clear explanation of why explicit exploration is not necessary for achieving high-probability regret bounds and consider relaxing the assumption of deterministic learning rate and IX parameters. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with existing algorithms would be helpful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
