This paper proposes rectified factor networks (RFNs) for constructing sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of input data. The authors introduce a generalized alternating minimization algorithm derived from the posterior regularization method, which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis, including proofs of convergence and correctness of the RFN learning algorithm.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The authors provide a detailed introduction to the background and motivation of the work, as well as a comprehensive review of related methods. The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs in various tasks, including unsupervised representation learning, pretraining of deep networks, and analysis of gene expression data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel method for constructing sparse and non-linear representations of input data.
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the RFN learning algorithm, including proofs of convergence and correctness.
* Extensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RFNs in various tasks.
* The application of RFNs to real-world problems, such as gene expression analysis in pharmaceutical drug discovery studies.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper is quite long and dense, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow.
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in machine learning and statistics.
* The paper could benefit from more visualizations and illustrations to help explain the concepts and results.
