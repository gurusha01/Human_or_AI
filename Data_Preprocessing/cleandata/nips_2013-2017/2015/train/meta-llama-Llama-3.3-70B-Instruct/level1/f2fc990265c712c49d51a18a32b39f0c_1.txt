This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, HONOR, for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems. The algorithm incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence and uses a hybrid optimization scheme to guarantee convergence. The authors provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that every limit point of the sequence generated by HONOR is a Clarke critical point.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its convergence analysis. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HONOR in solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms such as GIST.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel optimization algorithm that incorporates second-order information to speed up convergence
* A rigorous convergence analysis that guarantees the convergence of the algorithm to a Clarke critical point
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm may require careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the value of Ç«, to achieve good performance
* The computational cost of the algorithm may be higher than that of other algorithms, such as GIST, due to the use of second-order information
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective optimization algorithm for solving non-convex regularized sparse learning problems
* The convergence analysis is rigorous and guarantees the convergence of the algorithm to a Clarke critical point
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving large-scale non-convex sparse learning problems
Arguments against acceptance:
* The algorithm may require careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve good performance
* The computational cost of the algorithm may be higher than that of other algorithms
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper for publication. The proposal of a novel and effective optimization algorithm, combined with a rigorous convergence analysis and experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness, make this paper a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.
