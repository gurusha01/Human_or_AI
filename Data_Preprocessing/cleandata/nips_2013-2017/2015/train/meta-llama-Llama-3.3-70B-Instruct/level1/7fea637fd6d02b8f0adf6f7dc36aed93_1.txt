This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and online learning, building upon previous work by Rakhlin and Shridharan [17] and Daskalakis et al. [4]. The authors introduce a class of regularized learning algorithms with recency bias, which achieve faster convergence rates to approximate efficiency and coarse correlated equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games.
The paper's main strengths lie in its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms' properties, including the Regret bounded by Variation in Utilities (RVU) property, and demonstrate how these properties lead to improved convergence rates. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the subject matter.
The results presented in the paper are significant, as they extend the previous work to arbitrary multi-player normal-form games, which is a more general and practically important setting. The authors also provide a black-box reduction that preserves the fast rates in favorable environments while maintaining robustness against adversarial opponents.
The paper's originality lies in its identification of the RVU property as a key ingredient for fast convergence rates and its introduction of a new class of algorithms that satisfy this property. The authors also provide a generic way of transforming an algorithm that satisfies the RVU property to retain fast convergence in favorable settings while guaranteeing a worst-case regret of ˜O(1/√T).
The significance of the paper's results is substantial, as they have implications for the computation of correlated equilibria and the understanding of agent behavior in complex multi-player games. The paper's contributions are likely to be of interest to researchers in game theory, online learning, and artificial intelligence.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and online learning.
* The results are technically sound, and the analysis is thorough and well-presented.
* The paper introduces a new class of algorithms with improved convergence rates, which is a significant original contribution.
* The authors provide a black-box reduction that preserves fast rates in favorable environments while maintaining robustness against adversarial opponents.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes that players have access to the expected utility function, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing algorithms, which would be useful for understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the paper's contributions without additional effort.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as its contributions are significant, and the results are technically sound and well-presented. The paper's originality and significance make it a valuable addition to the field of game theory and online learning.
