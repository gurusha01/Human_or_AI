This paper proposes a novel framework for on-the-job learning, which enables a system to learn from noisy crowds and maintain high accuracy while reducing cost over time. The authors model the on-the-job setting as a stochastic game and use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with progressive widening to approximate the optimal policy. The system, called LENSE, is evaluated on three tasks: named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification, and achieves significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning. The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel and interesting approach to on-the-job learning, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks.
* The technical sections are well-written and easy to follow, making it easy to understand the authors' contributions.
* The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach, making it easy to understand the context and significance of the work.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the crowd workers are noisy and unreliable, which may not always be the case. It would be interesting to see how the approach performs when the crowd workers are more reliable.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which could be an important consideration for large-scale applications.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work, particularly in the areas of online learning and active learning.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors make a significant contribution to the field of on-the-job learning. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
