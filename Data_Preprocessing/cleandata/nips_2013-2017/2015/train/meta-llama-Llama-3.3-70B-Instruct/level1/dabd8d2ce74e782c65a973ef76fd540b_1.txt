This paper presents a convex relaxation approach to learn the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model from ordinal data, with applications to collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of their approach, including an upper bound on the error and a matching information-theoretic lower bound.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of their approach, including the convex relaxation formulation and the optimization algorithm used to solve it. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-presented, with clear explanations of the key techniques and results.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and related work, making it easy to understand the context and significance of their contributions.
* The convex relaxation approach is well-motivated and clearly explained, with a thorough analysis of its performance guarantees.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-presented, with clear explanations of the key techniques and results.
