This paper proposes a sparse tensor graphical model to estimate the conditional independence structure within high-dimensional tensor-valued data. The authors assume that the data follow a tensor normal distribution with a Kronecker product structure of covariance, which facilitates the estimation of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves minimizing a non-convex objective function, and the authors propose an alternating minimization algorithm to solve this problem.
The paper's main contributions are:
1. The authors prove that their alternating minimization algorithm achieves an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence, as well as consistent graph recovery.
2. They establish the estimation consistency of the proposed estimator in Frobenius norm, max norm, and spectral norm, and provide the model selection consistency of the estimated precision matrix.
3. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their algorithm through extensive numerical studies, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and estimation accuracy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology and theoretical results. The numerical experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
The strengths of the paper are:
1. The authors address a important problem in the field of tensor data analysis, and their proposed method is novel and effective.
2. The theoretical results are rigorous and well-established, providing a solid foundation for the proposed algorithm.
3. The numerical experiments are extensive and well-designed, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper are:
1. The paper assumes a Kronecker product structure of covariance, which may not always hold in practice.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, such as the iterative penalized maximum likelihood method proposed by [9].
3. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the proposed method and its potential applications in real-world problems.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. The paper proposes a novel and effective method for estimating the conditional independence structure within high-dimensional tensor-valued data.
2. The theoretical results are rigorous and well-established, providing a solid foundation for the proposed algorithm.
3. The numerical experiments are extensive and well-designed, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. The paper assumes a Kronecker product structure of covariance, which may not always hold in practice.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, such as the iterative penalized maximum likelihood method proposed by [9].
3. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the proposed method and its potential applications in real-world problems.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and effective method for estimating the conditional independence structure within high-dimensional tensor-valued data, and the theoretical results and numerical experiments are rigorous and well-established. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a more detailed comparison with existing methods and discussing the practical implications of the proposed method.
