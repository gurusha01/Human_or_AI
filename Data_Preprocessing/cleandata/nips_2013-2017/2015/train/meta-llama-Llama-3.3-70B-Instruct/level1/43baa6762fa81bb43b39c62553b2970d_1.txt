This paper investigates the robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem, which aims to decompose an observed matrix into the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse error matrix via convex programming, known as Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). The authors extend previous studies by allowing non-uniform sampling, where entries of the low-rank matrix are corrupted by errors with unequal probabilities. They characterize conditions on error corruption of each individual entry based on the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix, under which correct matrix decomposition by PCP is guaranteed.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical proof is sound, and the authors introduce a new weighted norm to deal with non-uniform error corruption. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach and provide insights into the relationship between local incoherence and robustness to error corruption.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a refined analysis of robust PCA, which captures how robust each entry of the low-rank matrix combats error corruption.
* The paper introduces a new weighted norm, which is essential for dealing with non-uniform error corruption.
* The numerical experiments are well-designed and provide valuable insights into the performance of PCP under different error corruption models.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the rank of the low-rank matrix is known, which may not be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other robust PCA methods, which would be helpful in evaluating the performance of their approach.
* Some of the technical proofs are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to follow the arguments.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of robust PCA, and the results are well-supported by numerical experiments.
* The authors introduce a new weighted norm, which is a valuable technical contribution.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their contributions.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the rank of the low-rank matrix is known, which may not be realistic in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other robust PCA methods, which may limit the impact of their work.
* Some of the technical proofs are not provided in the main paper, which may make it difficult for readers to evaluate the soundness of the arguments.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of robust PCA, and the results are well-supported by numerical experiments. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper, such as providing a comparison with other robust PCA methods and making the technical proofs more accessible to readers.
