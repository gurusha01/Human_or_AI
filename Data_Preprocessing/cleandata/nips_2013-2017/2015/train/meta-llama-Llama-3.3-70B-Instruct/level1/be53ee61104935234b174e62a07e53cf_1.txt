This paper presents improved algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression of a given set of values on the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) under various weighted p-norms. The authors provide a unified framework for solving the Isotonic Regression problem for all weighted p-norms with p < ∞, achieving a significant improvement over previous algorithms. They also give efficient algorithms for `∞-norms and Strict Isotonic Regression, which have numerous applications in statistics, operations research, and machine learning.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of their results and techniques. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and provides context, while the technical sections are detailed and well-explained. The authors also provide experimental results, demonstrating the practical efficiency of their algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Improved algorithms: The authors provide faster algorithms for Isotonic Regression under various weighted p-norms, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Unified framework: The paper presents a unified framework for solving the Isotonic Regression problem for all weighted p-norms with p < ∞, making it easier to understand and apply the results.
