This paper presents a novel extension to Expectation Propagation (EP), called Stochastic Expectation Propagation (SEP), which addresses the significant memory overhead of EP when dealing with large datasets. The authors provide a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, discussing the limitations of EP and the potential benefits of their proposed approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the underlying concepts and related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the SEP algorithm, including its relationship to EP, Assumed Density Filtering (ADF), and Variational Inference (VI).
The experimental evaluation of SEP is comprehensive, covering a range of datasets and models, including probit regression, mixture of Gaussians, and probabilistic backpropagation. The results demonstrate that SEP performs competitively with EP, while reducing the memory consumption by a factor of N. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between different variants of SEP, including the use of mini-batches and finer-grained approximations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A thorough and detailed explanation of the technical contributions, including the SEP algorithm and its relationship to related work
* A comprehensive experimental evaluation, covering a range of datasets and models
* A detailed analysis of the trade-offs between different variants of SEP
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in Bayesian inference and approximate inference methods, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the experimental results, such as the comparison between SEP and EP on the probabilistic backpropagation task, could be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and future directions of the SEP approach
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a significant and well-motivated contribution to the field of approximate Bayesian inference. The technical quality of the paper is high, and the experimental evaluation is comprehensive and well-executed. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper demonstrates a thorough understanding of the underlying concepts and related work, and the authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their ideas.
