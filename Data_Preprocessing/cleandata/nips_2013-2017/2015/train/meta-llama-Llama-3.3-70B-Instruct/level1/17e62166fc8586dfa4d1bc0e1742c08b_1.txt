This paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream, extending the traditional single-image single-sentence generation task to a more challenging and realistic scenario. The authors introduce a multimodal architecture called Coherent Recurrent Convolutional Network (CRCN), which integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. The CRCN model is trained on a large dataset of blog posts with associated images, and its performance is evaluated using both quantitative measures (e.g., BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR, and top-K recall) and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach, related work, and experimental results. The CRCN model is carefully designed, and its components are well-motivated and explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Novelty: The paper addresses a new and challenging task of generating sentence sequences for image streams, which has not been extensively explored in previous research.
2. Technical soundness: The proposed CRCN model is well-designed, and its components are carefully motivated and explained.
3. Experimental evaluation: The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation, including both quantitative and qualitative results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Complexity: The proposed CRCN model is complex, and its training requires a large dataset of blog posts with associated images.
2. Computational cost: The model's computational cost is high, which may limit its applicability in real-time applications.
3. Limited generalizability: The paper focuses on tourism-related topics, and it is unclear how well the proposed approach generalizes to other domains.

Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective.
