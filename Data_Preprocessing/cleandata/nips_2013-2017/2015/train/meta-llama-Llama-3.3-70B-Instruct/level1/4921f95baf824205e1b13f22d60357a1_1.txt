This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic for link prediction and clustering in networks, under the stochastic blockmodel formulation. The authors show that common neighbors can extract clusters with high probability when the graph is dense enough, and can do so even in sparser graphs with the addition of a "cleaning" step. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the common neighbors heuristic, and demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical results on simulated and real-world data.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the contributions of the work. The authors provide a detailed review of related work, including spectral clustering and other link prediction methods, and demonstrate how their approach differs from and improves upon existing methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic, which has been widely used in practice but lacked a rigorous theoretical foundation. The authors' results provide a clear understanding of the conditions under which common neighbors can be effective, and demonstrate the importance of the "cleaning" step in improving the accuracy of the method.
Another strength of the paper is its empirical evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the common neighbors heuristic on a variety of datasets, including simulated and real-world networks. The authors' results show that common neighbors can perform as well as or better than other state-of-the-art methods, such as spectral clustering and the Katz score, in certain regimes.
However, there are also some weaknesses to the paper. One potential limitation is that the authors' analysis is limited to the stochastic blockmodel formulation, which may not capture the complexity of real-world networks. Additionally, the authors' results are based on a specific set of assumptions about the network structure and parameters, which may not hold in all cases.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network analysis and link prediction, and provides a valuable theoretical and empirical understanding of the common neighbors heuristic. The authors' results have important implications for the design of link prediction algorithms and the analysis of network data.
