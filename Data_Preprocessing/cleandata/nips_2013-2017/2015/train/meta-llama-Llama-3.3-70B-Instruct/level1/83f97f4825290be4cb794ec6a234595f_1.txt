This paper presents a study on the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem in the streaming computation model, where items arrive online one at a time and each item must be assigned irrevocably to a component at its arrival time. The authors propose a greedy assignment strategy and provide theoretical guarantees for its performance under a stochastic input model. The paper also includes an extensive empirical evaluation, which demonstrates that the greedy strategy outperforms alternative approaches on real-world datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and its applications. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are detailed and easy to follow. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the authors provide a comparison with other online and offline algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel solution to the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem in the streaming computation model, which is an important problem in various applications.
* The theoretical guarantees provided by the authors are strong, and they demonstrate that the greedy strategy can recover hidden co-clusters in the input data.
* The empirical evaluation is extensive, and the authors provide a comparison with other algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a specific stochastic input model, which may not be realistic in all applications.
* The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is important in the streaming computation model.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work, particularly in the area of hypergraph partitioning and streaming computation.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of streaming computation and hypergraph partitioning. The proposed algorithm is efficient and effective, and the theoretical guarantees provided by the authors are strong.
