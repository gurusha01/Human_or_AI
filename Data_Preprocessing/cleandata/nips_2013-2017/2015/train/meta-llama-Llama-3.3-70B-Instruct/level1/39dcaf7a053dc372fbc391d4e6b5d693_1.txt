This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of connectomics, specifically in the detection of neuronal boundaries in 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images. The authors propose a novel hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture, which combines the strengths of 2D and 3D filters to leverage both spatial and contextual information. The network is trained recursively, with a preliminary boundary map generated by a 2D ConvNet (VD2D) serving as input to a 3D ConvNet (VD2D3D). This approach enables the network to refine its predictions and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background, methodology, and results. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and provides context for the proposed approach. The methodology section is detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and implementation.
The results are impressive, with the proposed VD2D3D architecture outperforming the baseline N4 architecture and the VD2D architecture alone. The authors provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including precision-recall curves and visualizations of the boundary detection results. The discussion section provides a thoughtful analysis of the results and their implications, including a biologically-inspired interpretation of the recursive training process.
The paper's strengths include:
* A novel and well-motivated approach to neuronal boundary detection
* A clear and concise presentation of the methodology and results
* Impressive performance on a challenging dataset
* A thoughtful discussion of the results and their implications
The paper's weaknesses include:
* The recursive training process may be computationally expensive and require significant resources
* The authors could provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameters
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other state-of-the-art methods in the field
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of connectomics and computer vision. The proposed approach is novel, well-motivated, and effective, and the results are impressive. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, pending minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
