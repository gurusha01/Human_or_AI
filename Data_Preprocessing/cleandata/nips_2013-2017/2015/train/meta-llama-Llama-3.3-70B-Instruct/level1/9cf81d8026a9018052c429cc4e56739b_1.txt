This paper proposes a multi-scale recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) for scene labeling, a challenging computer vision task that requires the use of both local discriminative features and global context information. The authors adopt a deep RCNN, which is originally proposed for object recognition, and modify it to fit the scene labeling task. The key module of the RCNN is the recurrent convolutional layer (RCL), which introduces recurrent connections into a convolutional layer, enabling the seamless integration of feature extraction and context modulation in multiple levels of representation.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough review of related work and a detailed description of the proposed model. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the RCNN model, including the influence of different hyper-parameters and the comparison with state-of-the-art models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, which outperforms many state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency on two benchmark datasets, Sift Flow and Stanford Background.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel end-to-end approach for scene labeling, which integrates local feature extraction and context integration simultaneously in each parameterized layer.
* The thorough analysis of the performance of the RCNN model, including the influence of different hyper-parameters and the comparison with state-of-the-art models.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model on two benchmark datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear explanation of the intuition behind the use of recurrent connections in the convolutional layer, and how it helps to integrate context information.
* The limited analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed model, which is an important aspect of scene labeling applications.
* The comparison with state-of-the-art models is mainly based on the accuracy metric, and it would be interesting to see a more comprehensive comparison, including other metrics such as computational efficiency and robustness to different types of noise.
