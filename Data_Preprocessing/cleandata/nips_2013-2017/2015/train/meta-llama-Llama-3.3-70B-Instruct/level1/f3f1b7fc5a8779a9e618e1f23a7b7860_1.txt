This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation, extending existing results from the sub-Gaussian case to the sub-exponential case. The authors provide a unified framework for analyzing non-asymptotic error and structured recovery in norm-regularized regression problems when the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential.
The paper's main strengths include:
1. Technical novelty: The authors introduce a new concept, the exponential width of a set, and establish a relationship between the exponential and Gaussian widths. This allows them to leverage existing results on Gaussian widths to obtain bounds for the sub-exponential case.
2. Generality: The framework is applicable to any norm, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
3. Improved sample complexity bounds: The authors obtain sample complexity bounds that are log p worse than the sub-Gaussian case, which is a significant improvement over existing results.
4. Experimental validation: The paper includes experimental results that validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Assumptions: The paper assumes that the design matrix and noise are sub-exponential, which may not always be the case in practice.
2. Limited comparison to existing work: While the authors mention existing work on sub-Gaussian designs, they could provide a more detailed comparison to highlight the advantages of their approach.
3. Future work: The authors mention extending the stronger result for the RE condition to all norms, which is an important direction for future research.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant technical contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation.
* The framework is general and applicable to any norm.
* The experimental results validate the theoretical findings.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes sub-exponential designs and noise, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The comparison to existing work could be more detailed.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the results and future directions.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to impact future research in high-dimensional structured estimation.
