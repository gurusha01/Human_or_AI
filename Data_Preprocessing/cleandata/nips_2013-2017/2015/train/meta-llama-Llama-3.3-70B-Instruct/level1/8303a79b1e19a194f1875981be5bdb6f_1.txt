This paper introduces a novel method for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling from piecewise continuous densities, called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC). The authors motivate their approach by drawing an analogy with physical systems, where Hamiltonian dynamics can exhibit reflection and refraction at boundaries. They propose a modification to the traditional leapfrog discretization of HMC, which detects intersections with boundaries and applies reflection or refraction to the momentum. The authors prove that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the advantages of RHMC over traditional HMC and Metropolis-Hastings.
The strengths of this paper are:
* The authors address a significant problem in HMC sampling, which is the poor performance of traditional HMC on piecewise continuous densities.
* The proposed method, RHMC, is novel and well-motivated by physical systems.
* The authors provide a rigorous proof of the correctness of RHMC, which is essential for establishing the validity of the method.
* The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in various settings.
The weaknesses of this paper are:
* The implementation of RHMC requires detecting the first intersection of a position trajectory with polytope boundaries, which can be computationally expensive.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of RHMC compared to traditional HMC.
* The experiments are limited to a specific type of piecewise continuous density, and it is unclear how RHMC would perform on more complex densities.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper addresses a significant problem in HMC sampling and proposes a novel and well-motivated solution.
* The authors provide a rigorous proof of the correctness of RHMC, which is essential for establishing the validity of the method.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RHMC in various settings, which suggests that the method has practical value.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The implementation of RHMC can be computationally expensive, which may limit its applicability in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of RHMC compared to traditional HMC, which makes it difficult to evaluate the trade-offs of the method.
* The experiments are limited to a specific type of piecewise continuous density, and it is unclear how RHMC would perform on more complex densities.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of HMC sampling and provides a novel and effective solution to a challenging problem. While there are some limitations to the paper, I think that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance.
