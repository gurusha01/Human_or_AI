This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of supervised metric learning, providing both upper and lower bounds for the distance-based and classifier-based frameworks. The authors show that the sample complexity scales with the representation dimension when no assumptions are made about the underlying data distribution, but can be improved by leveraging the structure of the data distribution. They introduce the concept of metric learning complexity, which characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, and provide sample complexity rates that are finely tuned to this complexity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work. The empirical evaluation is also well-designed, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of norm-regularization in improving the performance of metric learning algorithms in high-noise regimes.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of supervised metric learning, including both upper and lower bounds for the distance-based and classifier-based frameworks.
* The introduction of the concept of metric learning complexity, which provides a new perspective on the intrinsic complexity of a dataset.
* A thorough review of related work, which provides a clear understanding of the contributions of the paper.
* A well-designed empirical evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of norm-regularization in improving the performance of metric learning algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data distribution is bounded, which may not be the case in practice.
* The analysis is limited to linear transformations of the representation space, which may not be sufficient for more complex datasets.
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a few datasets, and more extensive experiments would be necessary to fully validate the results.
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of metric learning, and the results have important implications for the design of metric learning algorithms. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results.
