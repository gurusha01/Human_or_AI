This paper proposes a novel framework for computing a lower bound of cross-validation (CV) errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which can be used to provide a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions. The authors introduce a new CV error lower bound that can be computed using a finite number of solutions obtained by arbitrary algorithms, making it easy to apply to common regularization parameter tuning strategies such as grid-search or Bayesian optimization.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of regularization parameter tuning and the limitations of current practices. The proposed framework is built on a novel CV error lower bound, which is represented as a function of the regularization parameter, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of this bound.
The authors also provide an algorithm for computing the approximation level ε from a given set of solutions and an algorithm for finding an ε-approximate regularization parameter. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in providing a theoretical guarantee on the choice of a regularization parameter with reasonable computational costs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel framework for computing CV error lower bounds as a function of the regularization parameter, which can be used to provide a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions.
* The derivation of a new CV error lower bound that can be computed using a finite number of solutions obtained by arbitrary algorithms.
* The provision of algorithms for computing the approximation level ε from a given set of solutions and for finding an ε-approximate regularization parameter.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed framework in experiments.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the regularization parameter is defined in a finite interval, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other methods for regularization parameter tuning, such as gradient-based search or random search.
* The paper focuses on binary classification problems, and it is not clear how the proposed framework can be extended to multi-class classification problems or other types of machine learning tasks.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by providing a novel framework for computing CV error lower bounds as a function of the regularization parameter. The proposed framework has the potential to be widely applicable and can provide a theoretical guarantee on the choice of a regularization parameter with reasonable computational costs.
