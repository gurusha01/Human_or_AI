This paper addresses the problem of overfitting in adaptive data analysis, where a holdout set is reused multiple times to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm. The authors propose two algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which enable the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses while provably avoiding overfitting to the holdout set.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of overfitting in adaptive data analysis. They also provide a thorough review of related work, including the connection between differential privacy and generalization. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of their algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose two novel algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, which address the problem of overfitting in adaptive data analysis.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the properties of the algorithms, including their generalization guarantees and computational efficiency.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms through a simple synthetic experiment.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the analyst has access to a large holdout set, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithms proposed in the paper may not be efficient for very large datasets, as they require multiple passes over the data.
* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other methods for preventing overfitting in adaptive data analysis.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper addresses an important problem in machine learning, and the proposed algorithms have significant potential for impact.
* The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of their algorithms.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and related work.
