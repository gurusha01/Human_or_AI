This paper presents a novel Markov chain, called projected Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), for sampling from a log-concave distribution restricted to a convex body. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the chain, including its convergence in total variation distance to the target distribution. The paper is well-written, and the authors do an excellent job of relating their work to previous research in the field.
The main contribution of the paper is the development of a new Markov chain that allows for sampling from a log-concave distribution with a first-order oracle, whereas existing chains with provable guarantees require a zeroth-order oracle. The authors demonstrate that their chain has a polynomial-time convergence guarantee, making it a significant improvement over existing methods.
The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and detailed proof of their main result. The use of elementary concepts from stochastic calculus is a notable aspect of the paper, as it makes the proof more accessible to a broader audience. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work, highlighting the connections between their chain and other Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
The experiments presented in the paper are preliminary but encouraging, suggesting that LMC may be a competitor to hit-and-run in practice. However, more extensive experiments are needed to fully evaluate the performance of LMC.
In terms of the review criteria, the paper scores highly on quality, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results, and the paper is well-motivated and well-related to previous work in the field. The significance of the paper is high, as it presents a novel and efficient method for sampling from log-concave distributions.
