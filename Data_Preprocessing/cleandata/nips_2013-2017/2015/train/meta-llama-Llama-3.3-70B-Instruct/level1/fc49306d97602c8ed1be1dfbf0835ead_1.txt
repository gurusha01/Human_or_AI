This paper proposes a novel kernel-based method for cross-domain instance matching, which is a crucial task in various applications such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining. The method represents each feature in all domains as a latent vector in a shared latent space, allowing it to capture the relationship between features across different domains. The authors employ the framework of kernel embeddings of distributions to efficiently and nonparametrically calculate the difference between distributions of paired instances.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various cross-domain matching tasks, including matching between multilingual documents, documents and tags, and images and tags.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is novel and addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as kernel CCA, which cannot capture non-linear relationships between features.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work and clearly explain the differences between their method and existing approaches.
* The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the features in each domain are represented as a multiset of features, which may not be the case in all applications.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which may be a concern for large-scale applications.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameter selection process and the sensitivity of the proposed method to different hyperparameter settings.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The proposed method is novel and addresses a crucial problem in various applications.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various cross-domain matching tasks.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and the proposed method.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a specific representation of features, which may not be applicable in all cases.
* The computational complexity of the proposed method is not thoroughly analyzed, which may be a concern for large-scale applications.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameter selection process and the sensitivity of the proposed method to different hyperparameter settings.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper as it proposes a novel and effective method for cross-domain instance matching, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the paper's quality and clarity.
