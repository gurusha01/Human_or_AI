This paper proposes a novel approach to knowledge tracing, a well-established problem in computer-supported education, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The authors introduce Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a formulation that applies flexible RNNs to model student learning over time. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their contributions.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Originality: The application of RNNs to knowledge tracing is a new and promising approach, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.
2. Technical soundness: The authors provide a thorough explanation of their model, including the input and output time series, optimization, and evaluation metrics.
3. Experimental results: The paper presents impressive results on three datasets, including a 25% gain in AUC over the previous best result on the Assistments benchmark dataset.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient information for the reader to understand the methodology and results.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider:
1. Limited interpretability: While the authors provide some insights into the learned model, the black-box nature of RNNs may limit the interpretability of the results.
2. Dependence on large datasets: The success of DKT relies on the availability of large amounts of training data, which may not be feasible in smaller educational settings.
3. Comparison to other methods: While the authors compare their results to traditional methods, a more comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches would strengthen the paper.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and promising approach to knowledge tracing, with significant improvements over traditional methods.
* The authors provide a thorough explanation of their methodology and results, making it easy to follow and understand.
* The paper has the potential to impact the field of computer-supported education, particularly in the development of personalized learning systems.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The limited interpretability of the results may be a concern, particularly in educational settings where understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial.
* The dependence on large datasets may limit the applicability of DKT in smaller educational settings.
* The comparison to other methods could be more comprehensive, providing a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of DKT relative to other approaches.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of knowledge tracing, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
