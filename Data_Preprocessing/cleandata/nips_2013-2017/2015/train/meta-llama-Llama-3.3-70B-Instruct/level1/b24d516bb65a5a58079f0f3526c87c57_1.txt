This paper presents a comprehensive study of transition phenomena in information cascades observed along a diffusion process over a graph. The authors introduce the concept of the Laplace Hazard matrix and show that its spectral radius fully characterizes the dynamics of the contagion, both in terms of influence and explosion time. The paper provides tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes and an in-depth analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The paper also includes several examples of cascade models, including fixed transmission patterns, exponential transmission probabilities, and SI and SIR epidemic models, which demonstrate the applicability of the authors' results to various fields.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of the Laplace Hazard matrix, which provides a novel and powerful tool for analyzing information cascades.
* The derivation of tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes, which can be used to evaluate the quality of influence maximization algorithms.
* The analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical, which provides valuable insights for decision-makers.
* The experimental validation of the authors' bounds, which demonstrates their tightness for various network types and values of T.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the transmission probabilities are integrable, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of their results, such as the assumptions made and the potential biases in the experimental validation.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the supplementary material, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the authors' arguments.
Overall, the paper makes significant contributions to the field of information cascades and provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. The authors' results have the potential to be applied to various fields, including epidemiology, viral marketing, and social network analysis.
