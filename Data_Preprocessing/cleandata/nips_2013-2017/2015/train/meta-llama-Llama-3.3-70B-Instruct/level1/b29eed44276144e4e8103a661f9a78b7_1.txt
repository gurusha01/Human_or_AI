This paper introduces a new graph property, hierarchy width, which is used to analyze the behavior of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. The authors show that for graphs with bounded hierarchy width and factor weight, Gibbs sampling mixes rapidly, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a class of factor graph templates called hierarchical templates. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their contributions.
The paper relates to previous work on Gibbs sampling and factor graphs, and the authors provide a thorough review of the relevant literature. The introduction of hierarchy width as a new graph property is a significant contribution, and the authors demonstrate its usefulness in analyzing the behavior of Gibbs sampling. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between hierarchy width and hypertree width, and the authors show that bounding hierarchy width is necessary for rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and detailed presentation, its thorough review of the literature, and its significant contributions to the field. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of hierarchy width and its relationship to hypertree width, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a class of factor graph templates.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other inference algorithms, and they do not discuss the potential limitations of their approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used in their experiments.
