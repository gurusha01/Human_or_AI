This paper introduces Variational Consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a novel class of data-parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that optimize over aggregation functions to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target posterior. The authors cast the consensus Monte Carlo (CMC) algorithm as a variational Bayes problem, where the goal is to choose an aggregation function that induces a distribution on the global parameter as close as possible to the true posterior.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of the VCMC algorithm. The experimental evaluation is also comprehensive, with three inference tasks from the literature demonstrating the advantages of VCMC over CMC and serial MCMC.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and flexible framework for data-parallel MCMC that can accommodate various aggregation functions and factorizations.
* The provision of a thorough analysis of the properties of the VCMC algorithm, including the relaxation of the objective and the conditions for concavity.
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the advantages of VCMC over CMC and serial MCMC in various settings.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization step in VCMC can be computationally expensive, although the authors provide some evidence that the cost can be moderate and that techniques like data minibatching and adaptive step sizes can improve performance.
* The choice of aggregation function family is critical to the performance of VCMC, and the authors provide some guidance on how to choose this family, but more research is needed to fully understand the implications of different choices.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and significant contribution to the field of data-parallel MCMC.
* The technical analysis is thorough and well-done, providing a clear understanding of the properties of the VCMC algorithm.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the advantages of VCMC over CMC and serial MCMC.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The optimization step in VCMC can be computationally expensive, which may limit its applicability in some settings.
* The choice of aggregation function family is critical to the performance of VCMC, and more research is needed to fully understand the implications of different choices.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the advantages of VCMC over CMC and serial MCMC are clearly demonstrated. While there are some potential weaknesses, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted.
