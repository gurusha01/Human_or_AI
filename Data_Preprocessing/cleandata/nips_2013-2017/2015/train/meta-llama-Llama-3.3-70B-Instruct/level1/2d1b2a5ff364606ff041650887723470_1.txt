This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and estimation, particularly in the context of non-linear measurements. The authors extend the classical work of Brillinger and recent results by Plan and Vershynin to provide a precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for estimating structured signals from non-linear measurements. The main result shows that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear, with a scaling factor and noise variance that depend on the link function.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and motivation. The technical contributions are substantial, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm, including a precise error prediction and a characterization of the optimal quantizer for q-bit compressive sensing.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A significant extension of existing results to the case of non-linear measurements, which is a common scenario in many applications.
* A precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm, including a characterization of the optimal quantizer for q-bit compressive sensing.
* A clear and concise presentation of the technical contributions, including a detailed introduction to the problem and the necessary background.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a Gaussian distribution for the measurement matrix, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The analysis is asymptotic, which may not provide accurate results for finite problem sizes.
* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field and provides a thorough analysis of the Generalized LASSO algorithm for estimating structured signals from non-linear measurements. The results have important implications for various applications, including compressive sensing and signal processing.
