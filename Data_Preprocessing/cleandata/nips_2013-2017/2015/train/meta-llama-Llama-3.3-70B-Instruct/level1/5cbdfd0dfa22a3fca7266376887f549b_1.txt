This paper presents a novel algorithm for sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and signal processing. The authors propose an efficient computational algorithm that modifies Leurgans' algorithm for tensor factorization, relying on a reduction of the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition via tensor contraction. The algorithm is shown to be computationally efficient and scalable, with a computational complexity of O(n^3), which is significantly better than existing tensor unfolding-based approaches.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees for exact recovery under certain conditions. The authors introduce incoherence parameters to measure the degree of sparsity and low-rankness of the tensor, and provide bounds on these parameters to ensure exact recovery. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in recovering the sparse and low-rank components of a tensor.
The paper also discusses various extensions of the algorithm, including higher-order tensors, block sparsity, tensor completion, and non-convex approaches. These extensions demonstrate the flexibility and modularity of the proposed algorithm, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
