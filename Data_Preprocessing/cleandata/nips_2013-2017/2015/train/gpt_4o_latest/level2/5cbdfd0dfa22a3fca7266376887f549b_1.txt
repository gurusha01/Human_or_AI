The paper addresses the problem of robust low-rank tensor decomposition in the presence of sparse adversarial corruption. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that modifies Leurgans' tensor factorization method by leveraging tensor contraction to reduce the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's recovery performance under specific incoherence and sparsity conditions and validates the method through numerical experiments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, avoids tensor unfolding, and is modular, allowing extensions to higher-order tensors and other settings such as tensor completion and block sparsity.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a novel application of tensor contraction to decompose corrupted tensors efficiently, avoiding the computational overhead of tensor unfolding. This is a significant improvement over existing methods.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis, including conditions for exact recovery and deterministic and probabilistic guarantees under random sparsity models. These results extend the robust PCA framework to tensors.
3. Scalability: The algorithm is computationally efficient, with a complexity of \(O(n^3)\) for third-order tensors, significantly outperforming tensor unfolding methods (\(O(n^4)\)).
4. Practical Validation: The numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering low-rank and sparse components, even for large tensors, and validate its robustness to varying sparsity levels.
5. Modularity: The algorithm's modular design allows extensions to higher-order tensors, block sparsity, and tensor completion, making it broadly applicable in machine learning and signal processing.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, the presentation is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with tensor algebra. Simplifying explanations and providing more intuitive insights into the algorithm would improve accessibility.
2. Experimental Scope: The numerical experiments are limited to synthetic datasets. Real-world applications, such as topic modeling or neuroscience, would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
3. Parameter Selection: The paper briefly mentions cross-validation for selecting regularization parameters but does not provide detailed guidance or empirical analysis of parameter sensitivity.
4. Robustness to Noise: The paper focuses on adversarial sparse corruption but does not analyze the algorithm's performance under random noise or mixed noise models, which are common in real-world scenarios.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in tensor decomposition with a novel and computationally efficient approach.
- Theoretical guarantees and numerical validation provide strong evidence of the method's effectiveness.
- The modularity and scalability of the algorithm make it a valuable contribution to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of real-world experiments limits the demonstration of practical utility.
- The dense presentation may hinder comprehension for a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The authors should focus on improving the clarity of the presentation, expanding the experimental section to include real-world datasets, and providing more detailed guidance on parameter selection. These changes would significantly enhance the paper's impact and accessibility.
