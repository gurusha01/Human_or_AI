The paper addresses the problem of estimating a structured signal \( x0 \) from nonlinear measurements of the form \( yi = gi(ai^T x_0) \), where \( g(\cdot) \) is a potentially unknown nonlinear link function. The authors extend the Generalized LASSO framework to this nonlinear setting and provide precise asymptotic error predictions for the estimator when the measurement matrix \( A \) has i.i.d. Gaussian entries. The main contribution is the derivation of an equivalence between the performance of the Generalized LASSO under nonlinear measurements and its performance under appropriately scaled noisy linear measurements, characterized by parameters \( \mu \) and \( \sigma^2 \) derived from the link function \( g(\cdot) \). This result is supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulations for various structured signal recovery tasks, including sparse, group-sparse, and low-rank matrix recovery. The paper also explores the practical application of these results to optimize quantization schemes in compressive sensing.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper provides the first known precise asymptotic error expressions for the Generalized LASSO under nonlinear measurements. This is a significant theoretical advancement, as previous works only offered loose bounds or non-asymptotic results.
2. Generality: The framework is broadly applicable, covering a wide range of link functions \( g(\cdot) \), regularizers \( f(\cdot) \), and structured signal models, making it relevant to multiple domains such as signal processing, statistics, and machine learning.
3. Practical Implications: The application to quantization design in compressive sensing demonstrates the practical utility of the theoretical results. The use of the Lloyd-Max algorithm to optimize quantization thresholds and levels is particularly compelling.
4. Clarity of Results: Theorems are stated clearly, with explicit expressions for the asymptotic error and its dependence on key parameters (\( \mu, \sigma^2, \delta, \lambda \)). The inclusion of illustrative figures further aids understanding.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions and Limitations: The analysis relies on specific assumptions, such as i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices and asymptotic regimes (\( n, m \to \infty \)). While these are standard in theoretical studies, their practical applicability to real-world scenarios with non-Gaussian or finite-dimensional settings is not fully addressed.
2. Complexity of Derivations: The derivations, while rigorous, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced convex optimization or the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT). A more intuitive explanation of the key insights could improve accessibility.
3. Experimental Validation: Although the theoretical results are validated through simulations, the experiments are limited in scope. Additional empirical studies on real-world datasets or non-Gaussian measurement matrices could strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional signal recovery and provides practical insights into quantization design. While some assumptions limit its immediate applicability, the results are novel, well-supported, and have significant potential for impact. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve accessibility and expand experimental validation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and precise theoretical results.
- Broad applicability to structured signal recovery.
- Practical relevance demonstrated through quantization design.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited discussion of non-Gaussian or finite-dimensional settings.
- Dense theoretical exposition may hinder accessibility.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing the state of the art in machine learning and signal processing.
