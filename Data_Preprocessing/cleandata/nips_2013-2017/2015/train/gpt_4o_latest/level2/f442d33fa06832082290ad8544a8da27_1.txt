This paper introduces "skip-thought vectors," a novel approach for unsupervised learning of generic sentence representations. The authors propose an encoder-decoder model that reconstructs surrounding sentences of a given passage, inspired by the skip-gram model for word embeddings. The model is trained on the BookCorpus dataset, leveraging its diversity to produce robust sentence encodings. A key contribution is the vocabulary expansion method, which maps unseen words into the encoder's embedding space using pre-trained word2vec vectors. The resulting sentence representations are evaluated across eight tasks, including semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, and several classification benchmarks, using linear classifiers without fine-tuning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Generality: The skip-thought model introduces a new unsupervised objective for learning sentence representations, abstracting away from task-specific supervision. This is a significant departure from prior methods that rely on supervised tasks.
2. Robust Evaluation: The authors evaluate the model across diverse tasks, demonstrating its versatility and robustness. Notably, skip-thought vectors outperform or match state-of-the-art methods in semantic relatedness and paraphrase detection, even without task-specific tuning.
3. Scalability: The vocabulary expansion method is a practical solution to the out-of-vocabulary problem, enabling the model to encode nearly a million words despite being trained on a smaller vocabulary.
4. Reproducibility: The use of linear classifiers for evaluation ensures that the results are straightforward to reproduce, emphasizing the quality of the learned representations rather than complex downstream models.
5. Insightful Analysis: The paper provides qualitative examples and visualizations (e.g., t-SNE plots) that illustrate the semantic and syntactic properties captured by skip-thought vectors.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Innovation in Architecture: While the objective function is novel, the encoder-decoder architecture is largely borrowed from existing work in neural machine translation. The paper could have explored alternative architectures or deeper models, as acknowledged in the conclusion.
2. Performance on Classification Tasks: Skip-thought vectors underperform compared to supervised models on sentiment and classification benchmarks, indicating that generic representations may not always suffice for fine-grained tasks.
3. Training Complexity: Training the model for two weeks on a large corpus may limit accessibility for researchers without substantial computational resources.
4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not thoroughly address potential weaknesses, such as the reliance on contiguous text for training or the challenges of scaling to larger datasets.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong scientific contribution by proposing a novel, unsupervised method for learning sentence representations and rigorously evaluating its utility across multiple tasks. While there are areas for improvement, such as exploring deeper architectures and addressing computational challenges, the work is well-aligned with the goals of the conference. I recommend acceptance, as the skip-thought model advances the state of the art in unsupervised representation learning and provides a robust baseline for future research.
