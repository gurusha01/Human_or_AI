This paper introduces the novel concept of hierarchy width as a graph property to analyze the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs and demonstrates its utility in ensuring polynomial mixing time under bounded weights. The authors also propose a new class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which guarantee polynomial mixing time when instantiated with logical or ratio semantics. The paper is well-motivated, addressing the gap in theoretical guarantees for Gibbs sampling, and provides both theoretical results and empirical validation.
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The introduction of hierarchy width is a significant theoretical advancement. It extends the understanding of graph properties beyond hypertree width, which is insufficient to guarantee rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide clear definitions, proofs, and lemmas to support their claims. The main result, Theorem 2, is well-supported and establishes a direct connection between hierarchy width, factor weights, and mixing time.
3. Practical Relevance: The identification of hierarchical templates as a class of factor graphs with bounded hierarchy width is highly relevant for real-world applications, particularly in natural language processing and knowledge base population tasks.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic and real-world data effectively demonstrate the practical implications of hierarchy width and the benefits of logical and ratio semantics. Notably, the Paleontology application achieves superior performance compared to human volunteers, underscoring the practical utility of the proposed approach.
5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of concepts and a logical progression from theoretical results to practical applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Empirical Validation: While the experiments are compelling, the synthetic dataset and a single real-world application may not fully capture the diversity of factor graphs encountered in practice. Additional experiments on a broader range of datasets and domains would strengthen the paper.
2. Assumptions on Factor Weights: The results rely on bounded factor weights, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. The paper could benefit from a discussion of how to handle cases where this assumption is violated.
3. Computational Complexity of Hierarchy Width: Although the authors claim that hierarchy width can be computed in polynomial time for fixed k, the practical feasibility of this computation for large graphs is not discussed in detail.
4. Comparison with Other Inference Methods: While the paper focuses on Gibbs sampling, it would be valuable to compare the proposed approach with other inference methods, such as belief propagation or lifted inference, in terms of both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution and provides practical insights into the behavior of Gibbs sampling. However, addressing the limitations in empirical validation and discussing the computational feasibility of hierarchy width would enhance its impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The concept of hierarchy width is novel and addresses a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of Gibbs sampling.
- The results are rigorously proven and have practical relevance, particularly for hierarchical templates.
- The empirical results, though limited, are promising and demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The scope of empirical validation is somewhat narrow, and the assumptions on factor weights may limit the generalizability of the results.
- The computational practicality of hierarchy width computation is not fully explored.
In summary, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field and is likely to stimulate further research on graph properties and their implications for inference algorithms.
