The paper addresses the problem of high-dimensional structured estimation with norm-regularized estimators, such as Lasso, under sub-exponential design matrices and noise. This is a significant extension of prior work, which primarily focuses on sub-Gaussian settings. The authors establish that the sample complexity and estimation error in the sub-exponential case depend on the exponential width of sets, rather than the Gaussian width. They further demonstrate that the exponential width is at most √log(p) times the Gaussian width, allowing prior Gaussian-width-based results to be leveraged. Additionally, for Lasso and Group Lasso, the authors show that the sample complexity matches that of sub-Gaussian designs through a VC-dimension-based analysis. These contributions are novel and relevant to applications involving heavy-tailed data, such as climate science and finance.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending theoretical guarantees for norm-regularized estimators to sub-exponential settings, which are more general and practically relevant.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The analysis is mathematically rigorous, leveraging tools like generic chaining to relate exponential and Gaussian widths. The results are well-supported by proofs and prior literature.
3. Practical Relevance: The work is applicable to real-world scenarios where sub-exponential distributions are common, such as extreme-value phenomena in climate science.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments effectively demonstrate the theoretical findings, showing slower error decay for sub-exponential designs compared to Gaussian ones.
5. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly outlines its key contributions, including the relationship between exponential and Gaussian widths, and the sample complexity results for Lasso and Group Lasso.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Experimental Scope: While the experiments validate the theoretical results, they are limited to synthetic data and specific norms (`l1` and group-sparse norms). Real-world datasets or additional norms could enhance the paper's practical impact.
2. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. Simplifying some explanations or providing intuitive insights could improve readability.
3. Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss its limitations, such as the √log(p) penalty in sample complexity compared to sub-Gaussian cases or the potential challenges in extending the results to other norms.
4. Future Work: While the authors mention extending the stronger RE condition results to all norms, a more detailed discussion of future directions would be beneficial.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in high-dimensional estimation with sub-exponential data.
- The theoretical contributions are novel, rigorous, and well-supported.
- The results have practical relevance to fields where heavy-tailed data is common.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental validation is somewhat limited in scope.
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions are both novel and impactful. However, the authors should consider improving the clarity of presentation and expanding the experimental section in a future revision.
