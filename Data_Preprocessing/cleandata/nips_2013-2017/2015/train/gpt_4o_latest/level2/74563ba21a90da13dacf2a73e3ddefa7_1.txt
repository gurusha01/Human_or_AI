The paper addresses the challenge of statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a key representation in topological data analysis (TDA). The authors propose a universal kernel for persistence diagrams, enabling their embedding into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). This kernel facilitates the application of kernel-based statistical methods, such as two-sample hypothesis testing, to persistence diagrams. The authors demonstrate the universality of their kernel, a property crucial for distinguishing probability distributions, and validate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a universal kernel for persistence diagrams, addressing a critical gap in the statistical treatment of TDA. The approach builds on prior work by Reininghaus et al. and extends it with theoretical guarantees of universality, which is a substantial improvement.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a well-structured theoretical foundation, including proofs of kernel universality and its applicability to RKHS embeddings. The use of Theorem 1 to construct the universal kernel is particularly elegant.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments on synthetic data (e.g., torus vs. sphere discrimination) and real-world datasets (e.g., lateral ventricles and corpus callosum surfaces) effectively demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed kernel. The results highlight the kernel's ability to detect statistically significant differences in persistence diagrams.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a clear progression from theoretical development to experimental validation. The inclusion of background material on persistent homology and RKHS embeddings ensures accessibility to a broad audience.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope of Experiments: While the experiments are compelling, they are somewhat limited in scope. For instance, the real-world datasets focus primarily on medical imaging, and it would be beneficial to see applications in other domains where TDA is used, such as materials science or network analysis.
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The results depend on the choice of kernel scale (Ïƒ) and heat kernel signature (HKS) time. However, the paper provides limited guidance on selecting these parameters, which could hinder reproducibility and practical adoption.
3. Compactness Assumption: The kernel's universality relies on restricting the space of persistence diagrams to a compact subset. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, further discussion on how this impacts real-world applications would strengthen the paper.
4. Comparison to Alternatives: Although the authors reference related work (e.g., persistence landscapes), a more detailed empirical comparison with these methods would provide stronger evidence of the proposed kernel's advantages.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Theoretical innovation with practical implications for TDA.
- Rigorous proofs and well-executed experiments.
- Addresses a critical gap in statistical TDA, enabling broader use of persistence diagrams in machine learning.
Cons:
- Limited experimental diversity and parameter sensitivity issues.
- Dependence on compactness assumptions, which may restrict generalizability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a significant advancement in the statistical treatment of persistence diagrams and has the potential to impact both theoretical and applied TDA. While there are some limitations, they do not detract from the core contributions. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address parameter sensitivity and expand the discussion on the compactness assumption.
