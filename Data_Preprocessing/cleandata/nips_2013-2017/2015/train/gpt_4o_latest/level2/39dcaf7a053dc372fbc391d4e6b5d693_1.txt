The paper presents a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in anisotropic 3D electron microscopy (EM) images, leveraging advancements in deep learning. The authors propose a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional network (ConvNet) architecture, recursive training, and the use of ZNN, a multicore CPU-based implementation for 3D ConvNets. These innovations are shown to significantly improve boundary detection accuracy, with potential applications beyond connectomics, such as video processing and general image labeling tasks.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contributions: The paper introduces three key innovations: (1) deeper networks for improved accuracy, (2) hybrid 2D-3D filters tailored for anisotropic 3D data, and (3) a recursive training framework that enhances boundary detection by iteratively refining results. These contributions are well-motivated and address limitations in prior work.
2. Performance Gains: The proposed methods outperform the baseline (N4) in both pixel-wise classification error (8.76% vs. 10.63%) and Rand F-scores, demonstrating their effectiveness. The qualitative results further highlight the superiority of the hybrid 2D-3D approach in reducing false detections.
3. Reproducibility: The authors provide sufficient implementation details, including network architectures, training procedures, and hyperparameters. The use of publicly available datasets and ZNN ensures that the work can be reproduced and extended.
4. Broader Applicability: The hybrid 2D-3D architecture and recursive framework are positioned as generalizable techniques, with potential applications in video processing and other image labeling problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Comparison to State-of-the-Art: While the paper compares its methods to the N4 baseline, it does not benchmark against more recent state-of-the-art approaches in boundary detection or segmentation. This limits the ability to contextualize the significance of the reported improvements.
2. Dataset Specificity: The experiments are conducted on a single dataset (mouse piriform cortex), which may limit generalizability. While the authors argue for broader applicability, additional datasets from diverse domains would strengthen this claim.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense, and some sections, such as the discussion of ZNN's implementation, could be streamlined for clarity. Additionally, the recursive framework's biological analogy, while interesting, could be more succinctly tied to the technical contributions.
4. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss potential limitations, such as the computational cost of training deeper networks or the challenges of applying ZNN to GPU-based systems, which are more common in deep learning.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro: The paper presents significant technical innovations with demonstrated performance improvements and potential for broader impact.  
Con: Limited benchmarking and dataset diversity reduce the generalizability and contextual significance of the results.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong contribution to the field of connectomics and deep learning for boundary detection. However, the authors should address the lack of comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and provide additional clarity in the presentation. Expanding the experiments to include more datasets or discussing the generalizability in greater depth would further strengthen the paper.
