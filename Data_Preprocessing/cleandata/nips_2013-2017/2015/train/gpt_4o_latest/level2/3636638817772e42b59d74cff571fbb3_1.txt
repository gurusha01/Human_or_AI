The paper presents novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms, termed GoSta-sync and GoSta-async, for decentralized computation of U-statistics in networks. U-statistics, such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and within-cluster point scatter, are critical for describing global statistical properties but have been underexplored in decentralized settings. The authors establish convergence rate bounds of \(O(1/t)\) for the synchronous algorithm and \(O(\log t/t)\) for the asynchronous version, with explicit data- and network-dependent terms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the prior U2-gossip algorithm in terms of convergence speed, memory, and communication efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper addresses a significant gap in decentralized computation by focusing on U-statistics, which are more complex than traditional mean or sum statistics. The introduction of phantom nodes for convergence analysis is particularly innovative.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed convergence proofs and rate bounds, which are supported by clear mathematical formulations. The dependency of convergence rates on network properties (e.g., spectral gap) is well-articulated.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithms are designed with real-world constraints in mind, such as limited memory and asynchronous communication, making them suitable for large-scale distributed systems.
4. Empirical Validation: Numerical experiments on real datasets (e.g., SMVguide3 and Wine Quality) convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over U2-gossip across various network topologies. The inclusion of both synchronous and asynchronous settings enhances practical applicability.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the algorithms, theoretical results, and experimental setups. The supplementary material appears to provide additional insights, though not reviewed here.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Applications: While the paper demonstrates the algorithms on AUC and within-cluster point scatter, it would benefit from exploring additional U-statistics or broader applications to highlight generalizability.
2. Comparison to Baselines: The experimental section primarily compares the proposed methods to U2-gossip. Including comparisons to other decentralized algorithms (e.g., for mean or sum statistics) could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. Asynchronous Algorithm Analysis: Although GoSta-async performs well in practice, its theoretical analysis is less detailed compared to the synchronous version. A deeper exploration of the constants affecting the \(O(\log t/t)\) convergence rate would strengthen the paper.
4. Scalability Discussion: While the experiments demonstrate scalability to larger networks, the paper lacks a detailed discussion of computational and communication overheads as network size increases.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong contribution to decentralized computation, particularly for U-statistics, and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. The theoretical and empirical results are compelling, and the proposed algorithms address practical challenges in distributed systems. However, the authors should consider expanding the scope of applications and providing more detailed comparisons to other baseline methods. Additionally, a more thorough analysis of the asynchronous algorithm would further enhance the paper's impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and significant contribution to decentralized computation.
- Strong theoretical foundation with practical relevance.
- Empirical results validate the proposed methods' superiority.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited exploration of broader applications and baselines.
- Asynchronous algorithm analysis could be more comprehensive.
Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
