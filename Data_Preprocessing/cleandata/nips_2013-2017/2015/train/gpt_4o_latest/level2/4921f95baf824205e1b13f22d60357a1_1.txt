The paper presents a theoretical and empirical investigation into the use of the common neighbors heuristic for link prediction and clustering in network-structured data, particularly under the stochastic blockmodel framework. The authors claim three primary contributions: (1) a theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic, (2) identification of two graph density regimes (semi-dense and semi-sparse) where the heuristic performs well, and (3) the introduction of a "cleaning" step to improve performance in sparser graphs. Empirical results on simulated and real-world datasets validate these claims.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic under the stochastic blockmodel, addressing a gap in the literature. The distinction between semi-dense and semi-sparse regimes is a meaningful contribution that enhances our understanding of when and why the heuristic works.
2. Practical Relevance: The common neighbors heuristic is computationally efficient and widely used in practice. The paper's findings, particularly the cleaning step, could directly improve its utility in real-world applications.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets are well-designed and support the theoretical claims. The comparison with spectral clustering and the Katz score demonstrates the practical competitiveness of the proposed approach.
4. Clarity of Results: The theoretical results are clearly stated, with proofs and conditions for success provided. The separation of regimes (semi-dense vs. semi-sparse) is intuitive and well-motivated.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Real-World Experiments: While the experiments on real-world datasets are useful, they are limited to co-authorship networks. Broader validation on other types of networks (e.g., social, biological, or infrastructure networks) would strengthen the paper's claims.
2. Dependence on Stochastic Blockmodel Assumptions: The theoretical results rely heavily on the stochastic blockmodel, which may not capture the complexity of real-world networks. The paper could benefit from a discussion of how robust the findings are to deviations from this model.
3. Cleaning Step Complexity: While the cleaning step improves performance in sparse graphs, its computational cost and scalability are not thoroughly analyzed. This could be a concern for very large networks.
4. Limited Discussion of Related Work: Although the paper references prior work, the discussion of how the proposed approach compares to other similarity-based and model-based methods (e.g., random walks, latent space models) could be more comprehensive.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Extend the empirical evaluation to include a wider variety of real-world networks and compare against additional baseline methods.
2. Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the cleaning step and its scalability to large graphs.
3. Discuss the limitations of the stochastic blockmodel and explore how the approach might generalize to other network models.
4. Include a more thorough comparison with other heuristic and model-based link prediction methods in the related work section.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of network analysis. The theoretical insights into the common neighbors heuristic and the proposed cleaning step are valuable, and the empirical results are promising. However, the paper would benefit from broader validation and a more detailed discussion of computational trade-offs and generalizability. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to address the scope of experiments and computational analysis. 
Arguments for Acceptance
- Novel theoretical contributions with clear practical implications.
- Strong empirical support for the proposed methods.

Arguments Against Acceptance
- Limited validation on diverse real-world networks.
- Heavy reliance on the stochastic blockmodel, which may limit generalizability.
