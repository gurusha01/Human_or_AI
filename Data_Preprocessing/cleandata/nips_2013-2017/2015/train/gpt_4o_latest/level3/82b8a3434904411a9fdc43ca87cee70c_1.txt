The paper presents a novel framework for computing cross-validation (CV) error lower bounds as a function of the regularization parameter, aimed at providing theoretical guarantees for hyperparameter tuning in binary linear classification. This work builds on prior studies of regularization paths and safe screening, combining these ideas in a unique way to address the practical challenges of hyperparameter selection. The proposed method is particularly notable for its ability to work with approximate solutions, making it computationally efficient while still offering theoretical guarantees on test error. This contribution is significant as it bridges the gap between theoretical rigor and practical usability in hyperparameter tuning, a longstanding challenge in machine learning.
Strengths
The paper is technically sound, with clear theoretical derivations and well-motivated problem setups. The authors provide rigorous definitions for key concepts, such as ε-approximate regularization parameters, and demonstrate the utility of their framework through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The experimental results are promising, showing that the proposed method can achieve theoretical guarantees with reasonable computational costs. Additionally, the method's compatibility with existing optimization techniques, such as grid search and Bayesian optimization, enhances its practical relevance. The writing is generally clear and well-organized, making the paper accessible to readers with a background in machine learning and optimization.
Weaknesses
While the paper is strong overall, there are areas for improvement. First, the distinction between ε-approximate solutions for training and validation errors is not sufficiently clear, which could lead to confusion for readers. Explicitly separating these definitions would improve clarity. Second, the term "ε-approximate regularization parameter" could be more intuitively renamed as "ε-approximate best regularization parameter" to better reflect its meaning. Third, the discussion of the theoretical complexity of the proposed approach as a function of ε is limited. Specifically, the impact of naively chosen, equally spaced C values on computational efficiency and approximation quality warrants further exploration. Finally, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion of its connections to path methods for training error, as this would situate the work more firmly within the broader literature.
Minor Corrections
There are a few minor typographical errors: in line 61, "the" should be replaced with "this," and in line 264, "soluitons" should be corrected to "solutions."
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of hyperparameter tuning by introducing a novel framework that combines theoretical guarantees with practical efficiency. While there are minor issues with clarity and theoretical discussion, these do not detract significantly from the quality of the work. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses and minor corrections.
