This paper addresses the challenging problem of estimating sparse graphical models for high-dimensional tensor-valued data, leveraging the assumption of a Kronecker product covariance structure. The authors propose an alternating minimization algorithm (Tlasso) that provably achieves optimal statistical rates of convergence and consistent graph recovery, even in the extreme case of having only one tensor sample. This is a significant advancement over prior work, which either lacked efficient algorithms or achieved slower convergence rates. The theoretical contributions are complemented by strong empirical results demonstrating the algorithm's computational efficiency and accuracy.
The irrepresentability condition (IC) plays a critical role in the theoretical guarantees of the proposed method. IC ensures that the influence of non-informative edges on the true graph structure is bounded, which is crucial for achieving model selection consistency. The authors provide a clear and rigorous treatment of IC in their analysis, particularly in Theorem 3.9, where they establish optimal rates of convergence in max norm under this condition. However, the paper could benefit from a more intuitive explanation of IC for readers less familiar with its implications in high-dimensional settings.
Theorem 3.5 is a key result, showing that the Tlasso algorithm achieves consistent estimation after a single iteration, provided the initialization satisfies Condition (3.4). The dependence on \(\alpha\) in this condition is well-articulated, and the authors convincingly argue that random initialization typically satisfies the requirement. This robustness to initialization is a practical strength of the method. However, further discussion on the implications of \(\alpha\) for real-world datasets and initialization strategies would enhance the paper's accessibility.
The paper's focus on tensor graphical models is novel, but the authors should explore potential extensions to other machine learning problems, such as tensor decomposition or multi-view learning. This could broaden the impact of their work and inspire future research.
While the claim of achieving consistent learning with one sample is compelling, it raises questions about practical applicability. The authors should clarify the assumptions under which this result holds and discuss potential limitations, such as the sensitivity to noise or the sparsity level of the true graph.
Minor typographical errors on lines 177, 181, and 190 should be corrected for clarity. Despite these minor issues, the paper is well-written and organized, with a solid theoretical foundation and a strong experimental setup. The sample complexity results are particularly impressive, and the numerical studies convincingly demonstrate the advantages of Tlasso over competing methods.
Pros:
1. Strong theoretical guarantees, including optimal rates of convergence and model selection consistency.
2. Novel contribution to tensor graphical models with practical implications.
3. Computationally efficient algorithm with robust empirical performance.
Cons:
1. Limited discussion on extending the method to other machine learning problems.
2. Potential overstatement of the practicality of learning with one sample.
3. Minor typographical errors and a need for more intuitive explanations of key concepts.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional graphical models and is a strong candidate for acceptance.
