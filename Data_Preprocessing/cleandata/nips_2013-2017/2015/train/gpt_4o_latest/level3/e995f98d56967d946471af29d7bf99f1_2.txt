The paper presents a novel training approach for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) called Scheduled Sampling, which aims to address the discrepancy between training and inference phases in sequence prediction tasks. During training, RNNs traditionally rely on ground truth tokens as inputs, whereas during inference, they must rely on their own predictions. This mismatch can lead to error accumulation. The proposed method gradually transitions the model from using ground truth tokens to using its own predictions during training, thereby bridging this gap. The approach is evaluated across diverse tasks, including image captioning, constituency parsing, and speech recognition, demonstrating significant performance improvements over strong baselines.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with a well-motivated approach grounded in curriculum learning. The authors provide a clear theoretical framework for scheduled sampling and support their claims with extensive experimental results across multiple domains.
2. Significance: The proposed method addresses a critical issue in RNN training, offering a practical solution that has the potential to impact a wide range of sequence prediction tasks. The demonstrated improvements in tasks like image captioning (e.g., winning the MSCOCO 2015 challenge) highlight its real-world applicability.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to proposed solution, experiments, and conclusions. The inclusion of detailed experimental setups and results enhances reproducibility.
4. Performance: The method consistently outperforms baselines across tasks, showcasing its versatility. The results on image captioning, in particular, are compelling, with improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Decay Schedules: While the paper introduces different decay schedules (linear, exponential, inverse sigmoid), it lacks a detailed analysis of their relative strengths and weaknesses. A deeper exploration of how these schedules impact convergence and performance would be valuable.
2. Training Challenges: The paper does not sufficiently address potential challenges in training with scheduled sampling, such as sensitivity to hyperparameters or the risk of slower convergence in some cases.
3. Reproducibility: Although the experimental setups are described, the paper could benefit from providing more implementation details, such as specific hyperparameter values and code availability, to facilitate reproducibility.
4. Computational Cost: The paper does not explicitly discuss the computational overhead introduced by scheduled sampling, especially in comparison to standard training methods.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a well-recognized issue in sequence prediction with a novel and effective solution.
- It demonstrates strong empirical results across diverse tasks, indicating broad applicability.
- The method is simple to implement and does not significantly increase training time, making it practical for real-world use.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of detailed analysis of decay schedules and training challenges leaves some questions unanswered.
- The paper could improve its discussion of reproducibility and computational costs.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence modeling and is well-aligned with the conference's focus on advancing state-of-the-art machine learning methods. While there are minor areas for improvement, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend accepting the paper, with the suggestion to address the noted concerns in the final version.
