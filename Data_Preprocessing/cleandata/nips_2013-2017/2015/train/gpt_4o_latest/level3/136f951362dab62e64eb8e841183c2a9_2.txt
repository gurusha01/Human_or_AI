Review
This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates self-exciting point processes with low-rank models to address two key challenges in recommender systems: recommending the most relevant item at the right time and predicting the next returning time of users. The authors present a low-rank Hawkes process model that captures both temporal and recurrent user-item interactions. The model is optimized using a convex formulation, and the authors develop an efficient algorithm that combines proximal gradient and conditional gradient methods. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the model's scalability and predictive performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces an interesting combination of self-exciting point processes and low-rank models, which has not been extensively explored in the literature. This approach provides a unified framework for capturing temporal and recurrent dynamics in recommendation tasks.
2. Practical Significance: The proposed method addresses real-world challenges in time-sensitive recommendation systems, such as predicting user engagement and optimizing marketing strategies. The ability to incorporate additional contextual information (e.g., spatial, textual, user profiles) further enhances its practical utility.
3. Optimization Algorithm: The development of an efficient optimization algorithm with an \(O(1/t)\) convergence rate is a notable contribution. The algorithm is scalable to large datasets, as demonstrated by experiments involving millions of user-item pairs and hundreds of millions of events.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., Last.fm, Tmall, MIMIC II) are thorough, showcasing the model's superior performance in item recommendation and returning-time prediction tasks compared to strong baselines.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Baselines: While the paper compares its method to several baselines, it lacks an ensemble baseline combining STiC and SVD, which could provide a stronger benchmark for evaluating the model's performance.
2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper does not provide sufficient details on how hyperparameters (e.g., \(\sigma\), latent vector dimensions) are selected or their sensitivity to the model's performance. This omission makes it difficult for readers to reproduce the results or understand the robustness of the method.
3. Dataset Details: The datasets used in the experiments are not fully characterized in terms of recurring events and irregular temporal patterns. Providing such statistics would help contextualize the results and validate the model's applicability to diverse scenarios.
4. Clarity and Presentation: The paper's presentation could be improved. There are several language issues, typos, and grammatical errors that detract from readability. Additionally, some technical details, such as the derivation of the optimization algorithm, are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a practical and underexplored problem in recommender systems with a novel and technically sound approach.
- The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over existing baselines in both synthetic and real-world settings.
- The optimization algorithm is efficient and scalable, which is critical for real-world applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of hyperparameter sensitivity analysis and detailed dataset statistics limits the reproducibility and interpretability of the results.
- The clarity and organization of the paper need improvement, particularly in the technical sections.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of time-sensitive recommendation systems by introducing a novel framework and optimization algorithm. However, the authors should address the issues related to baseline comparisons, hyperparameter sensitivity, dataset characterization, and presentation quality. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, provided these concerns are addressed.
