This paper addresses the problem of high-dimensional structured estimation using \( l1 \) and \( l1/l_2 \)-regularized least squares under isotropic sub-exponential measurements and noise. The authors extend existing results, which primarily focus on sub-Gaussian settings, to the sub-exponential case, showing that sample complexity and estimation error bounds depend on the exponential width of relevant sets. Notably, they demonstrate that the exponential width is at most \( \sqrt{\log p} \) times the Gaussian width, yielding bounds that are only logarithmically worse than the sub-Gaussian case. The analysis leverages advanced empirical process techniques, including generic chaining, and provides theoretical guarantees for popular estimators like Lasso and Group Lasso. The paper also includes experimental validation, comparing Gaussian and sub-exponential settings.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor: The paper is technically sound and employs sophisticated tools like generic chaining to derive its results. The relationship between exponential and Gaussian widths is a significant theoretical contribution.
2. Extension of Prior Work: The results meaningfully extend prior work (e.g., Negahban et al., Rudelson & Zhou) to the sub-exponential setting, addressing a gap in the literature.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with high-dimensional statistics and empirical process theory.
4. Significance for Domain Experts: The results are valuable for researchers in compressed sensing and high-dimensional statistics, particularly for applications involving heavy-tailed distributions, such as finance and climate science.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: While the extension to sub-exponential settings is important, the novelty may be considered incremental, as the results largely adapt existing sub-Gaussian techniques with logarithmic adjustments.
2. Scope Limitation: The focus on isotropic sub-exponential measurements leaves the non-isotropic sub-Gaussian case unaddressed, which could limit the paper's applicability.
3. Missing Citations: The paper would benefit from citing foundational works like Vershynin's tutorial on Gaussian-width-based analysis, which provides context for the techniques used.
4. Experimental Gaps: The experiments lack a direct comparison between sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential measurements, which would better illustrate the sharpness of the theoretical results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a rigorous and well-executed extension of sub-Gaussian results to the sub-exponential setting, addressing a relevant problem in high-dimensional statistics.
- The theoretical contributions, particularly the relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths, are significant for domain experts.
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The novelty is somewhat limited, as the results primarily adapt existing techniques with minor adjustments.
- The experiments could be more comprehensive, particularly in comparing sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential settings.
- The paper's focus on isotropic measurements limits its generality.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of high-dimensional statistics, particularly for researchers working with heavy-tailed distributions. While the novelty is incremental, the technical rigor and clarity of the work make it a strong candidate for acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly addressing the missing citation and enhancing the experimental section.
