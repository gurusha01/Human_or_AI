This paper presents a significant extension of the work by Plan and Vershynin [17], providing novel explicit expressions for the estimation error of the Generalized LASSO in the asymptotic regime, particularly under non-linear measurement models. The authors demonstrate that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements is asymptotically equivalent to that under scaled and noisy linear measurements, with precise characterizations of the scaling factor and noise variance. This result is validated through theoretical analysis and experiments, with applications to sparse, group-sparse, and low-rank recovery, as well as optimal quantizer design in q-bit compressed sensing.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Significance: The paper introduces novel performance estimation error expressions that are asymptotically precise, addressing a gap in the literature. The connection between non-linear and linear measurements is particularly insightful and has potential implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications, such as quantizer design.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The results generalize previous work by providing precise error predictions for a broader class of regularizers and measurement models. The application of these results to sparse, group-sparse, and low-rank recovery demonstrates the versatility of the framework.
3. Validation and Practical Relevance: The authors validate their theoretical findings through experiments, showing that the derived expressions accurately predict estimation performance. The application to optimal quantizer design, with a connection to the Lloyd-Max quantizer, is a compelling practical contribution.
4. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the theoretical results and their implications.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Balance and Detail: Due to space constraints, some sections lack sufficient detail. For example, the derivation of the error expressions and their implications for specific applications (e.g., low-rank recovery) could be elaborated further.
2. Notation Issues: The notation for the Moreau envelope (Page 5, line 294) is awkward and could be revised for clarity. Additionally, the equivalence of regularized and penalized versions (Page 4, line 193) is not adequately explained.
3. Assumption Interpretation: Assumption 1 (Page 5) would benefit from a formal interpretation using variational analysis to enhance its accessibility to readers unfamiliar with the technical details.
4. Minor Errors: There is a typo in Figure 1 caption ('n=768' should be '$n$=768').
Suggestions for Improvement:
- Provide more details on the derivation of the error expressions and their implications for specific applications, particularly low-rank recovery.
- Revise the notation for the Moreau envelope and clarify the equivalence of regularized and penalized versions.
- Include a formal interpretation of Assumption 1 to improve accessibility.
- Address minor errors and typos for better presentation.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional estimation and compressed sensing, with significant implications for both theory and practice. Despite minor weaknesses, the originality, clarity, and relevance of the work merit its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted issues.
