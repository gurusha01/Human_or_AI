This paper introduces Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), a novel extension of the leapfrog discretization in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to handle piecewise smooth distributions with affine boundaries. The authors address a key limitation of traditional HMC, which struggles with high rejection rates when applied to non-smooth distributions. By incorporating reflection and refraction dynamics inspired by physical systems, the proposed method significantly improves sampling efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The paper also provides a rigorous proof of volume conservation, filling a notable gap in prior work and ensuring the correctness of the algorithm. This contribution is an important step forward in making HMC applicable to a broader class of distributions.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The extension of leapfrog dynamics to piecewise smooth distributions is a significant and non-trivial advancement. The algorithm is shown to be correct, with detailed proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance. This ensures that the RHMC method samples from the correct stationary distribution.
2. Novelty and Scope: Unlike prior work, such as Pakman and Paninski's methods for piecewise Gaussian distributions, RHMC generalizes to arbitrary piecewise continuous distributions without requiring closed-form solutions to the Hamiltonian dynamics. This greatly expands the applicability of HMC.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the algorithm, its theoretical underpinnings, and its advantages over baseline HMC. The proofs are thorough and easy to follow for readers familiar with the field.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of RHMC over baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The use of well-defined metrics like Worst Mean Absolute Error (WMAE) strengthens the evaluation.
5. Impact: By reducing the rejection rate and increasing the effective sample size, RHMC has the potential to become a widely used tool in probabilistic inference for complex models.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Overhead: While the paper acknowledges the additional computational cost of detecting intersections and handling reflections/refractions, it would benefit from a more detailed analysis of this trade-off, particularly in real-world applications.
2. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments focus on a single synthetic model with varying dimensionalities. Additional benchmarks on real-world datasets or more diverse distributions would strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Minor Typos: There are small typographical errors, such as "l.161: ',Then'" and "l.376: 'parameters, are tuned'," which should be corrected for clarity.
Recommendation:
This paper is a high-quality contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and Monte Carlo methods. Its technical rigor, novelty, and practical significance make it a strong candidate for acceptance. The strengths far outweigh the minor weaknesses, and the proposed method has the potential to inspire further research and applications. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted typos and expand the experimental evaluation if possible.
