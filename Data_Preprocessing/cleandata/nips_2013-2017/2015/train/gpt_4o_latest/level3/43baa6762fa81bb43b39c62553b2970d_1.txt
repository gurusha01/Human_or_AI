The paper addresses the robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem, introducing a novel concept of local incoherence to analyze matrix decomposition under non-uniform error corruption. Unlike prior work that assumes uniform error distributions, this study refines the analysis by considering entry-specific error probabilities and deriving conditions for successful decomposition using Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). The authors define local incoherence parameters for individual matrix entries, enabling tighter bounds on the number of allowable non-zero entries in the sparse error matrix. The paper also introduces a new weighted norm to handle non-uniform error distributions and provides theoretical guarantees for matrix recovery under both random and fixed sign error models.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The introduction of local incoherence as a finer-grained measure of matrix robustness is a significant departure from the global incoherence assumptions in prior work. This localized perspective provides deeper insights into how individual matrix entries resist error corruption.
2. Technical Contribution: The use of a new weighted norm and the development of concentration properties for this norm represent meaningful technical advancements. The dual certificate construction and proof techniques adapt existing methods to the non-uniform error setting effectively.
3. Practical Implications: The results have clear implications for applications like clustering, where the robustness of specific matrix regions varies. The analysis of cluster matrices demonstrates the utility of the proposed framework in real-world scenarios.
4. Numerical Validation: The experiments convincingly illustrate the theoretical findings, particularly the impact of local incoherence on error tolerance and the benefits of adaptive error distributions.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper's main message and technical contributions are not always presented clearly. The introduction of local incoherence and its role in the proofs could be explained more intuitively for a broader audience.
2. Significance: While the results are novel, their broader impact on the field remains uncertain. The paper does not sufficiently discuss how the proposed framework might influence future research or practical implementations.
3. Complexity of Proofs: The proofs rely on intricate arguments involving weighted norms and dual certificates, but the necessity of some technical components (e.g., the role of the new norm) is not fully justified. This could make the results less accessible to practitioners.
4. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper references prior studies, it does not adequately position its contributions relative to existing methods. For example, the relationship between this work and weighted algorithms for matrix completion could be elaborated.
Recommendation:
The paper offers a novel and technically sound contribution to robust PCA, particularly through its introduction of local incoherence. However, the lack of clarity in presentation and uncertainty regarding the broader significance of the results temper its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on improving the exposition of the main ideas and providing a stronger discussion of the results' implications. Specifically, the authors should clarify the role of local incoherence in the proofs, provide more intuitive explanations, and better contextualize their work within the broader literature.
