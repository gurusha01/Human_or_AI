This paper presents novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for decentralized computation of U-statistics, a class of statistics essential for describing global properties of a statistical population. The authors address a relatively underexplored area in distributed systems, where existing gossip algorithms are inefficient for U-statistics due to their dependency on pairs of observations. The proposed methods are evaluated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline U2-gossip algorithm.
The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and provides a comprehensive introduction to the problem, including its relevance to distributed systems and machine learning tasks such as AUC computation and clustering quality assessment. The authors provide rigorous convergence bounds for both synchronous and asynchronous settings, with rates of \(O(1/t)\) and \(O(\log t/t)\), respectively. These bounds are supported by a novel reformulation of the problem using "phantom nodes," which is a creative and effective analytical tool. Furthermore, the experimental results on two real-world datasets confirm the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of both convergence speed and communication efficiency across various network topologies.
The strengths of the paper lie in its solid theoretical contributions, practical relevance, and empirical validation. The proposed algorithms outperform U2-gossip in terms of convergence rate, memory, and communication costs. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the dependency of convergence rates on network connectivity and data properties, which enhances its applicability to real-world scenarios. The inclusion of both synchronous and asynchronous variants makes the approach versatile for different practical settings.
However, the paper has a few limitations. While the authors demonstrate the theoretical and empirical advantages of their methods, they do not provide runtime per iteration comparisons with U2-gossip. Such comparisons are crucial for assessing the practical utility of the algorithms, especially in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, while the paper references related work extensively, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion on how the proposed methods compare to other decentralized optimization techniques beyond U2-gossip.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in decentralized computation.
2. The proposed methods are theoretically sound, with clear convergence guarantees.
3. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline across multiple datasets and network types.
4. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to a broad audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. The lack of runtime per iteration comparisons limits the assessment of practical efficiency.
2. The discussion of related work could be expanded to include broader comparisons with other decentralized optimization methods.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of decentralized computation and is likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners. Addressing the runtime comparison issue in a revision would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the aforementioned concerns.
