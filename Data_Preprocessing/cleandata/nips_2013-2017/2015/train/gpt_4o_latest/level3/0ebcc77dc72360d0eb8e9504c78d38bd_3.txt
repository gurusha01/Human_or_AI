The paper introduces Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that achieves exponential convergence without relying on auxiliary optimization or the Î´-cover sampling procedure. This represents a significant advancement over existing methods, such as GP-UCB and BaMSOO, which either require impractical sampling techniques or achieve only polynomial regret bounds. By leveraging an unknown semi-metric bound and integrating Gaussian Process (GP) priors, IMGPO effectively balances global and local search efforts, demonstrating theoretical and practical improvements in regret bounds.
The paper is well-written, with clear contributions outlined in the introduction and main sections. Section 3.2 provides an intuitive, illustrative example that aids in understanding the algorithm's mechanics, while Section 3.3 offers a detailed programmatic explanation, making the method accessible for replication and future implementation. The experimental results are compelling, showing that IMGPO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of benchmark functions. The integration of ideas from both bound-based search methods and Bayesian optimization literature is particularly noteworthy, as it bridges two previously distinct approaches.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including a proof of exponential convergence and a detailed exploration of the algorithm's advantages over existing methods. The regret bounds are clearly derived and well-supported.
2. Clarity: The manuscript is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to algorithm description, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The illustrative example in Section 3.2 and the pseudocode in Section 3.3 enhance understanding.
3. Originality: The proposed algorithm introduces a novel approach by considering infinitely many possible bounds, which is a significant departure from traditional GP-based methods. This innovation addresses long-standing challenges in Bayesian optimization.
4. Significance: The results demonstrate that IMGPO advances the state of the art, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements. Its ability to achieve exponential convergence without auxiliary optimization is likely to influence future research and applications in global optimization.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: The paper acknowledges that the algorithm's performance may degrade in high-dimensional settings due to the exponential dependence on dimensionality in the regret bound. While this is a common limitation in Bayesian optimization, further discussion or experiments on scalability would strengthen the paper.
2. Computational Cost: Although IMGPO is faster than traditional GP optimization methods, it is slower than SOO. The trade-off between computational efficiency and performance could be explored in more depth.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical open problem in Bayesian optimization, providing a theoretically sound and practically effective solution.
- The integration of GP priors with infinite-metric exploration is novel and impactful.
- The experimental results are robust and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The scalability issue in high-dimensional spaces remains a limitation, though this is partially mitigated by the authors' discussion and potential future strategies.
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the NIPS community and is recommended for acceptance. It is likely to inspire further research in both Bayesian optimization and bound-based search methods.
