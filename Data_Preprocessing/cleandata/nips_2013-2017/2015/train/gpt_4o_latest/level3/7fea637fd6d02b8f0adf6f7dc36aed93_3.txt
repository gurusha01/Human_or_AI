This paper introduces a novel class of no-regret learning algorithms with recency bias that achieve faster convergence rates in multiplayer normal-form games, extending prior work limited to two-player zero-sum games. The authors demonstrate that their algorithms achieve individual regret rates of \( O(T^{3/4}) \) and approximate social welfare convergence rates of \( O(1/T) \), significantly improving upon the worst-case \( O(T^{1/2}) \) rates. The results are supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, making the paper a strong contribution to the NIPS community.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by generalizing fast convergence results to multiplayer general-sum games, which are more representative of real-world scenarios such as auctions and routing games. The proposed algorithms, particularly the optimistic variants of Mirror Descent and Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL), are well-motivated and theoretically sound. The black-box reduction for maintaining robustness against adversarial opponents while preserving fast rates is an elegant contribution. The experimental results, especially the comparison between Optimistic Hedge and standard Hedge, are compelling and validate the theoretical claims. The paper is well-written, with clear exposition of the problem, contributions, and implications.
Weaknesses:  
1. Convergence Bound Typo: There appears to be a potential typo in the convergence bound formula on page 3, where the root may have been incorrectly removed from the logarithmic term. This should be clarified to ensure the correctness of the theoretical results.  
2. Unclear Terminology: The claim on page 6 regarding "natural" and "decoupled" no-regret dynamics is overly strong and lacks precise definitions. This weakens the rigor of the argument and should be rephrased or better substantiated.  
3. Comparison to Prior Work: The comparison to Hart & Mas-Colell's regret-matching in Corollary 12 could be more explicit, as the current phrasing is somewhat ambiguous.  
4. Partial Information Settings: While the paper focuses on full-information settings, it would be valuable to discuss whether the results can extend to partial information scenarios using sampling-based methods like Optimistic Exp3.  
5. Minor Issues: The paper has some formatting inconsistencies, unclear terms, and incomplete bibliography entries that should be addressed in the camera-ready version.
Pro vs. Con for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper presents a significant theoretical advancement with practical implications for multiplayer games, supported by strong experimental results. It is relevant to the NIPS audience and advances the state of the art in no-regret learning.  
- Con: Minor issues with clarity, a potential typo in a key formula, and the lack of exploration of partial information settings slightly detract from the overall impact.
Conclusion:  
This paper is a high-quality contribution that advances the understanding of no-regret dynamics in multiplayer games. While there are minor issues that need to be addressed, the strengths of the work far outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, contingent on clarifications and corrections to the noted concerns.
