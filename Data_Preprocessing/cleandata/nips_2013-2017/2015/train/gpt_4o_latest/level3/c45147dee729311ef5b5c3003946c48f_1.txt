The paper introduces a Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Network (BRCN) for multi-frame super-resolution (SR), extending the work of Dong et al. (2014) into the temporal domain. The proposed model incorporates time-dependent feature maps and recurrent convolutions to model temporal dependencies in video frames. While the use of recurrent and conditional convolutions is novel and intuitive, the bidirectional aspect of the model is not new, as it has been widely used in NLP and speech recognition since at least 1997. The paper demonstrates that BRCN outperforms existing single-frame and multi-frame SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly lower computational costs.
Strengths:  
1. The use of recurrent and conditional convolutions is a strong contribution, offering an effective mechanism for modeling temporal dependencies without requiring explicit motion estimation, which is computationally expensive.  
2. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets with complex motion, as demonstrated by quantitative and qualitative results.  
3. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, running orders of magnitude faster than traditional multi-frame SR methods, making it practical for real-world applications.  
4. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the architecture, including the forward and backward recurrent sub-networks and their integration.  
Weaknesses:  
1. The bidirectional aspect of the model is not novel and lacks proper citation of prior work on bidirectional RNNs. This omission weakens the originality claim.  
2. The paper does not sufficiently explain the pretraining process for feedforward weights, leaving readers unclear about its necessity and implementation.  
3. The filter visualizations are insufficiently explained, and their connection to the model's performance is not well-articulated.  
4. The paper lacks a strong motivation for the specific architectural choices, such as why recurrent and conditional convolutions work better than alternatives.  
5. Handling of edge effects in convolutional layers is not addressed, which could impact the quality of results near frame boundaries.  
6. Figure 3 reveals ringing artifacts in certain regions, such as around power lines, which the authors do not address.  
7. While the method outperforms prior approaches, the extent of improvement is not clearly quantified, making it difficult to assess its significance.  
Pro Acceptance Arguments:  
- The use of recurrent and conditional convolutions is novel and impactful for temporal dependency modeling.  
- The method achieves strong performance and is computationally efficient, addressing a key limitation of existing multi-frame SR methods.  
Con Acceptance Arguments:  
- The bidirectional aspect lacks novelty and proper citation.  
- Missing details on pretraining and architectural motivation reduce the clarity and reproducibility of the work.  
- Artifacts in the results and insufficient discussion of limitations weaken the paper's overall quality.  
Recommendation:  
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to multi-frame SR through its novel use of recurrent and conditional convolutions. However, the lack of novelty in the bidirectional aspect, insufficient citations, and missing details on pretraining and architectural choices detract from its overall quality. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions to address these issues, particularly the inclusion of missing citations, a clearer explanation of pretraining, and a discussion of the observed artifacts.
