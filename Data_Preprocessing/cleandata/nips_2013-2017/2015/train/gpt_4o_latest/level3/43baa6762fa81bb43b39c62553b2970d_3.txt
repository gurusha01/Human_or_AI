The paper addresses the robust PCA problem under non-uniform error corruption, extending prior work by introducing sufficient conditions for exact recovery using localized incoherence parameters. This is a significant theoretical contribution, as it refines the global incoherence-based analysis traditionally used in robust PCA. By leveraging weighted norms and golfing schemes, the authors provide a more granular understanding of how error corruption probabilities interact with the local structure of the low-rank matrix. The results are theoretically sound and supported by rigorous proofs, including the introduction of a new weighted norm \( l{w(1)} \), which captures the interplay between localized \(\mu0\) and \(\mu_1\).
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper advances the state of the art in robust PCA by characterizing conditions for exact recovery under non-uniform error corruption. This localized analysis is novel and provides deeper insights into the robustness of individual matrix entries.
2. Technical Rigor: The proofs are well-structured, and the use of weighted norms and concentration inequalities is both innovative and technically sound.
3. Numerical Validation: The numerical experiments effectively demonstrate the theoretical results, particularly the impact of local incoherence on recovery performance under adaptive error distributions.
4. Clustering Implications: The connection between local incoherence and clustering problems is insightful, particularly the observation that larger clusters are more robust to errors. This could inspire future applications in graph clustering and related domains.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Motivation: While the theoretical results are compelling, the paper lacks a clear discussion of practical scenarios where non-uniform error probabilities and leverage scores align. The clustering example is helpful but feels tangential to the main focus.
2. Role of \(\mu1\): The necessity of \(\mu1\) in robust PCA is discussed but could benefit from more formal justification or additional numerical experiments to highlight its unique contribution compared to \(\mu_0\).
3. Elimination/Derandomization Arguments: The paper references these arguments but does not formally present them for the non-uniform setting. Including this would strengthen the theoretical framework.
4. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may limit accessibility for readers less familiar with robust PCA or matrix completion. Simplifying some explanations or providing more intuition behind key results could improve clarity.
Recommendation:
While the paper is theoretically robust and makes a meaningful contribution to the field, its practical relevance and clarity could be improved. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the concerns about practical applications, the role of \(\mu_1\), and the formalization of elimination arguments.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Significant theoretical advancement in robust PCA under non-uniform settings.
- Rigorous mathematical analysis and innovative use of weighted norms.
- Strong numerical validation and connection to clustering problems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited discussion of practical applications.
- Lack of formalization for elimination/derandomization arguments.
- Dense presentation that may hinder accessibility.
In conclusion, this paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the robust PCA literature, but addressing the noted weaknesses would enhance its impact and applicability.
