The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of Isotonic Regression by addressing the problem under \( l_p \)-norms and proposing efficient algorithms leveraging Symmetric Diagonally Dominant (SDD) near-linear solvers. The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees and demonstrate practical applicability, particularly for large-scale datasets. Their approach, which relates isotonic regression to graph problems and utilizes fast SDD solvers, is both novel and impactful.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis. The proposed algorithms improve upon prior work in terms of computational complexity, offering faster solutions for \( lp \)-norm isotonic regression on general DAGs. For example, the \( O(m^{1.5} \log^2 n) \) time complexity for \( lp \)-norms and the linear-time algorithm for \( l_\infty \)-norms represent substantial improvements over existing methods.
2. Novelty: The reduction of isotonic regression to a graph problem and the use of SDD solvers is a creative and original approach. Extending Interior Point Methods (IPMs) to \( l_p \)-objectives with relaxed error bounds is another innovative contribution.
3. Significance: The results are highly relevant for both theoretical and practical applications, such as learning monotone functions, class probability estimation, and multi-index models. The algorithms are scalable and applicable to real-world datasets, as evidenced by the experimental results.
4. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and organized. The inclusion of detailed proofs and supplementary material enhances reproducibility. The experimental validation further supports the practical utility of the proposed methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Intuition on Complexity Improvements: While the paper provides rigorous proofs, it could benefit from additional intuition behind the complexity improvements, particularly for readers less familiar with SDD solvers or IPMs. A high-level explanation of why the proposed methods outperform prior approaches would make the work more accessible.
2. Foundational Concepts: The connection between isotonic regression, graph structures, and SDD solvers is novel but could be elaborated further. For instance, a visual or intuitive explanation of the graph-based reduction might help readers unfamiliar with these techniques.
3. Experimental Scope: Although the experiments demonstrate the practicality of the algorithms, they are limited to specific graph structures (e.g., grid graphs and random regular graphs). Additional benchmarks on diverse real-world datasets would strengthen the empirical validation.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are both novel and significant, advancing the state of the art in isotonic regression. The theoretical results are robust, and the practical implications are promising. However, the authors should consider incorporating more intuition and expanding the experimental evaluation to address the identified weaknesses.
