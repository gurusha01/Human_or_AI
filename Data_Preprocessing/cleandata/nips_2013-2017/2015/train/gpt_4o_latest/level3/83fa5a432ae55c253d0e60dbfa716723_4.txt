This paper introduces Principal Differences Analysis (PDA) and its sparse variant, SPARDA, as novel methods for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. By leveraging the Wasserstein distance, the authors propose a framework that identifies projection directions maximizing divergence between distributions, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. The sparse extension, SPARDA, incorporates feature selection, enabling the identification of features responsible for inter-distribution differences. The authors provide algorithms for solving the non-convex optimization problem, including a semidefinite relaxation and a tightening procedure, and demonstrate their approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, such as single-cell RNA-seq data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a relatively unexplored areaâ€”component analysis using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). While prior work, such as Sandler and Lindenbaum (2011), explored EMD in the context of non-negative matrix factorization, this paper extends its application to a broader framework for high-dimensional distribution comparison.
2. Technical Depth: The formulation of the problem as a non-convex optimization task and the development of a semidefinite relaxation demonstrate strong technical rigor. The RELAX algorithm and tightening procedure are well-motivated and provide practical solutions to the inherent challenges of non-convexity.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments showcase the effectiveness of SPARDA in identifying relevant features and improving statistical power in high-dimensional settings. The application to single-cell RNA-seq data highlights the method's utility in real-world scenarios, particularly in uncovering biologically meaningful differences.
4. Broader Impact: The framework extends beyond the Wasserstein distance, suggesting potential applicability to other divergence measures, which could make it a versatile tool for various domains.
Weaknesses:
1. Significance of Results: While the paper demonstrates improvements over state-of-the-art methods, the importance of these improvements is not fully contextualized. For example, the biological implications of the findings in the RNA-seq analysis could be elaborated further to emphasize the method's impact.
2. Clarity: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may limit accessibility to a broader audience. Certain sections, such as the theoretical guarantees and algorithmic details, could benefit from additional intuition or visualizations to aid understanding.
3. Comparative Analysis: Although SPARDA outperforms several baseline methods, the choice of baselines (e.g., sparse PCA, LDA) may not fully represent the state-of-the-art in high-dimensional distribution comparison. Including more recent methods, such as kernel-based approaches or deep learning models, could strengthen the empirical evaluation.
4. Scalability: The computational complexity of the RELAX algorithm, particularly for large datasets, is a concern. While the authors propose incremental updates, the scalability of the method in practice remains unclear.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional distribution analysis by introducing a novel and technically sound framework. The combination of Wasserstein-based divergence maximization and sparsity is both innovative and impactful. Despite some concerns about clarity and the contextualization of results, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance to NIPS, as it meets the conference's standards for quality, originality, and significance. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and rigorous methodological contributions.
- Demonstrated improvements over existing methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Potential for broad applicability across disciplines.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited discussion of the broader significance of empirical results.
- Computational scalability concerns for large datasets.
- Dense presentation may hinder accessibility for non-experts. 
Overall, this paper represents a valuable addition to the literature and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS.
