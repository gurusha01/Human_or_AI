This paper presents an extension of the ISBI 2012-winning segmentation algorithm by incorporating deeper architectures, 3D network initialization, and a recursive training framework. The authors demonstrate that these innovations significantly improve segmentation accuracy for neuronal boundary detection in 3D electron microscopy (EM) images. The proposed hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture, combined with recursive training, achieves state-of-the-art performance, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics (e.g., Rand F-scores) and qualitative visualizations. The work is particularly relevant to the field of connectomics, where automating EM segmentation is critical for reconstructing neural circuits.
Strengths  
The paper makes a clear and measurable advancement in segmentation accuracy, improving upon a well-established baseline (N4) with a novel combination of deeper networks, hybrid 2D-3D filters, and recursive training. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, demonstrating superior performance on a challenging dataset of mouse piriform cortex images. The recursive framework is biologically inspired and well-motivated, offering a compelling interpretation of top-down feedback mechanisms in neural processing. Additionally, the use of ZNN, a CPU-based framework optimized for 3D ConvNets, is a practical contribution that could benefit other researchers working with 3D data. The paper is clearly written, with well-organized figures and sufficient methodological detail to enable reproducibility. The release of the annotated dataset further enhances the paper's significance by providing a resource for the broader community.
Weaknesses  
While the paper demonstrates strong results on the provided dataset, its generalizability to other datasets or larger-scale problems is not thoroughly explored. Experiments on a more diverse set of datasets would strengthen the claims of broader applicability. Additionally, the paper does not compare its approach to more recent segmentation methods beyond the ISBI 2012 baseline, which limits the contextualization of its contributions within the current state of the art. A discussion of computational efficiency relative to GPU-based frameworks would also be valuable, as ZNN's reliance on CPUs may not align with the hardware preferences of many practitioners.
