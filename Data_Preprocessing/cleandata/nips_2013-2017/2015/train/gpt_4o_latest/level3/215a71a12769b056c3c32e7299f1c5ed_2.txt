This paper introduces a novel architecture, termed "highway networks," that leverages input-dependent gating mechanisms to facilitate the training of very deep neural networks. Inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks, the proposed architecture allows information to flow unimpeded across layers via "information highways." This design overcomes the challenges of vanishing gradients and poor gradient propagation, which have traditionally hindered the training of deep feedforward networks. The authors provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of highway networks, achieving promising results on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
The paper is of high quality, technically sound, and well-written. The authors clearly articulate the differences between highway networks and related works, such as FitNets and LSTMs, and provide a thorough review of prior research. The proposed gating mechanism is a novel contribution, enabling dynamic, input-dependent routing of information across layers. This approach not only simplifies training but also allows for the exploration of extremely deep architectures, with networks exceeding 100 layers trained successfully using simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The experimental results are compelling, showing that highway networks outperform plain networks of similar depth and converge significantly faster. Furthermore, the paper includes an insightful analysis of how the gating mechanism selectively routes information, highlighting its role as more than just a training aid but as an integral part of the computation.
Strengths of the paper include its originality, clarity, and significance. The architecture addresses a critical challenge in deep learning, advancing the state of the art in training deep networks. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are robust, with detailed analyses of layer importance and information routing. The authors also provide practical insights, such as initialization strategies for the gating mechanism, making the work accessible to practitioners.
Weaknesses are minimal. The only notable issue is a minor typographical error on page 5, where "Tables 3 and 3" should be corrected. While the results are promising, the paper could have included additional comparisons to state-of-the-art methods beyond FitNets to further contextualize its contributions.
In conclusion, this paper is a solid and novel contribution to the field of deep learning. It introduces a practical and theoretically grounded architecture that enables the training of very deep networks, with significant implications for both research and applications. I strongly recommend acceptance.
