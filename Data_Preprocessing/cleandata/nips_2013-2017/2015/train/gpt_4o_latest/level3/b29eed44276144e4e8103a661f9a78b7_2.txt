The paper introduces "hierarchy width," a novel graph property designed to provide theoretical guarantees for the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. The authors demonstrate that bounded hierarchy width, combined with bounded factor weights, ensures polynomial mixing time, addressing a significant gap in the theoretical understanding of Gibbs sampling. This contribution is particularly relevant for hierarchical factor graph templates, which are common in practice, and the paper validates its findings through both synthetic and real-world applications, including a natural language processing task where Gibbs sampling achieves human-level or better accuracy.
Strengths
The paper makes an important theoretical contribution by identifying hierarchy width as a property that can guarantee rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling. This is a significant step forward, as prior work has shown that hypertree width, a commonly used graph property, is insufficient for this purpose. The authors provide rigorous proofs, including a detailed comparison of hierarchy width and hypertree width, and demonstrate that hierarchy width is computationally feasible to calculate. The experimental results, particularly the real-world Paleontology application, convincingly illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework. The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, theorems, and experimental validation, making it accessible to readers familiar with graphical models and MCMC methods.
Weaknesses
One concern is that hierarchy width is always larger than hypertree width, which raises questions about its practical applicability to large-scale factor graphs. While the authors argue that bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time, the paper does not fully address whether this property is commonly bounded in real-world graphs beyond the specific hierarchical templates studied. Additionally, the observation that sampling could be harder than exact inference in certain cases (e.g., hypertree width 1 but exponential mixing time) is counterintuitive and challenges conventional intuition. While this is acknowledged, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of this phenomenon and its implications for the broader use of Gibbs sampling.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. Significance: The introduction of hierarchy width addresses a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of Gibbs sampling, advancing the state of the art.
2. Originality: The concept of hierarchy width and its application to hierarchical templates is novel and has not been explored in prior work.
3. Quality: The theoretical results are rigorous, and the experiments validate the practical relevance of the proposed approach.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides sufficient detail for experts to reproduce the results.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. Practicality: The fact that hierarchy width is always larger than hypertree width may limit its applicability to large-scale graphs.
2. Counterintuitive Results: The observation that sampling can be harder than exact inference is not fully explored, leaving some theoretical gaps.
Recommendation
Overall, this is a high-quality paper with a significant theoretical contribution and practical relevance. While there are some concerns about the general applicability of hierarchy width, the paper provides a strong foundation for future work in understanding and improving Gibbs sampling. I recommend acceptance, particularly as a "light review" paper that introduces a novel concept and opens new avenues for research.
