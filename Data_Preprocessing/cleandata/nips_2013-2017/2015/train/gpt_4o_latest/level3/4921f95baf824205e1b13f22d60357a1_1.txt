This paper investigates the use of a heuristic based on counting common neighbors for link prediction and clustering in graphs, particularly under the stochastic blockmodel framework. The authors demonstrate that this simple heuristic, despite its computational efficiency, performs competitively with more complex methods like spectral clustering and the Katz score. The paper also introduces a "cleaning" step to extend the heuristic's applicability to sparser graphs. Theoretical results are rigorously presented, and empirical evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets substantiate the claims.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic under the stochastic blockmodel, addressing a gap in the literature. While the heuristic itself is not new, the theoretical insights and the proposed cleaning step represent a meaningful contribution.
2. Significance: The proposed method is computationally efficient, making it highly relevant for large-scale networks where spectral clustering and other model-based methods are computationally prohibitive. The results could have practical implications for applications like recommendation systems and social network analysis.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are well-designed, covering both simulated and real-world datasets. The comparison with benchmark methods like spectral clustering and the Katz score is thorough and demonstrates the heuristic's competitiveness.
4. Clarity of Results: The distinction between semi-dense and semi-sparse regimes is well-articulated, and the theoretical guarantees are clearly tied to these regimes. The inclusion of the cleaning step to address limitations in sparser graphs is a thoughtful extension.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Self-Containment: The manuscript is not fully self-contained. Some proofs require referring to the supplementary material, which may hinder accessibility for readers. Including key proof sketches in the main text would improve clarity.
2. Textual and Notational Issues: There is a textual error on page 2 that needs correction for clarity. Additionally, a notation issue on page 4, where "v" should likely be replaced with "j," could confuse readers.
3. Limited Scope of Empirical Evaluation: While the experiments are compelling, the datasets used are relatively small and specific (e.g., co-authorship networks). Testing on larger and more diverse datasets, such as social media or biological networks, would strengthen the empirical claims.
4. Assumptions on Graph Density: The method's reliance on semi-dense and semi-sparse regimes may limit its applicability to extremely sparse graphs, which are common in real-world networks.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a novel theoretical foundation for a widely used heuristic, bridging a gap in the literature.
- The method is computationally efficient and performs well in practice, making it a valuable contribution for large-scale applications.
- The theoretical and empirical results are rigorous and well-supported.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The manuscript's reliance on supplementary material for key proofs detracts from its self-containment.
- Minor textual and notational errors could confuse readers and should be addressed.
- The empirical evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse datasets.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by providing theoretical insights into a practical heuristic, and its computational efficiency is a strong advantage. Addressing the clarity issues and expanding the empirical evaluation in future work would further enhance its impact.
