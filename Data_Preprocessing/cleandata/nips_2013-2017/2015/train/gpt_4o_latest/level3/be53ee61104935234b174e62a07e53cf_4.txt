The paper presents incremental improvements to Isotonic Regression under weighted $\ellp$-norms, proposing algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees and better computational efficiency. The authors claim improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly for general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and specific graph families. Theoretical contributions include faster algorithms for $\ellp$-norms, $\ell_\infty$-norms, and Strict Isotonic Regression, leveraging a novel Interior Point Method (IPM) framework and efficient solvers for specific matrix classes. While the work builds on well-established techniques in convex optimization and graph theory, its focus on computational efficiency and generality aligns with ongoing research trends in nonparametric regression and optimization.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous performance guarantees and demonstrates improved computational complexity for Isotonic Regression across various norms. The extension of IPM techniques to $\ell_p$-norms and the development of efficient solvers for new matrix classes are noteworthy.
2. Generality: The proposed algorithms are applicable to general DAGs, making them versatile for diverse applications in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis.
3. Potential Practical Impact: The authors highlight applications in learning monotone functions, class probability estimation, and multi-index models, suggesting broader relevance to practitioners.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The main sections of the paper lack sufficient detail to fully understand the contributions. Key theoretical insights and proofs are relegated to the supplementary material, making the paper less accessible to readers.
2. Experimental Results: The experimental evaluation is limited in scope, focusing primarily on $\ell_2$-norms and specific graph types (e.g., grid graphs and random regular graphs). The results lack depth and fail to explore the performance of the proposed algorithms under varying conditions or on real-world datasets.
3. Comparison with Existing Methods: The paper does not provide experimental comparisons with prior state-of-the-art methods. This omission makes it difficult to assess the practical significance of the claimed improvements.
4. Reproducibility: While the authors provide a link to their code, the lack of detailed experimental protocols and benchmarks may hinder reproducibility.
Pro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper advances the theoretical understanding of Isotonic Regression and proposes algorithms with improved computational efficiency, which could inspire further research.
- Con: The lack of comprehensive experimental validation and insufficient clarity in the main text significantly weaken the practical and scientific impact of the work.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include a more detailed explanation of the key contributions in the main text to improve accessibility.
2. Expand the experimental section to include comparisons with existing methods, evaluations on real-world datasets, and analysis of algorithmic scalability.
3. Improve the organization and clarity of the paper by integrating critical insights from the supplementary material into the main sections.
Recommendation: Weak Reject. While the theoretical contributions are solid, the paper's limited experimental validation and lack of clarity in the main text reduce its overall impact. Addressing these issues could make the work a strong candidate for future acceptance.
