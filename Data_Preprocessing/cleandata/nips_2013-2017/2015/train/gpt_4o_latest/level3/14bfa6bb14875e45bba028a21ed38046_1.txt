This paper introduces a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that significantly advances object detection by integrating region proposal generation and object detection into a unified framework. The RPN shares convolutional features with the detection network, enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC benchmarks while being 10x faster than Fast R-CNN. The authors also propose a multi-stage training procedure to address the assumption that object localization CNNs require predefined regions. This work builds on prior advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN, which reduced detection runtime but left region proposal computation as a bottleneck. By addressing this bottleneck, the paper makes a notable contribution to the field.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Impact: The paper introduces a novel region proposal method that shares CNN features, improving efficiency and accuracy. This is a significant step forward in object detection, as it eliminates the computational bottleneck of traditional region proposal methods like Selective Search.
2. Performance: The proposed RPN achieves impressive results, with a frame rate of 5fps on a GPU and state-of-the-art accuracy (73.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007). The system is both faster and slightly more accurate than Fast R-CNN.
3. Unified Framework: The integration of RPN with Fast R-CNN into a single network is elegant and practical, demonstrating the benefits of shared convolutional features.
4. Reproducibility: The authors provide code, which enhances the paper's utility for the research community.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Presentation: While the goal and results are clear, the paper's presentation is difficult to follow in parts. For instance, the explanation of why RPN is translation-invariant compared to [19] is unclear, and there is no discussion of OverFeat, which is a relevant baseline.
2. Parameter Choices: Several parameters (e.g., n=3, k=9) are manually set without justification or sensitivity analysis. This weakens the rigor of the experimental design.
3. Complex Training Procedure: The multi-stage training procedure is complex and unstable, yet the authors do not provide sufficient explanation for why alternative settings or repeated training were not explored.
4. Limited Discussion of Related Work: The paper does not adequately discuss OverFeat or other related methods like MultiBox, which would provide better context for the contributions.
Pro vs. Con for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in object detection, introduces a novel and impactful method, and demonstrates strong experimental results.
- Con: The lack of clarity in some sections, absence of parameter analysis, and insufficient discussion of related work detract from the overall quality.
Recommendation: While the paper has some weaknesses in clarity and experimental justification, its contributions to object detection are significant and impactful. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues, justify parameter choices, and expand the discussion of related work in the final version.
