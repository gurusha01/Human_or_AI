The paper presents a novel approach to bridge the gap between high-precision backpropagation training and spiking neural networks with binary synapses, addressing a critical challenge in deploying energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. By treating analog variables as probabilities, the authors enable a seamless mapping of offline-trained networks to spiking hardware. They adapt the backpropagation algorithm to this probabilistic framework and validate their method on the MNIST benchmark, achieving impressive results in both accuracy and energy efficiency. The trained networks are deployed on the TrueNorth chip, demonstrating their adaptability to different architectures optimized for size and accuracy. The paper is well-written, original, and has potential applicability to other hardware platforms, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound and demonstrates a complete and well-executed piece of work. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (99.42%) for spiking networks on MNIST while maintaining exceptional energy efficiency (0.268 ÂµJ per classification for a smaller network). The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, including the probabilistic adaptation of backpropagation and the deployment process on TrueNorth. The results are compelling, and the approach is timely, given the increasing interest in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. The authors also highlight the potential for extending their method to convolutional networks and other neuromorphic platforms, which enhances the significance of their work.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is strong overall, there are areas that could be improved. The authors do not sufficiently emphasize the practical implications of their method for the TrueNorth chip or its broader real-world applications. Additionally, the advantages of their approach over alternative methods, such as train-then-constrain approaches, are not explicitly demonstrated through comparative experiments. Several implementation details, such as input-to-spike conversion, spike frequencies, shared weight values, and neuron models, are missing, which may hinder reproducibility. Furthermore, the paper would benefit from referencing Qiao et al. (2015) and a relevant arXiv paper to provide a more comprehensive context for their work.
