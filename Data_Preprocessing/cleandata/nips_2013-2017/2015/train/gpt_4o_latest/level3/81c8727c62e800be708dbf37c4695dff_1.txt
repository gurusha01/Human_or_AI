This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of sample complexity in supervised metric learning, with a focus on both distance-based and classifier-based frameworks. The authors derive PAC-style bounds, showing that sample complexity scales with representation dimension \(D\) in the absence of structural assumptions about the data. They further refine these results by introducing the concept of intrinsic complexity \(d\), which allows for dataset-dependent bounds that relax the dependence on \(D\). The paper also highlights the benefits of norm-based regularization in adapting to a dataset's intrinsic complexity, both theoretically and empirically.
Strengths
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, offering novel theoretical insights into the sample complexity of metric learning. The authors provide both upper and lower bounds, demonstrating the necessity of the dependence on \(D\) in general cases. The introduction of intrinsic complexity \(d\) is a significant contribution, as it formalizes an intuitive notion of dataset complexity and enables more realistic sample complexity bounds. The empirical validation is methodical, using noise-augmented datasets to demonstrate the robustness of regularized metric learning algorithms. The results are compelling, showing that regularization improves generalization performance, particularly in high-noise regimes.
The paper also situates itself well within the existing literature, addressing gaps in prior work and providing a broader perspective by analyzing both distance-based and classifier-based frameworks. The theoretical justification for norm-regularization is particularly valuable, as it explains the empirical success of such techniques in practice.
Weaknesses
One concern arises with Theorem 2, where the parameters \(\lambda\) and \(L\) are set to depend on \(d\). While this choice is theoretically justified, it raises questions about the realism and practical implications of such assumptions. The authors could clarify how these dependencies manifest in real-world scenarios and whether they limit the applicability of the results.
Additionally, the paper does not cite "Scalable Metric Learning for Co-embedding" by Mirzazadeh et al. (2015, ECML), which addresses a similar loss function and provides an efficient algorithm. Including this reference would strengthen the discussion of related work and situate the contributions more effectively within the broader context of scalable metric learning.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- Novel theoretical contributions, including matching upper and lower bounds.
- Introduction of intrinsic complexity \(d\), enabling dataset-dependent sample complexity bounds.
- Rigorous empirical validation demonstrating the practical utility of norm-regularization.
