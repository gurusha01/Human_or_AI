This paper presents a scene labeling method using a multi-scale Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), which integrates local feature extraction and global context modulation in an end-to-end framework. The authors adapt RCNNs, originally designed for object recognition, to the more challenging task of scene labeling. By introducing intra-layer recurrent connections, the model captures both local and long-range contextual information, eliminating the need for separate preprocessing or post-processing steps. The multi-scale architecture further enhances the model's ability to handle objects of varying sizes. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, Sift Flow and Stanford Background, demonstrating competitive accuracy and impressive computational efficiency on GPUs.
Strengths  
The paper addresses an important problem in computer vision, and the proposed method is well-suited to the task of scene labeling, where both local and global information are critical. The end-to-end nature of the RCNN is a significant advantage, simplifying the pipeline compared to traditional methods that rely on separate modules for context integration. The experimental results are compelling, with the RCNN achieving state-of-the-art performance on per-pixel accuracy (PA) for both datasets. The method's computational efficiency, processing images in 0.03 seconds on a GPU, is another notable strength, making it practical for real-time applications. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough comparison with existing models, demonstrating the RCNN's advantages in accuracy and parameter efficiency.
Weaknesses  
Despite its merits, the paper has several limitations. The primary critique is that the contribution is incremental, as it applies existing RCNN techniques to scene labeling without introducing fundamentally novel concepts. While the multi-scale approach and intra-layer recurrent connections are effective, they are extensions of prior work rather than groundbreaking innovations. The clarity of the paper is another concern; the text is difficult to follow in places due to ambiguous phrasing and unclear explanations. For example, abbreviations like RCL and LRN are not adequately defined, and there is a typo in one of the equations. Additionally, the discussion on the gamma parameter variations feels unnecessary and detracts from the main focus of the paper.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance  
Pro:  
- Strong experimental results with state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.  
- End-to-end architecture simplifies the scene labeling pipeline.  
- Thorough evaluation on benchmark datasets with appropriate comparisons.  
Con:  
- Limited novelty; primarily an application of existing techniques.  
- Poor clarity and organization in the text, making it harder to understand.  
- Minor technical issues, such as unclear abbreviations and a typo.
Recommendation  
While the paper demonstrates solid technical quality and experimental results, the limited novelty and lack of clarity are significant drawbacks. If the authors address the clarity issues and better position their work in the context of prior research, the paper could make a meaningful contribution. I recommend acceptance as a borderline case, contingent on revisions to improve clarity and address the minor issues.
