This paper introduces a novel concept, hierarchy width, to analyze and bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs with bounded parameters. The authors demonstrate that hierarchy width, a stronger condition than hypertree width, ensures polynomial mixing time under bounded factor weights. This is a significant theoretical advancement, addressing gaps in understanding the behavior of Gibbs sampling, which is widely used in inference tasks but lacks robust guarantees in many cases. The paper also proposes hierarchical factor graph templates, a new class of relational models with bounded hierarchy width, and demonstrates their applicability to real-world problems, such as natural language processing and paleontology, where Gibbs sampling achieves both rapid mixing and high-quality results.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of hierarchy width as a graph property is a noteworthy advancement. The authors rigorously prove that bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time, bridging a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of Gibbs sampling. The results are well-supported by mathematical proofs and align with related work on graph properties like hypertree width.
   
2. Practical Relevance: The paper effectively connects theoretical insights to practical applications. The use of hierarchical templates in real-world tasks, such as knowledge base population and text extraction, demonstrates the utility of the proposed methods. The empirical results, including outperforming human annotators in a paleontology task, underscore the significance of the contributions.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough and well-designed. The synthetic data experiments illustrate the impact of hierarchy width on mixing time, while the real-world applications validate the practical benefits of hierarchical templates and the proposed semantics (logical and ratio). The comparison of different semantics (linear, logical, ratio) further strengthens the findings.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The definitions, proofs, and experimental results are presented clearly, making the technical content accessible to readers.
5. Forward-Looking Suggestions: The authors propose exploring extensions like "Blocked Gibbs sampling" and "Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling" to further leverage hierarchy width. These suggestions open avenues for future research.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability of Theoretical Results: While the theoretical guarantees are compelling, the practical scalability of hierarchy width computation for large, complex factor graphs could be discussed in more detail. Although the authors note that computing hierarchy width is polynomial for fixed bounds, real-world graphs may present challenges.
2. Limited Scope of Empirical Evaluation: The experiments focus on specific applications and relatively small synthetic datasets. While the results are promising, broader evaluations on diverse, large-scale datasets would strengthen the claims.
3. Comparison with Alternative Methods: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with alternative inference techniques, such as belief propagation or lifted inference, to contextualize the advantages of Gibbs sampling with bounded hierarchy width.
Recommendation:
This paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions to understanding and improving Gibbs sampling. The introduction of hierarchy width and its application to hierarchical templates is both novel and impactful. Despite minor limitations in scalability discussion and empirical breadth, the paper is well-executed and advances the state of the art in both theory and application. I recommend acceptance for the conference, as it is a high-quality scientific contribution that will likely inspire further research in the field.
