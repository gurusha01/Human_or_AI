This paper introduces a novel Gaussian Process-based global optimization algorithm, Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves exponential convergence without requiring auxiliary optimization or the impractical Î´-cover sampling. The authors build upon the work of de Freitas et al. (2012) and address a significant limitation in previous methods by proposing a theoretically grounded approach that generalizes bound-based search methods. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including regret bounds and insights into the algorithm's advantages over existing approaches.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides rigorous theoretical results, demonstrating an exponential regret bound for IMGPO. This is a notable improvement over prior methods like BaMSOO, which only achieve polynomial regret bounds.
2. Novelty: The algorithm introduces an innovative approach by considering infinitely many possible bounds and leveraging Gaussian Process priors to reduce the search space. This combination is both novel and impactful.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the algorithm and its theoretical underpinnings. The authors effectively situate their work within the broader context of global optimization and Bayesian optimization literature.
4. Practical Implications: The authors provide meaningful insights into the trade-offs between relying on a specific bound versus considering multiple bounds, which could inspire future work in optimization and related fields.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Rigor: The experimental section is underwhelming. The authors only test their algorithm on synthetic functions with a maximum dimensionality of six, which limits the generalizability of their results. Real-world applications, such as wetlab parameter tuning, would have strengthened the paper significantly.
2. Comparative Analysis: The paper does not compare IMGPO with state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods like Entropy Search or GP-UCB with advanced acquisition functions. This omission makes it difficult to assess the practical competitiveness of IMGPO.
3. Statistical Analysis: The experiments lack multiple initial evaluations of the objective function \( f \), which prevents meaningful statistical analysis of performance variability.
4. Scalability: While the authors acknowledge the scalability challenges of IMGPO in higher dimensions, the experiments do not adequately address this limitation or propose concrete solutions.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and introduces a novel algorithm, the lack of experimental rigor and real-world validation weakens its overall impact. To improve, the authors should include comparisons with state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods, test on real-world applications, and provide a more robust statistical analysis of their results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Theoretical advancements in regret bounds and algorithm design.
- Novel approach to combining bound-based methods with Gaussian Processes.
- Clear and well-written presentation of ideas.
Arguments against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental evaluation and lack of real-world scenarios.
- No comparison with state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods.
- Insufficient statistical analysis of experimental results.
Final Score: 5/10
This paper is a solid theoretical contribution but falls short in experimental rigor and practical validation. It is suitable for a specialized audience interested in theoretical advancements in global optimization but requires significant improvements to appeal to a broader audience.
