The paper presents a novel EM-based framework for parameter learning in Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs), addressing challenges in modeling irregularly sampled temporal data. The authors propose leveraging methods from Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) literature, such as Expm and Unif, to compute end-state conditioned expectations, and evaluate their approach on simulated and real-world datasets for glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease. The work demonstrates scalability to large state spaces and improved prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Strengths:
1. Algorithmic Contribution: The paper provides a systematic and comprehensive framework for CT-HMM learning, which is a significant advancement over prior work. The adaptation of CTMC methods to CT-HMMs is novel and well-motivated.
2. Scalability: The ability to handle models with over 100 states is a notable improvement, as previous CT-HMM works were limited to smaller state spaces.
3. Real-World Applications: The application of CT-HMMs to disease progression modeling for glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease is impactful, demonstrating the practical utility of the method in clinical contexts.
4. Comparison with Baselines: The experimental results convincingly show that CT-HMM outperforms Bayesian joint linear regression for glaucoma progression prediction, highlighting its efficacy.
5. Visualization: The visualization of disease progression trends offers valuable insights and supports findings from medical literature, making the work relevant for interdisciplinary research.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper is densely written and difficult to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with CTMCs or CT-HMMs. Section 2 could better clarify the contributions of referenced works ([8,9,10,12,13]) to aid conceptual understanding.
2. Trade-Off in Discretization: The trade-off introduced by the discretized time interval in Section 3.1 is unclear, and its exactness is questioned. The authors should explore its application to CTMCs to provide a more rigorous justification.
3. Simulated Data: The simulated data in Section 5.1 lacks noise due to states being 4Ïƒ apart, which raises concerns about the relevance of the results in demonstrating the robustness of the proposed scheme.
4. Undefined Metric: The "2-norm error" metric is undefined, and its application to the state sequence is ambiguous. The sources of state errors should be clarified.
5. Excessive Background: The paper dedicates 4.5 pages to explaining prior work, which could be condensed to allocate more space for discussing the proposed methods and results.
6. Missing Citation: The omission of Rao and Teh (2014), a relevant paper on fast MCMC sampling for CT-HMMs, is a significant oversight.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a novel and valuable contribution to CT-HMM learning, the clarity and quality of writing need substantial improvement. The authors should address the unclear trade-offs, provide a more rigorous evaluation on noisy data, and define all metrics used. Additionally, the excessive background discussion should be condensed, and the missing citation should be included. With these revisions, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and scalable algorithmic contribution.
- Demonstrated practical utility in disease progression modeling.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction tasks.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense and unclear writing limits accessibility.
- Simulated data results may not fully validate the method's robustness.
- Missing discussion of relevant prior work (Rao and Teh, 2014).
Overall, the paper has significant potential but requires revisions to improve clarity, rigor, and completeness.
