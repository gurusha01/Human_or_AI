Review
This paper proposes a novel approach to neuronal boundary detection in anisotropic 3D electron microscopy (EM) images by combining 2D and 3D convolutional filters within a deep convolutional network (ConvNet) framework. The authors introduce a hybrid architecture, VD2D3D, which leverages 2D filters in the initial layers for computational efficiency and 3D filters in later layers to incorporate 3D context. Additionally, the paper employs a recursive training strategy, where the output of an initial network is fed into a second network for refinement. The method outperforms prior approaches, including the widely used 2D max-pooling ConvNet, demonstrating its relevance for neuroscience applications. The authors also highlight the use of ZNN, a multicore CPU-based implementation optimized for 3D ConvNets, as a key component of their workflow.
Strengths
1. Scientific Contribution: The hybrid use of 2D and 3D filters is a significant innovation for addressing the anisotropy in serial section EM images. The recursive training strategy further enhances boundary detection performance, as evidenced by quantitative improvements in pixel-wise classification error and Rand F-scores.
2. Relevance: The method addresses a critical problem in connectomics and has potential applications in other domains, such as video processing or general image labeling tasks.
3. Performance: The proposed VD2D3D architecture achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, demonstrating the importance of integrating 3D context for boundary detection.
4. Open Science: The authors make their annotated dataset publicly available, which could benefit the broader research community.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity and Presentation: The paper suffers from poor organization and insufficiently descriptive figure captions, which hinder comprehension. For example, Figure 3 lacks a color code explanation, and inconsistent terminology (e.g., "net1/net2") adds to the confusion.
2. Reproducibility: The implementation of ZNN, a critical component of the method, is not adequately detailed. While the authors reference its GitHub repository, they fail to provide sufficient information for independent replication.
3. Terminology: The term "recursive" is misapplied, as the networks are composed sequentially rather than recursively applied. This could mislead readers unfamiliar with the nuances of the approach.
4. Ambiguities: Specific sections lack clarity, such as the vague description of the Rand index (l177) and the unclear references to ZNN (l80). Section 3, which discusses ZNN, could benefit from a more structured explanation.
Pro and Con Arguments
Pros:
- Advances the state of the art in neuronal boundary detection.
- Demonstrates the utility of combining 2D and 3D filters for anisotropic datasets.
- Provides a publicly available annotated dataset for further research.
Cons:
- Presentation quality and clarity are subpar, requiring significant revision.
- Insufficient details on ZNN and training procedures limit reproducibility.
- Misleading terminology and inconsistent notation detract from the paper's technical rigor.
Recommendation
While the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of connectomics and demonstrates clear performance improvements, its shortcomings in presentation, clarity, and reproducibility must be addressed. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, contingent on the authors improving the paper's organization, providing more detailed explanations of ZNN and training procedures, and addressing ambiguities in terminology and figures.
