The paper presents a novel greedy algorithm for streaming hypergraph clustering, targeting the minimization of the maximum number of topics covered by any partition. This problem is framed as a min-max hypergraph partitioning task, with significant applications in clustering and load balancing. The authors extend the problem to the streaming computation model, where items arrive sequentially and must be irrevocably assigned to partitions under memory constraints. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed and empirically validated, demonstrating superior performance compared to other simple streaming methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with clear problem formulation and theoretical guarantees. The authors prove that their greedy algorithm achieves balanced asymptotic recovery of hidden clusters under specific probabilistic conditions. The use of Polya urn processes to establish convergence is elegant and well-justified.
2. Originality: The extension of hypergraph clustering to the streaming model is novel and relevant, addressing scalability challenges in real-world applications. The recovery guarantees under a stochastic input model represent a meaningful contribution to the field.
3. Experimental Validation: The empirical results are compelling, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms other online heuristics in terms of normalized maximum load. The inclusion of real-world datasets strengthens the practical relevance of the work.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, theoretical results, and experimental setup. The inclusion of related work provides a comprehensive context for the study.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Batch Methods: While the authors justify the exclusion of batch methods due to computational inefficiency, smaller-scale comparisons could have provided additional insights into the trade-offs between streaming and batch approaches.
2. Limited Exploration of Variants: The paper could explore more variants of the greedy algorithm or hybrid approaches to further improve performance.
3. Typographical Issue: A minor typo ("the the" on line 319) should be corrected.
Significance:
The results are significant, as they address a challenging problem in streaming computation with practical applications in clustering and load balancing. The theoretical guarantees and empirical performance suggest that the proposed method could inspire further research and practical adoption.
