Review of "Min-Max Hypergraph Partitioning in the Streaming Model"
This paper addresses the challenging and important problem of min-max hypergraph partitioning in a streaming computation model, where items arrive sequentially and must be irrevocably assigned to components with limited memory. The authors propose a greedy assignment strategy and provide both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence for its performance. The problem is framed as a special case of submodular load balancing, a well-studied area in combinatorial optimization, and builds on prior work such as Svitkina & Fleischer (2008) and Mu Li et al. (2013). The paper makes a notable contribution by extending the analysis to the streaming setting and focusing on hidden co-cluster recovery in probabilistic inputs.
Strengths:
1. Significance and Novelty: The paper tackles a relevant problem with applications in clustering and load balancing for modern computation platforms. The focus on the streaming model, which imposes strict memory constraints, is timely and practical for large-scale systems.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including a recovery theorem for hidden co-clusters under specific probabilistic conditions. The use of Polya urn processes to analyze the greedy strategy is innovative and well-justified.
3. Empirical Validation: The extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets and synthetic inputs demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the greedy strategy outperforms alternative online heuristics and even some offline methods.
4. Clarity of Problem Definition: The problem is clearly defined, and its relationship to submodular load balancing is well-articulated. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with related work, situating their contributions within the broader research landscape.
Weaknesses:
1. Originality of Proposition 2: The result about arbitrary partitions (Proposition 2) is already known for general submodular functions, as noted in Svitkina & Fleischer (2008). While this is acknowledged, the paper could better emphasize how its contributions go beyond existing results in submodular load balancing.
2. Limited Comparison with Related Work: Although the paper references Mu Li et al.'s work on min-max hypergraph partitioning in a streaming setting, a more detailed comparison of the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance would strengthen the contribution.
3. Restricted Input Model: The theoretical guarantees rely on a specific probabilistic input model (hidden co-clusters), which may limit the generalizability of the results to arbitrary real-world inputs. While the authors acknowledge this, future work could explore broader input models.
4. Empirical Baselines: The comparison with offline methods like PARSA highlights the limitations of the greedy approach in achieving optimal partitioning. While this is expected in a streaming setting, additional baselines or hybrid approaches could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper provides a solid mix of theoretical and empirical contributions, addressing a challenging problem with practical relevance. The use of Polya urn processes for analyzing streaming algorithms is a novel and valuable addition to the literature.
- Con: The reliance on a specific input model and the reuse of known results (e.g., Proposition 2) somewhat limit the originality of the work. Additionally, the empirical evaluation could include a more diverse set of baselines.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of streaming computation and submodular optimization. While there are some limitations in originality and generalizability, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to strengthen the discussion of related work and clarify the novelty of the contributions.
