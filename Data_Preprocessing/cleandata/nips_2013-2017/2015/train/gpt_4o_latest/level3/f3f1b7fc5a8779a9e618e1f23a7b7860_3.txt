The paper addresses the challenging problem of high-dimensional structured estimation under sub-exponential design matrices and noise, extending theoretical guarantees previously limited to sub-Gaussian settings. The authors establish that the estimation error in this setting is at most \(\sqrt{\log p}\) worse than the sub-Gaussian case, a significant result that generalizes existing frameworks. Leveraging the exponential width argument, the authors demonstrate that the exponential width is upper bounded by the Gaussian width multiplied by a factor of \(c \sqrt{\log p}\). This connection enables the application of prior results on Gaussian widths to the sub-exponential case, which is a novel and impactful contribution.
The paper also establishes that the sample complexity required to satisfy the restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition for sub-exponential designs matches that of the sub-Gaussian case for widely used estimators like Lasso and Group Lasso. Two proof techniques are presented: one based on exponential widths, which yields a bound \(\log p\) worse than the VC dimension-based approach, and another that achieves sharper results for specific norms. These theoretical findings are supported by simulations, although the presentation of Figure 1 is criticized for being uninformative. The reviewer suggests plotting normalized sample size versus the probability of success to better illustrate sample complexity trends.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper is the first to provide theoretical guarantees for norm-regularized estimators under sub-exponential designs, addressing a gap in the literature.
2. Technical Depth: The connection between Gaussian and exponential widths is rigorously established using generic chaining, a sophisticated mathematical tool.
3. Practical Relevance: The results are applicable to real-world scenarios involving heavy-tailed distributions, such as finance and climate science.
4. Impact: The findings generalize existing results for sub-Gaussian designs, advancing the state of the art in high-dimensional estimation.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the theoretical contributions are substantial, the exposition is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with generic chaining or width-based arguments. The authors could improve accessibility by including more intuitive explanations.
2. Experimental Presentation: Figure 1 does not effectively convey the trends in sample complexity. A more informative visualization, as suggested, would enhance clarity.
3. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments validate theoretical results but are restricted to synthetic data. Including real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes significant theoretical contributions, introduces novel proof techniques, and addresses an important problem in high-dimensional statistics.
- Con: The presentation could be improved, particularly in terms of clarity and experimental visualization.
Recommendation: The paper is technically sound, original, and addresses a significant problem. Despite minor weaknesses in clarity and experimental presentation, the contributions outweigh these issues. I recommend acceptance at NIPS.
