This paper introduces a novel architecture, Highway Networks, inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, to address the challenges of training very deep neural networks. The authors tackle longstanding issues such as initialization and vanishing gradients, which have historically hindered the training of deep networks. By incorporating adaptive gating mechanisms, Highway Networks enable unimpeded information flow across layers, allowing for effective training of networks with depths exceeding 100 layers. This work builds on prior research in deep learning, including skip connections, initialization strategies, and optimization techniques, while offering a significant advancement in the field.
Strengths
The paper is technically sound and well-supported by both theoretical insights and extensive experimental results. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of Highway Networks through rigorous comparisons with plain networks, showing that their architecture overcomes the degradation in performance typically observed with increasing depth. The experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets are thorough and highlight the scalability and generalization capabilities of the proposed method. Notably, the ability to train 100-layer networks directly using stochastic gradient descent is a significant achievement, advancing the state of the art in deep learning.
The clarity of the paper is commendable, with well-structured sections and detailed explanations of the architecture, training methodology, and experimental setup. The inclusion of visualizations, such as transform gate activity and layer importance, provides valuable insights into the inner workings of Highway Networks. Additionally, the authors make their code and hyperparameter search results publicly available, promoting reproducibility.
The originality of the work is evident in its novel use of LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms for feedforward networks. While related to skip connections and other initialization techniques, Highway Networks offer a unique and more flexible approach to routing information dynamically based on input.
Weaknesses
While the paper is of high quality, there are minor areas for improvement. In Section 4.1, the statement regarding transform block activity could be revised for greater clarity. Additionally, the paper would benefit from a discussion on how the transform gates differ from identity matrix initialization, as this distinction is not fully explored. These clarifications would enhance the reader's understanding of the proposed architecture.
Recommendation
This paper is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, addressing a critical challenge and providing a practical solution with strong empirical support. Its originality, technical rigor, and potential impact make it highly suitable for acceptance at the conference. Minor revisions to improve clarity and address the aforementioned points are recommended but do not detract from the overall quality of the work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and effective solution to training very deep networks.
