This paper addresses the problem of high-dimensional structured estimation using norm-regularized estimators in scenarios where the design matrix and noise follow sub-exponential distributions. The authors extend the theoretical framework previously established for sub-Gaussian settings to sub-exponential cases, introducing the concept of "exponential width" as a key complexity measure. They demonstrate that the sample complexity and estimation error bounds depend on this exponential width, which is at most \( \sqrt{\log p} \) times the Gaussian width. Notably, for Lasso and Group Lasso, the authors show that the sample complexity matches the sub-Gaussian case through a VC-dimension-based analysis. This work is the first to provide theoretical guarantees for norm-regularized regression under sub-exponential conditions, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The transition from sub-Gaussian to sub-exponential designs is technically challenging and highly appreciated by the theoretical community. The authors successfully generalize existing frameworks, leveraging tools like generic chaining to establish a relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths. This is a significant theoretical advancement.
2. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are well-designed and align with the theoretical findings. The plots effectively illustrate the differences in recovery and error decay between Gaussian and sub-exponential cases.
3. Clarity in Mathematical Derivations: The paper provides detailed and rigorous mathematical proofs, particularly for the relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths and the RE condition under sub-exponential assumptions.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Motivation: While the authors briefly mention applications in fields like finance and climate science, the paper lacks a compelling motivation for why sub-exponential models are critical in practice. A more detailed discussion of real-world scenarios where sub-exponential distributions are prevalent would strengthen the paper.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is dense and assumes a high level of familiarity with advanced concepts like generic chaining and VC-dimensions. While the mathematical rigor is commendable, the exposition could be improved to make the work more accessible to a broader audience.
3. Typos: There are minor typographical errors in lines 321, 330, 344, 358, and 368, where "at[ ]least" should be corrected. These should be addressed in the final version.
Evaluation:
- Quality: The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experiments. The authors are careful in evaluating the strengths and limitations of their work.
- Clarity: While the mathematical sections are rigorous, the paper could benefit from improved organization and a clearer explanation of its broader significance.
- Originality: The work is novel, addressing a gap in the literature by extending sub-Gaussian results to sub-exponential settings.
- Significance: The results are important for advancing the understanding of high-dimensional estimation under heavier-tailed distributions. The findings are likely to inspire further research and applications in related fields.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution, but the authors should address the identified weaknesses, particularly the lack of motivation and the typographical errors.
