The paper presents a novel EM-based inference method for Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMM), addressing the lack of scalable parameter learning techniques for CT-HMMs. By leveraging tools from the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) literature, the authors propose a comprehensive framework that reformulates the estimation problem as a discrete-time inhomogeneous HMM. They adapt three CTMC-based approaches—Expm, Unif, and Eigen—for computing end-state conditioned expectations, and validate their method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease progression.
Strengths:
1. Contribution: The paper makes a meaningful contribution by extending existing CTMC tools to the CT-HMM domain and demonstrating their utility in large-scale models with over 100 states. This is a significant improvement over prior works, which were limited to smaller models.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the challenges in CT-HMM learning and the proposed solutions. The pseudocode and complexity analysis enhance reproducibility.
3. Significance: The practical utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through its superior performance in glaucoma progression prediction compared to a state-of-the-art Bayesian method. Additionally, the visualization of disease progression trends for Alzheimer's disease offers valuable insights for medical research.
4. Originality: While the approach builds incrementally on existing tools, the application of Expm and Unif methods to CT-HMMs is novel. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of inference methods, which is a valuable resource for the community.
Weaknesses:
1. Experiment Weakness: The chosen baselines for comparison are weak, as they ignore state transition and trajectory information. A comparison with discrete-time HMMs and fast MCMC sampling methods for Markov jump processes would strengthen the evaluation.
2. Alternative Approach: The authors do not explore the simpler alternative of discretizing the time horizon with appropriate bin sizes, which could be effective for irregular sampling rates.
3. Missing Comparison: The paper does not compare its method with other inference techniques, such as fast MCMC sampling, which limits the scope of its evaluation.
4. Software Release: While the authors mention the potential value of releasing their software package, no explicit commitment or details about its availability are provided.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in disease progression modeling with a novel and scalable solution.
- It demonstrates practical utility through real-world applications and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.
- The clear presentation and detailed analysis make it a valuable resource for the community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation could be more robust with stronger baselines and comparisons to alternative methods.
- The lack of exploration of simpler discretization approaches leaves a gap in the analysis.
- The incremental nature of the contribution may limit its impact.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper provides a valuable contribution to CT-HMM learning, but the authors should address the experimental weaknesses by including comparisons with discrete-time HMMs, fast MCMC methods, and alternative discretization approaches. Additionally, releasing the software package would enhance the work's significance and usability.
