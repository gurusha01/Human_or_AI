The paper presents a novel contribution to topological data analysis (TDA) by proving the universality of a variant of the persistence scale-space (PSS) kernel, enabling kernelized hypothesis testing on persistence diagrams. This is a significant advancement in embedding probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) for statistical computations with persistence diagrams. The authors demonstrate the utility of the universal kernel in two-sample hypothesis testing on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its potential to address challenging problems in statistical TDA.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The proof of universality for the modified PSS kernel is a key theoretical advancement. This enables a principled approach to kernel-based statistical methods in TDA, such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for two-sample testing.
2. Applications: The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the utility of the proposed kernel. The ability to detect statistically significant differences in homological features, as demonstrated in the lateral ventricle dataset, highlights the practical relevance of the method.
3. Writing Quality: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a logical progression from theoretical foundations to experimental validation.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Background: The paper assumes familiarity with specialized concepts in TDA, such as "birth-death bounded" and persistence diagrams. Including more background material would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience, especially those new to TDA.
2. Experimental Validation: While the experiments demonstrate the utility of the kernel, the lack of comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods limits the ability to assess its relative performance. For instance, comparisons with persistence landscapes or other kernels for persistence diagrams would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Proposition 2 Clarity: The proof of Proposition 2 is unclear due to missing definitions, particularly regarding "birth-death bounded." This could hinder reproducibility and understanding of the theoretical results.
4. Discussion of Related Work: The related work section focuses heavily on computing means of persistence diagrams, which could be shortened to include more background on the main topics, such as kernel methods in TDA.
5. Typographical Errors: Minor typos, such as "form -> from" and "an function -> a function," detract from the overall polish of the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by proving the universality of the kernel, which is a foundational result for statistical TDA.
- The proposed method has the potential to spark discussions and inspire further research in the intersection of TDA and kernel methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods limits the ability to assess the practical impact of the proposed kernel.
- The paper could be more self-contained, with additional background and clearer proofs, to improve accessibility and reproducibility.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is an interesting and valuable contribution to the field of TDA, particularly in enabling statistical computations with persistence diagrams. However, the limited experimental validation and accessibility issues temper its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity of Proposition 2, expand the experimental comparisons, and improve the accessibility of the paper for a broader audience.
