This paper introduces Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), a novel variation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) tailored for sampling from probability density functions (PDFs) with discontinuities or bounded domains. The authors propose a modification to the leapfrog integration scheme, incorporating refraction and reflection dynamics inspired by physical systems such as optics. By detecting intersections with boundaries and adjusting momentum accordingly, the method improves proposal acceptance rates and effective sample size (ESS). The paper validates RHMC through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, demonstrating its advantages over baseline HMC and Metropolis-Hastings (MH) in terms of efficiency, especially for high-dimensional piecewise distributions.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper addresses a significant limitation of traditional HMC when applied to piecewise continuous distributions. By introducing reflection and refraction dynamics, RHMC provides a principled way to handle discontinuities, preserving the stationary distribution and improving sampling efficiency.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed proofs of volume conservation and detailed balance for RHMC, ensuring the method's correctness. This is a substantial theoretical contribution, particularly given the challenges posed by non-smooth energy functions.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate RHMC's superiority over baseline HMC and tuned MH in terms of ESS and accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The use of a well-defined metric (Worst Mean Absolute Error) and confidence intervals enhances the credibility of the results.
4. Broader Applicability: Unlike prior work restricted to piecewise quadratic potentials, RHMC generalizes to arbitrary piecewise continuous distributions with affine boundaries, significantly broadening its scope.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Exploration of Trade-offs: While RHMC improves ESS, it incurs additional computational overhead due to boundary intersection calculations. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of scenarios where this overhead might outweigh the benefits, particularly in low-dimensional settings or for simpler PDFs.
2. High-Dimensional Suitability: The method's scalability to very high-dimensional PDFs remains unclear. Although experiments include up to 50 dimensions, real-world applications often involve hundreds or thousands of dimensions, where boundary intersection computations may become prohibitive.
3. Missing Negative Example: The paper would benefit from an example where computing intersections is not advantageous, to clarify the method's limitations and guide practitioners in choosing appropriate use cases.
4. Clarity in Presentation: While the theoretical sections are rigorous, they are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical intricacies of HMC. Simplifying or summarizing key results could improve accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in probabilistic inference, making a significant theoretical and practical contribution.
- The method is well-validated through both theoretical proofs and empirical results.
- RHMC has the potential to advance the state of the art in sampling methods for piecewise distributions, with applications in Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The computational trade-offs of RHMC are not fully explored, leaving questions about its practicality in certain scenarios.
- The paper lacks an example highlighting the method's limitations, which would provide a more balanced perspective.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and is well-suited for the conference. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in exploring trade-offs and clarifying limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted concerns.
