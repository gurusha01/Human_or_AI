The paper addresses the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem in the streaming computation model, proposing a simple greedy strategy for item assignment. This problem is both interesting and important, with applications in clustering, load balancing, and scalable data processing. The authors introduce a novel stochastic model for generating input hypergraphs, providing sufficient conditions for asymptotical recovery of hidden clusters. The paper also includes theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluations, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over alternative methods.
Strengths:  
The problem studied is significant, and the proposed stochastic model is both novel and thought-provoking. The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis, including a recovery theorem that guarantees balanced asymptotic recovery of hidden clusters under specific conditions. The coupling of the greedy algorithm with Polya urn processes is an elegant and technically sound approach. The empirical results are extensive, showcasing the algorithm's performance on real-world datasets and synthetic inputs. The comparison with offline methods and alternative heuristics strengthens the validity of the proposed solution. The paper also highlights practical considerations, such as memory constraints, making it relevant to real-world applications.
Weaknesses:  
One concern is the realism of the proposed stochastic model. While the hidden co-clustering assumption is mathematically appealing, its applicability to real-world scenarios is not fully justified. The authors are encouraged to provide more evidence or examples where such assumptions hold in practice. Additionally, the paper does not adequately compare the streaming greedy algorithm's empirical performance with offline greedy algorithms for min-max graph partitioning, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. The claim about random partitioning's performance (Lines 168-171) is unclear regarding the global optimal cost and should be clarified. Furthermore, the notations in Algorithm 1 (Lines 216-225) are somewhat confusing and could benefit from clearer explanations.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:  
- The problem is important and has practical applications.  
- The stochastic model and theoretical guarantees are novel contributions.  
- Empirical results demonstrate strong performance compared to alternatives.  
Con Acceptance Arguments:  
- The stochastic model's assumptions may not align with real-world data.  
- Missing comparisons with relevant prior work on offline greedy algorithms.  
- Minor clarity issues in the text and algorithm presentation.  
Recommendation:  
The paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to the field of streaming algorithms for hypergraph partitioning. However, addressing the concerns about the stochastic model's realism and including comparisons with offline greedy algorithms would significantly strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address these issues in a revision.
