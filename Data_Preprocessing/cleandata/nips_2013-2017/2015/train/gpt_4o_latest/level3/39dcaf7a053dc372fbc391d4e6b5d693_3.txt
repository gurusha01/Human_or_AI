This paper presents a deep convolutional network for neuron segmentation in 3D electron microscopy (EM) image stacks, introducing several innovations that enhance boundary detection accuracy. The authors propose a hybrid architecture combining 2D and 3D filters, a recursive training framework, and the use of ZNN, a CPU-based implementation optimized for 3D convolutional networks. These contributions are applied to anisotropic 3D EM images, addressing challenges such as poor resolution in the z-dimension and alignment errors. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over prior approaches, achieving lower pixel-wise classification error and higher Rand F-scores in segmentation tasks.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology, architecture, and results. The authors provide sufficient background, situating their work within the context of existing methods, such as max-pooling convolutional networks and 3D ConvNets. The novelty lies in the hybrid use of 2D and 3D filters tailored to anisotropic data, as well as the recursive training framework, which draws inspiration from biological mechanisms of top-down feedback in neural circuits. While the recursive approach has been explored in other contexts, its application to ConvNets for boundary detection is novel and effective.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The proposed method is technically sound, with comprehensive experimental validation. The use of ZNN for efficient training and dense output computation is a noteworthy contribution.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with detailed descriptions of the architecture and training procedures. The inclusion of visualizations and quantitative comparisons strengthens the presentation.
3. Significance: The method addresses a critical problem in connectomics and demonstrates clear improvements over state-of-the-art techniques. The publicly available annotated dataset adds value to the field.
4. Originality: The hybrid 2D-3D filter design and recursive training framework are novel contributions that advance the state of the art.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Insights: While the architecture is innovative, the paper lacks deeper theoretical analysis or insights into why the proposed design choices are optimal.
2. Generalizability: Although the authors suggest broader applicability to other anisotropic 3D data (e.g., video), this claim is not empirically validated.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and effective approach to a significant problem in neuroscience.
- The results demonstrate clear improvements over prior methods, supported by rigorous evaluation.
- The work has potential applications beyond the specific dataset, contributing to the broader field of image segmentation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of fundamental methodological insights may limit the broader impact of the work.
- The generalizability claims are speculative and not substantiated by experiments.
Overall, this is a high-quality paper that makes a meaningful contribution to the field. While it could benefit from deeper theoretical analysis, its practical advancements and relevance to neuroscience make it a strong candidate for presentation. I recommend acceptance.
