This paper introduces the concept of approximate max-information and demonstrates its utility in addressing generalization in adaptive data analysis, a critical challenge in modern machine learning. The authors connect this new measure to differential privacy and description length, providing a unified framework for understanding generalization guarantees. They propose two practical algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, for reusing holdout sets in adaptive settings, and validate their effectiveness through theoretical analysis and experiments.
Strengths
The paper makes a significant contribution by advancing the understanding of generalization error in adaptive data analysis. The introduction of approximate max-information is both original and impactful, as it bridges two previously distinct approaches: differential privacy and description length. This unification is theoretically elegant and practically useful, as it enables adaptive composition of algorithms with different generalization guarantees. The proposed algorithms, Thresholdout and SparseValidate, are well-motivated and address a pressing issue in machine learning: the risk of overfitting when holdout sets are reused adaptively. The empirical results, inspired by Freedman's classical experiment, effectively illustrate the dangers of standard holdout reuse and the robustness of the proposed methods.
Weaknesses
The main text is dense, with an overwhelming amount of content packed into limited space, making it challenging to follow. The introduction could be condensed to improve readability and focus on the core contributions. Additionally, while the theoretical results are compelling, the paper would benefit from a clearer comparison of Theorem 8 with Theorem 9 in [6] and Corollary 20, as this would clarify the similarities and differences in deviation bounds. Furthermore, the explicit contributions of the paper are not clearly delineated, which could hinder comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the context. Minor issues include a typo in Definition 3 and insufficient clarification on the type of noise used in the experiments.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. Significance: The paper addresses a critical problem in adaptive data analysis and provides both theoretical insights and practical solutions.
2. Originality: The concept of approximate max-information and its unification of differential privacy and description length are novel.
3. Quality: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results convincingly demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithms.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. Clarity: The dense presentation and lack of explicit contributions reduce accessibility.
2. Comparison: The absence of a formal comparison with related theorems limits the contextual understanding of the results.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Condense the introduction to focus on the key contributions.
2. Explicitly list the main contributions in the introduction or conclusion.
3. Provide a formal comparison of Theorem 8 with Theorem 9 in [6] and Corollary 20.
4. Address the typo in Definition 3 and clarify the type of noise used in the experiments.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of adaptive data analysis and is worthy of acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity and comparison issues.
