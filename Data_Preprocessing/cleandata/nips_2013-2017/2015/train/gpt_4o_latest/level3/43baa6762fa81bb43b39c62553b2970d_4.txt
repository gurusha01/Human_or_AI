The paper addresses the robust PCA problem under non-uniform Bernoulli sparse corruption, extending the classical Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) framework by introducing local incoherence as a key factor in determining recovery success. The authors demonstrate that locally incoherent entries of the low-rank matrix can tolerate higher error densities, providing a more refined understanding of robust PCA recovery. Their analysis, which incorporates a new weighted norm and builds on techniques like the golfing scheme, is applied to both random and fixed sign error settings. The results are supported by numerical experiments and have implications for applications such as clustering.
Strengths:
1. Technical Depth and Novelty: The introduction of local incoherence as a parameter for robust PCA recovery is a meaningful contribution, offering a more granular perspective compared to global incoherence. This refinement could inspire future work in robust PCA and related areas.
2. Clear Writing and Organization: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and results. The inclusion of detailed proofs and numerical experiments enhances its rigor and accessibility.
3. Practical Insights: The implications for cluster matrices are particularly intriguing, as they demonstrate how local incoherence impacts robustness to errors in real-world scenarios like clustering.
4. Adequate Experiments: The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the theoretical results and providing insights into the practical behavior of PCP under different error distributions.
Weaknesses:
1. Incremental Contribution: While the localized analysis is novel, the overall contribution feels incremental when contextualized within the broader convex demixing literature. The paper could benefit from a stronger emphasis on how its results advance the state of the art.
2. Insufficient Contextualization: The paper does not adequately position its contributions relative to existing work in convex demixing and robust PCA. For example, while the use of weighted norms is notable, the distinction from prior work (e.g., weighted algorithms for matrix completion) is not fully articulated.
3. Practical Usability of Local Incoherence: The local incoherence condition, while theoretically interesting, is not practically testable or computable in real-world scenarios. This raises concerns about its applicability beyond theoretical analysis.
4. Lack of Centering in Experiments: The experimental results are robust, but additional analysis of recovery performance after centering the data could provide further insights and strengthen the empirical contributions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a refined theoretical framework for robust PCA, which could inspire further research.
- The writing is clear, and the experiments are thorough, making the results accessible and reproducible.
- The implications for clustering and the introduction of local incoherence are valuable contributions.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The contributions, while technically sound, are incremental and lack sufficient contextualization within the existing literature.
- The practical relevance of the local incoherence condition is limited, reducing the paper's impact on real-world applications.
- The distinction between this work and prior studies using weighted norms is not adequately clarified.
Recommendation:
I recommend borderline acceptance. While the paper makes a technically sound and well-presented contribution, its incremental nature and lack of practical applicability limit its impact. Strengthening the contextualization and addressing the practical limitations of local incoherence could improve the paper's significance.
