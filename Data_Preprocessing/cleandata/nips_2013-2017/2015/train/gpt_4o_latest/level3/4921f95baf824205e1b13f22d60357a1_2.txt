This paper investigates the common neighbors heuristic for link prediction and local clustering in networks modeled by the stochastic blockmodel (SBM). The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the heuristic's performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in semi-dense graphs and extending its applicability to semi-sparse graphs with an additional "cleaning" step. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets are presented to support these findings. The work contributes to understanding why this simple heuristic, widely used in practice, performs well under certain conditions, while also contrasting its performance with more computationally expensive methods like spectral clustering and Katz scores.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic under the SBM, introducing semi-dense and semi-sparse regimes. This is a novel contribution that bridges a gap in understanding the heuristic's empirical success.
2. Efficiency: The heuristic is computationally lightweight compared to spectral clustering, making it appealing for large-scale networks. The addition of the cleaning step is a thoughtful enhancement for sparse graphs.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on simulated data align with the theoretical results, and the inclusion of real-world datasets adds practical relevance.
4. Clarity of Results: The distinction between dense and sparse graph regimes is well-articulated, and the conditions for the heuristic's success are clearly stated.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: While the paper is generally clear, some sections, particularly the mathematical derivations, are dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the SBM or concentration inequalities. A more intuitive explanation of key results would improve accessibility.
2. Performance on Real-World Data: The SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN methods underperform compared to spectral clustering and Katz scores on real-world datasets. This raises concerns about the practical utility of the proposed methods.
3. Lack of Discussion on Underperformance: The authors do not adequately address why their methods perform worse on real-world networks. A discussion on how the SBM assumptions (e.g., fixed cluster sizes, uniform link probabilities) may not align with real-world network structures would strengthen the paper.
4. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments focus on co-authorship networks, which may not generalize to other types of networks. Additional datasets from diverse domains would enhance the empirical evaluation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a novel theoretical analysis of a widely used heuristic, contributing to the understanding of its strengths and limitations.
- The work is computationally efficient and offers insights into practical scenarios where the heuristic can be applied effectively.
- The study is well-motivated and addresses an important problem in network analysis.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The methods underperform on real-world datasets, and the lack of discussion on this underperformance limits the paper's practical impact.
- The clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly in the theoretical sections, to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
- The experimental evaluation is somewhat narrow, focusing on a limited set of datasets.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution, its practical impact is limited by underperformance on real-world datasets and insufficient discussion of this issue. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, emphasizing the need for a deeper analysis of the methods' limitations, improved clarity, and a broader experimental evaluation.
