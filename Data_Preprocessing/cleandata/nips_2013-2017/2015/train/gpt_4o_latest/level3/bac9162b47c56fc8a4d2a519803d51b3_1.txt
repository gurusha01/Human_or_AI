This paper explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to the task of knowledge tracing in MOOCs, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) methods. The authors present a well-documented study, leveraging relevant datasets such as Khan Academy and Assistments, and achieve notable gains in prediction accuracy, with a 25% improvement in AUC over prior benchmarks. The paper also highlights the model's ability to autonomously learn latent structures in student interactions, bypassing the need for expert annotations, and discusses its potential applications in curriculum design and exercise dependency discovery.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The use of LSTM RNNs for knowledge tracing is novel and well-motivated. The authors demonstrate that the model captures richer temporal dynamics compared to BKT, advancing the state-of-the-art in this domain.
2. Performance: The reported gains in AUC are substantial and consistent across datasets, underscoring the robustness of the proposed approach.
3. Practical Applications: The ability to improve curricula and discover exercise relationships has significant implications for personalized education.
4. Reproducibility: The authors provide shared code and datasets, promoting transparency and enabling further research in this area.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper's organization is suboptimal. Subsection 1.1 appears misplaced, and Section 4 lacks coherence, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. A restructuring of these sections is recommended.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The choice of AUC as the primary evaluation metric is not well-justified. While AUC is informative, accuracy is more standard in knowledge tracing and should have been included for comparison.
3. Usability of Shared Code: Although the code is shared, the absence of a README file reduces its immediate usability for other researchers.
4. Quantitative Evaluation in Section 6.2: While the supplementary material is interesting, the lack of a quantitative evaluation method for the discussed tasks limits the rigor of the analysis.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Significant performance improvements over BKT.
- Novel application of LSTM RNNs to knowledge tracing.
- Practical implications for personalized education.
- Shared resources that encourage reproducibility.
Cons:
- Poor organization and unclear motivation for certain choices (e.g., AUC as the primary metric).
- Lack of usability documentation for the shared code.
- Insufficient quantitative evaluation in some sections.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of knowledge tracing and demonstrates clear advancements over prior methods. However, the issues with organization and evaluation metrics need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, as the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper aligns well with the scope and standards of NIPS.
