The paper addresses the problem of decentralized computation of U-statistics in distributed networks, proposing novel synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms. U-statistics, which include measures like AUC and within-cluster point scatter, are critical for describing global statistical properties but are computationally expensive in distributed settings. The authors claim improved convergence rates (O(1/t) for synchronous and O(log t/t) for asynchronous) compared to prior work, with reduced memory and communication costs. The theoretical contributions include comprehensive proofs of convergence and bounds, supported by experiments on real datasets to validate the algorithms' performance.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper provides rigorous theoretical proofs for the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms. The use of "phantom nodes" for analysis is a novel and elegant approach to model data propagation and averaging steps separately.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the algorithms and their theoretical underpinnings. The inclusion of both synchronous and asynchronous settings makes the contribution more comprehensive.
3. Significance: The problem of decentralized U-statistics computation is relevant for distributed systems, and the proposed algorithms address practical constraints like limited memory and communication. The improved convergence rates and reduced resource requirements are valuable contributions.
4. Evaluation of Convergence: The theoretical bounds are complemented by numerical experiments, demonstrating the algorithms' performance on real datasets and different network topologies.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Novelty: While the problem is interesting, the novelty of the proposed algorithms is somewhat limited. The paper builds on existing randomized gossip algorithms, and the improvements appear incremental rather than groundbreaking.
2. Weak Evaluation: The experimental evaluation lacks comparisons with baseline methods beyond U2-gossip. For instance, no randomized algorithm-based baselines are considered, which could provide a broader context for the proposed methods' performance.
3. Absence of Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not benchmark against simpler or more established methods for decentralized computation, which undermines the claim of superiority.
4. Limited Practical Insights: While the theoretical results are strong, the practical implications of the algorithms (e.g., scalability to very large networks or robustness to real-world issues like node failures) are not thoroughly explored.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper tackles an important and underexplored problem in decentralized computation.
- The theoretical contributions are rigorous and well-supported.
- The proposed algorithms demonstrate improved performance over U2-gossip in experiments.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of novelty in the algorithmic approach limits the paper's impact.
- The evaluation is insufficiently robust, with no comparisons to randomized baselines or simpler methods.
- Practical considerations like scalability and robustness are not adequately addressed.
Recommendation: Borderline. While the paper makes a solid theoretical contribution and addresses a relevant problem, the lack of novelty and weak evaluation diminish its overall impact. Strengthening the experimental section with broader comparisons and practical insights would significantly improve the paper.
