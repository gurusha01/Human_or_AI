The paper introduces an EM-style algorithm for learning Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs) and applies it to disease progression modeling, specifically for glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease. The motivation for using CT-HMMs is well-articulated, emphasizing their suitability for irregularly sampled temporal data, a common characteristic in medical datasets. This positions CT-HMMs as a more realistic alternative to discrete-time HMMs in practical applications such as disease modeling and customer interaction.
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by presenting the first comprehensive EM-based framework for CT-HMM learning. The derivation of the algorithms is technically non-trivial and leverages methods from the continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) literature, such as the Expm and Unif methods for computing end-state conditioned expectations. This work extends prior CTMC approaches and adapts them effectively to the CT-HMM domain, demonstrating both theoretical rigor and practical relevance. The authors also provide a detailed complexity analysis and compare the performance of various algorithmic variants, which is a valuable addition to the literature.
Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets strengthens the paper, showcasing the practical utility of CT-HMMs. The glaucoma dataset results demonstrate superior performance compared to a state-of-the-art Bayesian joint linear regression method, while the Alzheimer's dataset provides qualitative insights into disease progression trends. However, the empirical section has some limitations. The comparison on the glaucoma dataset would be more robust if discrete-time HMMs were included as a baseline. Additionally, the Alzheimer's results, while interesting, are largely qualitative and lack quantitative benchmarks.
The paper is well-organized, and the CT-HMM framework is clearly explained. However, Section 5 requires revision due to unclear sentences and grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity. Additionally, the reliance on exponential distributions for transition times, while standard, may limit the model's flexibility. Exploring mixtures of distributions could be a promising direction for future work.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a novel and comprehensive framework for CT-HMM learning, extending prior work in CTMCs.
2. Practical Relevance: The use of real-world datasets demonstrates the applicability of the proposed methods.
3. Algorithmic Rigor: The derivation and comparison of multiple algorithmic approaches add depth to the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Empirical Limitations: Comparisons on the glaucoma dataset lack discrete-time HMMs as a baseline, and the Alzheimer's results are largely qualitative.
2. Clarity Issues: Section 5 contains unclear sentences and grammatical errors.
3. Model Assumptions: The exclusive use of exponential distributions for transition times may limit flexibility.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a solid theoretical contribution and demonstrates practical utility, justifying its acceptance. However, addressing the empirical and clarity issues would significantly strengthen the work.
