Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the estimation of sparse graphical models for high-dimensional tensor-valued data under the assumption of a tensor normal distribution. The authors propose an alternating minimization algorithm, termed Tlasso, to solve the penalized maximum likelihood estimation problem, which is non-convex due to the Kronecker product structure of the covariance. The paper establishes theoretical guarantees for the proposed method, including minimax-optimal rates of convergence, consistency in graph recovery, and the surprising result that estimation consistency can be achieved with just one tensor sample. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments comparing Tlasso to existing methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically sound and provides nontrivial results. The use of alternating minimization to overcome non-convexity is well-motivated and rigorously analyzed. Theorem 3.1, which demonstrates one-step convergence of the population minimization function, is a key contribution and a critical observation for future research.
2. Significance: The work advances the state of the art in tensor graphical models by addressing the computational-statistical gap and achieving minimax-optimal rates. The ability to achieve estimation consistency with a single tensor sample is particularly noteworthy and has practical implications for fields like fMRI and recommendation systems.
3. Clarity of Most Proofs: The majority of the proofs are clear and well-structured, making the theoretical contributions accessible to the reader.
4. Practical Relevance: The numerical experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency and superior performance of Tlasso compared to existing methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Initialization Concern: The claim that initialization is irrelevant is undermined by the fact that the authors use the same initialization as prior works. This raises concerns about the generality of the results and should be addressed more rigorously.
2. Sample Sufficiency Claim: The claim that one sample suffices for estimation consistency is not fully supported by the current proof. Additional theoretical justification or empirical validation is needed to substantiate this claim.
3. Missing Proof: The proof for the last theorem is missing, which leaves a gap in the theoretical exposition. This omission should be rectified in a future revision.
4. Supplementary Material Errors: The supplementary material contains several small errors, including typos, unclear terms, and missing definitions. These issues detract from the overall clarity and should be corrected.
5. Talagrand's Inequality: The reliance on Talagrand's inequality is unclear and appears to be misattributed. This weakens the theoretical rigor and should be clarified.
6. Hessian Definition: The definition of the Hessian in line 323 is unclear and requires revision for better understanding.
7. Minimax Bound Clarity: The minimax optimality claim lacks clarity regarding the class of distributions it pertains to, which limits the generalizability of the results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes significant contributions to the field of tensor graphical models, particularly with its theoretical guarantees and practical algorithm.
- Theorem 3.1 is a novel and impactful result that will likely inspire follow-up research.
- The numerical experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The initialization concern and unsupported sample sufficiency claim raise questions about the robustness of the results.
- The missing proof and errors in the supplementary material detract from the completeness and clarity of the work.
- The unclear use of Talagrand's inequality and Hessian definition weaken the theoretical rigor.
Recommendation:
This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the initialization concern, clarify the sample sufficiency claim, and correct the errors in the supplementary material. The contributions are significant, and the results have the potential to impact both theoretical and applied research in tensor graphical models.
