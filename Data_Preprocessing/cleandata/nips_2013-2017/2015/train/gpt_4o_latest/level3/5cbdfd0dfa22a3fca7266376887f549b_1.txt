The paper presents a modified version of Leurgans' algorithm for sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, emphasizing computational efficiency. By leveraging tensor contraction and convex optimization techniques, the authors propose a framework that avoids computationally expensive tensor unfolding methods. The algorithm is theoretically supported with guarantees for exact recovery under specific incoherence and sparsity conditions. The authors also discuss potential extensions to higher-order tensors and other applications, such as tensor completion and block sparsity. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm's performance on small-scale order-3 tensors, demonstrating its ability to recover low-rank and sparse components.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm that modifies Leurgans' approach, avoiding tensor unfolding and reducing the problem to matrix decomposition. The theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic recovery conditions, are well-grounded and extend existing results in tensor decomposition literature.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized, with clear problem definitions, algorithm descriptions, and theoretical results. The modular nature of the proposed method is a strength, as it allows for straightforward extensions to higher-order tensors and other problem settings.
3. Potential Impact: The proposed method addresses a challenging problem in tensor decomposition with applications in machine learning, signal processing, and neuroscience. Its computational efficiency and scalability (compared to tensor unfolding approaches) could make it a valuable tool for practitioners.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Numerical Experiments: The numerical validation is restricted to small-scale tensors (50×50×50) with low ranks (r = 1-4). While the results are promising, they do not convincingly demonstrate scalability or performance for larger tensors or higher ranks (e.g., r = 40-49). This raises concerns about the algorithm's practical applicability to real-world large-scale problems.
2. Scalability Concerns: The reliance on eigenvalue decompositions and convex optimization may limit scalability for large tensors. While the authors claim computational efficiency, empirical evidence for handling tensors of higher dimensions or ranks is insufficient.
3. Implementation Details: The paper lacks clarity on solving problem (6), particularly regarding parameter selection (e.g., ν1, ν3) and practical implementation strategies. This omission could hinder reproducibility and adoption by other researchers.
4. Sparsity Definition: The paper does not provide a precise or consistent definition of sparsity, leaving ambiguity about the types of sparse tensors the algorithm can handle effectively.
5. Typos and Errors: Several minor errors (e.g., matrix dimensions, summation indices, and variable notation) detract from the manuscript's overall polish and readability.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution, its practical impact is limited by insufficient numerical validation and unclear implementation details. To strengthen the submission:
- Include experiments on larger tensors with higher ranks to demonstrate scalability.
- Provide detailed implementation guidelines for solving problem (6) and parameter selection.
- Address the ambiguity in sparsity definitions and correct typographical errors.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Theoretical rigor with strong recovery guarantees.
- Novel and computationally efficient approach compared to tensor unfolding methods.
- Modular framework with potential for extensions to higher-order tensors and other applications.
Cons:
- Limited numerical experiments and scalability demonstration.
- Unclear implementation details and parameter tuning.
- Minor errors and lack of clarity in certain sections.
Final Decision: Borderline accept. The paper has significant theoretical merit but requires additional experimental validation and clarity to fully demonstrate its practical impact.
