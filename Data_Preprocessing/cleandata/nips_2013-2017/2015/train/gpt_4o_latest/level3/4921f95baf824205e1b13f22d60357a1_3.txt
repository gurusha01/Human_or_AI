This paper investigates the theoretical and empirical properties of the common neighbors (CN) heuristic for link prediction and clustering in networks, particularly under the stochastic blockmodel framework. While spectral clustering is a well-established method with strong theoretical guarantees, its computational cost makes it impractical for large graphs. The authors propose that CN, a simple and computationally efficient heuristic, can achieve competitive results in semi-dense and semi-sparse graph regimes. They further introduce a "cleaning" step to enhance CN's performance in sparse graphs. The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, supported by empirical validation on simulated and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper offers a solid theoretical foundation for the CN heuristic under the stochastic blockmodel, addressing a gap in prior literature. The analysis clearly delineates the semi-dense and semi-sparse regimes, providing conditions under which CN is effective.
2. Novelty: The introduction of the cleaning step is a meaningful extension, broadening the applicability of CN to sparser graphs. This is a novel contribution that enhances the heuristic's utility.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their theoretical claims with experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CN, with the cleaning step, performs competitively with spectral clustering and Katz scores in certain regimes.
4. Relevance: The problem of link prediction is highly relevant to applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and other domains, making the work significant from a theoretical perspective.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Relevance: While the theoretical analysis is robust, the practical utility of the proposed method is unclear. The experiments do not sufficiently explore the strengths and weaknesses of CN compared to other methods, particularly in diverse real-world scenarios.
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The algorithm depends on parameters (e.g., thresholds for the cleaning step) that are not well-justified or explored in suboptimal settings. The performance under incorrect parameter choices remains unclear.
3. Assumption of Equal Cluster Sizes: The assumption of equal cluster sizes is restrictive. While the authors mention that this can be relaxed, the implications of such relaxation are not thoroughly analyzed, and it introduces additional parameters that are not well-studied.
4. Clarity and Organization: Sections 3 and 4 are poorly structured, with concepts introduced in a disorganized manner. The relationship between different components of the method is not always clear, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
5. Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from minor but noticeable issues, such as copy-paste errors, unclear abbreviations, and imprecise terminology, which detract from its readability.
Post-Rebuttal Comments:
The authors addressed concerns about parameter sensitivity, the cleaning step, and the assumption of equal cluster sizes. However, the structural issues in Sections 3 and 4 remain unresolved, and the practical relevance of the method is still insufficiently demonstrated.
Recommendation:
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical analysis of a widely used heuristic.
- Novel and meaningful extension with the cleaning step.
- Empirical results that validate theoretical claims.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poor presentation and organization.
- Insufficient exploration of practical relevance and parameter sensitivity.
- Limited applicability due to strong assumptions (e.g., equal cluster sizes).
Final Decision: Weak Accept. While the paper makes a solid theoretical contribution, the issues with clarity, presentation, and practical relevance limit its impact. Addressing these concerns in a revised version would significantly strengthen the work.
