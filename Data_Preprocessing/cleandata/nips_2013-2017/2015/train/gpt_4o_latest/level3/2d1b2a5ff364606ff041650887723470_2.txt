This paper presents a significant extension of the statistical performance analysis of the `2-LASSO to single-index models, relaxing the Gaussian prior assumption. By deriving precise asymptotic results for the estimation error of the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements, the authors demonstrate that the performance is equivalent to that under scaled and noisy linear measurements. This connection, which bridges single-index models and linear models with scaled signals and non-standard noise, is a key contribution and could benefit from explicit mention in the main text for clarity.
The paper makes a notable contribution to the literature on the asymptotic behavior of LASSO-type estimators. The authors provide rigorous theoretical results, including precise error predictions and their dependence on factors such as the regularizer, measurement matrix, and link function. These results are validated through numerical experiments, which align well with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the application to quantized compressive sensing and the derivation of optimal quantization thresholds and levels using the Lloyd-Max algorithm are practical and impactful extensions.
However, there are areas where the paper could be improved. First, while the theoretical analysis is rigorous, the practical justification for using the `2-LASSO over the `2²-LASSO, based on its independence from noise variance, could be further elaborated. This would strengthen the argument for the choice of the `2-LASSO in real-world applications. Second, the paper is well-written but dense, and accessibility could be improved by addressing key points, such as the aforementioned connection between single-index and linear models, in the main text rather than relegating them to later sections or appendices.
Strengths:
1. Rigorous and novel theoretical contributions to the analysis of LASSO under non-linear measurements.
2. Clear connection established between non-linear and linear measurement models.
3. Practical application to quantized compressive sensing with optimal quantization design.
4. Validation of theoretical results through numerical experiments.
Weaknesses:
1. The practical motivation for the `2-LASSO over the `2²-LASSO could be explored more thoroughly.
2. The connection between single-index models and linear models with scaled signals and non-standard noise should be highlighted earlier in the text.
3. Accessibility could be improved by simplifying some of the dense theoretical exposition.
Recommendation:
This paper is a strong scientific contribution to the field of high-dimensional statistics and optimization. While there are minor areas for improvement, the novelty, rigor, and practical relevance of the work make it a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity and practical motivation issues in a revision.
