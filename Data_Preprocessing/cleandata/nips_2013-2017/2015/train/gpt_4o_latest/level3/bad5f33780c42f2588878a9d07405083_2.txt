The paper addresses the critical issue of overfitting in the repeated use of hold-out sets during adaptive data analysis and proposes novel methods to mitigate this problem. The main contributions are encapsulated in Theorems 9 and 10, which provide guarantees for reusing hold-out sets without overfitting. The work extends beyond traditional differential privacy methods by introducing the concept of approximate max-information, which unifies differential privacy and description length-based approaches. This generalization is a significant contribution, as it allows the framework to encompass algorithms with outputs describable by a small number of bits, broadening its applicability.
The paper's results are particularly exciting because they do not constrain the class of functions for validation, unlike standard approaches relying on uniform concentration inequalities for VC classes. This flexibility makes the proposed methods more broadly applicable to real-world adaptive data analysis scenarios. Additionally, the high-level writing and clarity of the exposition are commendable, as the paper provides a clear narrative and sufficient background for understanding the problem and its solutions.
However, there are notable concerns. Theorem 9 has significant issues, including deterministic claims that depend on randomness, inadequate simultaneous bounds for adaptive decisions, and unclear parameter settings that lead to vacuous results in some cases. These issues undermine the theoretical rigor of the paper's primary contributions. Furthermore, the experimental design raises questions, particularly the use of a classifier with weights of +1 and -1 based on correlation signs, which seems impractical and lacks justification. Additionally, the extension to algorithms with small-bit outputs, while acknowledged by the authors, can be derived using a simpler union bound argument, which diminishes the novelty of this aspect.
The paper also has minor clarity issues, such as incorrect references to training/hold-out sets and unclear bounds in Theorem 4. Typos and redundant sentences in sections like Theorem 8 further detract from the overall quality.
In summary, the paper makes valuable contributions to adaptive data analysis by addressing overfitting in hold-out set reuse and introducing approximate max-information as a unifying concept. However, the significant concerns with Theorem 9 and the experimental design necessitate major revisions before the paper can be considered for acceptance. Recommendation: Major Revision.
