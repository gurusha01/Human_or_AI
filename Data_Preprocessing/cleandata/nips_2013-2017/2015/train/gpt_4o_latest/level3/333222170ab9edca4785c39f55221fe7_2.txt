The paper introduces a novel framework, LENSE, for on-the-job learning, which aims to build high-accuracy classifiers starting with zero labeled examples. By leveraging real-time crowdsourcing to resolve uncertainties and progressively reducing reliance on human input, the system balances accuracy, latency, and cost using Bayesian decision theory. The authors employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to approximate the intractable optimal policy and demonstrate the system's effectiveness across three datasets: named-entity recognition (NER), sentiment classification, and image classification. LENSE achieves significant cost reductions compared to full human annotation while improving accuracy over traditional machine learning baselines.
Strengths:
1. Compelling Problem and Novel Approach: The paper addresses a critical challenge in machine learning—creating high-accuracy systems without labeled data—by proposing a principled framework that combines stochastic game modeling with real-time crowdsourcing. The integration of timing and latency optimization is particularly innovative.
2. Empirical Results: The experimental results are strong, showing significant cost reductions and accuracy improvements. For example, LENSE achieves an 8% F1 improvement over single human labeling and a 28% improvement over online learning in NER.
3. Practical Contributions: The open-source implementation and reproducibility details enhance the paper's utility for the research community.
4. Interdisciplinary Relevance: The work bridges multiple areas, including active learning, crowdsourcing, and structured prediction, making it broadly relevant.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: The paper is dense and sometimes difficult to follow. For instance, the example in Line 154 is abstract and would benefit from a concrete query example with realistic crowd responses and timings.
2. Terminology Inconsistencies: Tables 2 and 3 use inconsistent terminology, referring to the same baseline as both "entropic" and "threshold," which may confuse readers.
3. Unconventional Organization: Placing related work in Section 5 disrupts the flow. A more standard placement in the introduction or a dedicated section earlier in the paper would improve readability.
4. Opaque Presentation: While the problem is compelling, the explanations of the stochastic game framework and utility function are overly technical and could be simplified for broader accessibility.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The problem is significant, and the proposed solution is novel and well-motivated.
- Strong empirical results demonstrate the system's practical value.
- The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the intersection of machine learning and crowdsourcing.
Cons:
- The paper's clarity and organization need improvement, which may hinder comprehension.
- Some terminology inconsistencies and abstract examples reduce readability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution by addressing a challenging and impactful problem with a novel approach. While the presentation could be improved, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address clarity, terminology, and organizational issues.
