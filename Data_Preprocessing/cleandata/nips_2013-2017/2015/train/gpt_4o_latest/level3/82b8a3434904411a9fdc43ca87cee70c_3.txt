The paper introduces a novel framework for computing lower bounds on cross-validation (CV) error as a function of the regularization parameter in linear models, enabling a theoretically guaranteed selection of the regularization parameter. This is achieved by deriving a "regularization path of CV error lower bounds," which quantifies how far the CV error of a selected solution is from the best possible CV error. The framework is applicable to common parameter tuning strategies like grid search and Bayesian optimization and can work with approximate solutions, making it computationally efficient. This contribution is positioned as a practical alternative to existing methods for regularization parameter tuning, which often lack theoretical guarantees.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses an important and practical problem in machine learning—regularization parameter tuning—by providing a theoretical guarantee on CV error, which is a significant improvement over heuristic approaches. The proposed framework is novel and builds on recent advances in safe screening and approximate regularization paths, extending these ideas to CV error bounds. The theoretical contributions are well-supported by rigorous derivations, and the paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it accessible to readers. Additionally, the method has the potential to reduce over-tuning of the regularization parameter and over-fitting to the CV estimate, which is a common issue in practice. The framework's ability to work with approximate solutions further enhances its computational practicality, a key consideration in real-world applications.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its theoretical contributions, the paper's experimental evaluation is limited. The experiments are conducted on only a few small datasets, which undermines the claim of computational practicality, especially for large-scale problems. The datasets used are not representative of the diverse challenges faced in real-world applications, and the results lack statistical rigor (e.g., no confidence intervals or significance testing). Furthermore, while the framework is theoretically sound, it is unclear whether it leads to better model selection compared to directly optimizing CV error within a computational budget. The paper also does not adequately address dependencies between kernel and regularization parameters when kernelized, leaving the validity of the bounds in such cases uncertain.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
1. Novel theoretical framework with strong mathematical foundations.  
2. Practical implications for regularization parameter tuning with theoretical guarantees.  
3. Clear and well-written exposition of the methods and results.  
Cons:  
1. Weak experimental evaluation, with limited datasets and lack of large-scale experiments.  
2. Unclear benefits over direct optimization of CV error in practice.  
3. Potential issues with kernelized extensions due to parameter dependencies.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution, the experimental evaluation does not sufficiently demonstrate the framework's practical utility or scalability. I recommend a weak reject, with encouragement to strengthen the experimental section by including larger datasets, more diverse scenarios, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Addressing the kernelization issue would also enhance the paper's impact.
