This paper introduces a new graph property, hierarchy width, to analyze the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs. The authors establish that the mixing time is exponential in the hierarchy width and the maximum weight difference in factor graph potentials. For specific hierarchical factor graph templates, the results demonstrate that Gibbs sampling can achieve polynomial mixing time, providing theoretical guarantees for a class of models where such guarantees were previously lacking. The paper also validates its theoretical contributions with experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including a Paleontology application where Gibbs sampling outperformed human volunteers in accuracy.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The introduction of hierarchy width as a stronger condition than hypertree width is a significant theoretical contribution. It addresses a known gap in the literature by providing new cases where Gibbs sampling is provably efficient.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The proofs are detailed and well-structured, particularly the derivation of polynomial mixing time for graphs with bounded hierarchy width and factor weights. The comparison with hypertree width highlights the necessity of the new property.
3. Practical Relevance: The focus on hierarchical factor graph templates, which are common in real-world applications, enhances the practical significance of the work. The results are particularly impactful for domains like natural language processing and knowledge base population.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments, especially the real-world application in Paleontology, demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. The empirical results align well with the theoretical predictions, strengthening the paper's claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: Figure 1 is poorly integrated into the text, with its explanation appearing much later in the paper. This disrupts the flow and makes it harder for readers to follow the examples.
2. Assumptions and Limitations: The paper does not address the impact of near-deterministic potentials or 0 values on the results, leaving questions about the robustness of the assumptions on the distribution structure.
3. High Treewidth Models: It remains unclear whether hierarchical templates can result in high treewidth models, which might not require Gibbs sampling. This ambiguity limits the generalizability of the results.
4. Semantic Distinctions: The distinction between linear, logical, and ratio semantics is not sufficiently explored in terms of their implications for the theoretical results. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with these concepts.
5. Real-World Applicability: While the paper focuses on hierarchical templates, it does not adequately address scenarios where only subgraphs of a model are hierarchical. This limits the applicability of the results to broader real-world problems.
Recommendation:
This paper tackles a challenging and important problem, making a strong theoretical contribution with practical implications. However, the presentation could be improved, and some critical assumptions and limitations need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to improve the clarity of the figures, address the impact of near-deterministic potentials, and elaborate on the real-world applicability of the results to non-hierarchical subgraphs.
Pro Arguments:
- Novel theoretical contribution with hierarchy width.
- Strong experimental validation, including real-world applications.
- Practical relevance for hierarchical factor graph templates.
Con Arguments:
- Lack of clarity in figure integration and semantic distinctions.
- Unaddressed limitations regarding near-deterministic potentials and high treewidth models.
- Limited discussion of applicability to non-hierarchical subgraphs.
In summary, this paper advances the theoretical understanding of Gibbs sampling and has the potential to influence both research and practice. With minor revisions, it will make a valuable contribution to the conference.
