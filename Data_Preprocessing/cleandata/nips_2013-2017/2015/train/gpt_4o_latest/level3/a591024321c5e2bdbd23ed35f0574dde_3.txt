The paper presents a novel and comprehensive framework for efficient EM-based parameter learning in Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs), addressing a critical gap in modeling irregularly sampled temporal data, such as disease progression. By reformulating CT-HMM inference as a discrete-time inhomogeneous HMM problem and leveraging advanced methods for computing end-state conditioned expectations, the authors demonstrate significant scalability and practical utility. The proposed methods are rigorously evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease, showcasing their ability to handle large state spaces and provide clinically relevant insights.
Strengths:
The paper is technically sound and well-written, with strong mathematical foundations and a clear exposition of the challenges and solutions in CT-HMM learning. The authors provide a detailed time complexity analysis (Table 1) and compare multiple algorithmic variants, offering valuable insights into trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. The experiments on real-world biomedical datasets are particularly compelling, as they not only validate the proposed methods but also tie the results to known disease insights. For example, the glaucoma model captures clinically observed progression patterns, while the Alzheimer's model supports recent findings about biomarker interactions. These contributions highlight the significance of the work for both machine learning and biomedical research.
Weaknesses:
The evaluation on synthetic data is limited, as the 5-state complete digraph setup does not adequately explore real-life challenges such as sparse observations, high noise levels, or complex state dependencies. A more diverse set of synthetic experiments would strengthen the paper's claims about robustness and generalizability. Additionally, Section 5.2 lacks clarity in describing competing methods, particularly the Bayesian joint linear regression baseline. Providing more details in the appendix, such as parameter settings and implementation specifics, would improve reproducibility and transparency. Minor issues include Figure 2, which is not self-contained, and several typos and unclear claims (e.g., the reference to binary search in Section 5.2).
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Tackles a challenging and important problem in temporal data modeling.
- Demonstrates scalability to large state spaces (e.g., 105 and 277 states).
- Provides clinically relevant insights, advancing the state of the art in disease progression modeling.
- Comprehensive evaluation of algorithmic variants with clear recommendations (e.g., Expm under soft EM).
Cons:
- Limited exploration of synthetic data scenarios.
- Insufficient clarity in describing competing methods and experimental setups.
- Minor presentation issues (e.g., Figure 2 and typos).
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of temporal modeling and is likely to be of interest to both machine learning researchers and practitioners in biomedical domains. While some areas could benefit from additional clarification and experimentation, the strengths of the work outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted issues.
