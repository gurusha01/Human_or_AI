Review of "Improved Variants of the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm"
This paper presents a detailed analysis of several variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization algorithm, including Away-Steps FW (AFW), Pairwise FW (PFW), Fully-Corrective FW (FCFW), and Wolfe's Minimum Norm Point (MNP) algorithm. The authors prove global linear convergence for these variants under weaker conditions than strong convexity, offering a novel geometric interpretation of the convergence constant. The paper also highlights practical applications of these variants, such as submodular optimization and sparse coding.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The theoretical results are well-developed and significant. The authors provide the first global linear convergence proofs for all FW variants under weaker conditions, which is a meaningful advancement in the field. The introduction of the pyramidal width as a geometric quantity is novel and could have broader implications for optimization theory.
2. Clarity of Theoretical Results: Despite general writing issues, the theoretical sections are relatively clear and well-structured, making the proofs accessible to readers with a strong mathematical background.
3. Relevance: The work addresses an important problem in optimization, particularly for constrained convex problems in machine learning. The results are likely to be of interest to both theorists and practitioners.
Weaknesses:
1. Writing Issues: The paper suffers from numerous writing problems, including typos, missing punctuation, repeated words, and undefined acronyms. For example, terms like "LMOA" and "MNP" are not adequately defined in the main text. These issues significantly detract from the readability and professionalism of the paper.
2. Unclear Method Descriptions: The description of the Pairwise FW method is particularly problematic, with awkward and unclear sentences that make it difficult to follow the algorithm's details.
3. Experimental Section: The experimental results are weak. Figures are unclear, and lines are indistinguishable in printed versions. Moreover, the experiments fail to corroborate the theoretical results convincingly. The use of the sparse coding problem as a "toy example" is insufficient, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods for the Lasso problem are missing.
4. Structural Issues: The paper lacks a conclusion section, which would help summarize the contributions and contextualize the results. Additionally, Section 4 could be integrated into the main text to improve flow, and the last two sections require significant revision to address clarity and coherence.
5. Bibliography Formatting: The bibliography is inconsistently formatted and does not adhere to standard citation guidelines, which undermines the paper's overall presentation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by proving global linear convergence for FW variants under weaker assumptions.
- The introduction of the pyramidal width is a novel and potentially impactful idea.
- The work is relevant to constrained optimization problems in machine learning, aligning with the conference's scope.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The writing issues and unclear descriptions of methods significantly hinder comprehension.
- The experimental section is underwhelming and fails to validate the theoretical claims adequately.
- The paper lacks structural elements, such as a conclusion, and suffers from poor organization in some sections.
Recommendation:
While the theoretical contributions are noteworthy, the paper requires substantial revisions to address its writing, experimental validation, and structural issues. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage the authors to resubmit after addressing these concerns. Specifically, the authors should:
1. Thoroughly revise the writing for clarity and eliminate typos and inconsistencies.
2. Improve the experimental section by including state-of-the-art comparisons and clearer visualizations.
3. Add a conclusion section and integrate Section 4 into the main text.
4. Standardize the bibliography formatting.
With these improvements, the paper could make a strong contribution to the field.
