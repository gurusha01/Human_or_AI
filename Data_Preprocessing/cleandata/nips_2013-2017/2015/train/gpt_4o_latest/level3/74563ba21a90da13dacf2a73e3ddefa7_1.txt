This paper addresses the statistical challenges of working with persistence diagrams in topological data analysis (TDA) by proposing a novel kernel-based method. The authors introduce the universal persistence scale-space (u-PSS) kernel, a modification of an existing kernel, and prove its universality with respect to the 1-Wasserstein metric. This universality enables embedding probability measures on persistence diagrams into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), facilitating statistical computations such as two-sample hypothesis testing. The paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed kernel through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its potential to reduce computational complexity and broaden the applicability of TDA in machine learning.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a meaningful contribution by addressing a key bottleneck in statistical TDA: the computational and theoretical challenges of working with persistence diagrams. The proof of universality for the u-PSS kernel is a significant theoretical result, as it ensures the kernel's suitability for embedding probability measures and conducting principled statistical tests. The experiments effectively validate the proposed method, demonstrating its applicability to both synthetic and real-world data. The ability to test for distributional differences in persistence diagrams, rather than merely comparing specific properties like means, is a notable advancement over prior work. The paper also connects its contributions to existing methods in kernel-based learning, ensuring relevance to the broader machine learning community.
Weaknesses:  
The paper suffers from significant readability issues, particularly for readers unfamiliar with algebraic topology or functional analysis. Key concepts, such as persistent homology, filtrations, and RKHS embeddings, are introduced with insufficient explanation, making the paper inaccessible to a broader audience. Additionally, the argumentation is disorganized, with core ideas scattered across sections, which hampers the logical flow. The novelty of the work is somewhat limited, as it heavily builds upon existing kernels and prior theoretical results. While the universality proof is a valuable addition, the methodological innovation appears incremental. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the implications of lifting the compactness restrictions on the kernel, leaving open questions about its broader applicability.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- The universality proof is a solid theoretical contribution.  
- The method simplifies statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a challenging problem in TDA.  
- Experiments demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed kernel.  
- The work has potential impact in enabling broader applications of TDA in machine learning.  
Con:  
- The paper is poorly written, with significant clarity and organization issues.  
- The contribution is incremental, relying heavily on existing results.  
- The theoretical scope is limited by compactness assumptions, which are not thoroughly addressed.  
Final Verdict:  
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to statistical TDA, its limited novelty, poor readability, and disorganized presentation detract from its overall quality. The theoretical and empirical content, though promising, is insufficiently developed to warrant acceptance in its current form. I recommend a weak rejection (5/10), with encouragement to the authors to improve the exposition, address the compactness limitations, and further clarify the novelty of their contributions.
