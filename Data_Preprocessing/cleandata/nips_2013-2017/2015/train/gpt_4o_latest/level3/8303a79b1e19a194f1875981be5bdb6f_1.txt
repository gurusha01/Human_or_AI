This paper presents a novel modification to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for sampling from piecewise smooth probability distributions, addressing a significant limitation of traditional HMC in handling non-differentiable energy functions. The authors propose Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), which incorporates "reflections" and "refractions" to handle discontinuities in the energy function. These mechanisms are inspired by physical systems, such as optics, and are triggered when the trajectory crosses polytope boundaries. The authors prove that RHMC preserves volume, ensuring convergence to the correct stationary distribution, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Novelty: The introduction of reflections and refractions in HMC is a creative and physically inspired approach to addressing the challenges posed by non-differentiable energy functions. This work generalizes prior methods, such as those by Pakman and Paninski, to arbitrary piecewise continuous distributions, significantly broadening the scope of applicability.
2. Technical Rigor: The paper provides a thorough theoretical foundation, including proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance, ensuring that RHMC samples from the correct target distribution. The mathematical analysis is robust and well-justified.
3. Practical Impact: The proposed method reduces rejection rates and improves mixing speed, particularly in high-dimensional settings, making it a valuable contribution to probabilistic inference for complex models.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The algorithm is clearly described, and the motivation for the approach is well-articulated. The inclusion of experimental results comparing RHMC to baseline HMC and Metropolis-Hastings further strengthens the paper.
5. Experimental Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate that RHMC outperforms baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings in terms of effective sample size, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions on Boundaries: The method assumes that the boundaries of the piecewise regions are affine hyperplanes. While this is a reasonable starting point, it limits the applicability of RHMC to more general discontinuous distributions.
2. Rejection Rate Analysis: Although the authors highlight the reduction in rejection rates, a more detailed discussion and quantitative analysis of rejection rates across different settings would provide additional insights.
3. Computational Overhead: While RHMC improves sampling efficiency, the additional computational cost of detecting intersections and performing reflections/refractions is only briefly discussed. A more detailed analysis of this trade-off would be beneficial.
4. Broader Applicability: The method is tailored to piecewise smooth distributions with polytope boundaries. Extensions to more general discontinuities or non-affine boundaries are not explored, which could limit its utility in some applications.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it introduces a novel and impactful modification to HMC that addresses a critical limitation in sampling from non-differentiable distributions. The theoretical contributions are sound, and the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. However, the authors should consider expanding their discussion on rejection rates, computational trade-offs, and potential extensions to non-affine boundaries in future work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and creative approach to a challenging problem.
- Strong theoretical contributions with rigorous proofs.
- Demonstrated practical improvements in high-dimensional settings.
- Clear and well-organized presentation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited to affine boundaries, restricting broader applicability.
- Insufficient discussion of computational overhead and rejection rates.
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and is likely to inspire further research in extending HMC to more complex distributions.
