The paper presents a significant theoretical contribution to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) by extending policy gradient methods to the entire class of coherent risk measures, which are widely accepted in finance and operations research. The authors address both static and time-consistent dynamic risk measures, providing a unified framework that generalizes and simplifies previous approaches focused on specific risk measures like CVaR and mean-variance models. The core innovation lies in leveraging the dual representation of coherent risk measures as a convex hull of probability distributions, with risk defined as the maximum expected value in the hull. This enables the derivation of gradient formulas for risk-sensitive optimization, supported by sampling-based algorithms for both static and dynamic cases.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution by unifying risk-sensitive RL under the coherent risk framework. The derivation of gradient formulas for both static and dynamic risk measures is novel and generalizes existing results.
2. Algorithmic Development: The proposed sampling-based gradient estimation algorithms are practical and extendable to large-scale MDPs, addressing the "curse of dimensionality" in dynamic programming.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically organized, with clear problem formulation and detailed derivations. The inclusion of examples like CVaR and mean-semideviation demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.
4. Significance: The work is likely to have a broad impact, as coherent risk measures are widely used in various domains. The ability to handle general risk measures provides flexibility for practitioners to tailor risk preferences to specific applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Empirical Analysis: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the empirical evaluation is limited. A deeper analysis of the proposed gradient estimation algorithms, particularly in dynamic settings, would strengthen the paper.
2. Preliminaries Section: The roles of \( P_{\theta} \) and \( \xi \) in the preliminaries section are not clearly explained, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the notation.
3. Equation 2 and Theorem 2.1: The connection between Equation 2 (convex envelope) and Theorem 2.1 is not sufficiently clarified, leaving ambiguity about how the convex programming formulation relates to the representation of coherent risk measures.
4. Generalization to Continuous Variables: The paper does not explicitly discuss how the analysis generalizes to distributions on continuous variables, which could limit its applicability.
5. Smoothness of Constraints: The role of constraint function smoothness in proving Theorem 4.2 is not adequately discussed, which could improve the clarity of the technical results.
Pro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Strong theoretical contribution with a unified framework for coherent risk measures.
- Novel gradient estimation algorithms with practical implications for RL.
- Generalization of existing results and potential for broad applicability.
Cons:
- Limited empirical evaluation, particularly for dynamic risk measures.
- Some sections lack clarity, such as the preliminaries and connections between key equations.
- Missing discussion on generalization to continuous variables and the role of smoothness assumptions.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is a strong theoretical contribution to risk-sensitive decision-making and RL. While the proofs require verification and the empirical analysis could be expanded, the novelty and significance of the work justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity issues and provide additional empirical insights.
