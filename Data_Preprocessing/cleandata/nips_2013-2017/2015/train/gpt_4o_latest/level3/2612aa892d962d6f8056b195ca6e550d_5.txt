This paper presents a method for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as near-optimal feedback controllers for dynamic systems, achieving stable and realistic behaviors across various tasks and morphologies. The approach combines supervised learning with trajectory optimization, leveraging stochastic neural networks to handle noise and improve robustness. The authors demonstrate the method's versatility by applying it to diverse tasks, such as swimming, flying, and walking, using a unified architecture. The paper builds on prior work in reinforcement learning, trajectory optimization, and neural network-based control, advancing the state of the art by addressing challenges in high-dimensional continuous control tasks.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a promising combination of trajectory optimization and stochastic neural networks, yielding controllers capable of real-time, interactive use across diverse morphologies. This is a significant contribution to the field of robotics and animation, as it unifies disparate approaches for different tasks into a single framework.
2. Technical Depth: The method is rigorously formulated, with detailed explanations of trajectory optimization (Eq. 6) and stochastic policy training. The inclusion of noise injection and distributed training architecture enhances the robustness and scalability of the approach.
3. Experimental Results: The results are compelling, showcasing the method's ability to generate realistic locomotion behaviors for various characters. The comparative evaluation highlights the advantages of the joint optimization approach and noise injection.
4. Potential Applications: The method has broad applicability, from robotics to biomechanics and animation, making it a valuable contribution to multiple domains.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper suffers from structural imbalances, particularly between Sections 4 and 6. Section 4, which discusses neural network policy regression, omits key details about the recurrent units mentioned in the abstract, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of their role.
2. Stochastic Neural Network Definition: The paper does not clearly explain how the network qualifies as a stochastic neural network (l. 405). This is critical for understanding the robustness claims and should be elaborated.
3. Full Model Knowledge Assumption: The requirement for full model knowledge (Eq. 6) is not explicitly stated upfront, which could mislead readers about the method's applicability to real-world systems with partial knowledge.
4. Restructuring Needed: The paper would benefit from a clearer organization, with better alignment between the abstract, methodology, and experimental sections. For instance, the abstract emphasizes recurrent units, but their role is underexplored in the main text.
Recommendation:
The paper has significant potential but requires revisions for clarity and completeness. Specifically:
- Clearly state the assumption of full model knowledge early in the paper.
- Expand Section 4 to include details about recurrent units and their contribution to the method.
- Clarify how the network qualifies as a stochastic neural network.
- Balance the content across sections to improve readability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The method is innovative and addresses a challenging problem in control and animation.
- The results are impressive and demonstrate the method's versatility and robustness.
- The paper has potential to inspire further research and applications in related fields.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and organization need improvement, which may hinder comprehension.
- Key details about the method (e.g., recurrent units, stochastic NN qualification) are missing or underexplored.
Final Verdict:
With revisions to address the clarity and structural issues, this paper would make a strong contribution to the conference. I recommend a conditional acceptance pending these improvements.
