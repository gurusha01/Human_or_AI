The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for the widely used common neighbors heuristic in link prediction and clustering, particularly under the stochastic blockmodel (SBM). The authors demonstrate that the heuristic can recover clusters with high probability in dense graphs and extend its applicability to sparser graphs through a novel "cleaning" step. This work addresses a significant gap in the literature, as the common neighbors heuristic, despite its empirical success, has lacked theoretical justification until now.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic under the SBM, delineating two regimes—semi-dense and semi-sparse—where the method is effective. This is a substantial contribution, as the SBM is a foundational model in network science.
2. Novelty: The introduction of a "cleaning" step to extend the heuristic's applicability to sparser graphs is innovative and broadens the scope of the method. The authors also address weak edge dependencies, a relatively unexplored area in SBM literature.
3. Empirical Validation: The theoretical results are supported by experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating the heuristic's practical utility. The comparison with spectral clustering and the Katz score highlights its competitive performance, especially in sparse regimes.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written, with a clear exposition of the problem, theoretical results, and experimental findings. The inclusion of detailed proofs and supplementary material enhances its reproducibility.
5. Significance: The work is likely to impact both theoretical research and practical applications in link prediction and clustering, as the common neighbors heuristic is computationally efficient and widely used in large-scale networks.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions on SBM: The analysis assumes a fixed number of clusters and balanced cluster sizes, which may limit its applicability to real-world networks with more complex structures.
2. Limited Comparison: While the paper compares the heuristic with spectral clustering and the Katz score, other advanced methods (e.g., random walk-based approaches) are not considered. This could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. Empirical Focus: The experiments focus primarily on co-authorship networks. Testing on a broader range of real-world networks (e.g., social, biological, or infrastructure networks) would strengthen the generalizability of the results.
4. Cleaning Step Complexity: While the cleaning step improves performance in sparse graphs, its computational cost relative to the simplicity of the common neighbors heuristic is not thoroughly analyzed.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of link prediction and clustering. Its results are novel, well-supported, and likely to influence future research and applications. However, addressing the limitations in assumptions and expanding the empirical evaluation would further strengthen the work. Overall, I recommend acceptance, as the paper meets the quality, clarity, originality, and significance criteria of the conference.
