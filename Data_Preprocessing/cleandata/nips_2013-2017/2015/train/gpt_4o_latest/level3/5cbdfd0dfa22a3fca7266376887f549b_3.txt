The paper addresses the problem of sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, proposing a novel algorithm that extends Leurgans' Algorithm through the use of convex optimization. The authors reduce the tensor decomposition problem to a series of sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition problems via tensor contraction, avoiding computationally expensive tensor unfolding methods. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for exact recovery under specific incoherence and sparsity conditions, validated by numerical experiments. The proposed method is computationally efficient, scalable, and modular, with potential extensions to higher-order tensors, block sparsity, and tensor completion.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with well-supported claims through rigorous theoretical analysis. The derivation of recovery guarantees under specific incoherence and sparsity conditions is particularly compelling.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the algorithm and its theoretical underpinnings. The modular nature of the algorithm is well-illustrated, and the numerical experiments provide evidence of its practical feasibility.
3. Originality: The integration of Leurgans' Algorithm with convex optimization is a novel contribution. The avoidance of tensor unfolding and the use of tensor contraction to reduce computational complexity demonstrate innovative thinking.
4. Significance: The proposed method addresses a challenging problem in tensor decomposition and offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing methods. Its modularity and extensibility to higher-order tensors and other settings enhance its potential impact.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Real-World Validation: While the numerical experiments are promising, the lack of real-world datasets limits the practical validation of the method. Incorporating experiments on real-world applications, such as topic modeling or recommendation systems, would strengthen the paper.
2. Assumptions and Constraints: The recovery guarantees rely on strong assumptions about incoherence and sparsity, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. The paper could benefit from a discussion of how these assumptions might be relaxed or addressed in practice.
3. Minor Typos: The paper contains minor typographical errors, such as "algoirthm" instead of "algorithm" and "impelement" instead of "implement." While these do not detract from the technical content, they should be corrected for clarity.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a novel and computationally efficient solution to a challenging problem.
- The theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments demonstrate the method's soundness and scalability.
- The modular design of the algorithm opens avenues for future research and practical applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of real-world experiments limits the practical validation of the method.
- The strong assumptions required for recovery may restrict its applicability in diverse scenarios.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution and proposes a novel algorithm with clear potential for impact. However, addressing the practical limitations and correcting minor errors would enhance its overall quality.
