The paper addresses the problem of estimating a structured signal \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n\) from nonlinear measurements using the Generalized LASSO framework. It extends prior work by providing asymptotically precise characterizations of the estimation error for arbitrary nonlinear link functions \(g(\cdot)\), under the assumption that the measurement matrix \(A\) has i.i.d. Gaussian entries. A key result (Theorem 2.1) demonstrates that the asymptotic error for nonlinear measurements is equivalent to that for appropriately scaled and noisy linear measurements. This equivalence is established through explicit expressions for the scaling factor \(\mu\) and noise variance \(\sigma^2\), which depend on the link function \(g(\cdot)\). The paper also explores specific cases, such as sparse, group-sparse, and low-rank signal recovery, and provides numerical validation of its theoretical predictions.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by deriving precise error expressions for the Generalized LASSO under nonlinear measurements, which, to the best of my knowledge, is a novel result. The extension of prior work by Brillinger and Plan & Vershynin to the high-dimensional regime with regularization is a notable advancement.
2. Generality: The results are applicable to a wide range of link functions and regularizers, making the framework broadly relevant to various structured signal recovery problems.
3. Practical Implications: The connection between nonlinear and linear measurements provides actionable insights, such as the design of optimal quantizers (e.g., Lloyd-Max quantizer), which could be impactful in applications like compressive sensing and quantized signal recovery.
4. Numerical Validation: The paper includes numerical experiments that validate the theoretical predictions, demonstrating the accuracy of the derived error expressions.
Weaknesses
1. Restrictive Assumptions: The assumption that the measurement matrix \(A\) has i.i.d. Gaussian entries may limit the applicability of the results in practical scenarios where \(A\) has a different structure. This assumption requires further justification or discussion of its implications.
2. Regularizer Selection: The paper does not address how to choose the regularizer \(f(\cdot)\) based on the structure of the true signal \(x_0\). This omission is critical, as the choice of regularizer significantly impacts the performance of the Generalized LASSO.
3. Dependence on Parameters: The dependence of the results on the parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) is not fully explored. While these parameters are central to the analysis, their necessity in characterizing estimation difficulty could be better justified.
4. Literature Review: The paper lacks a comprehensive review of related work, particularly in areas such as single-index models, sufficient dimension reduction, and sparse recovery with zero \(\mu\). Recent work by Yi et al. is notably missing and should be cited for completeness.
5. Clarity: While the technical content is rigorous, the presentation could be improved for clarity. For instance, the derivation of Theorem 2.2 is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT). A more intuitive explanation of the main results would enhance accessibility.
Recommendation
The paper presents a strong theoretical contribution with interesting results, but it has several gaps that need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with major revisions. The authors should:
1. Justify the assumption of Gaussian measurement matrices and discuss its practical implications.
2. Provide guidance on selecting the regularizer based on the signal structure.
3. Expand the literature review to include missing references and related work.
4. Clarify the necessity of parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) in characterizing estimation difficulty.
5. Improve the exposition, particularly for the derivation of key results.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The results are novel, theoretically sound, and have practical implications.
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in high-dimensional signal recovery.
- Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The assumptions and scope of the results are restrictive and not well-justified.
- Missing references and insufficient discussion of related work weaken the paper's positioning.
- The clarity of the presentation could be significantly improved.
In summary, the paper has strong potential but requires revisions to address its limitations and improve its clarity and completeness.
