The paper proposes a novel gossip-style decentralized algorithm for computing higher-order statistics, specifically U-statistics, over distributed observations. This is a significant contribution as U-statistics, such as AUC, variance, and within-cluster scatter, are critical in many machine learning and statistical applications but have received limited attention in decentralized settings. The authors introduce both synchronous and asynchronous versions of their algorithm, leveraging a unique mechanism where nodes exchange and average estimates while swapping auxiliary state variables. This design enables a random walk of observations across the network, ensuring efficient data propagation and convergence.
The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical guarantees on convergence rates (O(1/t) for synchronous and O(log t/t) for asynchronous settings). The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the network-dependent convergence factors, such as the spectral gap, and compare their method to the existing U2-gossip algorithm. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence speed and memory efficiency. The inclusion of both theoretical and experimental evaluations strengthens the paper's contributions.
However, the paper has several weaknesses. First, the connection to prior work is insufficiently developed. Key references, such as Dimakis et al. (Proc. IEEE), are missing, which could provide better context and highlight the novelty of the approach. Additionally, the authors do not explore related work on lifting constructions for accelerating gossip algorithms, such as those by Jung et al., Li and Dai, and Chen et al., which could further contextualize their contributions. Second, the induced edge distribution from the "node wakes up, contacts neighbor" process is not clearly explained, leaving room for ambiguity in the asynchronous setting. Third, while the paper compares its approach to U2-gossip, a comparison with flooding-based methods that use more memory at each node could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of trade-offs. Finally, the problem statement and theorem assumptions on data distribution and error guarantees need clearer articulation.
The paper is well-organized and generally clear, but minor grammatical and phrasing issues detract from its readability. These should be addressed in a revision. The authors' response to feedback was constructive, but baseline comparisons and connections to lifting constructions remain unaddressed.
Strengths:
1. Novel algorithm design with strong theoretical guarantees.
2. Empirical evidence supports the practical advantages of the proposed methods.
3. Addresses an underexplored but important problem in decentralized computation.
Weaknesses:
1. Insufficient connection to prior work and related literature.
2. Lack of clarity in the induced edge distribution and assumptions in the problem statement.
3. Missing comparisons with alternative approaches, such as flooding-based methods.
4. Minor grammatical and phrasing issues.
Recommendation:
The paper is a valuable extension of gossip algorithms and has the potential to impact decentralized computation significantly. However, it requires revisions to strengthen its connections to prior work, clarify assumptions, and provide additional comparisons. I recommend acceptance after major revisions.
