This paper proposes a novel approach to deep structured output learning by integrating CNN-based message estimators into the message-passing inference process for Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The authors aim to bypass the computationally expensive step of learning potential functions, instead directly optimizing the inference procedure to estimate variable marginals. The method is applied to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, achieving competitive results with a single message-passing iteration. The paper highlights the scalability of the proposed approach, as the network output dimension remains proportional to the number of classes, unlike conventional CRF methods where complexity grows exponentially with the order of potentials.
Strengths:  
The paper introduces an innovative idea of directly learning factor-to-variable message estimators using CNNs, which is a significant departure from traditional CRF learning methods. This approach eliminates the need for repeated inference during training, leading to computational efficiency. The empirical results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark are impressive, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in semantic segmentation tasks. The scalability of the proposed framework, particularly in scenarios with a large number of classes, is another notable advantage. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the competitiveness of their approach.
Weaknesses:  
The framing of the work is somewhat misleading. While the paper claims to perform "structured CRF prediction," the method focuses on pixel-wise labeling rather than modeling a joint distribution over labels, which is central to structured prediction. The cost function maximizes independent pixel-wise predictions (IoU score) rather than joint label plausibility, further distancing the work from traditional CRF objectives. The claim of incorporating inference iterations into learning is overstated, as only a single iteration is implemented. Furthermore, the manuscript suffers from several typographical and grammatical errors, such as "massage" instead of "message" (line 54) and misspellings like "potenials," "sematic," and "convlutional," which detract from the paper's clarity.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Innovative heuristic for neural network output layers.  
- Demonstrates strong empirical performance on a standard benchmark.  
- Computationally efficient and scalable for large-class problems.  
Con:  
- Misleading framing as structured prediction.  
- Lack of theoretical justification for claims about inference iterations.  
- Typographical and grammatical issues reduce clarity.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper presents an effective heuristic for pixel-wise labeling and achieves strong empirical results, its framing as a structured prediction method is misleading, and some claims are unsubstantiated. The work would benefit from a clearer and more accurate presentation of its contributions. I recommend acceptance only if the authors address the framing issues and improve the manuscript's clarity.
