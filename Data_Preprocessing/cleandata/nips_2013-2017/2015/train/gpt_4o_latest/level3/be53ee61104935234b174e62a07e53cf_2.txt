This paper presents significant advancements in algorithms for isotonic regression under various norms, achieving notable reductions in computational complexity. The authors propose a unified optimization framework for weighted `p-norms and introduce efficient algorithms for `∞-norms and strict isotonic regression, demonstrating improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods. The paper also highlights practical implementations and experimental results, showcasing the scalability and efficiency of the proposed methods.
Strengths:
1. Quality: The paper is technically sound and provides rigorous performance guarantees for the proposed algorithms. The theoretical contributions are well-supported by detailed proofs and experimental validation. The use of approximate solvers to accelerate isotonic regression is a novel and impactful approach.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, related work, and contributions. The inclusion of experimental results and practical considerations enhances the clarity and relevance of the work. However, some sections, particularly those involving technical details of the algorithms, could benefit from additional simplification for broader accessibility.
3. Originality: The work introduces novel algorithmic techniques, such as leveraging approximate solvers within an interior point method framework, and extends these methods to new settings, including strict isotonic regression. The reduction of `∞-norm isotonic regression to Lipschitz learning on DAGs is particularly innovative.
4. Significance: The results are highly significant, offering faster algorithms for isotonic regression across various norms, with potential applications in machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. The improvements in computational complexity, particularly for large-scale problems, are likely to influence future research and practical implementations.
Weaknesses:
1. Convergence Concerns: A key concern is the impact of the delta factor in the approximate solution on convergence for typical values of \( n \). While the theoretical guarantees are robust, further discussion or empirical analysis of this aspect would strengthen the paper.
2. Typographical Issue: There appears to be a possible typo in the inequality \( n \geq m-1 \), which might need to be \( n \leq m-1 \). This should be clarified to avoid confusion.
3. Accessibility: While the paper is thorough, the dense technical details may pose challenges for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. Simplifying or summarizing key steps could improve accessibility.
