This paper addresses the critical problem of influence maximization in diffusion networks, particularly focusing on the transition phenomena in information cascades. Building on prior work that identified the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix as a key determinant of influence, the authors introduce the Laplace Hazard matrix to extend these insights to anytime influence bounds. They define sub-critical and super-critical contagion states and provide a lower bound for the critical time at which contagion transitions to a super-critical phase. The theoretical contributions are validated through numerical experiments on synthetic datasets and applied to various contagion models, including epidemiological and viral marketing scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor: The paper is technically sound, with comprehensive proofs and detailed derivations of bounds. The introduction of the Laplace Hazard matrix and its spectral radius as a governing factor for contagion dynamics is a significant theoretical advancement.
2. Novel Insights: The characterization of critical times and the differentiation between sub-critical and super-critical contagion states provide valuable tools for understanding and controlling diffusion processes. These insights have practical implications for decision-making in fields like epidemiology and marketing.
3. Validation: The experimental results align well with the theoretical predictions, demonstrating the tightness of the proposed bounds across different network types and scenarios. The inclusion of diverse contagion models (e.g., SI, SIR) further underscores the generality of the approach.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a logical flow from theoretical development to experimental validation. The supplementary material for proofs is a helpful addition.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: While the extension to anytime influence bounds is valuable, the paper heavily builds on prior work, particularly the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix. The novelty may be perceived as incremental rather than groundbreaking.
2. Dataset Limitations: The experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets and specific network types. The lack of evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets limits the practical applicability and generalizability of the results.
3. Scalability: While the theoretical framework is robust, the computational feasibility of applying these bounds to large, real-world networks is not discussed in detail.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a solid theoretical contribution to the field of influence maximization, with clear implications for both research and practice.
- The introduction of critical times and anytime influence bounds is a novel and useful extension of prior work.
- The experimental validation supports the theoretical claims, demonstrating the utility of the proposed approach.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The incremental nature of the contribution may not justify acceptance in a highly competitive venue like NeurIPS.
- The lack of real-world dataset evaluation raises concerns about the practical relevance of the findings.
- The scalability of the proposed methods to large networks remains unclear.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the study of information cascades and influence maximization. While the novelty is somewhat limited, the theoretical rigor and practical implications make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the scalability and real-world applicability concerns in a future revision.
