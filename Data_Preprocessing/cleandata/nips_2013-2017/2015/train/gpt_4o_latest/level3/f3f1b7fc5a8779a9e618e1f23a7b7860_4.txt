The paper addresses the problem of high-dimensional structured regression under subexponential noise and design matrices, focusing on estimating parameters close to the true values. While previous work has largely focused on subgaussian settings, this paper extends the analysis to subexponential distributions, which are more general and include heavier-tailed distributions. The main contribution lies in showing that the sample complexity and estimation error depend on the exponential width of certain sets, which is at most a factor of \( \sqrt{\log p} \) worse than the Gaussian width. This relationship is derived using generic chaining arguments. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that for specific estimators like Lasso and group Lasso, the sample complexity matches that of the subgaussian case, leveraging VC-dimension-based analysis.
Strengths:
1. Novelty in Scope: The paper is among the first to analyze norm-regularized regression under subexponential settings, addressing a gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths is rigorously established, providing a foundation for extending existing subgaussian results to subexponential cases.
3. Practical Relevance: The work is motivated by real-world applications (e.g., climate science, finance) where subexponential distributions naturally arise.
4. Experimental Validation: Simulations comparing Gaussian and subexponential settings support the theoretical findings, particularly regarding sample complexity and error decay.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Technical Novelty: The main result (Theorem 1) is a straightforward application of Talagrand's generic chaining framework, offering limited innovation in methodology.
2. Motivational Gap: The introduction lacks concrete examples where subexponential design matrices are indispensable and subgaussian assumptions fail.
3. Clarity Issues: Key definitions, such as the error set \( A \), and parameters like \( \lambda_n \), are introduced late or insufficiently explained, making the paper harder to follow.
4. Incorrect Claims: Some statements regarding subexponential and subgaussian properties (e.g., moments and bounds in equations (4) and (5)) are flagged as misleading or incorrect.
5. Writing and Notation: Minor issues, such as inconsistent notation (e.g., \( K \) in Equation (16)) and redundant phrasing, detract from the paper's readability.
6. Supplementary File Errors: Similar inaccuracies in claims about bounds and applicability of results to subexponential processes are noted in the supplementary material.
Pro and Con Arguments:
- Pro: The paper addresses a relevant and underexplored problem, with theoretical results that generalize existing frameworks to subexponential settings. The experimental results align with theoretical predictions.
- Con: The technical contribution is incremental, and the paper suffers from clarity and correctness issues. The lack of strong motivation for subexponential settings weakens its impact.
Recommendation: While the paper provides a useful extension of existing results, its limited novelty, unclear exposition, and technical inaccuracies make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. A major revision addressing these issues, particularly the motivational gap and clarity, would significantly improve its quality.
