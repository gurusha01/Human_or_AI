The paper introduces novel synchronous and asynchronous Gossip algorithms, termed GoSta, for computing U-statistics in decentralized networks. U-statistics, which involve averaging over pairs of observations, are critical for describing global statistical properties such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and within-cluster point scatter. The authors address the limitations of the existing U2-Gossip algorithm, which suffers from higher memory and communication costs and lacks support for asynchronous settings. The proposed algorithms achieve faster convergence rates of \(O(1/t)\) for the synchronous case and \(O(\log t/t)\) for the asynchronous case, with explicit data- and network-dependent terms. The paper is well-positioned within the existing literature on Gossip algorithms, referencing foundational works and highlighting the gap in decentralized U-statistics computation.
Strengths:  
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical guarantees for convergence rates. The use of "phantom nodes" to model data propagation and averaging steps is particularly innovative and provides a clear analytical framework.  
2. Novelty: The algorithms are novel and represent a significant improvement over U2-Gossip in terms of convergence speed, memory efficiency, and communication cost. The asynchronous version is especially valuable for real-world decentralized systems where global synchronization is impractical.  
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on real datasets (e.g., AUC and within-cluster point scatter) demonstrate the practical superiority of GoSta over U2-Gossip across various network topologies, including complete graphs, 2D grids, and Watts-Strogatz networks. The results align well with the theoretical analysis, and the performance gap widens with increasing network size.  
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear problem motivation, detailed algorithm descriptions, and comprehensive experimental results. The supplementary material further strengthens the theoretical and empirical contributions.
Weaknesses:  
1. Scalability Analysis: While the paper demonstrates improved performance for larger networks, a more detailed discussion of scalability to extremely large networks (e.g., millions of nodes) would be valuable.  
2. Practical Considerations: The paper assumes that nodes know their degree and the total number of edges in the network, which may not always be feasible in highly dynamic or partially connected networks.  
3. Comparison to Other Baselines: Although the paper compares GoSta to U2-Gossip, additional comparisons to other decentralized algorithms for related tasks (e.g., decentralized optimization or consensus algorithms) would provide a broader context for its contributions.
