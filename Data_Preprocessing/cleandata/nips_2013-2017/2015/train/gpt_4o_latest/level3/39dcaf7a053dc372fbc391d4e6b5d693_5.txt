This paper presents a novel architecture for detecting neuronal boundaries in 3D electron microscopy (EM) scans, a critical task for advancing automation in connectomics. The authors propose a hybrid 2D-3D convolutional network (ConvNet) architecture combined with a recursive training framework, which significantly improves boundary detection accuracy. The key innovations include the integration of 2D and 3D filters to leverage anisotropic image properties, the use of a deeper network structure, and a recursive training approach where preliminary boundary maps are refined in subsequent stages. The authors also introduce ZNN, a multicore CPU-based implementation optimized for 3D ConvNets, which facilitates efficient training of their models. The proposed methods are validated on a new dataset of mouse piriform cortex images, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a strong motivation for the problem and a thorough explanation of the proposed methods. The authors provide sufficient technical details, including architectural design, training procedures, and evaluation metrics, enabling reproducibility for expert readers. The results are compelling, with quantitative improvements in pixel classification error and Rand F-scores, as well as qualitative visualizations that highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. The recursive framework, inspired by biological principles, is particularly intriguing and adds a novel perspective to the field.
In terms of originality, the hybrid use of 2D and 3D filters tailored to anisotropic 3D data and the recursive training paradigm represent significant contributions. While recursive approaches have been explored in other contexts, their application to ConvNets for boundary detection is novel. The paper also situates its contributions within the broader literature, referencing prior work on ConvNets, recursive frameworks, and connectomics.
The significance of this work lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in neuronal boundary detection, a challenging and impactful problem. The hybrid architecture and recursive training framework could inspire further research in related domains, such as video processing or other anisotropic 3D imaging tasks. Additionally, the release of the annotated dataset and the ZNN implementation enhances the paper's utility to the community.
However, as the topic is outside my primary area of expertise, I recommend relying on other reviewers for a more in-depth technical evaluation, particularly regarding the novelty and rigor of the proposed methods. While the paper appears technically sound, a domain expert's perspective would ensure a more comprehensive assessment.
