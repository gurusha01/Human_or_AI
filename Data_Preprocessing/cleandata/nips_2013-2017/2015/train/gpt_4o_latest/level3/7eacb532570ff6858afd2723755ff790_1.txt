This paper addresses the problem of online rank elicitation under the Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution, focusing on identifying the most probable ranking or top-ranked item using active pairwise comparisons. The authors propose budgeted QuickSort-based algorithms with query complexity bounds for both ranking and top-item identification. The key contribution lies in leveraging the pairwise marginals of the PL model, which correspond to a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) distribution, to construct a surrogate ranking distribution that preserves these marginals. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for approximate recovery and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods through experiments.
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis and experiments. The distinction between exact recovery (bound in [25]) and approximate recovery (bound in this paper) is clearly articulated.
2. Novelty: The use of a budgeted QuickSort algorithm to construct a surrogate ranking distribution is innovative. The approach effectively exploits the transitivity properties of the PL model, advancing the state of the art in online rank elicitation.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed top-item identification algorithm outperforms recent methods, such as INTERLEAVED FILTER and BEAT THE MEAN, in terms of sample complexity. This highlights the practical utility of the approach.
4. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-written and organized, making the theoretical contributions and experimental results accessible to the reader.
Weaknesses
1. Underperformance in Full Ranking: The full-ranking algorithm underperforms compared to passive uniform sampling, which raises questions about its practical applicability in certain scenarios.
2. Limited Experimental Scope: While the experiments validate the theoretical claims, the lack of a direct comparison with RankCentrality in terms of \(\epsilon\)-optimal ranking recovery and sample complexity is a missed opportunity. Adding such an experiment in Section 9.2 would strengthen the empirical analysis.
3. Notational and Typographical Issues: There are minor issues that need correction:
   - In Section 9.1, replace "c or m [= --> \in] {range}" for clarity.
   - On page 7, last line, "horizontal" should be corrected to "vertical."
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Experimental Comparison: Include an experiment in Section 9.2 comparing the proposed ranking algorithm with RankCentrality, particularly focusing on \(\epsilon\)-optimal ranking recovery and sample complexity.
2. Broader Evaluation: Extend the experimental analysis to real-world datasets to assess the robustness of the proposed methods under less idealized conditions.
3. Clarity in Presentation: Fix the noted typographical and notational errors to improve the overall clarity and professionalism of the manuscript.
Recommendation
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online rank elicitation by proposing efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. Despite some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper is of high quality. I recommend acceptance after minor revisions to address the notational and experimental issues.
