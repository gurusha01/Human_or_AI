The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of decentralized estimation by introducing novel synchronous and asynchronous gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics, a class of statistics that depend on pairs of observations. The authors establish convergence rates of \( O(1/t) \) for the synchronous algorithm and \( O(\log t / t) \) for the asynchronous version, with explicit dependence on data and network properties. This work builds upon prior research on gossip algorithms for decentralized averaging but extends it to the more complex problem of U-statistics, which has received limited attention in the literature. The authors also demonstrate the superiority of their methods over the existing U2-gossip algorithm in terms of convergence speed, memory, and communication efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Quality: The paper is technically robust, with well-supported theoretical analysis and convergence proofs. The use of "phantom nodes" for reformulating the problem is particularly innovative, enabling a clear separation of data propagation and averaging steps.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem definition to algorithm design, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The inclusion of detailed pseudocode and supplementary material enhances reproducibility.
3. Originality: The proposed algorithms are novel and address a gap in the literature by efficiently computing U-statistics in decentralized settings. The work is a clear advancement over U2-gossip, with improvements in both theoretical guarantees and practical performance.
4. Significance: The results are highly relevant to researchers working on decentralized systems, particularly in applications such as sensor networks, social media analysis, and distributed machine learning. The demonstrated performance advantages and reduced resource requirements make the algorithms practical for real-world use.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Scope: While the experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods, they are limited to two applications (AUC and within-cluster point scatter) and three types of networks. Additional experiments on larger and more diverse networks, as well as other U-statistics, would strengthen the empirical validation.
2. Asynchronous Algorithm Analysis: Although the asynchronous algorithm shows promising practical performance, its theoretical analysis is less detailed compared to the synchronous case. Further exploration of the constants in the convergence rate and their dependence on network properties would be valuable.
3. Comparison to Broader Baselines: The paper focuses on comparisons with U2-gossip but does not benchmark against other decentralized estimation methods or adaptive communication schemes, which could provide additional context for the results.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper. Its contributions are both theoretically rigorous and practically impactful, advancing the state of the art in decentralized computation of U-statistics. The strengths far outweigh the weaknesses, which are relatively minor and do not detract from the overall quality of the work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and technically sound algorithms with clear theoretical guarantees.
- Significant improvement over existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy.
- Well-organized and clearly written, with sufficient detail for reproducibility.
- High relevance and potential impact on decentralized systems research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental scope and lack of broader baseline comparisons.
- Less detailed theoretical analysis for the asynchronous algorithm.
Overall, the paper makes a strong scientific contribution and is well-suited for presentation at the conference.
