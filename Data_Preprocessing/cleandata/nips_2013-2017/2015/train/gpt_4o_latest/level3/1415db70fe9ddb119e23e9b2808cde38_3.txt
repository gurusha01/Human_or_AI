This paper presents a novel sparse Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm tailored for high-dimensional latent variable models, addressing challenges in parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The authors introduce a truncation step in the EM procedure to enforce sparsity, which enables geometric convergence to a near-optimal estimator with a statistical error rate dependent on the sparsity level and the infinity norm of the M-step error. Furthermore, they propose a decorrelated score statistic for hypothesis testing, which achieves asymptotic normality and attains the semiparametric information bound for low-dimensional components of high-dimensional parameters.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for the sparse EM algorithm, including convergence guarantees and statistical error bounds. The results are significant for high-dimensional learning, where traditional EM algorithms lack theoretical guarantees.
2. Novelty: The introduction of a truncation step within the EM framework is innovative, as it directly incorporates sparsity into the iterative process. This distinguishes the method from existing approaches that apply sparsity constraints post hoc.
3. Inferential Procedure: The decorrelated score statistic is a valuable addition, enabling hypothesis testing in high-dimensional settings. Its asymptotic normality and optimality are well-supported by theoretical analysis.
4. Generality: The framework is broadly applicable to various high-dimensional latent variable models, including Gaussian mixtures and regression mixtures, demonstrating its versatility.
5. Comparison with Related Work: The paper situates its contributions well within the existing literature, particularly highlighting improvements over low-dimensional EM results and tensor-based methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Necessity of Sparse EM: The necessity of incorporating truncation at every iteration is not convincingly established. The authors acknowledge that similar guarantees might be achievable with ordinary EM followed by a single truncation step, raising questions about the practical advantages of their approach.
2. Initialization Details: The experimental section lacks clarity on the initialization method used for the sparse EM algorithm, which is critical for achieving the stated convergence guarantees.
3. Experimental Validation: While the theoretical results are robust, the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive. For instance, comparisons with ordinary EM and other sparse optimization methods, such as "Sparse online learning via truncated gradient" (Langford et al., 2009), would strengthen the empirical claims.
4. Practical Impact: The computational overhead introduced by the truncation step in each iteration is not thoroughly analyzed. This could limit the method's scalability to extremely high-dimensional problems.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes significant theoretical advancements in high-dimensional EM algorithms, addressing a critical gap in the literature.
- The proposed decorrelated score statistic is a meaningful contribution to high-dimensional inference.
- The work is well-positioned within the broader context of sparse optimization and latent variable models.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The necessity of the iterative truncation step is not convincingly justified, and its practical benefits remain unclear.
- The experimental section is underdeveloped, particularly in terms of initialization details and comparative analysis.
- The computational feasibility of the approach for very high-dimensional problems is not adequately addressed.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in its theoretical contributions, the practical aspects and experimental validation require further refinement. I recommend acceptance conditional on addressing the concerns regarding initialization, experimental comparisons, and computational overhead.
