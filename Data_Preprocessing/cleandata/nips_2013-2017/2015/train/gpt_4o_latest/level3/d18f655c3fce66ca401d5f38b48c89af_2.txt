The paper introduces Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD), a novel family of training algorithms for deep learning that addresses the challenge of training large-scale models under communication constraints. By framing the problem as a global variable consensus problem, EASGD allows local workers to explore parameter space more freely while maintaining coordination with a central variable managed by a parameter server. The proposed family includes synchronous, asynchronous, and momentum-based variants, all of which are supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.
The paper is technically sound and well-supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence. The authors provide a stability analysis of EASGD, demonstrating its superior stability compared to ADMM under the round-robin scheme. The stability condition for EASGD is simple and intuitive, and the illustrative example effectively highlights its advantages. The experimental results are compelling, showing that EASGD outperforms state-of-the-art SGD algorithms, particularly in settings with larger communication periods and more workers. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the critical bottleneck of communication overhead in distributed deep learning.
The writing is clear and well-organized, with a logical progression from problem formulation to algorithm design, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. However, the main theoretical content is relegated to the supplementary material, which may hinder accessibility for some readers. Including a concise summary of key theoretical results in the main text would improve clarity.
The originality of the work is notable. While it builds on existing methods like SGD and ADMM, the introduction of an elastic force mechanism and the focus on exploration-exploitation trade-offs are novel contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, situating the paper within the broader context of distributed optimization and deep learning.
The significance of the results is high. The proposed algorithms are not only theoretically robust but also practically impactful, as demonstrated by their successful application to real-world GPU clusters and benchmark datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet. The ability to improve baseline models while reducing communication overhead has practical implications for large-scale machine learning systems.
