The paper introduces Variational Consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a novel method for scalable Bayesian inference in low-communication parallel MCMC settings. By framing the aggregation of subposterior samples as a variational inference problem, VCMC optimizes over a family of aggregation functions to better approximate the full posterior distribution. This approach generalizes the existing Consensus Monte Carlo (CMC) method, offering greater flexibility and enabling the aggregation of structured mathematical objects such as positive semidefinite matrices and mixture model parameters. The authors also derive theoretical results, including blockwise concavity of the relaxed variational objective, and demonstrate the method's advantages through empirical evaluations on three inference tasks.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Generalization: VCMC extends the CMC framework by introducing a variational perspective, which allows for adaptive and nonlinear aggregation functions. This generalization is particularly valuable for handling structured parameters, broadening the applicability of data-parallel MCMC methods.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation, including conditions for blockwise concavity and a relaxed entropy approximation, which are significant contributions to the variational inference literature.
3. Empirical Performance: The experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in posterior approximation quality compared to CMC, particularly in high-dimensional and structured parameter settings. For example, VCMC achieves up to a 92% error reduction in estimating cluster co-membership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model.
4. Scalability: The method achieves near-ideal speedups in some cases, demonstrating its potential for efficient use in distributed computing environments.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Experimental Scope: While the paper demonstrates the accuracy of VCMC, it lacks extensive comparisons of runtime and speed benefits against other low-communication and communication-based MCMC methods. This omission makes it difficult to fully assess the method's computational efficiency.
2. No Comparison with Variational Inference: Given the rise of scalable variational inference techniques, it is surprising that the paper does not compare VCMC to serial or parallel variational inference methods. Such a comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses.
3. Correctness of Aggregated Samples: VCMC does not guarantee the correctness of aggregated samples, a limitation shared with variational methods. While the authors acknowledge this, a deeper discussion of its implications would strengthen the paper.
4. Theoretical Results Underexplored: The significance of theoretical results, such as blockwise concavity, is not sufficiently discussed in the context of existing variational inference literature. This limits the reader's ability to appreciate their broader impact.
Recommendation:
The paper makes meaningful progress in scalable Bayesian inference and introduces a flexible framework that could inspire future research. However, the lack of thorough empirical comparisons and limited discussion of theoretical contributions weaken its overall impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the authors addressing the experimental gaps and providing additional context for their theoretical findings.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and flexible approach to parallel MCMC.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating superior posterior approximation.
- Rigorous theoretical contributions.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Insufficient empirical evaluation of runtime and scalability.
- Lack of comparison with variational inference methods.
- Limited discussion of theoretical results' significance.
