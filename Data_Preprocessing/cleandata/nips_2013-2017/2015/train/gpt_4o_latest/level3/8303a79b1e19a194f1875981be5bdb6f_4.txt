The paper introduces a novel modification to the leapfrog integrator for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), called Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), to address the challenges of sampling from piecewise continuous probability distributions with affine discontinuity boundaries. The proposed method incorporates reflection and refraction of trajectories at boundaries, inspired by physical systems like optics. This approach generalizes prior work by Pakman and Paninski, which was limited to piecewise Gaussian distributions, to arbitrary piecewise continuous distributions. The authors prove that RHMC preserves the correct stationary distribution and demonstrate its advantages over baseline HMC in terms of reduced rejection rates, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Novelty: The paper extends the applicability of HMC to a broader class of piecewise continuous distributions, addressing a significant limitation of traditional HMC. The use of reflection and refraction dynamics is an elegant and intuitive adaptation inspired by physical systems.
2. Technical Soundness: The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis, including proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance, ensuring that RHMC maintains the correct stationary distribution.
3. Significance: The proposed method has clear potential for applications in Bayesian inference and other areas involving piecewise continuous models, where traditional HMC struggles.
4. Clarity of Motivation: The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing methods and positions RHMC as a meaningful improvement.
5. Experimental Validation: The experiments demonstrate the practical benefits of RHMC, particularly in high-dimensional settings, where it outperforms baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Numerical Evaluation: While the experiments are promising, they are restricted to a single synthetic example. Expanding the evaluation to more diverse and real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper's claims.
2. Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity of RHMC to tuning parameters (e.g., step size \( \epsilon \) and number of leapfrog steps \( L \)) is not thoroughly explored. Additional numerical results on this aspect would be valuable.
3. Clarity Issues: Certain explanations, such as the refracted momentum update and the handling of matrix zero elements, lack clarity and could benefit from further elaboration.
4. Typos and Errors: The manuscript contains several minor errors, such as missing normalization constants and unclear matrix element descriptions, which should be corrected for better readability.
5. Scalability to Non-Affine Boundaries: While the authors briefly discuss the challenges of extending RHMC to non-affine boundaries, this limitation is not explored in depth.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of probabilistic inference by addressing a challenging problem with an innovative and theoretically sound approach. However, the limited scope of numerical evaluation and the lack of sensitivity analysis slightly detract from its overall impact. Post-rebuttal updates addressing some of these concerns are appreciated but do not fully resolve them. I recommend acceptance with a score of 7 (Good paper, accept), contingent on addressing the noted weaknesses in a future revision.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and theoretically sound extension of HMC to piecewise continuous distributions.
- Demonstrated efficiency gains in high-dimensional settings.
- Potential for significant impact in Bayesian inference and related fields.
Arguments against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental scope and lack of sensitivity analysis.
- Minor clarity and presentation issues that could hinder understanding.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the conference and merits inclusion.
