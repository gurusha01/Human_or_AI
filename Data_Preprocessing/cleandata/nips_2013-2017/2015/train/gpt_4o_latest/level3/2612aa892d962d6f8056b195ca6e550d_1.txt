This paper presents a novel method for training recurrent neural networks as near-optimal feedback controllers, enabling robust and realistic behaviors for a variety of dynamical systems and tasks. The approach combines supervised learning with trajectory optimization, specifically Contact-Invariant Optimization (CIO), to train neural networks that can generate stable, real-time control policies for diverse robotic morphologies and tasks. Key innovations include embedding feedback gains into neural network policies for robustness, softly coupling trajectory and policy optimization via a cost penalty for deviation, and employing noise injection during training to improve generalization and stability. The method is demonstrated on a range of robots, including swimming, flying, bipedal, and quadrupedal systems, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.

1. Technical Excellence: The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results. The integration of trajectory optimization and neural network training is particularly compelling, addressing challenges in high-dimensional, continuous control tasks.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and organized, providing sufficient detail for reproduction of results. The inclusion of algorithmic steps, parameter settings, and ablation studies enhances transparency.
3. Originality: The proposed method is a novel combination of trajectory optimization and neural network regression, with innovations such as embedding feedback gains and noise injection. The work significantly extends prior research by achieving stable 3D locomotion, a challenging domain where previous methods were limited to 2D.
4. Significance: The results are impactful, demonstrating robust and realistic control across diverse morphologies and tasks. The method's potential applications in robotics, animation, and biomechanics make it highly relevant to the field. The use of a unified framework for different behaviors and morphologies is particularly noteworthy.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparative Evaluation: While the paper compares its method to static training and ablated versions, it lacks a direct comparison to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning or model-predictive control (MPC) methods in terms of computational efficiency and performance.
2. Scalability: The reliance on cloud computing and GPU resources raises questions about the scalability of the approach for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of limitations, such as the potential challenges in transferring the method to physical robots or handling highly dynamic environments.
