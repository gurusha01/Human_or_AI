The paper presents a novel 2D-3D convolutional network for neuronal boundary detection in 3D electron microscopy (EM) brain images, addressing the challenges posed by the anisotropic nature of serial section EM datasets. The proposed method combines 2D and 3D convolutional filters to leverage both high-resolution 2D information and 3D spatial context. A recursive training schema is introduced, where a preliminary boundary map generated by a 2D network (VD2D) is used as input to a deeper 2D-3D network (VD2D3D), enabling iterative refinement of boundary predictions. The authors employ ZNN, a CPU-based deep learning framework optimized for 3D convolutional networks, to achieve efficient training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline models (N4 and VD2D) in terms of pixel-wise classification error and Rand F-scores, with potential applications to other sequential data like video frames.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The hybrid use of 2D and 3D filters is well-suited for the anisotropic nature of serial section EM images, and the recursive training framework introduces a biologically inspired mechanism for iterative refinement. These innovations represent a meaningful contribution to the field of connectomics and image segmentation.
2. Efficiency: The use of ZNN for dense output and efficient training of 3D convolutional networks is a notable technical achievement, particularly for large-scale 3D datasets.
3. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and provides sufficient detail about the network architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics, making it accessible to readers familiar with deep learning and image processing.
4. Potential Impact: The method's applicability to other types of anisotropic 3D data, such as video, broadens its significance beyond the immediate domain of neuronal boundary detection.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Evaluation: While the proposed method shows improvements over baseline models, the experimental evaluation is limited. The paper does not compare its approach to state-of-the-art boundary detection methods, making it difficult to assess the true advancement over existing techniques.
2. Dataset Scope: The evaluation is restricted to a single dataset (mouse piriform cortex), which raises concerns about the generalizability of the results to other datasets or imaging modalities.
3. Ablation Studies: The paper lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components, such as the recursive framework or the hybrid 2D-3D architecture.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach with potential for significant impact in connectomics and beyond.
- The recursive framework and hybrid 2D-3D architecture are innovative and well-motivated by biological insights.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and insufficient experimental evaluation limit the ability to judge the method's effectiveness.
- The generalizability of the approach remains unclear due to the limited dataset and absence of cross-dataset validation.
Conclusion: The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and demonstrates technical novelty, but its experimental evaluation needs to be strengthened to fully establish the effectiveness of the proposed method. I recommend acceptance with the condition that the authors address the evaluation gaps in future revisions.
