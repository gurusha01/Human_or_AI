Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the important problem of time-sensitive recommendation by proposing a novel framework that combines low-rank structure in user-item matrices with self-exciting Hawkes processes. The authors aim to solve two key tasks: recommending the most relevant item at the right time and predicting the next returning time of a user. The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a convex formulation of the problem and developing an efficient optimization algorithm that blends proximal gradient and conditional gradient methods. The algorithm achieves an optimal \(O(1/t)\) convergence rate and scales well to large datasets, demonstrating superior predictive performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novel Algorithm: The proposed combination of low-rank models and Hawkes processes is innovative and addresses a relatively underexplored area in recommender systems. The convex formulation and the efficient optimization algorithm are well-motivated and technically sound.
2. Distributed Solution: The algorithm's scalability to millions of user-item pairs and hundreds of millions of temporal events is impressive, making it practical for real-world applications.
3. Principled Approach: The use of stochastic processes to model temporal observations is rigorous and aligns well with the problem's requirements. The theoretical grounding is robust, with convergence guarantees provided.
4. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow the technical details and experimental results.
5. Significance: Time-sensitive recommendation is a meaningful and impactful problem, and the proposed method advances the state of the art in this domain. The ability to incorporate additional contextual information further enhances its applicability.
Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical Concerns: There is ambiguity in Equation (8) regarding the parameter for maximization and the potential unboundedness of \(\rho^*\). Additionally, while Theorem 2 provides convergence guarantees, it is not utilized in the experiments, reducing its practical significance.
2. Baseline Comparison: The experimental evaluation could be strengthened by including SVD++, a well-known time-sensitive recommendation algorithm, as a baseline. This would provide a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods.
3. Generality of Results: While the algorithm performs well on synthetic and specific real-world datasets, the generalizability to other domains with different temporal dynamics is not fully explored.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and principled approach to time-sensitive recommendation, which has significant implications for both research and practice.
- The proposed algorithm is scalable, efficient, and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- The writing is clear, and the methodology is well-grounded in theory.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Theoretical concerns about Equation (8) and the limited use of Theorem 2 in experiments weaken the paper's rigor.
- The absence of SVD++ as a baseline limits the comprehensiveness of the experimental evaluation.
- The generalizability of the approach to other datasets and domains is not fully addressed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of time-sensitive recommendation. While there are some theoretical and experimental limitations, the novelty, scalability, and practical significance of the proposed method outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the theoretical ambiguity and improve the experimental evaluation by including additional baselines.
