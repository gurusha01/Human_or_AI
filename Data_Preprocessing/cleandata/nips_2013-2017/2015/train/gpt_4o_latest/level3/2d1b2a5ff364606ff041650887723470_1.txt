This paper addresses the problem of estimating structured signals from nonlinear measurements using the Generalized LASSO framework. The authors extend classical results by Brillinger and more recent work by Plan and Vershynin to provide asymptotically precise characterizations of the estimation error when the measurement matrix is Gaussian and the link function is nonlinear. The key contribution is the derivation of explicit error expressions that demonstrate equivalence between the performance of the Generalized LASSO under nonlinear measurements and its performance under appropriately scaled noisy linear measurements. These results are novel and provide significant insights into the behavior of the Generalized LASSO in high-dimensional settings.
The paper is technically sound and makes a strong theoretical contribution. The derivation of asymptotic guarantees is rigorous, and the results are validated through numerical experiments. The authors also provide insightful applications, such as optimizing quantization thresholds for compressive sensing, which could have practical implications. However, the reviewer acknowledges a limited familiarity with the single-index model and sufficient dimension reduction literature, which may affect their ability to fully assess the novelty of the work in the broader context of prior research.
The paper is well-written and logically organized, making it accessible to readers with a strong mathematical background. However, there are several typos, particularly in the proof sections, which could hinder clarity. The authors are encouraged to carefully proofread the manuscript to ensure precision in the presentation of their results.
In terms of originality, the paper stands out by providing the first-known precise error predictions for the Generalized LASSO under nonlinear measurements. The extension of prior results to include regularized settings and the derivation of exact error expressions represent a significant advancement. The paper also adequately references related work, situating its contributions within the existing literature.
The significance of the results is high. The precise characterization of the Generalized LASSO's performance under nonlinear measurements is likely to influence future research and applications in high-dimensional signal recovery. The insights into the role of the link function and regularization parameters are particularly valuable for practitioners and researchers working on structured signal estimation.
Strengths:
1. Rigorous theoretical analysis with asymptotically precise results.
2. Novel contributions extending classical and recent results.
3. Practical implications, such as optimizing quantization thresholds.
4. Clear organization and logical flow.
Weaknesses:
1. Several typos in the proof sections.
2. Limited discussion of connections to the single-index model literature.
3. The results may be less accessible to readers without a strong mathematical background.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and provides novel insights into the Generalized LASSO under nonlinear measurements. While the reviewer's familiarity with related literature is limited, the results appear to be both original and significant. The authors should address the identified typos and consider expanding the discussion of prior work to strengthen the paper further. Overall, the paper is a valuable addition to the field and is recommended for acceptance.
