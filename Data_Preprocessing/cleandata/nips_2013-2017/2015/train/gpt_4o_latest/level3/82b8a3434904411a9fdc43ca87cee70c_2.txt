The paper introduces a novel framework for computing lower bounds on cross-validation (CV) errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which the authors term the "regularization path of CV error lower bounds." The framework aims to provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of selected regularization parameters, addressing the practical challenge of determining how many grid points are necessary for tuning. The approach leverages safe screening ideas to derive CV error bounds and proposes algorithms for two key tasks: computing the approximation level of a given set of solutions and identifying an ε-approximate regularization parameter. The authors validate their framework through experiments on benchmark datasets, comparing it with grid search and Bayesian optimization.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The proposed framework is grounded in well-established safe screening ideas, and the derivation of CV error bounds appears rigorous. The theoretical contributions are clearly articulated, particularly in the development of validation error bounds as a function of the regularization parameter.
2. Practical Relevance: The framework addresses a significant challenge in hyperparameter tuning by offering a theoretically guaranteed approximation of CV error, which could be valuable for practitioners seeking efficient and reliable regularization parameter selection.
3. Flexibility: The framework is adaptable to various regularization parameter tuning methods (e.g., grid search, Bayesian optimization) and can work with approximate solutions, which reduces computational costs.
Weaknesses:
1. Incremental Novelty: While the framework is technically sound, its novelty is limited. The motivating question of how many grid points are needed in CV has been extensively studied, and the proposed approach builds incrementally on existing safe screening and approximate regularization path methods.
2. Clarity Issues: The manuscript could benefit from clearer explanations of key concepts, particularly in the main text. For instance, the connection between the proposed bounds and safe screening ideas is relegated to the appendix, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with this background.
3. Experimental Setup: The experimental evaluation lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding the setup for approximating the regularization parameter. The results are also underwhelming, with only slight improvements over grid search and Bayesian optimization, raising questions about the practical impact of the framework.
4. Significance: The framework's applicability is limited to specific problem setups (e.g., linear binary classification with convex loss functions). Additionally, the computational costs for achieving high approximation quality (e.g., ε = 0) remain prohibitive, which diminishes its significance for large-scale problems.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a technically sound framework, its incremental novelty, limited experimental impact, and scope of applicability make it less compelling as a significant contribution to the field. The authors should focus on improving the clarity of the manuscript, providing more detailed experimental setups, and demonstrating stronger empirical results to justify the framework's practical utility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Rigorous theoretical foundation.
- Addresses a practical problem in hyperparameter tuning.
- Flexible and computationally efficient for approximate solutions.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Incremental contribution with limited novelty.
- Insufficient experimental detail and underwhelming results.
- Limited scope and high computational costs for exact solutions.
Overall Rating: Weak Reject.
