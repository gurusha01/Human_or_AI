This paper introduces a novel graph property, hierarchy width, and demonstrates its utility in analyzing the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on discrete factor graphs. The authors establish that bounded hierarchy width, combined with bounded factor weights, ensures polynomial mixing time. They further extend this insight to hierarchical factor graph templates, a class of models frequently used in real-world applications, and provide theoretical guarantees for rapid mixing under logical or ratio semantics. The paper also includes experimental validation, showing that hierarchy width correlates with mixing time and that hierarchical templates achieve high-quality results in practical tasks, such as a Paleontology application where Gibbs sampling outperformed human volunteers.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The introduction of hierarchy width as a stronger alternative to hypertree width is a significant theoretical advancement. Theorem 2 provides a clear and rigorous bound on mixing time, which is a valuable contribution to the study of Gibbs sampling.
2. Practical Relevance: The focus on hierarchical templates, which are common in real-world applications, bridges the gap between theory and practice. The demonstrated success in tasks like knowledge base population and Paleontology highlights the practical utility of the proposed framework.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written, with a logical flow from theoretical foundations to experimental results. Key proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, maintaining readability.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments effectively illustrate the impact of hierarchy width on mixing time and the benefits of logical and ratio semantics. The comparison with human performance adds an engaging real-world dimension.
Weaknesses:
1. Loose Bounds: While the theoretical bounds are insightful, they are too loose for quantitative predictions in practical scenarios. This limits their direct applicability.
2. Unclear Relevance of Theorem 2: The practical significance of Theorem 2 for real-world networks is not fully established. The authors should evaluate its relevance more rigorously.
3. Insufficient Comparison with Prior Work: The related work section lacks focus on prior research specifically addressing mixing time bounds in factor graphs. Notably, tighter bounds for special cases, such as those by Liu and Domke (2014), are not cited.
4. Tree-width vs. Hierarchy Width: The claim that real-world networks have high tree-width, making exact inference infeasible, is compelling but unsubstantiated. Reporting and comparing tree-width, hierarchy width, and factor weights across datasets would strengthen the analysis.
5. Minor Errors: Typos in Section 2.1 (e.g., "q" vs. "Q" and "figure 2(a)" vs. "figure 2(b)") detract slightly from the paper's polish.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound concept (hierarchy width) that advances the understanding of Gibbs sampling.
- It connects theory to practice through hierarchical templates and demonstrates real-world impact.
- The writing is clear, and the experimental results are compelling.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The bounds are too loose for quantitative use, and the practical relevance of Theorem 2 is unclear.
- The related work section is incomplete, and important prior contributions are omitted.
- The analysis would benefit from a more thorough comparison of hierarchy width with other graph properties like tree-width.
Recommendation:
This paper is a strong theoretical contribution with practical implications, but it requires revisions to address the cited weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly focusing on strengthening the related work section, substantiating claims about tree-width, and correcting minor errors.
