This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of topological data analysis (TDA) by introducing a universal kernel for persistence diagrams, enabling their use in the framework of embedding probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The authors demonstrate the universality of a modified persistence scale-space (PSS) kernel and its practical utility in two-sample hypothesis testing, supported by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This work builds on prior research, such as Reininghaus et al. [20] and Bubenik [4], by addressing critical gaps in kernel properties and extending the statistical applicability of persistence diagrams.
Strengths:
The paper is technically sound and well-motivated. The authors rigorously prove the universality of their kernel using established theoretical frameworks, such as the work of Christmann and Steinwart [7]. The experiments convincingly demonstrate the kernel's utility in distinguishing distributions of persistence diagrams, particularly in synthetic and real-world applications. The ability to perform principled two-sample hypothesis testing represents a notable advancement over prior methods, which often focused on specific distributional properties, such as mean equality. Furthermore, the paper's connection to kernel-based learning techniques broadens its potential impact, making it relevant to both TDA and the broader machine learning community.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: The phrase "total multiplicities are bounded by N" in Section 3 requires clarification, as it may confuse readers unfamiliar with the concept. Similarly, the discussion of 0-dimensional features and their relation to sublevel sets and homology in Section 4.1 is convoluted and needs simplification for non-expert readers.
2. Limitations of Bounded Persistence and Multiplicities: The restriction to compact metric spaces and bounded persistence diagrams, while necessary for the theoretical framework, is a significant limitation. The authors should discuss the implications of these constraints, particularly for smooth perturbed functions, and provide guidance for non-expert readers on interpreting these results in practical scenarios.
3. Visualization in Figure 2: The 3D visualization of the mean PSS function in Figure 2 is suboptimal. Replacing it with 2D colormaps would better convey symmetry and improve clarity.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pros: The paper addresses an important problem in statistical TDA, introduces a novel universal kernel with strong theoretical guarantees, and demonstrates its practical utility in hypothesis testing. The work is original and builds meaningfully on prior research.
- Cons: The clarity of certain sections and visualizations could be improved, and the limitations of the bounded persistence framework are not adequately addressed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. Addressing the identified weaknesses would further enhance its clarity and impact. I recommend acceptance, contingent on revisions to improve clarity, address limitations, and enhance visualizations.
