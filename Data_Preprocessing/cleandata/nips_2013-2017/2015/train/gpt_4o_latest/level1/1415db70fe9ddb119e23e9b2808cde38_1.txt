The paper presents a significant advancement in the theory and application of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for high-dimensional latent variable models. The authors make two primary contributions: (i) they propose a novel high-dimensional EM algorithm that incorporates a truncation step to enforce sparsity, achieving a (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence with geometric convergence under suitable initialization, and (ii) they introduce a decorrelated score statistic for hypothesis testing in high-dimensional settings, providing the first computationally feasible framework for simultaneous estimation and inference in such regimes. The paper demonstrates the generality of the proposed framework by applying it to Gaussian mixture models and mixture of regression models, comparing favorably with existing methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The introduction of a truncation step in the EM algorithm is innovative and addresses the challenge of high dimensionality effectively. The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for both computational and statistical performance, including the minimax-optimal rate of convergence.
2. Unified Framework: The paper offers a comprehensive framework that integrates parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, which is a significant step forward for high-dimensional latent variable models.
3. Asymptotic Inference: The decorrelated score statistic is shown to achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound, making it optimal for inference in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters.
4. Thorough Theoretical Analysis: The authors rigorously establish conditions for convergence and statistical guarantees, supported by detailed proofs in the appendix.
5. Comparison with Related Work: The paper situates itself well within the existing literature, particularly extending the work of [2] to high-dimensional settings and addressing gaps in computational and statistical guarantees for latent variable models.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Applicability: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper could benefit from more extensive empirical validation. The experiments are limited to Gaussian mixture models and mixture of regression models, and it is unclear how the method performs on real-world datasets or more complex latent variable models.
2. Initialization Dependency: The proposed algorithm requires a suitable initialization, but the paper does not provide detailed guidance on how to achieve this in practice. This could limit the applicability of the method in scenarios where good initializations are difficult to obtain.
3. Complexity of Implementation: The truncation step and the decorrelated score statistic involve non-trivial computations, which may pose challenges for practitioners without access to specialized expertise or computational resources.
4. Sparse Assumptions: The framework relies on sparsity assumptions for both the parameter space and the decorrelated score statistic. While these assumptions are common in high-dimensional statistics, their validity in practical applications may not always hold.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in the theoretical understanding of the EM algorithm in high-dimensional settings and provides novel contributions that are well-supported by rigorous analysis.
- The proposed framework is general and has the potential to impact a broad range of applications involving latent variable models.
- The theoretical results are of high quality and advance the state of the art in both parameter estimation and inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of extensive empirical validation limits the practical impact of the work.
- The reliance on suitable initialization and sparsity assumptions may restrict the applicability of the proposed method.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its theoretical contributions are substantial and well-aligned with the goals of the conference. However, I encourage the authors to include more empirical results and practical guidance in future iterations to enhance the accessibility and applicability of their framework.
