The paper presents a significant contribution to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) by extending policy gradient methods to the entire class of coherent risk measures, encompassing both static and time-consistent dynamic risk measures. This work generalizes previous approaches that focused on specific risk measures, such as variance or CVaR, and provides a unified framework for risk-sensitive optimization in RL. The authors propose novel gradient estimation algorithms for static coherent risk measures using sampling and convex programming, and extend these results to dynamic settings with an actor-critic style algorithm. The theoretical contributions are complemented by a numerical illustration, showcasing the flexibility of coherent risk measures in addressing problem-specific risk preferences.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, providing theoretical guarantees for the proposed gradient estimation algorithms. The use of the envelope theorem and the likelihood-ratio trick is well-founded, and the consistency of the gradient estimators is established under reasonable assumptions.
2. Generality: By addressing the entire class of coherent risk measures, the paper significantly broadens the applicability of risk-sensitive RL. This generalization is a notable advancement over prior work that focused on specific risk measures like CVaR or mean-variance models.
3. Novelty: The proposed unified framework and the new policy gradient theorems for coherent risk measures represent a clear step forward in the field. The extension to dynamic settings with time-consistent risk measures is particularly impactful.
4. Practical Relevance: The numerical example effectively demonstrates the importance of flexibility in risk measure selection, highlighting the practical utility of the proposed methods in real-world decision-making scenarios, such as financial modeling.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the theoretical results and their implications. The inclusion of supplementary material for proofs and additional details is commendable.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: While the algorithms are theoretically sound, the reliance on convex programming and sampling may pose scalability challenges for large-scale or high-dimensional problems. The authors briefly acknowledge this but do not provide concrete solutions or empirical evaluations for such cases.
2. Empirical Validation: The numerical example, though illustrative, is relatively simple and does not fully demonstrate the scalability or robustness of the proposed methods in more complex RL environments. A broader empirical evaluation would strengthen the paper.
3. Assumptions: The assumptions required for the theoretical results, such as the explicit form of the risk envelope and the availability of a simulator for sampling, may limit the applicability of the methods in some practical settings.
4. Actor-Critic Algorithm Details: The actor-critic algorithm for dynamic risk is not fully detailed in the main text, which limits the reader's ability to evaluate its practicality and implementation challenges.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution by extending risk-sensitive RL to a broader class of risk measures.
- It provides a unified framework that generalizes and simplifies prior work, with clear potential for future extensions.
- The methods are well-grounded in theory and have practical implications for managing risk in RL.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The scalability and robustness of the methods are not thoroughly evaluated in complex settings.
- The reliance on certain assumptions may limit the general applicability of the proposed algorithms.
- The lack of detailed empirical validation leaves questions about the practical performance of the methods.
Conclusion:
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of risk-sensitive RL, offering novel theoretical insights and a unified framework for coherent risk measures. While there are some limitations in scalability and empirical validation, the significance of the contributions outweighs these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address scalability and provide more extensive empirical results in future work.
