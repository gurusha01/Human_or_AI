This paper presents a novel and comprehensive framework for efficient parameter learning in Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs), addressing a significant gap in the literature. The authors propose an EM-based approach that leverages techniques from the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) literature, including the Expm, Unif, and Eigen methods, to compute end-state conditioned expectations. The paper demonstrates the scalability of the proposed methods to large state spaces (e.g., 100+ states), which is a notable advancement over prior work. The authors validate their framework on both synthetic data and two real-world disease progression datasets (glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease), showcasing its utility for modeling irregularly sampled clinical data and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in prediction tasks.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous and systematic treatment of EM algorithms for CT-HMMs, introducing efficient methods for parameter estimation that extend and unify prior work on CTMCs.
2. Scalability: The ability to handle large state spaces (e.g., 105 states for glaucoma and 277 states for Alzheimer's) is a significant improvement over previous CT-HMM implementations, which were limited to fewer than 100 states.
3. Practical Utility: The application of CT-HMMs to real-world datasets demonstrates their potential for disease progression modeling, yielding clinically relevant insights (e.g., the L-shaped progression pattern in glaucoma and the temporal ordering of biomarkers in Alzheimer's).
4. Experimental Validation: The authors provide thorough experimental comparisons, showing that their methods outperform existing approaches, such as Bayesian joint linear regression, in prediction accuracy.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper includes detailed visualizations and interpretable findings, such as the 2D and 3D disease progression trajectories, which enhance its practical relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical content is robust, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations of key concepts, particularly for readers less familiar with CTMCs and matrix exponential methods. For example, the derivation of the Expm method could be simplified or accompanied by illustrative diagrams.
2. Comparative Analysis: Although the paper compares different methods (Expm, Unif, Eigen) within the proposed framework, it does not provide a detailed comparison with other CT-HMM learning approaches beyond Bayesian regression. Including more baselines or discussing why other CT-HMM methods were excluded would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Computational Cost: While the authors analyze time complexity, the reported runtimes (e.g., 18 minutes per iteration for Soft Expm) may still be prohibitive for very large datasets or real-time applications. A discussion of potential optimizations or scalability to even larger datasets would be valuable.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper addresses a critical limitation in CT-HMM learning, enabling scalability and practical application to large datasets.
- The methods are rigorously developed and validated, with clear improvements over prior work.
- The real-world applications provide compelling evidence of the framework's utility for disease modeling.
Con:
- The dense technical presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
- Limited discussion of alternative CT-HMM learning methods and computational scalability.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to efficient CT-HMM learning and its demonstrated impact on disease progression modeling make it a valuable addition to the field. However, the authors should consider improving the clarity of their presentation and expanding the discussion of related work in the final version.
