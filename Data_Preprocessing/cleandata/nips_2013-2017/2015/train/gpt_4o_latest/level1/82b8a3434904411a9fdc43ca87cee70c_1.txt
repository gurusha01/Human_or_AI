This paper introduces a novel framework for computing cross-validation (CV) error lower bounds as a function of the regularization parameter, enabling a theoretically guaranteed choice of regularization parameters in machine learning tasks. The authors propose the concept of ε-approximate regularization parameters, which ensures that the CV error of a chosen parameter is within ε of the best possible CV error. The framework leverages a novel CV error lower bound, represented as a monotonic function of the regularization parameter, and is compatible with common parameter tuning strategies such as grid search and Bayesian optimization. The authors demonstrate the practicality of their approach through experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that the framework achieves theoretical guarantees with reasonable computational costs.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical framework for bounding CV errors, addressing a critical gap in hyperparameter tuning by offering guarantees on the quality of selected regularization parameters.
2. Practical Utility: The framework is computationally efficient, as it works with approximate solutions and integrates seamlessly with existing tuning methods like grid search and Bayesian optimization.
3. Generality: The approach is applicable to a wide range of regularized convex loss minimization problems and can be extended to kernelized settings, making it broadly relevant.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the utility of the framework across multiple datasets and comparing it to existing methods. The results show that the proposed method improves upon grid search and Bayesian optimization in terms of approximation guarantees.
5. Clarity of Problem Statement: The paper clearly defines its objectives, including the two problem setups (computing ε-approximation levels and finding ε-approximate parameters), and provides detailed algorithms for each.
Weaknesses
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical tools used. Simplifying some derivations or providing more intuitive explanations could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: Although the experiments are thorough, they focus primarily on binary classification problems with convex loss functions. It would be valuable to explore the framework's performance on other machine learning tasks or with non-convex loss functions.
3. Scalability for ε = 0: The computational cost for finding the exact optimal regularization parameter (ε = 0) is high, as acknowledged by the authors. While approximate solutions are practical, this limitation could hinder adoption in scenarios requiring exact solutions.
4. Comparison with Alternatives: The paper mentions related work on approximate regularization paths but does not provide a direct empirical comparison with these methods. Such comparisons could strengthen the case for the proposed framework.
Arguments for Acceptance

Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a significant theoretical and practical contribution to hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. However, the authors should consider simplifying the presentation and expanding the experimental scope in future work.
