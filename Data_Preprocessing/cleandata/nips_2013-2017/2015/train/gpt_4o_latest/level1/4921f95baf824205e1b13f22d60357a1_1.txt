The paper addresses the problems of link prediction and clustering in network-structured data, proposing a theoretical and empirical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic under the stochastic blockmodel framework. The authors demonstrate that the common neighbors heuristic, despite its simplicity, can achieve high accuracy in identifying clusters and predicting links, particularly in semi-dense graphs. For semi-sparse graphs, they introduce a "cleaning" step that extends the heuristic's effectiveness. The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees for these claims and supports them with experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, comparing their approach to spectral clustering and the Katz score.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the common neighbors heuristic under the stochastic blockmodel, addressing a significant gap in the literature. The distinction between semi-dense and semi-sparse regimes is novel and insightful.
2. Practical Relevance: The common neighbors heuristic is computationally efficient and widely used in practice. The theoretical guarantees provided here can enhance its adoption in large-scale applications.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets are thorough. The results convincingly demonstrate the heuristic's effectiveness, particularly in sparse graphs where spectral clustering struggles.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly delineates the conditions under which the heuristic succeeds, providing a roadmap for practitioners to apply it effectively.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Models: The analysis is restricted to the stochastic blockmodel, which, while popular, may not fully capture the complexity of real-world networks (e.g., overlapping communities or dynamic graphs).
2. Dependence on Cleaning Step: The cleaning step, while effective, introduces additional complexity and may not be as computationally lightweight as the base heuristic. Its practical feasibility in very large graphs is not fully explored.
3. Comparative Analysis: While the paper compares its method to spectral clustering and the Katz score, it does not benchmark against other recent advancements in link prediction and clustering, such as graph neural networks or embedding-based methods.
4. Clarity in Presentation: The theoretical proofs, while rigorous, are dense and may be difficult for readers without a strong mathematical background to follow. A more intuitive explanation of key results would improve accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by analyzing a widely used heuristic and providing guarantees under specific graph regimes.
- The empirical results are robust and demonstrate the heuristic's practical utility.
- The work is relevant to both theoretical and applied communities, addressing a problem of broad interest.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The focus on the stochastic blockmodel limits the generalizability of the results.
- The reliance on the cleaning step in semi-sparse graphs adds complexity, which may detract from the heuristic's appeal as a lightweight method.
- The lack of comparison with more recent methods limits the paper's positioning in the broader research landscape.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field, bridging the gap between theory and practice for a commonly used heuristic. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the work is well-suited for the NIPS audience. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and broaden the comparative analysis.
