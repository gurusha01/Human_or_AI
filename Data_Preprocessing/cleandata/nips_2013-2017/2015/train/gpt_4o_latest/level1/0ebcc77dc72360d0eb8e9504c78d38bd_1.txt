This paper introduces a novel Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization algorithm, Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), which achieves exponential convergence without requiring auxiliary optimization or the impractical δ-cover sampling procedure. The authors address a longstanding challenge in Bayesian optimization by leveraging an unknown semi-metric bound, rather than relying solely on the GP-derived bound, to guide the search for the global optimum. The proposed algorithm uses hierarchical partitioning and a novel interval selection strategy to balance global and local exploration. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that IMGPO achieves exponential regret bounds, outperforming prior methods like BaMSOO, which only guarantee polynomial regret. Empirical results on benchmark functions further validate the algorithm's superior performance and computational efficiency.
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The paper provides a significant theoretical contribution by achieving exponential convergence without δ-cover sampling, a key limitation of prior work (e.g., de Freitas et al., 2012). The introduction of infinite-metric exploration is a novel and elegant solution to the problem of tightness in GP-derived bounds.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors present a detailed regret analysis, clearly articulating the conditions under which IMGPO outperforms existing methods. The inclusion of remarks on the effects of GP bounds and infinite-metric exploration provides valuable insights into the algorithm's behavior.
3. Practical Relevance: By eliminating auxiliary optimization and δ-cover sampling, IMGPO is more practical and computationally efficient than traditional GP-UCB methods. The availability of source code further enhances reproducibility and applicability.
4. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on diverse benchmark functions convincingly demonstrate IMGPO's superior performance compared to SOO, BaMSOO, and GP-based methods like GP-PI and GP-EI. The scalability experiment (e.g., 1000-dimensional function) highlights the algorithm's potential for high-dimensional optimization.
Weaknesses
1. Scalability Concerns: While the authors acknowledge that the regret bound deteriorates with increasing dimensionality, the paper does not provide a concrete strategy to address this limitation. The scalability experiments rely on REMBO, which imposes additional assumptions.
2. Complexity of Algorithm: The hierarchical partitioning and interval selection steps are intricate, and the algorithm may be challenging to implement and tune for practitioners unfamiliar with Bayesian optimization.
3. Limited Comparison: The experiments do not include comparisons with recent advancements in Bayesian optimization (e.g., methods leveraging neural networks or other surrogate models). This omission limits the scope of the empirical evaluation.
4. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper does not thoroughly explore the sensitivity of IMGPO to its hyperparameters (e.g., Ξmax), which could impact its robustness in real-world applications.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in Bayesian optimization and provides a theoretically sound and practically relevant solution.
- The combination of theoretical rigor and strong empirical results makes this work a valuable contribution to the field.
- The elimination of auxiliary optimization and δ-cover sampling significantly improves the practicality of GP-based methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems remains a challenge, and the paper does not propose a clear solution.
- The algorithm's complexity and lack of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods may limit its impact.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to Bayesian optimization. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address scalability and hyperparameter sensitivity.
