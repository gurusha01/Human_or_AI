The paper proposes a novel method, Covariance-Controlled Adaptive Langevin (CCAdL), for Bayesian posterior inference in large-scale machine learning applications. The method addresses the limitations of existing stochastic gradient-based sampling techniques, such as Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) and Stochastic Gradient Nos√©-Hoover Thermostat (SGNHT), which assume constant noise variance and struggle with parameter-dependent noise. By incorporating a parameter-dependent covariance matrix and a stabilizing thermostat mechanism, CCAdL effectively dissipates noise while maintaining the desired invariant distribution. The authors demonstrate the superiority of CCAdL through theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as Bayesian inference for Gaussian distributions, Bayesian logistic regression, and training Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machines (DRBMs).
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with clear derivations of the proposed method and its theoretical properties. The authors provide proofs of the invariant distribution preserved by CCAdL and discuss its advantages over SGHMC and SGNHT.
2. Practical Relevance: The method addresses a critical limitation of existing stochastic gradient-based samplers, making it highly relevant for large-scale Bayesian inference tasks.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that CCAdL outperforms SGHMC and SGNHT in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and sample quality.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to method development and experimental results. The inclusion of detailed algorithmic steps and comparisons enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Covariance Estimation Overhead: While the authors propose a diagonal approximation to reduce computational cost, the covariance estimation step may still be expensive for very high-dimensional problems. This limitation is acknowledged but not deeply explored in the paper.
2. Limited Exploration of Splitting Methods: The authors mention that more advanced splitting methods could improve CCAdL but defer this exploration to future work. Including preliminary results with such methods could strengthen the paper.
3. Comparison Scope: The experiments focus primarily on SGHMC and SGNHT. A broader comparison with other modern Bayesian sampling techniques, such as variational inference or advanced MCMC methods, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

Recommendation
I recommend accepting this paper for its strong contribution to the field of Bayesian sampling and its practical applicability to large-scale machine learning problems. While there are some limitations, the proposed method represents a significant advancement over existing techniques, and the paper is likely to stimulate further research in this area.
