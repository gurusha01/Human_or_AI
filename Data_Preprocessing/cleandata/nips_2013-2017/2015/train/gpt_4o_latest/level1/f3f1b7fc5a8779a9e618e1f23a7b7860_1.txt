The paper addresses the problem of high-dimensional structured estimation using norm-regularized estimators, such as Lasso, in scenarios where the design matrix and noise follow sub-exponential distributions. This work extends prior research, which predominantly focused on sub-Gaussian distributions, by introducing theoretical guarantees for sub-exponential settings. The authors demonstrate that sample complexity and estimation error depend on the exponential width of sets, as opposed to the Gaussian width in sub-Gaussian cases. They further establish that the exponential width is at most √log p times the Gaussian width, allowing the use of Gaussian width-based results even in sub-exponential cases. For Lasso and Group Lasso, the paper shows that sample complexity matches that of sub-Gaussian designs when analyzed using VC-dimension techniques. These results are significant for applications in fields like finance and climate science, where sub-exponential distributions are common.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Scope: The paper is the first to provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for norm-regularized estimation under sub-exponential design matrices and noise. This is a meaningful extension of prior work, addressing a gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths is rigorously established using generic chaining, which is a notable theoretical advancement. The results are broadly applicable to various norms and structured estimation problems.
3. Practical Relevance: The paper highlights the applicability of its results to real-world domains such as climate science and finance, where sub-exponential distributions are prevalent.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments effectively compare Gaussian and sub-exponential cases, validating the theoretical findings and demonstrating the slower error decay for sub-exponential distributions.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with advanced concepts like generic chaining and exponential widths. More intuitive explanations and visual aids could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments, though illustrative, are limited to synthetic data and specific norms (`l1` and group-sparse). Additional experiments on real-world datasets and other norms would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Significance of Results: Although the results are theoretically sound, the practical impact of the √log p factor in sample complexity may be modest in many applications. This could limit the perceived significance of the work.
4. Future Work: The paper briefly mentions extending the stronger RE condition results to other norms but does not provide a clear roadmap or discussion of potential challenges.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a novel and meaningful contribution by generalizing structured estimation to sub-exponential settings.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the results are broadly applicable to various norms and distributions.
- The relationship between Gaussian and exponential widths is a valuable theoretical insight.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly for a broader audience.
- The experimental section is somewhat limited in scope and does not fully explore the practical implications of the theoretical results.
- The practical significance of the √log p factor in sample complexity may not be substantial in many real-world scenarios.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a solid theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional structured estimation under sub-exponential distributions. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and experimental scope, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address clarity and expand the experimental validation.
