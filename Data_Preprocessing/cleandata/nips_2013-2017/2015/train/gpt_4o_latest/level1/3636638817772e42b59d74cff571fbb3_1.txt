This paper addresses the problem of decentralized estimation of U-statistics in networks, a less-explored area compared to the distributed estimation of sample means. U-statistics, which include measures like Area Under the Curve (AUC), empirical variance, and Gini mean difference, are critical for describing global statistical properties. The authors propose new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms, termed GoSta-sync and GoSta-async, to efficiently compute U-statistics. These algorithms propagate data across the network while maintaining local estimates, achieving convergence rates of \(O(1/t)\) and \(O(\log t/t)\) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases, respectively. The paper demonstrates both theoretical improvements over prior work (e.g., U2-gossip) and empirical superiority in terms of convergence speed and resource efficiency.
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including convergence proofs and explicit bounds that depend on data and network properties. The introduction of "phantom nodes" for convergence analysis is novel and insightful.
2. Practical Relevance: The algorithms address real-world constraints in decentralized systems, such as limited memory, communication, and the absence of global synchronization.
3. Empirical Validation: Numerical experiments on real datasets (e.g., AUC and within-cluster point scatter) demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed methods over U2-gossip, particularly in terms of convergence speed and scalability.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and results. The inclusion of both synchronous and asynchronous settings broadens the applicability of the work.
5. Originality: The work significantly extends the state of the art by focusing on U-statistics, which are computationally more challenging than simple means. The proposed algorithms are novel and improve upon existing methods in both theory and practice.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the experiments are compelling, they are limited to two applications (AUC and within-cluster scatter) and a few types of networks. Additional experiments on other U-statistics and network topologies (e.g., scale-free networks) would strengthen the paper.
2. Asynchronous Analysis: Although GoSta-async is shown to perform well empirically, its theoretical analysis is less detailed compared to the synchronous case. For example, the constant \(c'(G)\) in the convergence bound is not explicitly characterized.
3. Comparison to Baselines: The paper primarily compares GoSta to U2-gossip. Including comparisons to other decentralized algorithms for related tasks (e.g., decentralized optimization methods) would provide a broader context for the contributions.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant contribution to decentralized computation by addressing a challenging and underexplored problem.
- Theoretical results are robust and well-supported by empirical evidence.
- The work is original and advances the state of the art in decentralized algorithms for U-statistics.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The experimental section could be expanded to include more diverse applications and network types.
- The theoretical analysis of the asynchronous algorithm could be more comprehensive.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper is a strong submission that combines theoretical rigor with practical relevance. While there are minor areas for improvement, the contributions are substantial, and the work is likely to be of interest to the NeurIPS community. I recommend acceptance.
