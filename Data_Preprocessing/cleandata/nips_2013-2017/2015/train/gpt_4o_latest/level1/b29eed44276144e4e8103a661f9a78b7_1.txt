This paper presents a novel contribution to the theoretical understanding of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs by introducing the concept of hierarchy width, a new graph property that ensures polynomial mixing time under bounded factor weights. The authors demonstrate that hierarchy width is a stronger condition than hypertree width, which is traditionally used to analyze inference algorithms but is insufficient to guarantee rapid mixing for Gibbs sampling. The paper also introduces hierarchical factor graph templates, a class of templates with bounded hierarchy width, and proves that Gibbs sampling on these templates mixes in polynomial time when logical or ratio semantics are used. The authors validate their theoretical results with both synthetic experiments and a real-world application in natural language processing, where their approach achieves superior accuracy compared to human annotators.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The introduction of hierarchy width is a significant advancement in understanding the behavior of Gibbs sampling. The paper rigorously proves that bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time, filling a critical gap in the literature.
2. Novelty: The work is original and distinguishes itself from prior research by addressing the limitations of hypertree width and introducing a new graph property tailored to Gibbs sampling.
3. Practical Relevance: The focus on hierarchical templates, which are common in real-world applications, bridges the gap between theory and practice. The demonstrated success in a natural language processing task highlights the practical utility of the proposed approach.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on synthetic data and real-world applications provide strong evidence for the claims. The results clearly illustrate the impact of hierarchy width and semantics on mixing time and inference quality.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from theoretical foundations to practical applications. The definitions, theorems, and proofs are presented with sufficient detail for reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Definitions: While the concept of hierarchy width is well-motivated, its recursive definition may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with graph theory. A more intuitive explanation or additional examples could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The synthetic experiments focus on small graphs with treewidth 1, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world factor graphs. Additional experiments on larger, more diverse graphs would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Dependence on Semantics: The results rely heavily on the use of logical or ratio semantics. While this is justified theoretically, the practical implications for models that use linear semantics are less clear.
4. Scalability: Although the authors claim polynomial mixing time, the constants involved in the bounds (e.g., dependence on hierarchy width and factor weights) may still result in high computational costs for large-scale factor graphs. This aspect is not thoroughly discussed.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution by introducing hierarchy width and proving its relevance to Gibbs sampling.
- The work is novel, addressing a critical gap in the literature on MCMC methods for factor graphs.
- The practical relevance of the results is demonstrated through real-world applications, showing both theoretical and empirical impact.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The complexity of the definitions and proofs may limit accessibility for a broader audience.
- The experimental validation could be more comprehensive, particularly for larger and more complex factor graphs.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a significant theoretical advancement with practical implications. While there are minor weaknesses in accessibility and experimental scope, the strengths of the contribution outweigh these concerns. The paper is likely to stimulate further research on the interplay between graph properties and MCMC methods.
