This paper introduces Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC), a novel modification of the Leapfrog discretization method for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) that addresses the challenges of sampling from piecewise continuous densities with affine boundaries. The authors draw inspiration from physical systems, such as optics, where momentum undergoes reflection or refraction at discontinuities. RHMC incorporates these behaviors into the Leapfrog dynamics by detecting trajectory intersections with boundaries and adjusting momentum accordingly. The authors rigorously prove that RHMC preserves the correct stationary distribution and satisfies detailed balance, and they demonstrate its efficacy through numerical experiments on high-dimensional piecewise distributions. Their results show that RHMC reduces the number of rejected samples compared to baseline HMC, particularly in higher dimensions, thereby improving sampling efficiency.
Strengths
1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending HMC methods to piecewise continuous densities, which are common in many probabilistic models but challenging for traditional HMC. The incorporation of reflection and refraction dynamics is both novel and well-motivated by physical analogies.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, including proofs of volume preservation and detailed balance, which are essential for ensuring the correctness of the proposed method.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed, comparing RHMC to baseline HMC and tuned Metropolis-Hastings (MH) across different dimensions. The results convincingly demonstrate RHMC's advantages, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is generally well-organized, with clear explanations of the proposed method, theoretical results, and experimental setup. The inclusion of detailed algorithms and visualizations enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Scope of Applicability: While RHMC is shown to work well for piecewise continuous densities with affine boundaries, its applicability to more complex or non-affine boundaries is not discussed. This limits its generalizability.
2. Computational Overhead: The paper acknowledges that detecting intersections and computing reflections/refractions introduces additional computational cost. While this is offset by improved sampling efficiency in high dimensions, the trade-off is less favorable in low dimensions, as shown in the experiments.
3. Comparison to Related Work: Although the authors reference prior work by Pakman and Paninski on exact Hamiltonian dynamics for piecewise Gaussian distributions, a more detailed comparison of computational complexity and practical applicability would strengthen the paper.
4. Reproducibility: While the theoretical and algorithmic details are comprehensive, the lack of publicly available code may hinder reproducibility for practitioners.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a well-motivated and challenging problem in probabilistic inference, making a substantial technical contribution.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages.
- RHMC has the potential to significantly impact applications involving piecewise continuous densities, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The method's applicability is limited to piecewise continuous densities with affine boundaries, and its extension to more general cases is not explored.
- The computational overhead may limit its utility in low-dimensional problems or real-time applications.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper represents a strong contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and sampling methods. While there are some limitations in scope and computational cost, the novelty and rigor of the proposed method, combined with its demonstrated efficacy in high-dimensional settings, make it a valuable addition to the NeurIPS community. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the broader applicability and reproducibility concerns.
