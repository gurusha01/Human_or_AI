Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the problem of sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition, a critical task in machine learning and data analysis with applications in topic modeling, independent component analysis, and neuroscience. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that modifies Leurgans' algorithm for tensor factorization by leveraging tensor contraction to reduce the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition. The algorithm avoids computationally expensive tensor unfolding methods and instead uses convex optimization techniques to solve the matrix sub-problems. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for exact recovery under specific incoherence and sparsity conditions and validate their approach through numerical experiments.
The work builds on prior research in robust PCA for matrices [6, 9, 13] and tensor decomposition [4, 17, 24], extending these ideas to handle adversarial corruption in tensors. The use of tensor contraction to reduce computational complexity is a notable contribution, as it allows the algorithm to scale efficiently with tensor dimensions. The authors also explore extensions to higher-order tensors, block sparsity, and tensor completion, demonstrating the flexibility of their approach.
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is rigorous in its theoretical analysis, providing clear recovery guarantees under well-defined conditions. The use of incoherence parameters and degree constraints is consistent with prior work in matrix decomposition.
2. Efficiency: The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, with a complexity of \(O(n^3)\) for third-order tensors, significantly outperforming tensor unfolding methods that scale as \(O(n^4)\).
3. Generality: The algorithm is modular and adaptable to various extensions, including higher-order tensors and tensor completion, broadening its applicability.
4. Validation: Numerical experiments support the theoretical claims, showing successful recovery of low-rank and sparse components under varying levels of corruption and tensor dimensions.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, it is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with tensor decomposition. The notation and technical details could be streamlined for better accessibility.
2. Experimental Scope: The numerical experiments, while promising, are limited in scope. Larger-scale experiments or comparisons with state-of-the-art methods (e.g., non-convex approaches) would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Practicality: The reliance on convex optimization for matrix decomposition, while theoretically sound, may limit scalability for very large tensors. Exploring faster non-convex alternatives could enhance the practicality of the approach.
