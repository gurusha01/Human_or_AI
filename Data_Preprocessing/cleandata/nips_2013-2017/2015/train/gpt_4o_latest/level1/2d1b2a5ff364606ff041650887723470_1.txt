The paper addresses the problem of estimating structured signals (e.g., sparse or low-rank) from non-linear measurements using the Generalized LASSO framework. The authors build on classical work by Brillinger and recent results by Plan and Vershynin, extending these to provide precise asymptotic characterizations of the estimation error in high-dimensional settings. A key result is that the performance of the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements is asymptotically equivalent to that under appropriately scaled and noisy linear measurements. The paper also derives explicit error expressions, demonstrating their applicability to sparse, group-sparse, and low-rank recovery problems. An interesting application to optimal quantization in compressive sensing is presented, where the authors show that the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer minimizes the estimation error.
Strengths:
1. Technical Depth and Originality: The paper provides the first asymptotically precise results for the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements, addressing a significant gap in the literature. The extension of results from linear to non-linear measurement models is both novel and impactful.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The derivation of explicit error expressions and the connection between non-linear and linear measurement models are significant theoretical advancements. The use of tools like the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT) is rigorous and well-justified.
3. Practical Implications: The application to quantization in compressive sensing is compelling, with clear practical relevance. The identification of the Lloyd-Max quantizer as optimal is a valuable insight for practitioners.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper is well-organized, with clear statements of theorems and their implications. The numerical validations in Figures 1 and 2 effectively support the theoretical claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections, particularly the derivations, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the CGMT framework. Simplifying or summarizing key steps could improve accessibility.
2. Assumptions: The results rely on specific assumptions, such as Gaussian measurement matrices and high-dimensional asymptotics. While these are standard in the field, discussing the robustness of the results to deviations from these assumptions would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Experimental Validation: The numerical experiments are insightful but limited in scope. Additional experiments on real-world datasets or alternative measurement models would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
4. Comparison to Prior Work: While the paper builds on prior work by Plan and Vershynin, a more detailed comparison of the derived bounds to existing results (e.g., in terms of tightness or generality) would provide better context for the contributions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending the Generalized LASSO framework to non-linear measurements.
- The results are novel, technically sound, and have clear practical implications, particularly for compressive sensing and quantization.
- The connection between non-linear and linear measurement models is an elegant and impactful insight.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's presentation could be more accessible, particularly for readers outside the immediate subfield.
- The experimental validation is somewhat limited, and the robustness of the results to non-Gaussian settings is not explored.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a strong contribution to the field of high-dimensional signal estimation and optimization. While there are areas for improvement in presentation and experimental validation, the theoretical advancements and practical insights justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address clarity and expand experimental validation.
