The paper presents a comprehensive study of improved variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization algorithm, addressing its well-known sublinear convergence rate when solutions lie on the boundary of the feasible set. The authors focus on four variants—Away-Steps FW (AFW), Pairwise FW (PFW), Fully-Corrective FW (FCFW), and Wolfe's Minimum Norm Point (MNP) algorithm—and provide a unified theoretical framework proving their global linear convergence under weaker conditions than strong convexity. The key contribution lies in introducing a novel geometric quantity, the "pyramidal width," which, combined with the condition number of the objective function, determines the convergence rate. The paper also highlights practical applications in sparse optimization, submodular optimization, and machine learning, such as Lasso regression and video co-localization.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides the first global linear convergence guarantees for all four FW variants under a weaker condition than strong convexity. This is a significant advancement over prior work, which relied on stricter assumptions like Robinson's condition.
2. Novel Insights: The introduction of the pyramidal width as a geometric measure of the constraint set is an elegant and insightful contribution. It not only explains the convergence behavior but also has potential implications for complexity theory.
3. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors rigorously analyze the algorithms, addressing boundary cases and providing detailed proofs. The results are generalizable to non-strongly convex functions, further broadening the applicability.
4. Practical Relevance: The paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed methods in real-world applications, such as constrained Lasso and flow polytope optimization, supported by empirical results showing the superiority of the modified FW variants.
5. Clarity of Related Work: The paper situates its contributions well within the existing literature, contrasting its results with prior work and highlighting its novelty.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with FW algorithms. Simplifying the exposition, particularly the proofs and algorithm descriptions, could improve accessibility.
2. Empirical Evaluation: Although the experiments validate the theoretical claims, they are limited in scope. Additional experiments on diverse datasets and real-world problems would strengthen the practical significance of the results.
3. Loose Bounds for PFW: The convergence analysis for Pairwise FW includes a loose bound on the number of problematic swap steps, which could be tightened for a more precise characterization.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by proving global linear convergence for FW variants under weaker conditions.
- The introduction of the pyramidal width is a novel and impactful idea with potential applications beyond this work.
- The empirical results, though limited, demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The presentation is dense and may deter readers who are not experts in optimization.
- The experimental evaluation could be more extensive to demonstrate broader applicability.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its theoretical contributions and novel insights into FW algorithms represent a meaningful advancement in the field. However, the authors should consider revising the paper to improve clarity and expand the empirical evaluation.
