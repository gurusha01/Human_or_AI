Review:
This paper presents a novel method for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to act as near-optimal feedback controllers for a diverse range of dynamical systems and tasks, including swimming, flying, and bipedal/quadrupedal walking. The approach combines supervised learning with trajectory optimization, specifically Contact-Invariant Optimization (CIO), to generate stable and realistic behaviors in three-dimensional spaces. The method is notable for its ability to handle complex dynamics without requiring motion capture, task-specific features, or state machines. Key innovations include injecting noise during training to improve robustness, interleaving supervised learning with trajectory optimization, and optimizing feedback gains alongside actions. The authors demonstrate their method's efficacy on a variety of morphologies and tasks, achieving interactive real-time control.
Strengths:
1. Quality: The paper is technically sound and provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for its claims. The use of CIO for trajectory optimization and the integration of noise injection for robustness are well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The method is shown to outperform static training and ablations (e.g., without noise injection), demonstrating its effectiveness.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology, including mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps. The inclusion of comparative evaluations and ablation studies strengthens the clarity of the contributions.
3. Originality: The work is original in its combination of trajectory optimization and neural network regression for real-time control. While trajectory optimization and neural networks are established techniques, their integration in this manner, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control tasks, is novel. The paper also extends prior work by achieving stable locomotion in three-dimensional spaces, which has been a challenging problem.
4. Significance: The results are significant, as the method has broad applicability in robotics, animation, and biomechanics. The ability to train controllers for diverse morphologies and tasks with a unified approach advances the state of the art in neural network-based control. The method's scalability and robustness to noise make it particularly valuable for real-world applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparative Evaluation: While the paper compares its method to static training and ablations, it lacks a direct comparison to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods or other trajectory optimization-based controllers. A systematic evaluation against these baselines would strengthen the paper.
2. Generalization: The paper does not thoroughly address how well the trained controllers generalize to unseen tasks or morphologies. While the method is robust to noise, its performance under significant deviations from training conditions (e.g., novel terrains or obstacles) is unclear.
3. Computational Cost: The method relies heavily on computationally expensive trajectory optimization, which may limit its scalability to more complex tasks or real-world robotic systems. While the authors mention distributed training, further discussion on computational efficiency and potential bottlenecks would be beneficial.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The method is innovative and addresses a challenging problem in continuous control.
- The results are impressive, demonstrating stable and realistic behaviors across diverse tasks and morphologies.
- The paper is well-written, technically rigorous, and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility.
Con:
- Limited comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
- Unclear generalization to unseen scenarios and tasks.
- High computational cost may limit practical applicability.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions are significant and well-supported by theoretical and experimental evidence. However, the authors should consider addressing the weaknesses, particularly by including comparisons to RL-based methods and discussing generalization and computational efficiency in more detail.
