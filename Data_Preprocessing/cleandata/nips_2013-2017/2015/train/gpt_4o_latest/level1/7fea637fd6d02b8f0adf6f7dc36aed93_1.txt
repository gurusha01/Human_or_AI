This paper presents a significant advancement in the study of decentralized no-regret dynamics in multiplayer normal-form games by introducing a class of regularized learning algorithms with recency bias. The authors demonstrate that these algorithms achieve faster convergence rates to approximate efficiency and coarse correlated equilibria compared to existing methods. Specifically, the proposed algorithms reduce individual regret to \(O(T^{3/4})\) and achieve convergence of the sum of utilities to an approximate optimum at \(O(1/T)\), improving upon the worst-case \(O(1/\sqrt{T})\) rates. The work generalizes prior results by Rakhlin and Sridharan [17] and Daskalakis et al. [4], which were limited to two-player zero-sum games, to the more complex setting of arbitrary multiplayer games.
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a novel class of algorithms with the Regret bounded by Variation in Utilities (RVU) property, enabling faster convergence rates. This is a meaningful contribution to the field, as it extends prior work to a broader class of games.
2. Generalization: The results are applicable to multiplayer games, including non-zero-sum settings such as auctions and routing games, which are highly relevant in practice.
3. Robustness: The authors propose a black-box reduction that ensures the algorithms maintain fast convergence rates in favorable environments while guaranteeing \(O(1/\sqrt{T})\) regret against adversarial opponents. This robustness is a significant improvement over prior ad-hoc modifications.
4. Empirical Validation: The experimental results, particularly in auction settings, confirm the theoretical findings. The observed stability and reduced regret under the proposed algorithms, such as Optimistic Hedge, are compelling.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, it is dense and may be challenging for non-experts to follow. The theoretical results, particularly the RVU property and its implications, could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visualizations.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments focus primarily on auction games. While this is a relevant application, additional experiments in other game-theoretic settings (e.g., network routing) would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Assumptions on Smoothness: The reliance on Roughgarden's smoothness framework [18] may limit the applicability of the results to games that do not satisfy these conditions. The authors could discuss potential extensions to non-smooth games.
4. Open Questions: The paper raises important questions, such as whether vanilla Hedge can achieve similar rates or how to extend these results to partial information settings. While these are acknowledged, they remain unresolved.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a clear and substantial contribution to the field of decentralized learning in games, addressing both theoretical and practical challenges.
- It generalizes prior work to a broader class of games and provides robust algorithms with improved convergence rates.
- The experimental results validate the theoretical claims and highlight the practical utility of the proposed methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly for a broader audience at NeurIPS.
- The experimental scope is somewhat narrow, and additional validation in diverse game settings would strengthen the work.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and experimental breadth, the paper's contributions to the theory and practice of no-regret dynamics in multiplayer games are significant and impactful. It advances the state of the art and opens new avenues for future research.
