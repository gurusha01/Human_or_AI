The content of this paper is substantial, and it is presented in a clear and concise manner. The experimental results are strong and well-executed.
My only recommendation is to provide additional justification for the selection of the loss function.
Additionally, there is a minor typo on page 3: "globally optimal leads to" (remove "optimal"). Overall, this is a well-executed paper that addresses an intriguing problem. The core idea revolves around learning with the top-k loss, where k predictions are made, and the loss is zero if the true class is among the k predictions.
