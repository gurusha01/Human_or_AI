Paraphrased Review
SUMMARY
Hamiltonian MCMC methods generate samples from a probability distribution by interpreting its logarithm as a "potential energy" function over the state space. This is augmented with additional "momentum variables" and their corresponding "kinetic energy," enabling the system to evolve according to the Hamiltonian equations of motion. Each step in the Markov chain is executed by numerically integrating these equations forward in time. However, when the energy function is non-differentiable, the integral becomes ill-defined.
To address numerical inaccuracies in the integration process, a rejection step is employed, which also handles non-differentiable regions. However, this comes at the expense of reducing the mixing efficiency of the Markov chain. 
This paper introduces a novel approach inspired by physical principles, involving "reflections" and "refractions" of the system's trajectory whenever it crosses a discontinuity in the energy function. The method is specifically designed for target distributions that are differentiable everywhere except at the boundaries of certain polytopes. When the system's trajectory intersects such a boundary, either a reflection or a refraction occurs, depending on whether the momentum component of the state is sufficient to overcome the energy gap.
The authors demonstrate that these reflection and refraction mechanisms preserve the necessary volume properties, ensuring that the Markov chain converges to the desired target distribution.
QUALITY
The proposed modification to Hamiltonian MCMC is practical and addresses the relevant case of piecewise-differentiable target distributions, which are frequently encountered in real-world applications. Extending the method to handle boundaries beyond affine hyperplanes would be a valuable addition.
CLARITY
The paper provides a clear explanation of the algorithm, its underlying motivation, and the proof of the volume-preservation property. However, additional discussion—either qualitative or quantitative—on how reflections and refractions influence rejection rates would enhance the presentation.
ORIGINALITY AND SIGNIFICANCE
The concept of incorporating physically-inspired reflection and refraction into Hamiltonian MCMC appears to be both novel and impactful. While the current work establishes its correctness under specific conditions, further exploration to generalize the approach would be an exciting direction for future research.
In summary, this work presents a modification to Hamiltonian MCMC that effectively handles probability distributions with non-differentiable boundaries on polytopes. By reflecting or refracting the trajectory at such boundaries, the method reduces rejection rates and improves the mixing efficiency of the Markov chain.
