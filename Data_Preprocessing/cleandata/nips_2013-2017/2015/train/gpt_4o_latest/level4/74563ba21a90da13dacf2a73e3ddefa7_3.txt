SUMMARY
This paper establishes the universality of a variant of a recently introduced kernel for persistence diagrams, which are commonly utilized to capture the persistent homology of data. The universality of this kernel facilitates kernelized hypothesis testing, which the authors employ to analyze the topology of the underlying data space for both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The manuscript is well-written, though it could benefit from being more self-contained. The work is technically sound, engaging, and contributes to the application of kernel methods in topological data analysis—a relatively novel direction, apart from the previously introduced kernel. However, the novelty of the contribution is somewhat diminished due to the prior work. Additionally, the experimental results do not clearly demonstrate whether the proposed method improves upon the state-of-the-art, as no comparisons with alternative approaches are provided. Nevertheless, I believe this paper has the potential to spark interesting discussions within the NIPS community.
DETAILS
Completeness
A more detailed exposition of topological data analysis, particularly persistence diagrams and Wasserstein distances, would significantly enhance the paper's accessibility, as these topics are not mainstream at NIPS. I strongly encourage the authors to include such a discussion in the final version. For instance, space could be reallocated from the current discussion of related work, which heavily focuses on the computation of means of persistence diagrams. While the references should remain, the description could be condensed, as it is not central to the paper's contributions.
Additionally, definitions of terms such as "birth-death bounded" should be included (despite the reference provided). While the average NIPS attendee may find the paper intriguing, they are unlikely to look up such terms, so including these definitions would broaden the paper's accessibility and impact.
Proposition 2
I have a query regarding the proof of Proposition 2. Specifically, it is unclear to me why \( f(\mathcal{R}) = \mathcal{S} \). This ambiguity might stem from the absence of a definition for "birth-death bounded," which could clarify this point.
Experiments
The experimental section would benefit from a comparison with other methods. For example, permutation tests comparing means or variances of the datasets with respect to the Wasserstein distance, or comparisons with shape analysis of the surfaces discussed in Section 4.2, would provide valuable context. As it stands, it is unclear whether the proposed method offers improvements over the state-of-the-art.
TYPOS
- Line 094: "form" → "from"  
- On page 3, the reference to [13] should likely appear earlier, specifically when the discussion of MMD begins, as this is not a contribution of the current paper.  
- Line 222: "an function" → "a function"  
In summary, this is an interesting and well-written paper that demonstrates the universality of a variant of a previously introduced kernel for topological data analysis. While the novelty is somewhat limited, and the experimental validation lacks comparisons with alternative methods, the paper is likely to stimulate engaging discussions within the NIPS community.
