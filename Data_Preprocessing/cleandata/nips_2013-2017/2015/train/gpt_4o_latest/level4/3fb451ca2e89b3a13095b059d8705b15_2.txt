This paper introduces a method analogous to Least Trimmed Squares for robust linear regression but adapted for graphical lasso.  
The primary objective is to enhance the original graphical lasso to make it more robust against outliers.  
The most notable contribution of this work lies in its theoretical analysis, which demonstrates that despite the method being non-convex and involving a biconvex objective, consistency results are established for any local minimum.  
In Section C-4, were the parameters τ₁ and τ₂ explicitly defined?  
The main limitation of this paper lies in its experimental results.  
It would be beneficial to include sensitivity vs. 1-specificity plots in the supplementary material, with both the x and y axes ranging from 0 to 1.  
As currently presented, it is challenging to evaluate the extent to which the trimmed graphical lasso outperforms other methods. Based on the existing plots, it appears that the improvement may not be substantial.  
Additionally, for the trimmed graphical lasso, the 100h/n ratios considered (80, 85, and 90) correspond to scenarios with very few outliers.  
A more compelling result would involve demonstrating that as the proportion of outliers increases, the trimmed graphical lasso's performance begins to significantly diverge from other methods, particularly the classical graphical lasso.  
This paper proposes the Trimmed Graphical Lasso, a method that trims unreliable samples to enhance robustness against outliers. The key contribution is the provision of statistical guarantees on the estimator's consistency. While the experimental results indicate that the method is competitive with existing approaches, they do not provide strong evidence of clear superiority.
