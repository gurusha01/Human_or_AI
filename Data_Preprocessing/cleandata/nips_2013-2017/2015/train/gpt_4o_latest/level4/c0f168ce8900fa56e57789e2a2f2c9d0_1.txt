The authors' analysis is both highly technical and commendable.
The primary issues with the paper are as follows:  
1. There are several instances where factual statements are made without accompanying citations, which are expected. For instance: "Indeed several Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have been analyzed for the case where the posterior distribution is supported on a convex set, and the negative log-likelihood is convex." Similarly, "... convexity is a key property to obtain algorithms with provable guarantees for this task."  
2. The results section would benefit from comparisons with more standard MCMC algorithms applied to interesting inference problems, rather than focusing solely on "volume estimation" benchmarks. Additionally, the performance improvements should be quantified explicitly, rather than relying solely on graphical representations.  
3. The absence of a conclusions section (even a brief one) detracts from the overall polish of the paper.  
4. The plots lack axis labels, and the inclusion of error bars would enhance clarity and interpretability.  
Additional comments:  
1. The authors should clarify their statement: "Unfortunately the techniques used in Dalalyan [2014] cannot deal with the singularities in the diffusion process ...". What specific singularities are being referred to?  
2. There may be a typo on line 307. Should the constant C appear in the inequality? If so, would this imply that Lemma 3 involves C^2?  
The authors present a rigorous theoretical analysis to establish guarantees on the accuracy of Langevin Monte Carlo methods. Their primary result provides a big-O type relationship that connects the number of samples required, the dimensionality of the space, and the desired accuracy (measured in total variation distance between the target distribution and the sampled distribution).
