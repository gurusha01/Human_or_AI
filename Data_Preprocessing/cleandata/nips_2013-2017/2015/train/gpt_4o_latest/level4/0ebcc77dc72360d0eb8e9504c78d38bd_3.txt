The paper presents a method for Bayesian global optimization that eliminates the need for d-cover sampling or auxiliary optimization.
The structure of the paper ensures that the primary contributions are effectively conveyed in the main section.
In Section 3.2, the authors include a well-crafted illustrative example of the algorithm, offering readers a clear, high-level understanding of its functionality.
Section 3.3 further enhances clarity by programmatically detailing the algorithm, facilitating future implementation and replication.
The experimental results are particularly compelling and add to the paper's appeal.
Moreover, the authors highlight how the work integrates concepts from the Bayesian global optimization literature, encompassing both approaches that rely on and those that bypass continuity estimation.
The paper introduces Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), a Bayesian optimization algorithm that avoids the need for auxiliary optimization or d-cover sampling. It is not only well-written but also represents a significant contribution to the NIPS community.
