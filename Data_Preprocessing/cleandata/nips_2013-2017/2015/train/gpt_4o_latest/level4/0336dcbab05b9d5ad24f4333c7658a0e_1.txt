The paper introduces a top-k hinge loss tailored for top-k classification. It extends the multiclass SVM by employing the sum of the k largest components as a convex surrogate for the desired top-k loss. The authors present an efficient optimization algorithm and provide a thorough discussion of connections to prior work. The paper is well-written, and experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness compared to baseline approaches.
1. The authors did not include comparisons with [25, 8] due to the unavailability of implementations. However, I am particularly interested in seeing these comparisons.
2. Would the authors consider making the code publicly available upon acceptance?
  A well-crafted formulation of top-k multiclass SVM that performs effectively.
