Review-81: Consider providing a clearer explanation of current motion-based methods for readers who may not be familiar with them. - Is this the first work to use convolution for recurrent transitions in any context? If not, please clarify and cite prior work. - The term "conditional convolution" is misleading and inaccurate, as there is no actual conditioning involved; it is simply a convolution applied to the input from the previous time step. 180: Detailing the second hidden layer seems unnecessary and redundant.
3.2: Why is there an abrupt comparison to TRBM in an entire section? If TRBM is a significant related work, it should have been introduced earlier in the paper. This work proposes a novel sequence-based video super-resolution model. The model replaces the fully connected recurrent transition with a convolutional recurrent transition and incorporates an additional convolutional transition from the inputs of the previous time step. The authors achieve improved results with reduced computational cost. It is an interesting application paper in computer vision, with strong results, and I enjoyed reading it. However, I am uncertain about its relevance and impact within the NeurIPS community, as it might be more suitable for a computer vision-focused conference.
