Hidden variables in Bayesian networks and chain graphs introduce additional complexity to both parameter learning and inference. Mixed graphical models address this by incorporating bi-directed edges, which can eliminate hidden variables while maintaining the conditional independencies represented by the original DAG or chain graph. However, when latent projection is applied to remove hidden variables, the resulting mixed graphs may contain nodes where bi-directed and undirected edges meet, complicating the factorization of the model.
To address this issue, segregated graphs are introduced. These graphs preserve the conditional independencies among the non-latent random variables in the original DAG or chain graph, while ensuring that no nodes exist where undirected and bi-directed edges intersect.
Clarity: The introduction employs notations that are only defined later in the background section, making the paper harder to follow initially.
Significance: The significance of the work is difficult to assess in the absence of a practical real-world example and its corresponding evaluation.

Segregated graphs offer a method to preserve conditional independencies among non-latent random variables in Bayesian networks or chain graphs while eliminating latent variables and avoiding problematic intersections of undirected and bi-directed edges. While this approach has the potential for significant impact, its utility is not demonstrated through practical examples or experimental validation.
