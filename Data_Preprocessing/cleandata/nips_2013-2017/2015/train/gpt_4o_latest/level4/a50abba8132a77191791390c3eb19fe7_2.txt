- Techniques such as non-uniform sampling followed by importance sampling correction have been explored for quite some time, as demonstrated in [1], which reports a 3x speed-up. These earlier methods determined probabilities based on error rather than Li. Could you provide a discussion or practical comparison of such an approach? I suspect this could be beneficial in real-world scenarios where Li might not be readily available.
- Echoing Leon Bottou's philosophy: please elaborate on the limitations of your method and the scenarios in which it may not be applicable.
- An open-source code release accompanying the paper would be highly appreciated, as it would significantly enhance the paper's impact and usability.
- The experimental section and its figures are the weakest aspect of the paper and would benefit from a thorough revision. For instance, all plots should include error bars, specify the number of runs over which results were averaged, and have clearer labeling (e.g., clarify that SVRG corresponds to full batch in the top plots). The test-error plot lacks sufficient resolution for readabilityâ€”perhaps a log-scale would be more appropriate, even if it does not approach zero. Similar improvements are needed for the figures in the appendix. Additionally, I find it puzzling that there is no observable difference between uniform sampling and Lipschitz sampling in Experiment 3. A more challenging domain than logistic regression would also be welcome, though this could be explored in a follow-up paper.

Typos:
L19: a variant  
L53: increases over  
L77: expectation missing  
L96, L132: expectation symbol misformatted  
L164: B^s  
L289: can be used  
L316: superscript instead of subscript  
L325: sometimes  
L416: sometimes often?  
This is a strong and significant paper on variance-reduced gradient descent. It introduces several novel ideas, explains them clearly, and establishes convergence rates for all proposed variants. However, the experimental section remains the paper's primary weakness.
