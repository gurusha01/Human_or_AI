Overall, I found the paper to be quite interesting, though certain sections were somewhat challenging to follow. The authors have made a commendable effort in transitioning from the process interpretation to the generative model interpretation, while consistently emphasizing the primary objective of their proposed method. If this work is supported by more extensive experiments, I believe it has the potential to become an excellent contribution.
The authors have addressed my concerns regarding the experiments in their rebuttal, and I trust that these additional details will be incorporated into the final version. The paper introduces a Hybrid MCMC sampler for the Poisson-Kingman mixture model, which effectively combines the advantages of both conditional and marginal samplers. According to the authors, this approach reduces memory requirements while improving mixing performance.
My primary criticism pertains to the experimental evaluation presented in the paper. The authors have only demonstrated results on a uni-dimensional dataset, without providing experiments to assess the method's robustness to increasing dimensionality or dataset size. Additionally, there are no experiments quantifying the extent of memory reduction achieved, despite this being highlighted as a key motivation for adopting the proposed method. This limitation is the main reason I refrained from assigning a score of 7 to this paper. I encourage the authors to address these points in their response.
