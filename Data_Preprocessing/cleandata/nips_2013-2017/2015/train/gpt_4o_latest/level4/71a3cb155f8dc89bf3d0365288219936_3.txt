Summary: This paper investigates tensor graphical models with the goal of estimating sparse precision matrices under the assumption that the overall precision matrix follows a Kronecker product structure with sparse components. It establishes several desirable properties of the alternating minimization algorithm.
Quality: The paper builds on earlier works in the field by focusing on tensor data rather than matrix data, particularly those in [5, 6, 7, 8].
- The results hinge on a few key assumptions. The first is the irrepresentable condition, which is known to be quite restrictive. The second is condition (3.4). How can one construct an initial estimate that is sufficiently close to the truth as the dimensionality increases?
- Regarding the discussion after Theorem 3.5: Minimax-optimal results for the case where \( K = 2 \) have already been presented in [5, 8]. Therefore, the claim that this paper is the first to identify this phenomenon is not entirely accurate. In Remark 3.6, a more thorough comparison with [8] would be appropriate.
- Initial values for the precision matrices: It is unclear how or why the proposed initial values (or those obtained after iteration) would satisfy condition (3.4).
- The proposed method in equation (2.3) is fairly standard. Similarly, the iterative algorithm employed is widely used, and the theoretical results appear to follow standard approaches.
Clarity: The paper is well-written and clear.
Originality: The paper contributes to the literature by extending matrix graphical models to tensor graphical models, as seen in [9]. However, it is known that the rate in [9] is suboptimal when compared to [8]. This paper can be viewed as refining the results in [9] by employing techniques distinct from those in [8].
Significance: The paper's contribution is incremental at best.
The authors have made a commendable effort to address an interesting problem, but the assumptions appear to be problematic. In particular, the algorithm shares similarities with that in [8]. A key question remains: how can one identify initial values that satisfy condition (3.4) as the dimensionality grows?
