This paper introduces "hierarchy width," a novel graph property designed to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs.
The reviewer raises concerns about the observation that the hierarchy width of a graph is always greater than its hypertree width.
Intuitively, polynomial-time exact inference appears to be more challenging than achieving polynomial mixing time in sampling.
However, this result is counterintuitive.
Why is sampling more difficult than exact inference? This question arises as part of my lighter review of the paper. The authors propose the new graph property "hierarchy width," which serves to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor models. The theoretical contributions of this work appear significant for advancing our understanding of Gibbs sampling behavior on factor graphs.
