This paper introduces a CNN-CRF framework for structured prediction by explicitly learning CNN-based message passing for inference. I have several concerns, as outlined below:
(1) Including a schematic diagram could clarify the overall methodology. Currently, the specific roles of the proposed components remain ambiguous. Additionally, the equations should be presented in a more intuitive manner.
(2) The applicability of the proposed method appears to be fairly restricted, as it only accommodates a very limited number of neighborhood connections and involves numerous approximations. The algorithm lacks sufficient elegance and simplicity.
(3) The experimental evaluation is confined to the VOC dataset. Given that this is a NIPS submission, validation on other widely-used datasets for structured labeling, such as OCR and POS tagging, is necessary to strengthen the justification.
In summary, the proposed method is somewhat complex, making it difficult to discern its precise advantages. While the general approach of addressing the structured prediction problem by learning message passing within a CNN-based CRF model is promising, and improved results on the PASCAL VOC image labeling dataset are demonstrated, the method's scope remains limited, and the solution feels somewhat intermediate.
