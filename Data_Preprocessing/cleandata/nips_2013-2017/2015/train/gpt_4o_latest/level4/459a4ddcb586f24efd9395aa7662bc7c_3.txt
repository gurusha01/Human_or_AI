The paper introduces a novel sampler for mixture models constructed on homogeneous completely random measures. This sampler combines features from two established classes of samplers, preserving the advantages of both: the faster mixing times characteristic of conditional samplers and the ability of marginal samplers to represent an infinite object exactly using finite memory. Leveraging results from Pitman's work on Poisson-Kingman partitions and size-biased sampling, the authors derive a Gibbs sampling framework tailored to Poisson-Kingman mixture models. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed sampler outperforms existing conditional and marginal samplers in terms of runtime efficiency and effective sample size.
Mixture models based on normalized completely random measures have garnered significant attention in the Bayesian non-parametrics literature in recent years, and the sampler introduced in this work is a valuable contribution to the field. The central technical innovation lies in representing the "surplus mass" as a variable within the sampler and deriving its full conditional distribution using Pitman's results on the joint distribution of CRM weights and total mass. The paper is clearly written, with a well-structured exposition, and the proposed method is both efficient and impactful. This work offers a practical and important tool for researchers in the Bayesian non-parametrics community, addressing a class of models that has seen growing interest in recent years.
