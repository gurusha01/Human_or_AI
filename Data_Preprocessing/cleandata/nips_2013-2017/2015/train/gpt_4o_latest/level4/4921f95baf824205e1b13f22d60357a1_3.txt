Spectral clustering is a widely used method for link prediction, but it becomes computationally expensive for large-scale graphs. A common heuristic to address this is leveraging common neighbors, which is both efficient and performs well in practice. This paper establishes the consistency of the common neighbor heuristic across various graph classes. Additionally, the authors introduce a cleaning step to enhance performance on sparse graphs. The proposed approach is evaluated empirically using both simulated and real-world datasets.
The problem addressed in this paper is highly relevant, and the theoretical analysis appears mathematically rigorous. However, the practical implications remain ambiguous due to limitations in the experimental evaluation, which does not fully explore the strengths and weaknesses of the method:  
- The proposed algorithm relies on several unknown parameters. The authors do not adequately explain the importance of cluster link probabilities or cluster sizes. It is unclear how the algorithm performs when these parameters are not optimally selected.  
- For semi-sparse graphs, the authors recommend a cleaning step, and Figure 1 demonstrates its positive impact on recall and precision. However, since sparsity is difficult to assess in practice, it is crucial to examine how the cleaning step affects performance when applied inappropriately.  
- The assumption of equal cluster sizes (\(\pi = n/K\)) seems restrictive. While the authors suggest this assumption can be relaxed, they do not provide insight into how such a relaxation would affect their analysis. Presumably, relaxing this assumption would introduce additional unknown parameters, necessitating the assumption regardless. An experiment demonstrating the algorithm's performance with skewed cluster sizes would be valuable.
Sections 3 and 4 are particularly unclear, lacking a coherent structure and mixing concepts without clearly explaining their relationships or relevance. For instance:  
- The formulas in lines 182â€“187 are disconnected from the surrounding text.  
- The relationship between sections such as "current approaches," "common neighbors," and "dependence" is not well-articulated, leaving their purpose and connections unclear.
Minor issues:  
- Line 97 appears to be a copy-paste error (see Line 126).  
- Line 163: Replace "eigenvectors of the graph" with "eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix."  
- Expand abbreviations such as "w.h.p." (Line 23) and "WLOG" (Line 222).  
- Line 214: Replace "when average degree" with "when the average degree."
After rebuttal:  
Thank you for addressing my concerns regarding the algorithm's parameters, the conditions for applying the cleaning step, and the number of clusters. However, I still find Sections 3 and 4 confusing. I have adjusted my score accordingly and encourage the authors to improve the structure and clarify these sections in the paper.  
Strengths:  
+ Solid theoretical analysis of a popular approach.  
Weaknesses:  
- Presentation requires significant improvement.  
- Experiments do not fully explore the method's strengths and weaknesses.  
- Practical relevance remains uncertain.
