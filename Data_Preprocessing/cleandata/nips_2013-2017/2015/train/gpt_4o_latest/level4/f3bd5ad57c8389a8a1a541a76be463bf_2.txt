This paper introduces a novel variation of the EP algorithm, where a global approximation of the target is iteratively refined rather than updating individual approximating factors. This approach reduces memory usage and demonstrates strong experimental performance when compared to standard EP.
This is an elegant and practical idea.
Quality: solid work with a compelling concept.
Clarity: generally clear, though there are a few typos that need correction.
Originality: to the best of my knowledge, the approach is original.
Significance: the proposed algorithm is valuable and has the potential for numerous applications.
Minor comments:
- EP does not guarantee convergence; have the authors encountered similar convergence issues with SEP?
- In the Gaussian mixture clustering example, the posterior distribution has 4! modes. Does the SEP approximation capture this property? (I am uncertain about the interpretation of Figure 4.) 
Overall, the paper proposes a simple yet intriguing variation of EP.
