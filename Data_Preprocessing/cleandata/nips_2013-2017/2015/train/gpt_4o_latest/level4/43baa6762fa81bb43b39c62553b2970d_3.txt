This paper addresses the Robust PCA problem ("low-rank plus sparse") in a setting where the leverage scores (or local incoherence) of the low-rank matrix and the non-zero probabilities of the sparse matrix are allowed to vary across entries. The authors provide sufficient conditions for exact recovery, expressed through local relationships between the leverage scores and error probabilities.
The work aligns with prior research on matrix completion under a similar non-uniform framework. The analysis leverages techniques such as golfing schemes and weighted norms, which have been established in earlier studies.
My primary concern lies in the lack of clarity regarding practical applications of the proposed results. Specifically, it is unclear under what circumstances the error probabilities and leverage scores would naturally align in a way that satisfies the paper's conditions. Unlike matrix completion, where observation probabilities can sometimes be controlled, the error probabilities in this setting appear less tractable. A more detailed discussion of potential scenarios would be beneficial.
The clustering problem mentioned in the paper could serve as a viable application. Since local incoherence is tied to cluster sizes, it might be the case that larger clusters are permitted to have higher error probabilities. Including a corollary that explicitly addresses this problem would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
Additional comments:
1) It would be valuable to formally detail the elimination/derandomization arguments for the non-uniform setting considered in this work.
2) The results involve both \(\mu0\) and \(\mu1\). It would be helpful to explicitly identify the parts of the proof where \(\mu_1\) plays a critical role.
This paper extends prior work on matrix completion to a non-uniform local incoherence framework. The theoretical contributions appear sound, and the proofs build on established techniques. However, the authors are encouraged to provide stronger motivation for the problem setting and to elaborate on potential applications.
