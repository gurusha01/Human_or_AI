Summary: This paper introduces a stochastic generalization of expectation propagation (EP). In traditional EP, local contributions are removed and updated for each data point, which requires storing sufficient statistics for every data pointâ€”a process that becomes computationally expensive for models with numerous parameters. The authors propose an alternative approach where, instead of removing the sufficient statistics for individual data points, they remove the global sufficient statistic scaled by the sample size being updated. The method is further extended to other EP variants, such as parallel EP and distributed EP, to handle heterogeneous datasets, as well as to models with latent variables. The proposed approach is evaluated on probit regression, Gaussian mixture models, and Bayesian neural networks. The experiments demonstrate that the method achieves computational efficiency without compromising performance.
Quality: The proposed method is well-founded, thoughtfully motivated, and validated through experiments across three distinct yet representative application domains.
Clarity: The paper is highly readable, with an excellent writing style that ensures clarity throughout.
Originality: The central idea of the paper is simple yet ingenious, offering an elegant solution to the memory overhead challenge in EP. The paper also introduces novel extensions of stochastic EP, including its application to parallel processing, mini-batch updates for improved approximations, and models with latent variables. To the best of my knowledge, both the proposed approach and its extensions are entirely original.
Significance: The contributions of this work are substantial, as they present scalable alternatives to EP. I anticipate that this paper will have a similar impact on EP as stochastic variational inference (SVI) had on variational Bayes (VB). The paper is exceptionally well-motivated, clearly written, and makes significant advancements in scaling EP inference for complex, high-parameter models. The extensions and connections to existing EP and VB methodologies are thoroughly explored, resulting in a comprehensive and mature piece of research.
