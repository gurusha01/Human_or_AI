The authors present an analysis of the Robust PCA problem under the assumption that the sparse corruption follows a non-uniform Bernoulli distribution. The paper demonstrates that in such a non-uniform setting, successful recovery with high probability depends on the local incoherence property of the low-rank matrix. Specifically, matrix entries that exhibit local incoherence are shown to tolerate higher levels of corruption.
The analysis leverages certain established techniques in the literature, such as the golfing scheme. The results are derived for both the random sign and fixed sign settings, offering additional insights into the robust PCA problem.
However, there are some concerns that, if addressed, could enhance the clarity and impact of the contribution. First, there has been significant progress in the domain of convex demixing [1], which provides general geometric conditions for recovery of the form \( S + L \). These developments are notably broader in scope. It would be beneficial to explicitly contrast the specific results of this work with the broader context of this existing body of literature. Additionally, while the local incoherence condition is an intriguing concept, it does not appear to be practically testable for a given problem. This raises questions about how the condition can be applied in practice.
The paper's analysis is grounded in the use of weighted norms, which is an interesting approach. However, several conclusions related to this norm appear to already exist in reference [9]. It is important to clearly delineate what is novel in this work versus what is already known, and to emphasize the advantages of using this norm for the specific problem under consideration. Without this distinction, the contributions risk being perceived as incremental.
The implications for cluster matrices are intriguing, and the experimental results are satisfactory. It might be worthwhile to explore robust PCA after centering, as this could yield qualitatively different insights.
Additional Comments:
Pros:
- The paper is clearly written.
- It includes a substantial number of experiments.
Cons:
- The results are not adequately contextualized within the existing related literature.
- The work draws heavily from prior results, which may make the contributions appear incremental.
