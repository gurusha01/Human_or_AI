This paper introduces novel Gossip algorithms for the computation of U-statistics. The proposed methods exhibit a faster convergence rate compared to the state-of-the-art U2-Gossip algorithm (Pelckmans, Suykens '09) and are designed to operate effectively in more practical asynchronous settings. The experimental results further highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithms over existing approaches.
The manuscript is well-written, the problem is clearly motivated, and the authors have positioned their work appropriately within the context of existing literature. The proposed algorithms appear to be both novel and superior in terms of convergence speed and resource efficiency (memory and communication) when compared to U2-Gossip. Additionally, the algorithms are applicable to asynchronous scenarios.
In addition to providing theoretical guarantees and analysis, the authors have conducted extensive empirical evaluations on two datasets, benchmarking their methods against established baselines. These experiments further reinforce the contributions of this work. Overall, this paper presents innovative Gossip algorithms for U-statistics computation, offering faster convergence and applicability to asynchronous settings, supported by thorough experimental validation against state-of-the-art methods.
