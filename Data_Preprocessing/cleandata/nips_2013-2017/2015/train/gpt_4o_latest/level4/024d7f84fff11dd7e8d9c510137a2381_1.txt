The paper introduces a novel formula for the class of static coherent risks, enabling the analytical derivation of policy gradients for several common risk measures. Additionally, it proposes a general sampling-based algorithm for scenarios where analytical solutions are unavailable and establishes consistency guarantees for the estimated policy gradients. Finally, the paper derives expressions for policy gradients of Markov coherent dynamic risk measures.
Significance and quality:
The unified derivation of policy gradients for coherent risk measures is both intriguing and a significant contribution to the literature on risk-sensitive decision-making. However, analytical solutions for the Lagrangian saddle-points are only provided for a subset of risk measures.
The proposed sampling-based approximation framework has the potential to extend the applicability of the derived results to general coherent risk measures by circumventing the need for analytical saddle-point solutions. That said, the paper lacks empirical validation to demonstrate the practical utility of this estimation scheme. An experimental comparison between the sample-based policy gradients and their analytical counterparts across various problems, such as CVaR, would significantly strengthen the paper.
Originality: To the best of my knowledge, the derived policy gradients, presented in this general form, are novel.
Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, its clarity is undermined by the breadth of topics it attempts to address within the eight-page limit. In particular, the discussion of dynamic risk policy gradients in Section 5 is presented at a high level, and the absence of algorithmic details and experimental evaluations makes it difficult for readers to assess the practical viability of the derived policy gradients. This content might be better suited for a longer journal article. Alternatively, narrowing the scope to focus on static risk measures could enhance the paper's clarity, allowing for more detailed explanations and a more thorough empirical evaluation beyond the basic toy example currently included. Overall, the paper presents interesting and potentially impactful results, but the lack of comprehensive experimental validation makes it challenging to fully assess its contributions. A more focused approach could also address the clarity issues arising from space constraints.
