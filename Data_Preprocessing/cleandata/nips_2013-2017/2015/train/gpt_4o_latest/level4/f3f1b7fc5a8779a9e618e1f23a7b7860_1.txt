The paper addresses high-dimensional sparse and group sparse estimation using l1/l1-l2 regularized least squares estimation. Unlike the conventional setting that assumes Gaussian measurements and noise, the authors consider isotropic sub-exponential measurements and i.i.d. sub-exponential noise. The primary contribution of the paper is demonstrating that the error and sample complexity bounds remain essentially comparable to those in the standard Gaussian setting, apart from an additional logarithmic factor. The results are derived using advanced tools from empirical process theory.
In this analysis, the additional logarithmic factor emerges from the shift from Gaussian width (standard setting) to exponential width. Overall, the findings represent a meaningful extension of prior work, such as those by Negahban et al. [18], Rudelson & Zhou [20], and others.
Quality/Clarity: The paper is technically sound, well-written, and well-structured.
Originality/Significance: While the paper explores a well-studied area, its contribution is significant for specialists in the field, though it may appear less impactful to a broader audience. Additionally, the novelty of the techniques is somewhat unclear, given the body of related work on compressed sensing with heavy-tailed measurements.
Specific comments/questions:  
- The authors focus exclusively on isotropic measurements, whereas the non-isotropic sub-Gaussian case has already been addressed in Rudelson and Zhou [20]. It would be helpful if the authors could discuss the potential extension of their results to non-isotropic settings.  
- Gaussian-width-based analysis is extensively covered in Vershynin's tutorial on high-dimensional estimation. Citing that work would enhance the context of the analysis.  
- The experimental section is underwhelming, as it lacks a comparison between sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential measurements. Including such a comparison would provide a clearer evaluation of the sharpness of the authors' main results.  
Overall, this is a valuable contribution for researchers interested in the theory of compressed sensing and high-dimensional statistics.
