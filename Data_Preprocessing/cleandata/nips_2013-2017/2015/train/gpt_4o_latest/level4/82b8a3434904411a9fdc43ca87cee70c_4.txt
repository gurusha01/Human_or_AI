A common objective in machine learning is determining the optimal regularization parameter for a model, which is typically achieved through cross-validation. The primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel method to analytically compute bounds on the validation error. Specifically, the approach involves first deriving lower and upper bounds for wxi (where w represents the model parameter) for each validation instance xi, expressed as a function of the regularization parameter and based on a solution obtained for a different regularization parameter. These instance-specific bounds are then aggregated to produce bounds on the overall validation error. A key result in the paper is Lemma 1, which outlines the procedure for computing the bounds for wx_i. While the proof of this lemma is not included in the main text, it is provided in the Appendix. Including an intuitive explanation of this core result in the main text would greatly enhance the reader's ability to grasp the underlying idea without needing to consult the Appendix, even though omitting the full proof from the main body is reasonable. The proof itself (found in the Appendix) appears to rely heavily on the convexity of the regularized loss function, which, while more general than prior methods, limits the broader applicability of the approach. Additionally, the method assumes an L2 prior on the model parameters and is restricted to tuning a single hyperparameter. The results presented in the paper seem correct, though I did not verify the proofs in detail. The writing is clear overall (with the exception of the aforementioned remark). The experiments demonstrate that the regularization parameter can be optimized efficiently by leveraging a reasonably tight error bound, provided such a bound is available. The topic is relevant to the NIPS community, and the results are intriguing, though they may be too narrowly focused to attract widespread interest. In summary, the paper introduces analytical bounds for cross-validation error and illustrates how these bounds can be utilized to efficiently optimize model parameters.
