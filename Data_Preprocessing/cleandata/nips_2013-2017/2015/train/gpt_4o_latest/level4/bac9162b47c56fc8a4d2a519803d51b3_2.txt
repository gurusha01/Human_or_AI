The authors utilize LSTM recurrent neural networks to model student learning in online courses.
The results outperform several prior baselines.
The manuscript is well-written and evaluates the approach on an impressive dataset comprising 47,000 students solving problems on Khan Academy. The results demonstrate a notable improvement over the compared baselines. Overall, the paper is well-articulated and presents strong performance outcomes. It is clearly an applications-focused work that showcases the use of LSTMs on a large-scale dataset to achieve excellent results.
