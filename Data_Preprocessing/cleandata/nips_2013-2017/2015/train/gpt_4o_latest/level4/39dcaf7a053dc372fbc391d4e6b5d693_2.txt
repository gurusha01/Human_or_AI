The paper introduces a novel approach that combines a ConvNet with 2D filters and a ConvNet with 3D filters to enhance the quality of neural boundary predictions. The authors justify their architectural design by highlighting the anisotropy (x-y vs. z) inherent in sequential EM scans commonly used in Neuroscience. Their method demonstrates a clear improvement over prior approaches (which relied solely on 2D filters) for this task, which is highly relevant to their application domain.
While the proposed method is promising, the quality of the presentation could be significantly improved, and the exposition made more concise. The approach builds on previously established techniques, such as the composition of networks and the use of 3D filters for 3D datasets.
However, the paper has notable shortcomings. The authors frequently reference their implementation, ZNN, which is described as critical for achieving efficiency given the network size and data volume. Unfortunately, no reference or sufficient implementation details are provided, making it difficult to reproduce the results. I recommend including a concise description of the essential aspects of the implementation and clarifying whether the software will be made publicly available. Without this, the paper relies heavily on general design principles underlying ZNN, which are insufficiently detailed. Additionally, figure captions lack critical information, making it challenging to interpret the results.
Specific issues include:  
- l80: No reference is provided for ZNN. It is unclear whether ZNN refers to an algorithm or a specific implementation.  
- l177: The explanation of the Rand index is inadequate. While a reference is provided, the paper should be self-contained. Please include the necessary formula for clarity.  
- Section 3: This section does not provide sufficient detail to understand the paper. ZNN is not described in enough depth to enable reproduction of the results. I suggest either adding precise details or referencing a resource where these details can be found.  
- Figure 3: The color code is not explained.  
- l393: Inconsistent terminologyâ€”terms like "net1" and "net2" are not used elsewhere in the paper. Please ensure consistency throughout.  
- l396: The term "recursive" appears to be a misnomer, as the same network is not recursively applied. Instead, the method involves a composition of vd2d and vd2d3d networks, which share initial layers. Clarify whether the vd2d component is identical or independently refined after initial training.
In summary, while the paper addresses a relevant and applied problem, the presentation requires significant improvement.
