This paper introduces and validates (in terms of correctness and performance via simulation) a practical adaptation of HMC tailored for probability density functions (pdfs) with discontinuities or those defined on a bounded domain.
The approach leverages the simulation of refraction and reflection effects arising from Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling improved proposal generation near discontinuities (resulting in higher acceptance rates and, consequently, increased effective sample size).
One potential enhancement would be the inclusion of an example where computing intersections is not advantageous.
Additionally, what categories of high-dimensional pdfs would this method be less effective for?
