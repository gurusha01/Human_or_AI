This paper introduces a novel object proposal approach that leverages depth data (obtained from stereo) to generate bounding boxes for detecting objects such as pedestrians, cars, and cyclists in self-driving car applications. The method extracts a point cloud from stereo image pairs and defines a scoring function based on specific features computed from the point cloud. The scoring function's weights are object-specific and are learned using a structured SVM framework. During inference, the scoring function is evaluated across all potential windows that align with the prior assumption (i.e., being on the road). Subsequently, an RCNN is employed to score the proposed bounding boxes and finalize object detection.
The approach is evaluated on the KITTI dataset for three object categories (pedestrian, car, and cyclist), achieving strong results compared to reasonable baselines.
This is an intriguing idea, and given the computer vision community's interest in advancing object detection for self-driving cars, it should appeal to the conference audience.
The results are impressive.
Typically, object proposal algorithms are category-agnostic, with object detection algorithms later identifying objects by evaluating all proposals. However, in this work, the scoring function's weights are category-specific, which suggests that this method might be better characterized as an object detection algorithm with high recall rather than a traditional object proposal method. Since the scoring function does not rank the detected boxes effectively, an RCNN is used to re-rank the detections and improve average precision. It would be helpful to clarify this distinction in the paper. Additionally, there are several existing 3D object detection algorithms that could serve as baselines for comparison. For example, [24] employs RGBD data for object detection.
While the results are impressive, the technical novelty appears somewhat limited, as the method primarily introduces depth-based features, performs exhaustive search during inference, and utilizes a structured SVM for learning. This is acceptable, but evaluating the method on at least one additional dataset would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed features across datasets.
In summary, the strong results on the KITTI dataset for pedestrian, car, and cyclist detection are the main strength of this paper. However, the technical novelty is somewhat constrained.
