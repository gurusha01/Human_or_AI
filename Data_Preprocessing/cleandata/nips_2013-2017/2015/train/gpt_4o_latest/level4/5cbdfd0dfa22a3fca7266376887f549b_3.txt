Review - Paraphrased Version:
Summary: The paper begins by assuming that an observable tensor can be decomposed into two additive components: a low-rank tensor that is not sparse and a sparse corruption tensor that is not low-rank. Subsequently, the authors propose an extension of Leurgans' Algorithm, which involves solving a convex optimization problem based on the stated model assumptions. This extension is advantageous due to its simplicity and reduced computational complexity. Theoretical proofs are provided to demonstrate that both tensor components can be accurately recovered under specific conditions.
Quality: The paper is well-organized, and the central idea is clearly presented and effectively motivated. The theoretical proofs are compelling and contribute to a better understanding of the approach. However, the manuscript contains several minor typographical errors.
Clarity: Overall, the primary concept and its motivation are easy to follow. The authors have made commendable efforts to derive and elucidate the constraints of their proposed method.
Originality: While the algorithm heavily relies on Leurgans' method, its integration with convex optimization represents a potentially novel approach to addressing the stated assumptions.
Significance: The model effectively captures the decomposition of an observable tensor into low-rank and sparse components. However, the proposed algorithm has limitations that could affect its applicability and overall significance. In particular, the final conclusion (Corollary 3.7) assumes uniform dimensions without providing sufficient justification. The paper presents an intriguing extension of Leurgans' Algorithm, with the main ideas and results clearly articulated. Nonetheless, the lack of experiments on real-world data leaves open questions about the practical applicability of the model, especially in light of the identified constraints.
