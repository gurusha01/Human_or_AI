This paper introduces a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network for multi-frame super-resolution. The problem is formulated in a manner that, while straightforward and intuitive for those familiar with RNNs, is also sensible and well-motivated. The approach appears to be novel. The work by Dong et al. (ECCV 2014) on deep convolutional networks for image super-resolution is identified as the most relevant prior work, though it was limited to static frames. This paper represents a natural progression in the broader trajectory of applying deep convolutional networks to super-resolution tasks. Combined with the fact that the paper provides a reasonably strong evaluation, I find it acceptable for NIPS.
One of the most compelling aspects of this work is the analysis in Table 2, which evaluates the contributions of feedforward convolutions, recurrent convolutions, and conditional convolutions.
The discussion about MATLAB vs. Python as an explanation for runtime differences seems tangential compared to the more critical issue of GPU acceleration. State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks are almost universally implemented on GPUs. The paper mentions on line 362 that the proposed approach is implemented in Python, but it does not clarify whether GPU acceleration was utilized. 
This is an important point that needs to be addressed. If GPUs were not used, the method could potentially achieve significant speedups. Conversely, if GPUs were employed, comparisons with prior methods should explicitly account for this, as many earlier approaches could also benefit from GPU acceleration. Accurate motion estimation, often cited as a bottleneck in non-RNN-based methods, could also be significantly accelerated with GPU-based implementations.
Language Issues:
Abstract:
- "Considering that recurrent neural network[s] (RNNs) can..."
- "Different from vanilla RNN[s]..."
- "Conditional convolutional connections from previous input layers to [the] current hidden layer are added for enhancing visual-temporal dependency mod[el]."
The body text should be proofread for additional language issues.
Conclusions:
- "In the future, we will [perform] comparison[s] with [other] multi-frame SR methods."
This paper delivers strong quantitative results alongside clear visual evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the bidirectional recurrent convolutional network for multi-frame super-resolution. While the paper contains some language issues that the authors must address for it to be acceptable, the proposed model is well-conceived, and the results effectively balance quantitative improvements, visual quality enhancements, and competitive computation times compared to prior work.
