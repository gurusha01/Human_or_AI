This paper focuses on the computation of higher-order statistics derived from pairs of observations, where the observations themselves are distributed across a network of nodes. These U-statistics encompass a range of quantities of interest, including sample variance, correlation and scatter coefficients, and other aggregate measures. The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of a gossip-style decentralized aggregation/averaging algorithm to compute these statistics.
Overall, this is a valuable addition to the body of work on gossip algorithms. However, the authors should improve the connection to existing methods and prior research in this domain.
This is a detailed review, but I did not have sufficient time to verify the correctness of the supplementary material.
Comments
1) The key innovation in the proposed algorithm lies in the fact that when two nodes exchange and average their estimate values, they also swap a secondary state variable that represents their initial observation. This effectively causes the initial observations to perform a random walk (albeit a coupled one). Highlighting this more explicitly in the main manuscript would enhance clarity and also provide better motivation for the analysis approach involving multiple copies of the graph.
2) There is a substantial body of prior work on gossip algorithms for computing statistics that extends beyond the references currently cited. For example, the Dimakis et al. Proc. IEEE paper provides a comprehensive snapshot of the state of the art from a few years ago. Situating the current work in the context of the approaches discussed in that paper would be more informative than the relatively brief discussion provided in the manuscript.
3) On page 4, the authors should clarify the induced edge distribution resulting from the "node wakes up, contacts neighbor" process. The phrase "drawing a random edge of the network" is ambiguous and does not specify the exact distribution being used.
4) An alternative approach to the problem could involve allowing each node to use additional memory. In this approach, nodes could use the same contact process to flood their own value across the network, storing received observations tagged with the originating node. At each step, nodes could compute the U-statistic on the subset of data they possess. How would this approach compare to the proposed method? Such a comparison could help illustrate the advantages of the averaging process or quantify the trade-offs when node memory is constrained. Without this comparison, it is unclear whether the rate of 1/t is particularly good or suboptimal. For example, on expander graphs, the flooding method might perform quite well.
5) The authors should consider examining prior work on lifting constructions for accelerating gossip algorithms, as these appear to be closely related to their approach. Relevant references include:

6) Analyses of gossip algorithms typically make worst-case assumptions about the initial data distribution, providing guarantees over all possible initial data vectors $X$. This aspect is not clearly stated in the problem formulation or the theorem statement. The authors should clarify the assumptions on the data distribution and specify the guarantees on the error as a function of the initial data.
Minor Comments
- p1: The bipartite definition using (S \times T) \cup (T \times S) implies directed graphs.  
- p4: "let us stress out that" → "we stress that"  
- p4: "awakes and contact" → "awakes and contacts"  
- p6: "requires to initiate" → "requires initiating"  
- p7: "allows to create" → "allows us to create"
AFTER AUTHOR FEEDBACK
The clarifications and revisions provided by the authors address several of the concerns raised in this review. I am revising my initial score of 7 to an 8.
That said, the authors should still carefully examine the lifting constructions (particularly LADA) and incorporate these into the related work discussion.
Additionally, the experimental results should include baseline comparisons to alternative methods.
In summary, this paper presents a well-structured and promising approach to extending gossip algorithms for the computation of more complex statistics in distributed systems such as sensor networks. While the mathematical formulation and connections to prior work could be made clearer, assuming the authors address the comments raised in this review, I recommend accepting the paper.
