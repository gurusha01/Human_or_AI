The authors conduct a theoretical analysis on achieving faster convergence in multi-player normal-form games by extending techniques originally developed for two-player zero-sum games. Additionally, they provide an empirical evaluation using the 4-bidder simultaneous auction game.
The paper is well-written and presents strong theoretical and empirical contributions. My only suggestion is to consider evaluating performance with varying values of n and m (i.e., not restricting the analysis to 4-bidders) to better illustrate the behavior of Hedge and Optimistic Hedge. Overall, the paper demonstrates robust theoretical findings alongside compelling experimental results in the context of the 4-bidder simultaneous auction game.
