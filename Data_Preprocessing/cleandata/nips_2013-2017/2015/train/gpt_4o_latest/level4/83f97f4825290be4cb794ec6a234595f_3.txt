Overall, I found the paper to be well-executed and engaging. It tackles an important problem and strikes a good balance between theoretical contributions and empirical validation. Below are some comments:
1) The authors should acknowledge that the problem they address is a specific instance of submodular load balancing, as previously studied in 'Submodular approximation: sampling-based algorithms and lower bounds' by Svitkina and Fleischer.
2) The result concerning arbitrary partitions (Proposition 2) is already known for general submodular functions (refer to the aforementioned work for details).
3) Another relevant paper to consider is 'Graph Partitioning via Parallel Submodular Approximation to Accelerate Distributed Machine Learning' by Mu Li et al. This work examines the Min-Max hypergraph partitioning problem in a streaming context, identifying it as a special case of min-max submodular data partitioning, also referred to as the submodular load balancing problem. The paper provides theoretical insights and validates the proposed algorithm on real-world datasets.
