This study focuses on predicting links in graphs using a heuristic approach based on common neighbors. The goal is to develop a fast method that relies on counting common neighbors, a task that can be efficiently performed by many information systems.
While the proposed method is heuristic in nature, its performance on real-world datasets is comparable to that of established benchmark algorithms.
The main manuscript does not function entirely as a standalone document, as understanding the proof sketches for Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 requires referencing certain definitions provided in the supplementary material (e.g., the definition of GOOD).
On page 2, there is a segment of text that appears to require revision: "connect with probability $\gamma$. network has recently."
On page 4, the notation "CN(i,j) = {u | i ~ u ~ v}" seems to contain an error. Specifically, the "v" should likely be replaced with "j."
Although I am not an expert in this specific area, the work appears to be potentially valuable due to its speed advantages and includes rigorous results regarding the applicability of the proposed link prediction heuristic. However, some parts of the manuscript are not entirely self-contained and require consultation of the supplementary material.
