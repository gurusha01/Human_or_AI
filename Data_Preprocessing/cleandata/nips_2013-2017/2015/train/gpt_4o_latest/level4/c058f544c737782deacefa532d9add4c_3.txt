While I recognize that the primary focus of the paper is theoretical, the experimental section is relatively underdeveloped. Beyond demonstrating the enhanced performance of the various Frank-Wolfe variants analyzed, it would be highly beneficial to provide insights into the practical scenarios where these variants outperform other methods, particularly for problems where alternative approaches, such as l1-regularized regression in its unconstrained form, are commonly applicable.
This is a commendable paper that offers theoretical justification for several enhancements to the Frank-Wolfe algorithm family. Some of these enhancements have been empirically shown to significantly accelerate convergence but previously lacked rigorous theoretical backing. The paper appears to be well-structured and robust, aside from a few minor errors that the authors can likely address with careful proofreading.
