Review - Summary:
Topological data analysis is a field that investigates the geometric "shape" of data sets using techniques from algebraic topology. A particularly valuable tool in this domain is persistent homology, along with persistence diagrams, which serve as a "topological summary" of the data's shape. However, performing statistical analyses on persistence diagrams is computationally challenging and complex. One way to address this challenge is by embedding probability measures on the space of persistence diagrams into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Hilbert spaces are well-structured and offer a wealth of established methods that simplify computations significantly. This embedding is feasible if the associated kernel is "universal," achieved via the so-called "mean map." The paper demonstrates that a slight modification of the recently introduced "PSS kernel," referred to as the "u-PSS kernel," possesses the property of universality with respect to the 1-Wasserstein metric [Proposition 2]. For instance, this allows one to test whether two distinct samples exhibit significantly different homological features without directly computing persistence diagrams, reducing the problem to evaluating the corresponding kernel.
Major Negative Points:
- The paper is generally difficult to follow for readers who lack a strong background in algebraic topology or functional analysis. Despite the inclusion of a background section, several advanced concepts and results in functional analysis are assumed to be familiar and are not explained in sufficient detail.  
- Many important definitions, arguments from prior works, and calculations are presented in a sketchy manner or are entirely omitted.  
- The core argument of the paper is not presented in a clear, chronological, "start-to-finish" manner. Instead, the key components of the argument are scattered throughout the paper, interspersed with secondary information, which makes the overall structure confusing at times.  
- The main contribution of the paper is the proof of Proposition 2, which essentially reduces to showing that \((\mathcal{S}, d_{W,1})\) is a compact metric space, as established by Theorem 1. In my view, this contribution is not particularly significant, as it primarily involves assembling existing definitions and results from prior work without introducing substantial novelty.
Positive Points:
- Topological data analysis is a relatively new and exciting field with numerous promising applications, and the result presented in the paper appears to be of interest. Algebraic topology is a powerful tool, but its adoption is often hindered by computational challenges. A result that facilitates implementations with reduced computational complexity could have broad and impactful implications.  
- The experiments and implementations effectively showcase the generality of the theoretical result and highlight the diversity of its potential applications.
Final Conclusion: 5/10 (Weak Rejection)  
The paper lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical depth, and the writing could be significantly improved.
