The paper introduces a generalized approach to training neural networks with numerous stacked layers. The concept of information highways is effectively demonstrated through experimentation. Additionally, the authors have shown that this method can enhance classification accuracy.
Quality: The idea appears novel, and the experimental results are robust. However, the analysis sections could benefit from a greater variety of details or additional illustrations.
Clarity: The paper's main messages are conveyed effectively and are easy to understand.
Originality: While the proposed method builds on existing neural network techniques, it is sufficiently original in its generalization.
Significance: The work is significant to the field, as it addresses the challenge of training increasingly deeper neural networks to achieve improved performance in various application domains.
The paper presents an effective approach for training very deep neural networks by employing "information highways," which establish direct connections to higher network layers. Although this method extends prior techniques, such as cross-layer connections, the authors provide strong experimental evidence to demonstrate its efficacy. The contributions are both innovative and well-supported by the results.
