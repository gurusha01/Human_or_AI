The authors have provided a thorough explanation of the relevant literature on online preference-based mechanisms. They address both PAC-item and AMPR preference-based approximations as objectives within the context of the dueling bandit ranker problem. Their approach builds on the observation that the pairwise comparisons performed by the QuickSort algorithm in a stochastic setting are derived from the pairwise marginals of the Plackett-Luce model. The proposed Budgeted QuickSort-based algorithm is conceptually straightforward; however, I remain somewhat unconvinced of its novelty. The elimination strategy employed for both the PAC and AMPR problems appears intuitiveâ€”removing an item that is significantly outperformed by another. For the AMPR problem, the authors estimate the Copeland score for each item. A notable contribution of the paper is the derivation of sample complexity bounds for both PAC and AMPR. The synthetic data results are largely consistent with the bounds established in the theoretical analysis. However, it is worth noting that the assumption of a Condorcet winner is overly restrictive, which "forces" the authors to focus on the Plackett-Luce model, where such a winner is guaranteed to exist.
The primary contribution of this work lies in leveraging a budgeted version of QuickSort to construct surrogate probability distributions over rankings. By exploiting the fact that the pairwise marginals generated by QuickSort align with those of the Plackett-Luce model, the authors effectively utilize the transitivity properties inherent to Plackett-Luce.
