The paper introduces a method to identify sparse projection bases that maximize the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between distributions. To the best of my knowledge, the use of EMD for component analysis has been relatively unexplored, with the exception of [A] in the context of NMF. The authors formulate a non-convex optimization problem and address it using an alternating optimization approach. Experimental results—though their significance is somewhat difficult for me to fully assess—demonstrate notable improvements over the current state-of-the-art.

After considering the authors' rebuttal, I find the paper to be of NIPS quality and recommend its acceptance. The method for finding sparse projection bases using EMD is novel, and the alternating optimization procedure is well-motivated. While the importance of the experiments is not entirely clear to me, the reported improvements over existing methods are compelling. I recommend acceptance.
