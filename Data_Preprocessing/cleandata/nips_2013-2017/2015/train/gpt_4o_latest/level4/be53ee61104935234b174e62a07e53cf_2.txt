The reductions in computational complexity compared to existing algorithms are noteworthy. My sole concern is how the delta factor in the approximate solution impacts convergence for typical values of \( n \).
Minor: In the first line after Section 1.1, it states \( n \geq m-1 \), but I believe it should instead be \( n \leq m-1 \). In this work, the authors utilize approximate solvers to accelerate the solution of isotonic regression under any norm.
