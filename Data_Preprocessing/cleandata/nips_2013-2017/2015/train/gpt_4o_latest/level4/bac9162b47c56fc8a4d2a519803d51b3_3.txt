This paper presents the use of RNNs (both simple and LSTM variants) for predicting student performance based on their historical performance data. The proposed approach demonstrates a substantial improvement over the baseline method (BKT). Additionally, the paper includes a brief experiment on curriculum optimization and an analysis of the relationships between exercises.
The methodology is straightforward to understand, owing to the clarity of the writing (though some proofreading is needed, as noted below) and the relative simplicity of the techniques employed. While I personally view the simplicity of the approach as a positive aspect, others might perceive it as a drawback. The work represents a novel application of an established technique to an existing problem. As highlighted earlier, the performance improvement is significant and holds promise for advancing the field of computer-assisted education. Overall, this is a well-written paper with strong results in the domain of computer-assisted education, though its impact from a machine-learning perspective may be less pronounced.
