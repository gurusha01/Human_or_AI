The paper presents two primary contributions: (1) The introduction of a novel concept called hierarchy width, which can be leveraged to establish bounds on the mixing time of Gibbs sampling in factor graphs, provided the parameters of the factor graph are bounded. (2) The development of a new relational modeling language designed to generate factor graphs where Gibbs sampling achieves rapid mixing.
Additionally, the paper offers a minor contribution in the form of empirical evaluations, demonstrating that the theoretical findings are applicable to real-world scenarios.
Overall, the paper is well-written and highly engaging. I have no major concerns but suggest that it could be insightful to explore the potential benefits of "Blocked Gibbs sampling" and "Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling" in reducing hierarchy width. Conversely, it would be interesting to investigate whether hierarchy width could inform strategies for constructing blocks or for Rao-Blackwellising the Gibbs sampler. Relevant references include Venugopal and Gogate (UAI 2013), Hamze and de Freitas (UAI 2004), and Bidyuk and Dechter (Journal of AI Research, 2007). 
In summary, the paper introduces the innovative notion of hierarchy width for (relational) factor graphs and demonstrates that, combined with bounded parameters, it can yield novel bounds on Gibbs sampling's mixing time. The work is well-executed, represents a significant advancement, and is supported by strong experimental results.
