Small comments:
- It should be explicitly stated somewhere that the pairwise marginals of the PL model correspond to a BTL distribution.
- Remark 5: The bound in [25] pertains to exact recovery, whereas the bound provided here is for approximate recovery; this distinction should be clarified.
- Section 9.1: In several places, replace "c or m [= --> \in] {range}" with the appropriate notation.
- Page 7, last line: Replace "horizontal" with "vertical."
- Section 9.2: An additional interesting experiment could involve comparing the algorithm with rank centrality, not in terms of the optimal recovery fraction, but rather in terms of the fraction of times an \(\epsilon\)-optimal ranking is recovered (for some \(\epsilon > 0\)). Does your algorithm achieve better sample complexity in this scenario?
The paper addresses the problem of identifying (approximately) the most probable ranking over \(n\) items—or just the top-ranked item—under the assumption of an underlying Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution, using active queries of pairwise comparisons from the distribution (a problem also referred to as the dueling bandits problem). The authors propose algorithms for both tasks (identifying the full ranking and identifying the top-ranked item) based on a budgeted quicksort procedure, which is shown to preserve pairwise comparison probabilities under the PL distribution. The paper provides query complexity bounds for both tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the PL model, the proposed algorithm for identifying the top-ranked item outperforms several recently developed algorithms. However, the algorithm for identifying a full ranking does not outperform a simple passive sampling approach that employs a naive uniform sampling strategy, leaving room for the development of a more effective active algorithm in this case. The paper is exceptionally well-written, presents intriguing results, and includes thoughtfully designed experiments.
