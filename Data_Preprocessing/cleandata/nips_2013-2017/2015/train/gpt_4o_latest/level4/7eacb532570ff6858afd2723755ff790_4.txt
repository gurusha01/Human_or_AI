The authors present an elicitation algorithm designed to compute rankings over alternatives based on their parameters within the Plackett-Luce model. The elicitation process is guided by quick sort, and the sample complexity is shown to be bounded.
The paper is well-written and makes a clear and meaningful contribution to a natural and significant problem. However, it would have been beneficial to include a lower bound on the sample complexity within the PAC framework for the problem addressed in the paper. The primary reason for not providing a stronger recommendation is the existence of [1], which appears to cover much of the conceptual groundwork for the model and problem. Overall, this is a well-crafted paper that offers a solid (though not groundbreaking) contribution to elicitation under the Plackett-Luce model.
