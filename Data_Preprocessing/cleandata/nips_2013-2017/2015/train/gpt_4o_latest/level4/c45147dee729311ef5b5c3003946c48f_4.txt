I would recommend that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on how their approach compares to other methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of between-frame quality (e.g., consistency, flickering, etc.).
== post rebuttal == Based on the rebuttal, a positive aspect is that the authors intend to release their model. Furthermore, it would be beneficial if they also release their code to ensure reproducibility. The paper introduces a novel and runtime-efficient approach, which is thoroughly evaluated against a substantial body of related work as well as through ablation studies. Considering the task involves video, it would be valuable to expand the qualitative evaluation of multi-frame results in Fig. 5 by including a discussion and a quantitative comparison (e.g., a consistency measure).
