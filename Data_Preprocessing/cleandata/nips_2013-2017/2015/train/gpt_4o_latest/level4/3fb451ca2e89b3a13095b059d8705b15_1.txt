The paper introduces a method for robust inference of sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM). It provides theoretical guarantees for the estimated models, even when these estimates correspond to local optima of the associated objective function.
The paper is well-written and logically structured: it begins by outlining the problem, followed by the introduction of the objective function (3). A reasonable optimization approach is proposed in Algorithm 1. Since the objective function is bi-convex rather than convex, the authors do not attempt to find a global minimum. Instead, they provide theoretical guarantees for any local minimum, subject to specific conditions. Section 3 offers insights into the scenarios where these conditions are likely to hold. The paper also includes experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.
The objective function (3) is a reasonable approach to handling outliers and noise, and the inclusion of theoretical guarantees is commendable. However, I found it challenging to see significant practical advantages over existing methods. That said, the authors should be credited for comparing their method against a robust selection of alternatives. The results in Figure 1 demonstrate that the proposed method is "competitive," though not significantly superior. Nevertheless, achieving slightly better performance than alternatives while also providing theoretical guarantees is a meaningful contribution.
Additional comments:
- Please explicitly mention that \(\tau{1}\), \(\tau{2}\), and \(\tau\) are defined in the supplementary material. I spent considerable time searching for their definitions in the main text.
- The sentence on line 236 is unclear. What does it mean to choose a parameter "from [a] quantity"?
Minor corrections:
- Line 51: "paid on" → "paid to"
- Line 123: "if i-th sample" → "if the i-th sample"
- Line 125: "only small number" → "only a small number"
- Line 242: "how easy we can satisfy" → "how easily we can satisfy"
- Line 277: "Note that" → "Note that the"
- Line 278: "Corollary 2 recover" → "Corollary 2 reveals an"
- Line 285: "by arbitrary optimization" → "by an arbitrary optimization"
- Line 286: "multiple local optimum" → "multiple local optima"
- Line 291: "from other" → "from another"
- Line 365: "Fix j subscript. Also is" → "Fix the \(j\)-subscript. Also, if"
- Line 463: "gaussian" → "Gaussian"
In summary, the paper presents a method with useful theoretical guarantees and competitive empirical performance.
