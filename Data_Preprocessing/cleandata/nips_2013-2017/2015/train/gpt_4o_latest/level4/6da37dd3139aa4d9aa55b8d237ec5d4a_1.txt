-- Summary --
This paper tackles the challenge of generating 3D object proposals from a stereo image pair captured by an autonomous driving vehicle. The authors introduce a set of features for a 3D cuboid defined over a point cloud and ground plane derived from the stereo images. These features include point cloud density, free space, object height prior, and object height relative to its surroundings. It is important to note that these features rely on prior knowledge of the object class, unlike other "objectness" proposal methods that are class-agnostic. A structural SVM is employed to predict the "objectness" score of the 3D cuboid proposals, followed by bounding box and orientation regression for final object detection.
The proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI benchmark and demonstrates superior performance compared to competing baselines in terms of oracle recall and object detection accuracy.
-- Comments --
Positives: The paper addresses the critical task of generating high-quality object proposals, which has been shown to significantly benefit object detection.
While much of the prior work has concentrated on 2D images, this paper shifts focus to 3D data, a relatively underexplored area. The proposed approach achieves better results than existing baselines (including those leveraging 3D data), which also leads to improved object detection performance.
The paper is reasonably well-written, making the key ideas of the approach accessible, and it provides a thorough review of prior work in this domain.
Negatives: From a machine learning perspective, the contributions of this paper might be viewed as incremental.
The performance improvements are likely to be more appreciated by the 3D vision community than the broader machine learning audience.
Detailed comments:
+ Section 3.4: The rationale for using a structured SVM is unclear. Section 3.1 introduces a feature vector, which suggests that a linear classifier might suffice.
It would be helpful to compare the performance of a linear SVM with hard negative mining to the current approach.
+ Prior work on generating object proposals is typically class-agnostic.
It would be interesting to evaluate the performance of the proposed method without using object class information (e.g., by excluding object height from the feature vector).
+ Line 107: Clarify that the input is a calibrated stereo image pair, as the method depends on metric information. Additionally, mention the reliance on ground plane estimation.
+ Paragraph starting Line 142: What is the parameterization of t? The indices for t and \theta appear unnecessary.
It would also be helpful to explicitly state the assumption that the boxes are constrained to lie on the ground plane or have their bases parallel to it.
+ Equation (1): Consider explicitly stating that each \phi depends on x.
+ Equation (4): Why not take the "max" over the heights instead?
+ Line 194: The potential seems to assume that objects are well-segmented in 3D (i.e., no overlaps or intersections).
Is this assumption valid in practice?
+ Line 246: Provide more details on the ground plane estimation process, as the current description is insufficient for reproducibility.
+ Line 255: Expand NMS to "non-maximum suppression."
+ Section 3.4: What value is used for the parameter C?
Additionally, should "y" be in boldface notation? My rating is based on the improvement in oracle recall for the "car" and "cyclist" object classes on the KITTI benchmark.
