The paper is generally well-written.
The proposed algorithm demonstrates a modest improvement (more pronounced in certain scenarios) over traditional glasso and robust methods, with theoretical results providing consistency assurances. In this work, the authors tackle the challenge of precision matrix estimation through sparsity-inducing approaches. Building on the classical glasso framework, they introduce a novel algorithm that incorporates weights into the data points. This leads to a non-convex optimization problem, for which the authors propose two distinct solution algorithms. Naturally, due to the non-convex nature of the problem, the solutions obtained are local minima. Nevertheless, the authors establish a theoretical result that guarantees any local minimum will possess specific consistency properties.
