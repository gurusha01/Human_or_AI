Review - Online binary vertex classification over a graph. In this problem, the learner is initially provided with a graph $G$, and on each round, an adversarially chosen node from the graph is presented. The learner assigns a label from $\{0,1\}$ to this node, after which nature reveals the true label $y_t$ for the node. The learner's predictions are based on the Ising model in the limit as the temperature parameter approaches 0. However, solving this problem is computationally intractable. To address this, the authors propose an approximate approach that involves constructing Picard-Queyranne (PQ) graphs, which preserve the combinatorial structure of minimum cuts. The learner then makes predictions by engaging in an online game on the PQ graph instead. The authors derive a mistake bound for their algorithm, and in the special case where the graph is a tree, the mistake bounds are shown to be comparable to those of the TreeOpt algorithm.
I found the paper intriguing, but it was a challenging read, and the writing could be significantly improved. The basic problem setup and its description are scattered across the first two sections, making it difficult to follow. A concise and complete description of the problem in a bullet-point format would greatly enhance clarity. Additionally, the authors should consider including an informal proof outline and a high-level summary of their results in one of the initial sections. The 0-Ising model serves as a natural yet intractable benchmark for comparison, and the comparison with the TreeOpt algorithm is promising. The reduction to PQ graphs and the subsequent prediction game on these graphs are both novel and interesting contributions.
Overall, I believe this work is worthy of publication. The problem addressed is both interesting and practically relevant. However, the algorithm's time complexity, which is quadratic in the number of vertices, limits its applicability to small- to medium-scale problems.
