This paper introduces a refined version of EP that significantly reduces memory requirements, albeit at the expense of reduced accuracy (and occasionally increased computational demands).
The paper also provides an insightful discussion of connections to related algorithms.
The extensive experimental results presented make a compelling case for the practical utility of the proposed algorithm.
The primary shortcoming of the paper lies in certain aspects of its presentation, which are somewhat imprecise.
For instance, the abstract and introduction misuse the term "computation" where "memory" is intended. Memory and computation are distinct concepts, and SEP, in some cases, actually increases computation in exchange for reduced memory.
The description of SEP is also ambiguous regarding the number of iterations. In Table 1, it is unclear whether SEP was run to convergence (if such a notion applies) or manually terminated.
In section 4.1, the phrase "converges in expectation" is vague. Expectation of what? What is being treated as random?
Theorem 1 suffers from a similar lack of clarity. Moreover, the claim in Theorem 1 is unproven. The so-called "proof" in Appendix A merely restates the theorem without providing a rigorous argument. If the authors cannot provide a precise formulation and a valid proof, this claim should be omitted from the paper.
The assertion in section 4.4, that messages to latent variables associated with a single data point need not be stored, rests on a specific assumption: that the term \( p(xn | hn, \theta) \) can be updated in one step. While this holds for the model in section 5.2, it is not universally true. For example, in LDA, where each document has a latent variable (the topic proportions), this update cannot be performed in a single step. Consequently, these messages would need to be stored unless one is willing to incur a significant increase in computation.
Appendix B.2 should explicitly state: "This procedure still reduces memory by a factor of \( N/K \)."
In section 5.1, ADF should collapse to a delta function at the true posterior mode, not the mean.
Overall, this paper presents an elegant modification of EP, includes a thoughtful discussion of its connections to other algorithms, and provides extensive experimental evidence to support its claims.
