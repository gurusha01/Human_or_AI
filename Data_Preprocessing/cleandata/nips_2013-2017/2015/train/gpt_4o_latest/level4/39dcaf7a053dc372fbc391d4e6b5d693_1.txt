The authors build upon the winning segmentation algorithm from the ISBI 2012 segmentation challenge (referred to as Base2D in their paper) by introducing two significant extensions. Leveraging advancements in convolutional neural networks (convnets) for image recognition, they enhance the base architecture by making it deeper and employing smaller convolutions. Subsequently, the output of the 2D network is used to initialize a 3D network, leading to further improvements in segmentation accuracy.
Regarding quality, the paper demonstrates a clear advancement in the state of the art for a challenging and significant problem. The authors employ a variety of metrics, both quantitative and subjective, to validate their improvements. However, I would have appreciated experiments on a broader range of datasets, potentially including larger datasets, as scalability is a critical concern in connectomics applications. Additionally, I encourage future work to conduct more comprehensive comparisons against methods beyond the ISBI 2012 winner, including several cited papers and more recent approaches, such as the one detailed here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04304.pdf.
The paper is presented with exceptional clarity. While it does not include dense derivations, this is understandable given that the architecture is a straightforward integration of existing components. The figures are well-organized and provide thorough support for the presented work.
In terms of originality, some ideas are adapted from other application domains (which is valuable in itself, as it tests the generalizability of these ideas), while others are inspired by insights into the biological visual system. Although none of the components of this architecture are particularly novel or complex, this simplicity is a strength, as it facilitates adoption by practitioners in the field.
This paper is significant because automating EM segmentation has the potential to transform neuroscience. While the work represents an incremental step in this direction, any efficiency improvements are valuable to the community and merit dissemination. The authors propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture for segmenting connectomics data and provide compelling evidence that their method achieves superior segmentation performance on this challenging and important task.
