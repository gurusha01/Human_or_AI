The paper provides an analysis of the robust PCA problem (decomposing M = L + S) under the assumption of random error locations in S and introduces a local notion of incoherence.
Specifically, instead of considering the global incoherence of L, the authors focus on the local incoherence of individual elements of L. Leveraging this concept, they establish tighter bounds on the number of non-zero entries permissible in S.
The results appear to be novel and moderately interesting. While the analysis builds on standard techniques, it incorporates additional complexities arising from the local incoherence framework. However, it remains unclear whether the introduction of local incoherence significantly complicates the proof. Furthermore, the key insights or techniques derived from the analysis are not presented in a concrete manner.
Thus, although the novelty of the result is acknowledged, its overall significance and the depth of the analysis remain uncertain. See detailed comments below.
