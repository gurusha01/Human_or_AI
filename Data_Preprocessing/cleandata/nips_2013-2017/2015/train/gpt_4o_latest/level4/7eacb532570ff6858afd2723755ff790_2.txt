In the context of dueling bandits under the PL model assumption, the authors address two tasks: identifying an approximate best arm and deriving an approximate ranking of the arms. Both tasks hinge on estimating the pairwise marginals of the underlying PL model, achieved via an early-stopped variant of QuickSort. This Budgeted QuickSort enables the design of algorithms with a sample complexity of O(M log² M). The experiments compare the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms against state-of-the-art methods.
The problem lacks strong motivation, which is further underscored by the absence of experiments using real-world datasets. That said, I appreciate the simplicity of the algorithms, and the theoretical analysis supporting them appears sound. While I did not verify the proofs in the appendix, the results seem plausible. A discussion on the choice of the method for constructing confidence intervals in PLPAC would have been helpful—for instance, is the algorithm sensitive to this choice?
The paper is well-structured and fairly easy to follow. However, I find it somewhat unusual that an algorithm (AMPR-PLPAC) is relegated to the supplementary material.
As mentioned, the problem is not well-motivated and appears to address a niche area, a perception reinforced by the fact that the experiments are conducted solely on synthetic data. Nevertheless, the gain in sample complexity over existing algorithms is notable. The algorithm is intriguing, and the theoretical analysis is comprehensive, but the limited scope of the problem and experimental validation detracts from its broader appeal.
