This paper extends prior work on the EM method for CTMCs and addresses conditional statistics by leveraging some recently developed tools. It provides a detailed comparison of several inference methods, focusing on both accuracy and computational complexity.
Quality:  
a. The experimental baselines selected are relatively weak, as they fail to account for state transition or trajectory information. A more appropriate comparison would involve discrete-time HMM approaches, where the time horizon could be discretized using a suitable bin size.  
b. Building on point (a), given the computational complexity of inference in CT-HMMs, why not simply discretize the time horizon? For irregular sampling rates, a proper bin size could be chosen: with a small bin size, each bin would contain either one observation or none (missing); with a larger bin size, bins with multiple observations could use a local average. This approach is likely sufficient for most problems. Have you considered applying this method to your dataset?  
c. For CT-HMMs, alternative inference methods such as sampling also exist. For instance, the Fast MCMC sampling approach for Markov jump processes and its extensions (Rao et al., JMLR 2013) could be relevant. Have you compared your method against such approaches?  
Clarity:  
The paper is clearly written.  
Originality:  
The work is novel in that it introduces an EM-based approach for CT-HMMs, although the tools and components utilized are derived from prior research.  
Significance:  
This paper presents an EM-based inference method for CT-HMMs. If the authors release their software package, it could serve as a valuable resource for the community. While the contribution is incremental, it offers a practical inference method for CT-HMMs.
