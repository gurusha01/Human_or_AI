The paper introduces a reformulation for a broad category of mixed graphical models, enabling a sequence of factorizations. While the work is highly technical, my primary concern lies in the unclear extent to which the proposed representation simplifies certain problems or reduces the complexity of specific inference algorithms.
I am also concerned that the 8-page NIPS format may not be well-suited for this type of contribution, as it would benefit from a series of illustrative examples to better demonstrate the advancements it facilitates.
