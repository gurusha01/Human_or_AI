== SUMMARY ==
This paper establishes that a specific notion of algorithmic stability in learning algorithms is a necessary condition for achieving "uniform generalization." Here, "algorithmic stability" is defined probabilistically, implying that as the size of the training set grows indefinitely, the dependence of the (randomized) hypothesis produced by the learning algorithm on any single example diminishes. "Uniform generalization," in this context, means that there exists a minimum training size such that the difference between the empirical and expected losses (averaged over hypotheses generated by the learning algorithm) is uniformly upper-bounded across all "parametric" loss functions and data distributions. This condition is stricter than standard generalization, which, as defined in the paper, only needs to hold asymptotically for a given loss function. The main theorem is explored in various contexts: to elucidate the benefits of techniques like dimensionality reduction and dropout; to examine the connection between the effective domain size and algorithmic stability (and, consequently, generalization); and to link algorithmic stability with the VC dimension.
Overall, this is a well-written and thought-provoking theoretical contribution. The paper includes well-chosen examples that connect the theory to practical scenarios, and the implications of the main theorem are compelling. (I particularly appreciated the analysis of the effective domain size.) While the writing could benefit from minor refinements (see detailed comments), it is generally clear and well-structured.
My primary concern is that the paper's practical impact may be limited. It does not provide actionable insights or "prescriptions" for practitioners. While it deepens our theoretical understanding of learning, it does not propose any new techniques or practices to adopt. The paper would be significantly stronger if its theoretical insights were leveraged to inspire a novel method or approach.

The term "inference process" in the abstract was somewhat confusing. Typically, this term refers to prediction (e.g., inferring Y given X), but in this paper, it is used interchangeably with learning (e.g., inferring H given S_m). Clarifying this distinction or, preferably, avoiding the term "inference" altogether would improve clarity. Additionally, it might be interesting to explore whether stability in the prediction process (i.e., inference of Y given X) is also a necessary condition for generalization.
The main result relies on nuanced distinctions between "learnability," "consistency," "uniform convergence," and "(uniform) generalization." While these concepts are discussed in Section 2, the treatment felt somewhat convoluted. A clearer explanation of why these distinctions are important would be helpful. For instance, is there a class of learning algorithms (or hypotheses) that exhibits learnability but not generalization (or vice versa)? Understanding the practical relevance of these distinctions would enhance the paper's accessibility.
Similarly, the paper's definition of "learnability" via excess risk struck me as unconventional. Typically, learnability is understood in the PAC framework, where a poly(\epsilon,\delta,m)-time algorithm exists such that, with high probability (1-\delta), the learned hypothesis achieves an error of at most \epsilon. This definition does not appear equivalent to the one used in the paper. It would be helpful to explicitly cite the source of this definition and clarify that it may differ from the reader's expectations.
The application of the data processing inequality in the proof of Theorem 1 was somewhat unclear. For the Markov chain
(S_m -> H -> L(.;H)) == (A -> B -> C),
what role does Z_trn play? Is it treated as A in this construction? The inequalities on line 242 seem to rely on the assertion that
S(L(.;H);Ztrn) > S(H;Ztrn),
but doesn't this imply S(C;A) > S(B;A), which appears to differ from the inequality stated in Lemma 1?

== POST-RESPONSE ASSESSMENT ==
I remain skeptical about the paper's practical impact. The relationship between stability and generalization has been recognized for over a decade, so the overarching message is not groundbreaking. This paper primarily extends stability theory and confirms a conjecture in a broader learning framework. However, it does not propose any new techniques, and its implications for existing methods (e.g., dimensionality reduction, dropout) are somewhat speculative. That said, the paper is well-written, technically sound, and offers valuable theoretical insights. While I personally find the lack of practical relevance limiting, others may appreciate its theoretical contributions. Therefore, I recommend acceptance. The paper rigorously demonstrates that algorithmic stability is a necessary condition for uniform generalization. The theory is solid (albeit occasionally difficult to follow), the insights are thought-provoking, and the presentation is strong, even if the practical impact is limited.
