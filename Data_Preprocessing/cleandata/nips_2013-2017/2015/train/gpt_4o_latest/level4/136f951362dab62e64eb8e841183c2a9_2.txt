-- Summary --  
This paper introduces a point process-based collaborative filtering model designed to capture the temporal and recurrent interactions between users and items. Specifically, for each user-item pair, the event density is modeled as the sum of a constant intensity and a self-exciting intensity influenced by past events. Two sets of intensities are computed using separate latent vectors for users and items. The authors derive an optimization algorithm for parameter estimation and conduct empirical studies to highlight the advantages of their proposed method over commonly used alternatives.
That said, the experimental evaluation has room for improvement. For instance, a meaningful baseline could be a simple ensemble of STiC [12] and SVD, as the authors note that [12, 13] cannot recommend entirely new items, which SVD can address. Comparing the proposed method to this ensemble would provide additional insights. Moreover, for the \(\gamma\) function used in the self-exciting process, it is unclear how the bandwidth parameter \(\sigma\) is selected. How sensitive are the results to variations in \(\sigma\)? Additionally, the paper lacks details on how key hyperparameters, such as the latent vector dimensions, are chosen for both the baseline methods and the proposed model.
It would also be beneficial to include more information about the characteristics of the two real-world datasets used. Since the focus of the paper is on temporal structure, basic statistics such as the number of recurring events per user-item pair and the irregularity of the temporal patterns would provide valuable context.
-- Quality --  
The overall quality of the paper is decent but falls short of being excellent.
-- Clarity --  
The presentation of the paper could be improved, particularly in terms of language, typos, and grammatical errors.
-- Originality --  
The proposed approach is an intriguing integration of point process modeling and latent factor models.
-- Significance --  
Both the problem addressed and the proposed method have strong practical relevance. While the paper presents a novel point process-based collaborative filtering model and demonstrates its advantages over existing methods, the experimental evaluation and overall presentation require further refinement.
