This paper introduces a tensor decomposition algorithm designed for a sparse noise setting. The proposed method is both intriguing and practical for general tensor decomposition scenarios. The algorithm appears computationally feasible by reformulating the original problem into matrix decompositions involving pairs of modes. However, the experimental evaluation is somewhat limited.
Quality: The quality of the results is reasonable. The proposed approach is general and practical, with the ability to extend to higher-order tensors without significantly increasing computational costs. However, the numerical evaluation is limited, and the evaluation metric used is unconventional. The authors should clarify why they opted for the accurate probability metric instead of MSE. Additional numerical experiments under various noise settings are recommended.
Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.  
However, the optimization algorithm for equation (6) is not provided. It appears the authors may have used methods from [22] or [23], but a summary of the employed algorithms should be included. Additionally, there is an error in the model description \( X = \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda \ldots \) in Section 2.2 that needs correction.
Originality: The proposed decomposition algorithm and its theoretical analysis are highly novel.
Significance: The proposed approach appears to be a promising method for tensor decomposition. It is straightforward to implement and extend to more general tensor decomposition settings. To highlight these strengths, a more detailed discussion of related works is necessary.
The proposed tensor decomposition algorithm is both interesting and practical.
