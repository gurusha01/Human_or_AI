The author addresses the regression problem, where the relationship is given by  
$$ y = X \theta^* + \omega $$  
for a design matrix $X$ and a noise vector $\omega$. The objective is to recover an estimate $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta^$ such that $\|\hat{\theta} - \theta^\|_2$ is small with high probability, considering randomness in both $\omega$ and $X$. The paper adopts the standard approach of estimating $\hat{\theta}$ by solving a norm-regularized least squares regression problem.  
Previous work has extensively studied this problem under the assumption that the entries of $X$ and $\omega$ are subgaussian. In such cases, the required number of rows $n$ of $X$ is related to the Gaussian mean width of the "error set" $A$, as defined in lines 108-113 of the paper. This submission, however, focuses on the case where the subgaussian assumption is replaced with subexponential entries. Here, $n$ is tied to the exponential width of $A$. Theorem 1 in the paper establishes that the exponential width is at most the Gaussian width multiplied by $\sqrt{\log p}$ for any subset $T$ of $\mathbb{R}^p$. This result is derived as a straightforward corollary of two theorems from Talagrand's book, following a standard computation of the exponential width of the unit $\ell_1$ ball (Theorems 1.2.7 and 2.6.2 in Talagrand's book are cited; Theorem 5.2.7 is also mentioned but is irrelevant, as it provides a lower bound on the exponential width in terms of $\gamma$-functionals, which is neither used in the proofs nor applicable to the subexponential case considered in this submission).  
From a technical perspective, the extension from the Gaussian case in prior work to the subexponential case in this paper appears to be a relatively minor step. The main result, Theorem 1, follows almost directly from the cited theorems in Talagrand's book.  
That said, the lack of a substantial technical contribution is not necessarily a problem. However, the submission could be significantly improved by enhancing the motivation in the introduction. My impression is that in some scenarios, one has the flexibility to choose the design matrix $X$, and in such cases, selecting subgaussian entries would be preferable, as it minimizes the required number of measurements (depending on the Gaussian width of the error set). In situations where the design matrix is predetermined by external factors, it is crucial to justify why modeling its entries as subexponential is appropriate. The paper's motivation hinges on the existence of compelling examples where the design matrix is not under the experimenter's control and where subexponential modeling is reasonable. However, the introduction does not adequately address this question. If such examples exist, they should be discussed in detail to underscore the significance of the work.  
OTHER COMMENTS:  
FROM THE MAIN PAPER:  
- Line 070: The statement "sub-exponentials are the class of distributions which have heavier tails compared to sub-Gaussians and for which all moments exist" is misleading. The word "the" before "class" is overly restrictive, as there are other distributions with heavier tails and all moments existing (e.g., a distribution with pdf $e^{-|x|^{1.5}}$).  
- Line 071: The claim "Distributions having heavier tails than sub-exponentials start losing moments" is incorrect. For instance, a distribution with pdf $e^{-\sqrt{|x|}}$ has heavier tails than subexponentials, yet all moments exist.  
- Lines 084-085: The set $A$ is introduced without prior definition, which creates confusion. Its meaning only becomes clear later in line 109.  
- Line 115: The inequality for $\lambdan$ is unclear. Since $\lambdan$ is chosen in (2) to ensure certain properties (e.g., proximity of $\hat{\theta}$ to $\theta^*$ in some norm with high probability), it is ambiguous whether the inequality specifies how $\lambda_n$ should be set or refers to a specific $\beta > 1. Clarification is needed.  
- Lines 199-201: The claim that (4) holds for any $g$ with subgaussian entries is incorrect. While the upper bound in (4) is valid under subgaussian decay, the lower bound only holds for Gaussian decay. For example, Rademacher variables are subgaussian, but the $\gamma2$ functional is not a lower bound for them (e.g., for the $\ell1$ ball in $p$ dimensions, $\gamma_2 = \Theta(\sqrt{\log p})$, but the Rademacher width is $1$).  
- Lines 210-212: The assertion that (5) holds for any subexponential random variables is similarly incorrect. The upper bound is valid under subexponential decay, but the lower bound only applies when the entries of $X$ are exactly exponential.  
FROM THE SUPPLEMENTARY FILE:  
- Line 124: The word "lose" should be "loose". Additionally, "For e.g." is redundant and should simply be "e.g.".  
- Equation (16): The constant $K$ is an absolute constant but could be confused with the $K$ from Lemma 1. Clarify that the $K$ in Lemma 1 is assumed to equal $1$ here.  
- Below Line 215: The statement "the result is applicable to any process that has concentration inequality (16)" is inaccurate. While the upper bound in (17) holds under (16), the lower bound is valid only when the entries of $X$ are exactly exponential. For example, Gaussian entries satisfy (16) but invalidate the lower bound (the $\gamma_1$ term should not appear). Similarly, a trivial distribution supported only on zero is subexponential but clearly violates the lower bound (though this example may not apply if variances are assumed to be $1$).  
In summary, while the technical contribution is modest, the paper could be strengthened by addressing the motivational gaps and clarifying several technical inaccuracies.
