Summary of Paper:  
This paper establishes linear convergence for four variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, under less restrictive conditions compared to prior work in the literature.
Quality:  
The paper is well-written, and the results are compelling. Overall, I believe it would be a valuable addition to NIPS, as it represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the Frank-Wolfe procedure, which has growing relevance, particularly in applications such as submodular optimization.
Clarity:  
The paper is generally clear. However, I believe that an 8-page NIPS version would benefit from a more accessible, "in words" explanation of the different algorithmic variants, while moving the precise algorithmic descriptions to the appendix. As it stands, it is somewhat challenging to discern the exact distinctions between the variants from the main text alone, as the reader must rely heavily on the accompanying explanations. The intuition section, however, is helpful.
Originality:  
In my view, the primary original contribution of this paper lies in presenting a more unified perspective on the various Frank-Wolfe variants proposed in the literature, along with a unified proof framework for their convergence.
Significance:  
This paper will serve as a valuable reference for the community interested in Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants. First-order methods like Frank-Wolfe, which exploit problem structure, have seen a resurgence of interest in the machine learning community. As such, this work is likely to appeal to the NIPS audience. The paper not only proves linear convergence for four Frank-Wolfe variants under weaker assumptions but also provides a unifying framework for existing results and introduces new convergence guarantees.
