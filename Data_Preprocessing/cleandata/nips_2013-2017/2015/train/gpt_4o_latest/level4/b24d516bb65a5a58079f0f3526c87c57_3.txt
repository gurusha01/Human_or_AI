The authors investigated the transition phenomena in information cascades, demonstrating that the spectral radius of the Laplace Hazard matrix effectively characterizes contagion dynamics. Their study emphasizes non-asymptotic influence bounds, the super-critical time, and tight lower bounds for the critical explosion time.
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides rigorous theoretical bounds.  
2. It addresses network information cascades, a topic of significant interest to the research community.  
3. The manuscript is well-structured and easy to follow.  
Suggestions:  
The experimental validation could be enhanced to better support the theoretical findings. While the authors analyzed the case of 'exponential transition probabilities,' it would be beneficial to also examine 'fixed transition patterns' and the 'SI and SIR epidemic models.' Additionally, does the tightness observed in Fig. 1 apply exclusively to fully connected networks?  
This work extends the approach introduced by Lemonnier et al. [17] to address anytime influence bounds, maintaining strict theoretical guarantees.
