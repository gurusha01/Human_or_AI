The authors investigate methods for statistical preference learning using ordered data, establishing recovery guarantees under the assumption that the underlying parameter matrix is low rank. The paper is well-written and effectively tackles significant technical challenges, but it falls short in terms of empirical validation. The theoretical results rely on the concept of restricted strong convexity, which is framed within fairly standard assumptions. Additionally, the authors derive both upper and lower bounds in their analysis, indicating that the proposed sample complexity is nearly optimal within the stated assumptions.
The paper integrates models for collaborative ranking and bundle choice modeling under the broader framework of collaborative preference learning. While the statistical results for bundled choice modeling are evidently connected to those for collaborative ranking, the transition between the two frameworks feels disjointed. The authors might have achieved greater clarity and focus by concentrating on one of these problem domains rather than addressing both.
I recommend that the authors expand their experimental evaluation. For example, it would be valuable to empirically compare the proposed method with existing approaches in the literature to assess real-world performance and/or test the robustness of the proposed methods against model mis-specification. Moreover, there is no experimental validation provided for the bundled choice modeling problem, which further supports my suggestion to consider removing this section. While I understand that the primary aim of the paper is to present theoretical results, empirical evidence often strengthens the impact of new techniques in this research area.
Minor comments:  
- Line 124: If \( l \) is indexed starting from 1, what does \( S{i,1} \) represent, given that \( v{i,0} \) does not exist? The authors should clarify whether a null definition is implicitly assumed.  
- The claim in equation (6) is not immediately clear. Could the authors provide additional explanation or justification?  
- Line 288: Deleting the row mean generally increases the rank of \( \Theta \) by 1. Please revise this statement and verify the results in Figure 1, or demonstrate that the rank of the de-meaned parameter remains unchanged.
