The feedback from other reviewers and the authors' response have not substantially influenced my assessment of the paper. However, I should note that I am not well-versed in the single index model or sufficient dimension reduction literature, so it is possible that I may be unaware of prior work that could be relevant. The authors establish asymptotic guarantees for the generalized square-root lasso when applied to Gaussian measurements that may be (optionally) transformed by an unknown nonlinear function. The findings are highly compelling, as they offer a detailed characterization of the method's performance, and the paper is excellently written (though there are several typos, particularly in the proof section).
