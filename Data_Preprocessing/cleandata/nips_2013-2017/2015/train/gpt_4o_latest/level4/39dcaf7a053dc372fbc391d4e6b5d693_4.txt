This paper introduces a 2D-3D convolutional network for detecting neuronal boundaries in 3D electron microscopy (EM) brain images. Unlike conventional convolutional networks, the proposed approach leverages both 2D and 3D filters to capture information from EM image sequences. During training, a recursive scheme is employed to effectively learn 3D features starting from 2D initialization. Additionally, ZNN is utilized to enhance computational efficiency. The method is evaluated on cortical images, and in comparison to the base2D and VD2D models, the proposed 2D-3D network achieves a lower error rate.
Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The proposed method demonstrates novelty in neuronal boundary detection and holds promise for application to other sequential data, such as video frames.
That said, the experimental evaluation is somewhat limited. While the 2D-3D model achieves more accurate boundary detection than the 2D models, additional experiments are necessary, particularly comparisons against state-of-the-art methods in boundary detection.
In conclusion, the paper is engaging and generally well-prepared. However, further comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques in neuronal boundary detection are essential to fully showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method in this domain.
