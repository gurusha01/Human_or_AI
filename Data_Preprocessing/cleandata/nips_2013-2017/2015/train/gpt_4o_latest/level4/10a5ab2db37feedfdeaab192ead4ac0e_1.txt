1) The authors should explicitly acknowledge in Section 3.2 that the algorithm presented bears a strong resemblance to the methods described in the cited references:
[14] J. Zhao, J. Shawe-Taylor, and M. van Daalen, "Learning in stochastic bit stream neural networks," Neural Networks, vol. 9, no. 6, pp. 991 - 998, 1996, and [15] Soudry, Daniel, Itay Hubara, and Ron Meir. "Expectation backpropagation: Parameter-free training of multilayer neural networks with continuous or discrete weights." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2014.
The final form of the algorithm (a hybrid of both references) was derived using similar approximations, and this should be explicitly stated.
2) The first paragraph of the discussion section gives the misleading impression that the "constrain-then-train" methodology—where a weight distribution is learned and subsequently sampled to produce a fixed network ensemble for testing—is a novel contribution. However, this approach was previously proposed and evaluated in reference [15].
3) The novelty claim (i) in the last paragraph of the introduction is also inaccurate. The "expectation backpropagation" algorithm from reference [15] is a backpropagation-based update rule (leveraging expectation propagation) designed for binary neurons (with a sign activation function, where zero input is never precisely reached) and binary weights. This algorithm can also be extended to include constrained connectivity, making the claim misleading.
4) The cited prior state-of-the-art results are incorrect. Based on my knowledge, the best results for binary weights (and neurons) prior to this work were achieved by the algorithm in reference [15], which was evaluated on the MNIST dataset (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03562v3.pdf) without employing data augmentation, consistent with the experimental setup in this paper.

Thank you for agreeing to address these issues. This paper presents robust and innovative experimental results, particularly in terms of accuracy and power efficiency. However, the general methodology and the algorithm itself are not as novel as the paper claims.
