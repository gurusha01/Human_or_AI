A covariance-controlled Nos√© thermostat is introduced in this paper to facilitate sampling from a target measure when the computation of the likelihood is infeasible due to the overwhelming number of terms in the product-form likelihood.
This work builds upon foundational contributions in molecular dynamics, particularly those by Leimkuhler, and represents a noteworthy addition to the growing body of literature in this emerging field.
The experimental evaluations, while somewhat simplistic, do provide insights, with the final DBM results being particularly intriguing.
Quality: This is a robust piece of research that leverages results from molecular dynamics to tackle a modern machine learning challenge.
Clarity: The paper is well-written, avoiding unnecessary complexity or obfuscation, making it a very clear and accessible read.
Originality: A related approach, albeit with fixed covariance, was presented at last year's NeurIPS, building on the work by Skeel. This paper extends and improves upon that prior work, and this should not be seen as a limitation but rather as a valuable contribution.
Significance: This area holds significant potential, particularly for models with factorizable likelihoods, which represent a specific but important class of statistical models.
