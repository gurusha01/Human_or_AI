This paper introduces a novel upper bound for the mixing time of Gibbs sampling.
In contrast to prior specialized results, this bound is applicable to arbitrary discrete factor graphs.
While the bound is too loose for quantitative applications, the paper leverages it qualitatively to provide insights into why certain real-world networks exhibit good mixing behavior.
The manuscript is well-written and includes a solid collection of methods for analyzing mixing time, although much of the substantial material is relegated to the appendix.
In Section 4, the authors establish a connection between the mixing time of Ising models and hierarchy width.
However, this connection remains a qualitative rather than quantitative evaluation of the theory.
The theorem from [10], p201 indicates that the maximum degree may be a more relevant parameter than hierarchy width.
How would the figure appear if maximum degree were used on the axis instead?
The paper asserts that exact inference is infeasible for real-world networks (line 418), implying that these networks have high tree-width.
It would be beneficial for the authors to report the tree-width of the networks and compare it to hierarchy width and factor weight.
Does Theorem 2 provide meaningful bounds for the real-world networks analyzed?
The related work section is somewhat unconventional, as most of the cited papers are not directly concerned with mixing time.
It would be more appropriate to reference prior work specifically addressing mixing time bounds in factor graphs.
For instance, there are existing, much tighter bounds for specific graph structures than those provided by Theorem 2.
One such example is the work by Liu and Domke (2014):
"Projecting Markov Random Fields for Fast Mixing" Xianghang Liu, Justin Domke NIPS 2014 http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1119
Additionally, Section 2.1 contains minor issues, such as the use of 'q' instead of 'Q' in the equations and the incorrect reference to 'figure 2(a)' instead of 'figure 2(b)'.
Overall, the paper presents new theoretical insights into Gibbs sampling in a clear and engaging manner, though its contributions are primarily qualitative.
