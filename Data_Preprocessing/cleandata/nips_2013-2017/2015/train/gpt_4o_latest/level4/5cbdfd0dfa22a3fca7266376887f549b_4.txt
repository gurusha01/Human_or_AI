In this paper, the authors address a tensor factorization problem of the form \( Z = X + Y \), where \( X \) is a low-rank representation of \( Z \), and \( Y \) accounts for sparse corruption. The authors introduce two matrix subspaces, \( T{U,V} \) and \( T{V,W} \), for a third-order non-symmetric tensor, which describe the span of the tensor after contraction along the 1st and 3rd modes, respectively. The sparsity after contraction along mode \( m \) is characterized by the union of the support sets of each matrix (tensor slice) extracted along this mode. To manage this sparsity, the authors define incoherence parameters based on \( L_{\infty} \) norms, ensuring that the spectra of matrices are "diffuse" rather than sparse. 
The authors extend the simultaneous diagonalization method [18] by contracting the tensor along modes 1 and 3 using randomly chosen vectors \( a \) and \( b \) from a uniformly distributed unit sphere. This process yields eigenvalues \( u \), \( v \), \( v' \), and \( w \). By pairing the eigenvalues \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \), the authors derive a set of equations that allow them to solve for eigenvectors. To simultaneously enforce the low-rank property of \( X \) and the sparsity of \( Y \), the authors apply simultaneous diagonalization to contractions of \( X \) and \( Y \), impose the nuclear norm on \( X \), the \( \ell_1 \)-norm on \( Y \), and solve equation (6). This specific subproblem is well-documented in [10], particularly in equation (1.3).
For evaluation, the authors generate \( 50^3 \)-dimensional non-symmetric tensors \( Z \), composed of low-rank \( X \) and sparse \( Y \) based on distributions outlined in the paper. They then present the likelihood of recovering \( X \) and \( Y \) from \( Z \) with respect to sparsity and the true tensor rank \( r \).
Pros:  
- The paper addresses an intriguing non-symmetric tensor factorization/decomposition problem.  
- It provides a novel extension of the existing simultaneous positive-definite matrix diagonalization method [18].  
- The approach to imposing low-rank and sparsity constraints on contractions is an interesting extension of the problem in [10].  
Cons:  
- The paper would benefit from additional evaluations, such as experiments beyond Figure 1.  
- The final steps of the algorithm in Section 2 could be more clearly described.  
- Some of the proofs are challenging to follow.  
Major Comments:  
1. This is an engaging paper that extends several ideas, ranging from simultaneous diagonalization for a set of matrices to low-rank and sparse matrix recovery, by applying and adapting these methods to third-order non-symmetric tensors. The mathematical framework appears sound.  
2. In [18], the simultaneous diagonalization method highlights the limitations of using a single projection vector (equivalent to one contraction). The authors of [18] note in Section 3 that the quality of the estimated eigenvalues depends on the smallest eigengap. To address this, [18] proposes random projections to reduce the likelihood of zeroing out eigenvalues. Do the authors of this submission perform multiple contractions? While this seems to be the case, it is not explicitly clear from Section 2 or Algorithm 1. How does this impact the stability of diagonalization, given that non-symmetric tensors require solving for three sets of eigenvectors?  
3. The evaluations of the proposed algorithm feel somewhat limited. It would strengthen the paper to include experiments on non-synthetic data. Additionally, some of the guarantees provided in Section 3 could be illustrated through experiments. For instance, what happens in practical simulations when \( v3 \) and \( v1 \) fall outside the guaranteed regime described in Corollary 3.4?  
This paper is likely to be of interest to the community studying higher-order tensors. It is reasonably clear and original, although it builds significantly on prior work.
