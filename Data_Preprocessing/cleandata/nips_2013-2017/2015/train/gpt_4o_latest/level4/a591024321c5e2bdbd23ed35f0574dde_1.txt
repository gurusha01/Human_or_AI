The paper introduces multiple EM-style algorithms for learning Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs) and demonstrates their application on two disease progression prediction tasks: Glaucoma and Alzheimer's. The motivation for the work is well-articulated, and the proposed framework is indeed more realistic than traditional discrete-time HMMs for real-world applications like medicine and customer interaction. The CT-HMM framework is clearly presented, and the algorithm derivations appear to be correct. While the approach is conceptually straightforward from a theoretical perspective, the technical derivations are non-trivial, making this a valuable theoretical contribution. 
On the empirical side, the use of real datasets is commendable and strengthens the paper. However, for the Glaucoma dataset, the baseline methods used for comparison (linear and Bayesian linear regression) are relatively weak. A more meaningful comparison would involve a discrete-time HMM that disregards the time intervals between visits. Including this comparison would significantly enhance the evaluation. 
The results for Alzheimer's are more qualitative, but having a second task is a positive addition. That said, Section 5 requires revision, as it contains more unclear sentences and grammatical errors than other sections of the paper. Additionally, while the use of exponential distributions for transition times is standard in CTMCs, it may not always be optimal in practiceâ€”mixtures of distributions could be more effective and might be worth exploring in future work. 
Overall, the authors propose EM-style algorithms for learning CT-HMMs, where state transitions can occur between observations. The paper offers a solid theoretical contribution, and while the empirical evaluation could be improved, the use of real-world data makes the work deserving of publication.
