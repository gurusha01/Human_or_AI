The paper introduces a method for batch learning from logged bandit feedback that effectively addresses the propensity overfitting issue.
Building on the work of Swaminathan and Joachims (2015), it presents a significantly improved algorithm.
Quality: The research presented in the paper is of above-average quality. The proposed extensions lead to notable advancements in the training process of the original POEM algorithm.
Clarity: The paper is, for the most part, well-written and straightforward to follow.
Originality: The paper offers a substantially new formulation of the original POEM algorithm tailored to the BLBF problem. I find the contributions to be highly original.
Significance: The results presented in the paper are compelling and warrant further exploration. I am particularly impressed by the fact that the proposed algorithm is faster than the original POEM while incorporating additional regularization mechanisms. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption in the near future.
Overall, this is a strong paper. It is clear, well-structured, and easy to read.
