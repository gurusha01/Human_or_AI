UPDATES AFTER REBUTTAL: I appreciate the authors' efforts in addressing my questions. The additional numerical results provided in the supplementary material are a valuable enhancement to the paper. While I believe this is a solid contribution, I will maintain my score at 7.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: This work introduces a modified leapfrog integrator tailored for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample from piecewise continuous probability distributions with affine discontinuity boundaries. The proposed method incorporates reflection and refraction of the simulated trajectory upon encountering a boundary. While similar techniques have been previously applied to multivariate Gaussian distributions with constraints, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first instance of applying such an approach to more "general" distributions (though I do not claim expertise in HMC). The concept is straightforward yet intuitively compelling (many effective ideas are simple!) and has the potential to be highly useful for a specific subset of problems. However, the numerical evaluation is somewhat limited, and the authors might consider expanding it in a future (re)submission. Additionally, there are several typographical errors that should be addressed.
Lastly, could the authors comment on the feasibility of extending the method to non-affine discontinuity boundaries? Beyond the computational challenges of determining intersections, would it be possible to adapt the approach for more general boundary types?
Detailed comments/questions:
- Section 3: It might be helpful to explicitly mention that \( K(p') = K(p) - \Delta U \) to clarify the form of the refracted momentum.  
- Equation (3): Shouldn't the upper triangle (excluding the four elements in the upper left corner) also be zero?  
- Line 363: The definition of WMAE appears to be missing normalization by \( k \).  
- Footnote 2 on page 7: Expanding on the sensitivity of the tuning parameters (\( L \) and \( \epsilon \)) would strengthen the paper. Including additional numerical results in the supplementary material could help convince readers.  
In summary, the paper presents a modified leapfrog integrator for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo aimed at sampling from piecewise continuous probability distributions with affine discontinuity boundaries. The idea is simple yet promising for a restricted class of problems, though the numerical evaluation remains limited.
