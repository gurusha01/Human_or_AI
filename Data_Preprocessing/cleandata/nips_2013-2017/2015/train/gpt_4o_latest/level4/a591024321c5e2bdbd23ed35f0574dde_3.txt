The paper introduces novel methods for parameter learning and inference (either Viterbi or forward/backward) in continuous-time Hidden Markov Models (CT-HMMs) with non-uniformly distributed time points. The authors address the inference challenge for the transition rate matrix \( Q \) by transforming the problem into a discrete-time inhomogeneous HMM and leveraging two recently proposed techniques (Expfm, Unif - from Hobolth & Jensen 2011) to compute sufficient statistics for their EM algorithm. They provide a comprehensive time complexity analysis for the various algorithmic variants (Table 1) before presenting experimental results. The experiments include evaluations on a synthetic dataset with 5 states and two real-world disease progression datasets for Glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
Pros: The paper is generally well-written and tackles an important problem, both from a computational perspective and in terms of its relevance to modeling and biomedical applications. The authors build on the mathematical framework established by Hobolth & Jensen (2011) and adapt it effectively to the specific problem at hand. Additionally, they provide a clear explanation of the biomedical datasets and research questions, while contextualizing their results within the broader understanding of these diseases.
Cons:  
1. The evaluation on synthetic data is insufficient. Why limit the analysis to 5 states? Training on \( 10^6 \) samples seems excessive and unrepresentative of real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the differences between state emissions (lines 319-320) appear overly simplistic, which might explain why all algorithmic variants perform similarly. Testing under more challenging conditions and varying parameters could better highlight differences between the methods and provide a clearer picture of their real-world applicability.  
2. Section 5.2 is somewhat opaque, particularly in its description of competing methods. Adding more details about these methods in an appendix could improve clarity and make this section more accessible.
Minor comments:  
1. Figure 2 is not self-contained, and its first reference (line 40) is premature.  
2. Line 91: "the rate the process" needs revision.  
3. Line 161: "in only at" is unclear.  
4. Section 5.2: The claim about binary search (lines 348-350) lacks clarity.  
5. Line 399: "to shown" should be corrected.  
In summary, the paper develops efficient methods for parameter learning and inference in CT-HMMs and applies these methods to two disease progression datasets.
