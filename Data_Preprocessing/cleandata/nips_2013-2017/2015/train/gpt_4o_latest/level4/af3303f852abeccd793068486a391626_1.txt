The algorithm presented in the paper employs the KL divergence between the true posterior and the proposed posterior as its objective function. To estimate the KL divergence, it leverages stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for efficient posterior sampling, while stochastic gradient descent is utilized for optimization.
The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow. The approach, though straightforward, is effective, and the examples included in the paper demonstrate its advantages persuasively.
This work introduces a stochastic gradient-based method for training a parametric model of the posterior predictive distribution within a Bayesian framework.
