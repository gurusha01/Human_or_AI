The paper investigates the EM algorithm in a high-dimensional context, establishing convergence results and developing an inference procedure.
The authors should elaborate on the conditions under which the initial solution, \(\beta^{\rm init}\), satisfying the requirement stated in line 60 on page 2, can be identified.
Two algorithms are introduced in the paper. Is there practical guidance on selecting one over the other?
How should \(\hat{s}\) and \(\lambda\) be chosen in practice? How sensitive are the results to these tuning parameters? Can they be selected in a data-driven manner? In the high-dimensional inference literature, the choice of tuning parameters is critical for achieving desirable sampling properties.
The decorrelated score test is identical to that in [*]. This connection should be explicitly cited rather than understated. Are there any novel developments required to adapt the existing inference procedure to the current context?
The primary theoretical results rely on numerous technical conditions. The authors should discuss whether these conditions and assumptions are met for the latent variable models under consideration.
The paper extends [2] to a high-dimensional framework and applies the work of Ning and Liu [*] to the inference problem. While the paper cleverly integrates existing results, it should more clearly articulate what is genuinely novel and why applying these tools in this context is nontrivial. The submitted paper serves as a "trailer" for the extensive supplementary material, but this trailer should provide more insight into the technical challenges involved in establishing the main results.
