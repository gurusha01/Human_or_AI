Summary
The authors address the problem of minimizing a strongly convex or partially strongly convex function over a polyhedron. They present and analyze several variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Their results demonstrate that these algorithmic variants overcome the limitation of the standard Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which fails to exploit the strong convexity of the objective function. This leads to a proof of linear convergence for all the proposed variants. The analysis introduces a combinatorial positive constant related to a condition number for polyhedra. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are also provided.
Main comments
The paper introduces multiple versions of the original algorithm, some of which have been previously proposed in the literature. The linear convergence results for certain variants represent a novel and valuable contribution. Additionally, the pyramidal width concept introduced in this work could have broader applications beyond linear oracle-based methods. The proofs appear sound to the best of my understanding, and I do not identify any major issues with the content. Below, I outline several comments that should be addressed, some of which may require revisions to the text. Additional minor comments are provided in the subsequent section.
Detailed comments
- It would be beneficial to clarify the behavior of these algorithms when the strong convexity assumption does not hold.
- The paper places significant emphasis on affine invariance, which is indeed an important concept. However, the explanation could be made clearer. For instance, the surjectivity of the linear map seems to play a key role. Additionally, the claim that A is arbitrary in [17] (line 710) appears to be inaccurate, as the discussion on affine invariance in [17] explicitly mentions surjectivity.
- In the proof of Theorem 3 in the appendix, while the conclusion on line 640 seems correct, the reasoning provided is not entirely convincing. First, it would help to explicitly define what is meant by KKT. Second, KKT conditions only guarantee first-order stationarity, which may not suffice to conclude that the solution to minimizing a linear function over the intersection of a cone and the unit (Euclidean) sphere lies on the cone's relative boundary. For instance, in the cone $\RR_+ \times \RR$, $d = (-1,0)$ does not belong to the cone, and $y = (1,0)$ lies in the cone's interior while satisfying certain stationarity conditions, which might align with the KKT conditions the authors have in mind.
- The MNP variant necessitates a subroutine for minimizing the objective over an affine hull. Since $f$ is only defined on script M in the model, this slightly alters the problem's setting. Moreover, this has significant practical implications for implementation, which should be emphasized. Additionally, the line search in step 7 likely involves constraints, making it a more demanding requirement compared to other variants, which explicitly avoid such constraints (see line 163).
- The authors assert that the partially strongly convex model can be handled by simply substituting one constant for another. However, this claim seems overly simplistic, as the constants in (21) and (34) differ, particularly with a multiplicative factor of 2 appearing in different locations. Providing more detailed explanations would be helpful.
- The away-step variant under the partially strongly convex model was previously analyzed in [4]. It would be valuable to compare the convergence rates derived here with those in [4]. A discussion based on cases where the pyramidal width is known would be particularly insightful.
- For the simplex, the equivalence between the pyramidal width and the width requires further justification. Additionally, the presentation would benefit from a more precise citation of [2], specifically identifying which results from [2] are being referenced.
- To my knowledge, the convergence analysis in [12] does not address the case of "strongly convex objective + strongly convex set." In fact, this paper identifies linear convergence for such cases as an open problem, contrary to the claim made in the introduction.
Minor comments
- The abstract mentions "weaker condition than strong convexity." Consider adding "of the objective" for clarity.
- It might be helpful to include a reference regarding the convergence rates of the projected gradient method.
- Line 99: Typo in "While the tracking the active set."
- Footnote 3: The lower bound applies to specific sequences that never reach the face of interest. It does not hold universally and depends on the initialization and the problem.
- Line (151): The statement that the active set is small may not hold after many iterations unless specific steps are taken to optimize the vertex representation.
- Line 178: "is to in each step only move" would be clearer with commas added.
- Line 188: Typo in "due our."
- Line 210: Typo in "more computed more efficiently."
- Line 212: Consider replacing "overarching" with a more precise term.
- Equation (7) could be summarized as $ht \geq \min{gt/2, g_t^2/(LM^2)}$.
- The authors conjecture that the constant they introduce is nonincreasing. Do they have any intuition for this conjecture beyond the observation that the constant is smaller for the cube than for the simplex?
- Figure 2 is difficult to read and could be improved for clarity.
- On page 12 (appendix), the notation $r$ is used to denote two different things in the main text and footnote 7. Similarly, $y$ is used inconsistently.
- The argument following (14) moves too quickly and omits important details. It should be explicitly stated that (14) is equivalent to the problem described on line 640. Additionally, $y$ and $y^*$ are used to denote the decision variable and solution of two different problems, which could cause confusion.
- Line 689: (14) should be (15).
- Line 700 refers to "the appendix," but this section is itself part of the appendix.
- Line 950: "drop step" should likely be "swap step."
- In Equation (33), $B$ should be $B_1$. Linear convergence is a novel result for some of the proposed variants and represents a meaningful contribution. I do not identify any major issues with the content of this work.
