This paper addresses the challenge of computing average statistics in a distributed setting. While the proposed algorithm is fairly intuitive, it appears to lack significant novelty, although the accompanying proofs are thorough and well-presented.
A notable weakness of the paper is the absence of comparisons with baseline methods. It seems feasible to construct several intuitive baselines, particularly using randomized algorithms, and these should have been included in the experimental evaluation. While the problem tackled is interesting, the evaluation remains insufficient due to the lack of baseline comparisons.
