This paper introduces a (Budgeted) Quick-Sort algorithm to address the rank elicitation problem within the dueling bandits framework. The proposed algorithm operates by aligning the observed data with a Plackett-Luce (P-L) distribution. Based on this assumption, the authors provide a theoretical analysis of the model and evaluate its performance empirically.
While I find the core idea of the paper intriguing, I have a few reservations, particularly regarding the restrictive nature of the model. In comparison to related work in the dueling bandits literature, the analysis here relies heavily on the assumption that the data adheres strictly to a P-L distribution. Since both the theoretical and empirical results hinge on this assumption, I am uncertain about the broader applicability of the approach when compared to existing algorithms. Including some analysis or experiments that account for even minor deviations from the P-L assumption would have significantly enhanced the paper's value, as real-world data rarely conforms perfectly to such a model. Additionally, I would have liked to see ranking metrics used to evaluate performance on the AMPR problem, alongside the optimal recovery rate, to gain deeper insights into the nature of the errors. Overall, this is an interesting application of QuickSort to the dueling bandits problem, but the impact may be limited due to the stringent modeling assumptions.
