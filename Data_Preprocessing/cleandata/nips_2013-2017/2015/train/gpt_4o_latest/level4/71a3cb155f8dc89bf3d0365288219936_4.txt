This paper is well-written, with clearly defined symbols, making it an enjoyable read. Some of the theoretical results build directly on the alternating projection algorithm for standard precision matrix estimation. In my view, the most insightful quantitative relationship presented is the equivalence between the tensor normal distribution and a multi-dimensional normal distribution (i.e., vec(T) ~ N(vec(0); \SigmaK \otimes...\otimes \Sigma1)). Greater emphasis on this relationship would help guide readers—particularly those already familiar with standard precision matrix estimation—through the results for tensor distributions. However, the primary limitation of this paper is the lack of strong motivation for why this more complex (albeit elegant) model is better suited for practical applications. Despite this, I recommend acceptance due to its theoretical contributions. The authors propose an alternating minimization algorithm that achieves a local optimum for estimating the precision matrices of a tensor normal distribution. The problem formulation extends the standard sparse precision matrix estimation problem. I recommend this paper for acceptance based on its technical contributions.
