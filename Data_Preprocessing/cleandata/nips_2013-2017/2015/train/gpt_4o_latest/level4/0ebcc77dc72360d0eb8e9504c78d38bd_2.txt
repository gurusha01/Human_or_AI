The paper introduces a variant of Bayesian Global Optimization in which future samples are determined using a space/interval partitioning algorithm.
By employing UCB, the method circumvents the (internal) global optimization challenge of selecting the next sample.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves exponential regret, offering theoretical improvements over prior work.
The algorithm is well-described and supported with an illustrative example.
The paper provides a novel contribution and is, on the whole, clearly written and presented.
However, I have one concern regarding the paper.
The experimental results appear to focus exclusively on 1D test functions (though this is not explicitly stated).
I suspect that the interval partitioning strategy may not scale effectively to higher-dimensional problems (e.g., hyperrectangles), as the "resolution" would likely need to grow exponentially.
This limitation connects to the well-known DIRECT algorithm, which is similarly known to struggle with high-dimensional problems.
I believe the authors should at least address this issue in the paper. While it does not detract from the theoretical contribution, it is an important consideration for practical applications.
Minor comments:
- p.2: UCB is mentioned "for brevity." Does this imply that other acquisition functions, such as expected improvement, could also be used? The phrasing suggests UCB is essential, but this could be clarified.
- p.3: The statement, "...we simultaneously conduct global and local searches based on all the candidates of the bounds," is unclear. Could this be rephrased for better understanding?
- p.4: The text states, "At n=16, the far right...but no function evaluation occurs." Could the authors clarify why this is the case?
In summary, the paper proposes a variant of Bayesian Global Optimization using a space/interval partitioning algorithm, achieving theoretical improvements (exponential regret). While the work is novel and appears sound, the evaluation seems limited to 1D test problems, which raises concerns about scalability to higher dimensions.
