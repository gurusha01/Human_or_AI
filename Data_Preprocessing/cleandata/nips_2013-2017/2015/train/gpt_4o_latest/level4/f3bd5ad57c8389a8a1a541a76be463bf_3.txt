The paper introduces a variant of Expectation Propagation (EP), termed SEP, which assumes that the local factor (site) approximations are identical. This assumption reduces memory requirements by a factor of N, making the method particularly advantageous for large-scale data applications, as only the global posterior approximation needs to be stored during EP iterations. Through experiments involving probit regression, Gaussian mixture models, and neural networks, the paper demonstrates that SEP can achieve accuracy levels comparable to EP.
Quality:
The proposed methods are adequately justified with references to prior work, and the experiments are well-executed. However, my primary concern lies in understanding the limitations of the SEP approximation. Specifically, in what scenarios does the SEP/AEP assumption break down? Section 5.1 suggests that DSEP, which allows for a manageable number of distinct local approximations, might be a more robust choice. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include simple examples illustrating cases where the approximation quality deteriorates.
Clarity:
The paper is well-written and logically organized. However, the analogy with SVI/VI could be elaborated upon in the main text for greater clarity. Similarly, the remarks on the VI limit of PEP (lines 138-140) could be expanded to clarify their connection to the discussion in [23]. In Appendix A.2, the approximate family and the definition of the natural parameters should be explicitly stated to improve the reader's understanding. 
Lines 152-154: In typical scenarios involving Gaussian approximations, the complexity of the site approximations is often much lower than DÂ². Additionally, doesn't this complexity frequently depend on the number of model factors being approximated for each site?
Originality:
The assumption of an average local factor is conceptually similar to AEP, which has already been published. Therefore, it would be helpful to summarize the comparison between DSEP and DAEP (e.g., from Figure 2 in the supplementary material) more prominently in the main text. While distributed EP approaches have been explored previously, I appreciate the paper's effort to consolidate various EP variants into a cohesive framework.
Significance:
The paper makes incremental contributions by extending the EP framework in multiple directions. While the contributions are not groundbreaking, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable synthesis of different EP variants. However, the models and scenarios where the SEP/AEP assumption might fail should be explored in greater depth to enhance the paper's impact.
