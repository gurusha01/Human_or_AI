The paper presents an interesting approach with potentially valuable results.
However, it is unclear whether the proposed bound would remain valid if the method were extended to a kernelized setting, where the kernel parameters are also optimized via cross-validation. This is particularly concerning since kernel and regularization parameters are often interdependent.
The experimental evaluation is somewhat limited, as it relies on only a few small datasets. This is especially problematic given the paper's emphasis on the computational practicality of the proposed bound.
Additionally, it is not evident that the bound facilitates the selection of better models compared to directly optimizing cross-validation error within a given computational budget.
That said, the method shows promise in mitigating the risk of over-tuning the regularization parameter, thereby reducing the likelihood of over-fitting the cross-validation estimate. The paper introduces a bound on cross-validation error for linear models and a procedure for identifying a parameter value with guaranteed cross-validation error.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents an intriguing idea, but the experimental evaluation could be strengthened.
