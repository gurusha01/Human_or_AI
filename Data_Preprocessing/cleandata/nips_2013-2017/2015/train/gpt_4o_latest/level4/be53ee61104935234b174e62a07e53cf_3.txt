This paper addresses the problem of Isotonic Regression using \( l_p \) norms as the error metric and introduces efficient algorithms with provable guarantees for this framework. The authors leverage concepts from the literature on nearly linear-time SDD solvers to design these fast algorithms.
Quality: This is a strong and well-executed paper. It is generally well-written, the ideas are presented clearly, and the results are noteworthy.
Clarity: The paper is overall clear. Key objects are defined, and the contributions are explicitly articulated. However, I would have appreciated some intuition from the authors on why the complexity improvement for the isotonic regression problem is achievable. What are the core insights or techniques that enabled this advancement? That said, I found this paper highly engaging. The connection between isotonic regression and a graph-theoretic problem is well-motivated, and the use of fast SDD solvers to derive practical algorithms with provable bounds is compelling. Additionally, the authors propose some intriguing ideas in their proof techniques.
