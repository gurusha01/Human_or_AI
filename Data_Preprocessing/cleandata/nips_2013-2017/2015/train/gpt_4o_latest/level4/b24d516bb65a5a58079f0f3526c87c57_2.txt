- It is worth noting that \( p{ij}(t) \) are subprobabilities, as \( \int{0}^{\infty} p_{ij}(t) < 1 \).
- Daneshmand et al. [ICML '14] also use the term "hazard matrix" to refer to a different quantity in the context of observed cascades. It would be helpful to clarify this distinction and highlight the differences.
- In Section 4.1, the authors do not explicitly specify that \( \alpha{ij} \in [0, 1) \). This clarification seems necessary for \( p{ij}(t) \) to qualify as a (sub)probability.
- The writing in the first paragraph of the introduction could be significantly improved.
- The authors cite [3] as an early work on influence maximization. However, [3] addresses a different problem and does not directly tackle influence maximization.
- The proof of Lemma 3 could benefit from a more explicit description. Specifically, the authors should clearly relate \( f(x) \), \( g(x) \), and \( \mu(x) \) to the actual functions in the problem setting. This would aid readers in understanding the definition of "right positive correlation," which is not formally defined.
- In Eq. (11) of the proof of Lemma 4, the authors should explicitly define \( a \) and \( x \) in the inequality \( \ln(1 - ax) \geq \ln(1-a)x \) to improve clarity for the reader.
- In Eq. (12), should \( fi(s) \) on the right-hand side instead be \( fj(s) \)?
- There is some very recent work that focuses on establishing the theoretical foundations of influence models. Specifically, there are sample complexity results for recovering influence models:
  Daneshmand et al., ICML 2014  
  Pouget-Abadie et al., ICML 2015  
  While these works differ from the current paper, mentioning them could help readers understand the ongoing interest in the theoretical analysis of such models.
The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of contagion diffusion in networks. They derive a novel non-asymptotic upper bound on the influence (the average number of infected nodes) of any source set in a network, as well as a lower bound on the critical time after which a contagion becomes supercritical. Their analysis leverages the concept of the Laplace Hazard matrix, an intuitive quantity that depends on the network structure and edge probability distributions, and builds on prior work. The derived bounds are quite general, and the authors demonstrate their applicability to several well-known diffusion models. The theoretical results are validated through a relatively brief (and possibly too shallow) experimental evaluation on synthetic data. The problem addressed is scientifically interesting and timely. To the best of my knowledge, there is no prior work on influence bounds for continuous-time diffusion networks. The paper is mathematically rigorous, though the experimental results could be more insightful and illustrative.
