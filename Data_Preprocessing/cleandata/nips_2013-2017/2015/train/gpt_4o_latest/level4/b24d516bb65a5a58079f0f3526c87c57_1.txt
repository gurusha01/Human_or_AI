This paper builds upon the NIPS'14 work [17] by providing an upper bound on the maximum influence and a lower bound on the critical diffusion time over networks. The key contribution lies in leveraging the Laplacian Hazard matrix, which incorporates the Laplace transform of the transmission rate function, as a generalization of the hazard matrix introduced in [17]. The authors establish a connection between the size of influence (i.e., the number of infected nodes) and the spectral radius of this matrix.
The paper also explores specific cases of transmission probabilities over time, such as constant, exponential, and SI/SIR models.
The insights and derived bounds presented in this work are novel, and the paper is well-structured and clearly written.
While I have not verified the accompanying proofs in detail, they appear reasonable. However, there are parts of the argument that I may not have fully understood, which contributes to my low confidence rating. Overall, this paper makes a theoretical contribution by extending the influence bounds, demonstrating their tightness through simulations, and showing potential applicability to algorithms and experimentation (though this aspect is not explored in the current paper).
