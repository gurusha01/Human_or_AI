This paper extends and generalizes the principle of implicit exploration introduced in "Efficient learning by implicit exploration in bandit problems with side observations," NIPS 2014. Implicit exploration involves leveraging a lower confidence bound to estimate the true loss.
While the prior analysis focused on expected regret, this work provides regret bounds that hold with high probability.
The primary contribution of the paper is to highlight the benefits of high-confidence algorithms that utilize implicit exploration. The key theoretical result is a general concentration inequality for the sum of losses, presented in Lemma 1. This result is then applied to three variants of non-stochastic bandit problems: the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with expert advice, tracking the best sequence of arms, and the MAB problem with side information. For each of these problems, the regret bound analysis demonstrates an improvement of approximately a factor of 2 in the pre-factors. Furthermore, while Exp3.P with explicit exploration is often outperformed by standard Exp3 in practice, the proposed Exp3-IX algorithm outperforms Exp3 in the single but noteworthy experiment conducted. Exp3-IX appears to be less sensitive to the choice of Î· and provides more robust regret estimations.
Remark 1: Exp3 is ineffective for the switching bandit problem (i.e., tracking the best sequence of arms). It would be valuable to include a comparison between Exp3.S and Exp3.SIX in scenarios where the best arm changes multiple times.  
Remark 2: There is a typo in lines 4-5 of Algorithm 1: `\hat` should be replaced with `\sim`, as indicated in the initial lines of the proof for Lemma 1.  
This paper is outstanding. It is exceptionally well-written, with a clear and logical progression of ideas. The theoretical results encompass a broad class of MAB problems and hold significant potential for reuse within the machine learning community. Additionally, the experiment effectively demonstrates the practical utility of implicit exploration.
