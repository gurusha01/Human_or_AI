After discussions with the other reviewers and careful consideration of the rebuttal, I maintain that this is a strong paper worthy of publication due to the elegance of its proposed approach and its potential to inspire further research on related methodologies. While I acknowledge that the experimental results are somewhat underwhelming, I believe the current score reflects the paper's merits appropriately. With stronger experimental outcomes, I might have rated it even higher. The paper is very well-written and introduces a nonconvex relaxation for the global optimization of decision trees with a fixed structure. The approach is elegant, though the experimental results leave room for improvement. A straightforward modification could involve, after applying the global optimization, discarding the final split in each tree and re-optimizing it along with the corresponding leaf node using standard techniques, which might yield better results. Additionally, it is crucial to assess whether the global optimization inherently increases the risk of overfitting.
