The paper introduces a novel greedy approach for streaming hypergraph clustering, aiming to minimize the maximum number of topics covered by a partitioning. The proposed algorithm is straightforward, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees, showing that it performs well under a balance assumption on the data, asymptotically recovering the hidden partitioning. Experimental comparisons with other simple algorithms on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized maximum load.
The authors note that comparisons with batch methods on real datasets were not feasible due to the high computational cost of such methods. However, conducting experiments on smaller datasets (or subsets of the datasets used) could be valuable. While the proposed method may not necessarily match the performance of batch techniques, it would be insightful to quantify the performance gap.
Minor issue: There is a double "the" on line 319. Overall, the paper presents a new greedy method for streaming hypergraph clustering, addressing a problem typically studied in the batch setting by extending it to the streaming model. The proposed method appears effective both theoretically and empirically.
