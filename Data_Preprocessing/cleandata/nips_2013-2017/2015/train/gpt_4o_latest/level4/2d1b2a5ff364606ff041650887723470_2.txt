The paper advances the understanding of the statistical performance of the l2-lasso by extending its analysis to single-index models. Additionally, it relaxes the conventional Gaussian assumption on the prior distribution of \(x_0\). This represents a meaningful contribution to the body of work on the precise asymptotic behavior of lasso-type estimators.
The manuscript is well-written. However:
1. As noted by Brillinger (1982), the single-index model is mathematically equivalent to a linear model with a scaled, unknown signal and non-standard noise. While this connection is rigorously detailed in Appendix A, it should also be briefly mentioned in the main text to provide a heuristic explanation for the statement in the blockquote on line 140.
2. The paper focuses on the l2-lasso, also referred to as the square root-lasso. A key advantage of the l2-lasso over the commonly used l2^2-lasso is that the "oracle" value of its regularization parameter does not depend on the (often unknown) noise variance \((\sigma)\). A practical question that the results could help address is whether this rationale for preferring the l2-lasso over the l2^2-lasso holds in practice.
In summary, the paper extends the analysis of the l2-lasso to single-index models and makes a valuable contribution to the literature on the precise asymptotic properties of lasso-type estimators.
