The paper introduces a novel generative unsupervised model designed to learn representations with several desirable properties, including sparsity, non-negativity, and high dimensionality. The proposed approach extends factor analysis by incorporating these desired properties through posterior regularization.
The model demonstrates strong performance both as an autoencoder for reconstruction tasks and as a pre-training mechanism for classification networks. It is thoroughly analyzed and evaluated, with results that effectively highlight its advantages.
Some comments: -- The rationale for employing five different gradient descent methods in the E-step of the learning process (lines 136â€“140) in the specified sequence requires further clarification. The choice appears somewhat arbitrary. -- An ablative analysis of RFN, where all constraints are removed (e.g., non-negativity in addition to normalization), would provide additional insights. Overall, the paper presents a method that is both analytically and empirically compelling, making it a valuable contribution to the NIPS audience.
