This paper introduces a method to directly learn the messages in message-passing inference (as in inference machines [8]) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation task.
First, it is important to highlight that [12] also explores learning messages in one-step message-passing inference. While the mathematical details in [12] are not well elaborated and the application domain differs (pose estimation), the underlying insight—that learning messages is more straightforward than learning potentials, and that CNNs can effectively be employed for this purpose—is similar. This paper lacks an acknowledgment of [12] and does not provide a discussion of its unique contributions in light of that prior work.
Second, examining the proposed approach more closely reveals that the final score vector for a pixel is computed as the sum of the scores produced by each factor-to-pixel message, where each factor-to-pixel message is generated by an independent deep network. This setup closely resembles an ensemble of four models trained with different initializations.
Notably, all other methods used for comparison (except ContextDCRF, which has a similar limitation) rely on a single network to make predictions. This observation suggests that a simple ensemble model would serve as a natural baseline for comparison. I strongly encourage the authors to evaluate such a baseline.
Given these two points, I have reservations regarding the originality and significance of the contribution. However, in terms of clarity, the paper is well-written, and the mathematical details are presented in a clear and comprehensible manner. Despite my concerns, I recommend the paper for acceptance because the idea of learning messages using CNNs is an important contribution, and the results achieved are state-of-the-art.
The concept of training a CNN to predict messages is both intriguing and well-articulated. However, it is worth noting that [12] also directly learns messages (in the context of one-step message-passing inference) using CNNs, albeit for a different application. Additionally, the ensemble effect arising from the use of multiple networks has not been explicitly disentangled (see above).
