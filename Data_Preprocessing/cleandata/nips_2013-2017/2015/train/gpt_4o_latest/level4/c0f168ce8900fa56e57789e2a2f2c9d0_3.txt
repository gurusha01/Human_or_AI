The authors investigate the projected Langevin Monte-Carlo (PLMC) algorithm for sampling from a log-concave density with compact support. They derive a polynomial-time bound for achieving a specified accuracy in sampling. This result is novel, nontrivial, and, in my view, represents a significant and intriguing contribution to the theoretical foundations of computational statistics and machine learning.
I carefully reviewed the proof (excluding the sections in the supplementary material) and verified all the details. I identified only a few minor typographical errors (see below). The proof is not only correct but also features an elegant argument leveraging the Skorohod embedding, which I believe will be appreciated by mathematically inclined readers.
Here are some minor remarks:  
- I suggest including in the discussion that the PLMC algorithm requires not only a first-order oracle but also a projector onto the compact set under consideration.  
- Regarding the discussion on H&R in Section 1.2: the authors appear to suggest that H&R relies on a zeroth-order oracle. However, my understanding is that H&R requires sampling from the restriction of the distribution on the line segments. Could the authors clarify the connection between these two tasks?  
- At the beginning of Section 2.1: why is it necessary to introduce the pair (x, φ)? It seems to me that introducing x alone would suffice. In that case, the equation on line 184 could be removed, and φ could be replaced by x-w in the equation on line 187.  
- Line 210: replace "dirac" with "Dirac."  
- Line 225: replace "path" with "paths."  
- Line 244 and Eq. (3): in these two expressions, replace \(\bar{W}T\) with \(\bar{W}t\) (use lowercase \(t\) instead of uppercase \(T\)).  
- Line 298: please provide a precise reference for the version of the Khintchine inequality used.  
- Line 321: could you include a reference explicitly stating that the uniform distribution on a compact set is a stationary distribution for the reflected Brownian motion?  
Note: In the confidence evaluation, I assigned a score of 4 (rather than 5) solely because I cannot fully guarantee my assessment of the paper without thoroughly reviewing all the details of the proofs provided in the supplementary material.
This paper presents an elegant and original theoretical result on the computational complexity of sampling from a compactly supported distribution with a log-concave density, given access to a first-order oracle. The contribution addresses an important and underexplored topic that deserves greater attention.
