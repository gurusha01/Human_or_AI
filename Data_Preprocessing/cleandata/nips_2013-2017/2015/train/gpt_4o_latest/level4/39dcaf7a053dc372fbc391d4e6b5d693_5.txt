The topic of this paper lies well outside my area of expertise. However, I found the paper to be clearly written, with the motivations for the proposed architecture both compelling and intuitive. The results presented appear to support the hypothesis, making this a valuable contribution. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a more detailed analysis and recommend that the committee and authors place greater weight on the assessments from other reviewers. This work introduces a novel architecture for detecting neuronal boundaries in 3D scans. Its primary contribution is the interpolation of boundary classifications derived from 3D convnets and 2D convnets, which, when combined, yield improved performance.
