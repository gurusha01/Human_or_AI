Paraphrased Review:
Summary:  
This paper investigates the Generalized Lasso in the context of non-linear measurements with a Gaussian design. A commonly used heuristic assumes that non-linear observations can be approximated as noisy linear observations. Building on the foundational work of Plan and Vershynin [17], the authors extend these results and, by transitioning to an asymptotic regime, derive novel, precise, and explicit expressions for the estimation error. The accuracy of these predictions is validated through several special cases, including the Lasso, group Lasso, and nuclear norm. The discussion on designing optimal quantizers in the context of q-Bit compressed sensing (CS) and its connection to the Lloyd-Max quantizer is particularly insightful.
Quality:  
This is a commendable and well-executed piece of research.
Clarity:  
The paper is generally well-written, though the presentation feels slightly unbalanced. Space limitations appear to have constrained the inclusion of some necessary details.
Originality:  
The work builds upon Plan and Vershynin [17] and introduces several novel contributions. Notably, the explicit expressions for the estimation error performance are new and significant.
Comments:  
1. Page 4, line 193: The regularized and penalized formulations are equivalent under the appropriate correspondence.  
2. Caption of Figure 1: Replace 'n=768' with '$n$=768' for consistency.  
3. Page 5, line 247: There is a typo in the phrase starting with "When ...".  
4. Page 5, line 294: The term referred to as the proximal function is well-known in convex analysis as the Moreau envelope of index \(\tau\). The notation used here is unconventional, as "prox" is typically reserved for the proximal operator or proximal point. I recommend revising the notation.  
5. Page 5, Assumption 1: It would be beneficial to provide a more formal interpretation of this assumption using concepts from variational analysis.  
6. The authors should refrain from referring to the Generalized Lasso as an "algorithm" in the text. It is more accurately described as a (convex) program or, using terminology common in compressed sensing, a "decoder," but not an algorithm.  
7. Experiments: The authors demonstrate the application of the Generalized Lasso to non-linear measurements and show how their theoretical results predict the estimation error. This paper establishes that, asymptotically, the estimation performance of the Generalized Lasso under non-linear measurements is equivalent to that under noisy (Gaussian) linear measurements. The authors derive novel, precise, and explicit expressions for the estimation error and validate their findings through several special cases, including the Lasso, group Lasso, and nuclear norm. The discussion on designing optimal quantizers in q-Bit CS and its connection to the Lloyd-Max quantizer is particularly insightful.
