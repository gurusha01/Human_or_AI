The paper offers theoretical justification for the common neighbors heuristic in link prediction. Within the stochastic blockmodel framework, the authors demonstrate that for dense graphs, the heuristic effectively recovers the clusters. For sparser graphs, the heuristic combined with a cleaning step achieves successful cluster recovery.
The problem addressed is analogous to clustering a realization of the stochastic blockmodel with weakly dependent edges. To the best of my (limited) understanding of the field, this specific model has not been previously studied. However, existing proof techniques can be readily adapted to this context. Overall, the paper is well-written. If the common neighbors heuristic is widely used in practice but lacks theoretical grounding, this work represents a valuable contribution to the literature.
