- It would be helpful to clarify upfront that full model knowledge (Eq. 6) is required.
- Sections 4 and 6 are imbalanced in terms of content and detail.
- Section 4 does not address the recurrent units mentioned in the abstract.
- Line 405: In what sense is this a stochastic neural network? While the training data is stochastic, the network itself appears deterministic.
Rebuttal ======== Thank you for providing the additional details. LIGHT REVIEW The paper demonstrates promising results but would benefit from restructuring.
