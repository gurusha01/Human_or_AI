The paper introduces a novel approach for time-sensitive recommendations derived from user activities. Unlike existing methods, it tackles the challenge of time-varying user preferences. Additionally, the paper explores the prediction of a user's next returning time. The learning process is implemented using an efficient optimization algorithm proposed by the authors. The experimental evaluation includes results on one synthetic dataset to demonstrate scalability on large-scale data and two real-world datasets of moderate size.
First, is the issue of time-varying user preferences truly widespread? It would be beneficial to analyze the real datasets used in the experiments to substantiate this claim. If this variability exists, is it primarily driven by trends such as the release of new popular songs, or are there other underlying patterns?
What is the rationale behind predicting a user's next returning time? It would strengthen the paper to provide a clear motivation for this task before presenting it as a contribution. How might a web company utilize such predictions, and for what specific purposes?
There appear to be some straightforward baseline methods for predicting the next returning time that were not evaluated: (1) using the most recent time delay, and (2) using the most frequently occurring time delay. Furthermore, predicting the exact returning time may be overly ambitious. A more practical and achievable alternative could involve categorizing delays into intervals, such as short (1–5 days), medium (5–14 days), long (14–33 days), or very long (>33 days), and predicting which category a user falls into.
Regarding the experimental section, it was difficult to gauge the significance of the performance improvement over SVD. Is the improvement substantial (e.g., an order of magnitude) or relatively modest? Would the difference be noticeable to an end user? Additionally, how would these recommendations compare to simply recommending popular items? This is often a challenging baseline to surpass, particularly if the list of popular items is updated daily.
Minor comments:
1) Typo in the last paragraph of page 3: "and is abel to capture" should be corrected to "and is able to capture."
2) In the first paragraph of Section 2, the introduction of retweets and link creation in social networks lacks references and feels abrupt. The shift in context is confusing and could benefit from rephrasing for clarity.
Overall, the paper addresses two key problems: time-sensitive recommendations and user returning time prediction. However, it lacks a strong justification for the relevance of these problems and their potential impact. Several baselines and analyses are missing (details provided above). While the paper is generally acceptable, it falls into the category of an OK/marginal submission.
