The authors state that the effective receptive field of each unit increases with larger T (Line 174, Page 4). However, I find this point unclear. Given that a still image is provided as input to the network, how does the receptive field of each unit expand with increasing T? Could you provide clarification on this? The paper introduces a recurrent convolutional layer for CNNs to enhance scene image parsing performance. The proposed algorithm appears technically solid, and the results are promising.
