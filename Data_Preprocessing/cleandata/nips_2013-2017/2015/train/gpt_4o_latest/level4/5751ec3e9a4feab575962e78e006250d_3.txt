In this paper, the authors propose population Bayesian inference tailored for stream data.
By incorporating a population distribution, the authors aim to enhance model flexibility through the population posterior. To facilitate model parameter learning, they introduce stochastic population variational inference.
The experimental results are presented in comparison with stream VB and stochastic VB.
However, several issues require attention: 1) A clearer explanation of the necessity of the population distribution is needed.
2) The paper claims that population VB can capture changes in the data stream. However, if all data points are derived from the current dataset, what distinguishes population VB from SVI? Additionally, how does the sampling procedure in population VB effectively capture changes in the current stream if all data samples are treated equally?
3) While the inclusion of a population distribution and parameter  may result in a more flexible model, it also introduces higher computational costs due to the sampling procedure and the need for additional parameter tuning. Could the authors provide a quantified computation time for all three methods across the datasets? Furthermore, more details are needed on how to select .
4) An explanation is required for why population VB underperforms compared to stream VB on the Twitter dataset.
Although population Bayesian inference is proposed, it currently lacks sufficient technical rigor.
