The objective of the paper is well-defined, and the experimental results are robust. Nonetheless, the paper is somewhat difficult to follow, with several unclear aspects outlined below:  
1. Why is RPN translation-invariant, whereas [19] is not? How does this compare to Overfeat?  
2. Numerous parameters are manually set without sufficient justification or analysis. For instance, why were n=3 and k=9 chosen?  
3. The training procedure appears to be complex and unstable. Why not repeat the same training procedure multiple times? Have the authors experimented with various settings and concluded that the current one yields the best performance?  
The authors introduce an innovative region proposal method that leverages the shared CNN features used for object localization. This region proposal method incorporates a classification layer to distinguish objects from non-objects and a regression layer to predict object bounding boxes. By sharing feature computation with the object localization module, the proposed RCNN achieves approximately 10x faster performance compared to fast RCNN, with a slight improvement in accuracy. Given that the object localization CNN's training process assumes pre-defined regions, the authors propose an alternative multi-stage training procedure to address this challenge.
