This paper presents a novel deep convolutional network designed for the segmentation of neurons in EM image stacks. The primary contribution lies in the arrangement of filters within a relatively deep network and the integration of 3D filters. The paper is well-written, clear, and of high quality overall. The authors seem to have advanced prior methods, and the application area holds significant importance for neuroscience. While the work does not introduce fundamentally new insights beyond the specifics of the architecture, it is still a strong contribution. In summary, this is a solid paper, even if the novelty primarily resides in the detailed implementation.
