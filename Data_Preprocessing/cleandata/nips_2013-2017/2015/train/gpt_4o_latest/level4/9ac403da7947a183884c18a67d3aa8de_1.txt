The authors address the challenge of handling cases where bidirected edges (<->) and undirected edges (-) coexist in loopless mixed graphs. They introduce a novel construction called the segregated graph (SG), a type of mixed graph where bidirected edges (<->) and undirected edges (-) are segregated, ensuring that all conditional independencies among the observed variables are preserved.
I appreciate the originality of the proposed idea. However, I find the clarity of the paper lacking, which impacts its overall quality. Additionally, the significance of the problem being addressed is not sufficiently emphasized. Below, I provide a more detailed evaluation for each criterion:  
Clarity: I commend the authors for their effort to provide a high-level overview before delving into the details, as this helps to some extent in setting the context. However, the clarity diminishes when examining the technical details due to the presence of typos and undefined or undeclared symbols. Adopting notations from well-known and recent publications in this area, such as [4], [1], and [2], would significantly enhance readability.  
Quality: The lack of clarity negatively affects the overall quality of the paper. Additionally, I observed that moving most of the proofs to the supplementary material could free up 2-3 pages of space in the main text. This would allow the authors to include more substantive content and improve the presentation.  
Originality: The paper demonstrates good originality.  
Significance: The importance of the problem is only briefly mentioned (lines 128-129) and could benefit from further elaboration, particularly in the discussion of its implications in the conclusion section.  
Missing references: The authors should consider including the following references to strengthen the paper:  
[1*] Sadeghi, K. and Lauritzen, S. (2014). Markov properties for mixed graphs. Bernoulli 20, 676-696. MR3178514  
[2*] Wermuth, N. (2011). Probability distributions with summary graph structure. Bernoulli 17, 845-879. MR2817608  
After discussions with other reviewers and considering the authors' response, I have increased my score by one level. This paper introduces segregated graphs as a solution to a specific issue in loopless mixed graphs, where bidirected edges (<->) and undirected edges (-) intersect.
