This paper introduces a novel property of hypergraphs that aids in bounding the mixing time of Gibbs sampling. Since analyzing mixing time is a notoriously challenging problem in MCMC, this work addresses a significant issue in Gibbs sampling. The authors define a concept called hierarchy width for factor graphs. The main theoretical result demonstrated in the paper is that the mixing time is exponential in both the hierarchy width of the factor graph and the maximum difference in weights encoded by its potentials. Furthermore, the authors show that for certain factor graph templates, these results can be leveraged to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling polynomially in the number of variables that instantiate the templates.
The primary contribution of the paper lies in its theoretical findings, which establish that Gibbs sampling mixes rapidly for specific classes of template factor graphs.
However, Figure 1 feels disconnected from the flow of the paper. It is difficult to interpret this figure because much of the necessary explanation appears much later in the text.
One major challenge in Gibbs sampling is poor mixing when the potentials contain 0 values (or exhibit near-determinism). It was unclear how the results in this paper would generalize to such cases. Are there specific assumptions about the structure of the underlying distribution that address this issue?
Additionally, I was curious about the typical treewidth of factor graph templates that are hierarchical. Specifically, is it possible to construct high-treewidth models using these templates? If not, approximate inference methods like Gibbs sampling may not even be necessary.
I also found the discussion of the three semantics somewhat unclear. What do the three semantics represent, and is there a trade-off in using the logical/ratio semantics (where the results hold) compared to the linear semantics (where the results do not hold)?
Regarding real-world applications, I wondered whether the results on rapid mixing still hold if only subgraphs of the factor graph are hierarchical. My understanding from Section 3.1 is that the entire factor graph template must be hierarchical for the results to apply. How frequently does this occur in practice?
In summary, this paper provides a rigorous proof that Gibbs sampling mixes in polynomial time for certain template factor graphs with hierarchical structure. The paper is generally well-written and tackles a challenging problem. However, the experiments section could benefit from additional details about the applicability of the results to real-world scenarios.
