The authors propose a multinomial logit (MNL) model to characterize user preferences, where (a) in a collaborative ranking context, a low-rank matrix is employed to represent the underlying preferences, and (b) in bundled choice modeling, the low-rank structure captures the pairing of items. To establish theoretical bounds, the authors utilize the random utility model.
A notable contribution of this work is the development of a polynomial-time inference algorithm, despite the intractability of Maximum Likelihood estimation for the general MNL model. While there is room for improvement, this paper could serve as a stepping stone toward more efficient and generalized approaches.
By highlighting the limitations of the model (e.g., as discussed above equation 10), the authors provide insights that could drive further advancements in this area of research. The paper demonstrates that the convex relaxation via nuclear norm minimization is minimax optimal. Additionally, the authors derive an upper bound on the error with finite samples and establish a matching lower bound.
