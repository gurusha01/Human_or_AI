Review - Summary:  
The authors explore the theoretical underpinnings of utilizing Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)-based techniques to capture the topological invariants of persistent homology. Their investigation centers on the universality of potential kernel representations. They illustrate the effectiveness of their method through an example involving two-sample hypothesis testing.
General Remarks:  
--- The formulation of Proposition 2 could be reframed, as the exponential mapping employed therein may be interpreted as a projection from the manifold of positive semidefinite kernels onto the corresponding tangent space. Examining the properties of this manifold could open avenues for alternative generalizations. For instance, analyzing the sensitivity of universality to the local characteristics of the manifold might enable an extension of the proposition's applicability.  
--- The paper exclusively considers the solution of the heat diffusion equation as a source for potential kernel representations. It would be valuable to explore other possibilities, such as leveraging results from discrete differential geometry, which may offer alternative feature mappings relevant in this context.  
--- The proposed methodology is demonstrated through discriminative hypothesis testing. To further validate its utility, comparisons with discriminative learning methods could be conducted. Such control experiments, for instance, on randomly selected point clouds representing balls and tori, could reinforce the applicability of the approach.  
Pros:  
The authors present a thorough introduction to topological data analysis and the potential kernel representation of the associated problems.  
Cons:  
The authors do not clearly articulate why the universality of a kernel is advantageous in a learning context. Identifying a family of problems where this approach offers distinct benefits would significantly strengthen the paper.
