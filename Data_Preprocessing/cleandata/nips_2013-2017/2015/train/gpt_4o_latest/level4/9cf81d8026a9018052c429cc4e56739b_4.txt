This is a relatively light review. Specifically, similar approaches include:  
- Shuai Zheng, Sadeep Jayasumana, Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Chang Huang, and Philip Torr, available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03240.  
- Reference [15] should be added to the results table, perhaps marked with a star to indicate the use of different or additional training data.  
The paper extends the recurrent neural network methodology for object detection [13] to the task of scene labeling/semantic segmentation. While the proposed approach surpasses baseline methods, it does not outperform state-of-the-art techniques. The authors are encouraged to provide a clearer conceptual, quantitative, and methodological comparison of their work to existing semantic segmentation tasks, datasets, and related approaches.
