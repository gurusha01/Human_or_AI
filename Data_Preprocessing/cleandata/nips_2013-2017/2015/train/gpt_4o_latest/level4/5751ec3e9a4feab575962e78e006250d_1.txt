Update after author feedback and discussion: I am disappointed with the authors' response, particularly their lack of engagement with the practicality of applying the method to real-world streaming data, which has led me to lower my score. Based on my understanding, the algorithm appears to allow for the resampling of earlier data points, necessitating the storage and repeated access to the entire data stream. This approach is fundamentally different from true streaming algorithms, and this distinction should have been made more explicit. The work presents an interesting idea to generalize Bayesian inference for infinite data streams. However, I would have appreciated more exploration of alternative approaches to the problem within a Bayesian framework by modifying the model. Additionally, it remains unclear how this method qualifies as streaming, given that it may theoretically require resampling the earliest data points even at much later stages.
