This paper investigates the use of the common neighbors heuristic for link prediction and local clustering around a query node within the stochastic blockmodel framework. The authors theoretically demonstrate that the common neighbors heuristic can identify clusters with high probability when the graph is sufficiently dense and can also succeed in sparser graphs by incorporating a cleaning step.
The overall quality of the paper is good. Its clarity is acceptable, though certain sections are challenging to follow. In the final part, the authors compare SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN against state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world datasets. However, SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN appear to underperform compared to Spectral Clustering and Katz. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore and discuss potential reasons for this discrepancy. For instance, real-world networks might not align well with the theoretical assumptions underlying the proposed methods. A deeper discussion, analysis, and experimentation on these aspects would strengthen the paper. This work presents a compelling and interesting study, and overall, it appears reasonable and convincing.
