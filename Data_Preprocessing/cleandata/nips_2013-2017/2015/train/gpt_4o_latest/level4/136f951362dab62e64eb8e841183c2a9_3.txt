This paper introduces a novel algorithm for addressing time-sensitive recommendation by leveraging the low-rank structure of a user-item matrix and incorporating the Hawkes process. The proposed algorithm is designed to be solved in a distributed manner and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.
Quality: Overall, I believe the paper adopts a principled approach by modeling the observations (ratings) through stochastic processes. However, I have a few comments.
One concern lies in the theoretical aspects, specifically in Eq. (8) and Theorem 2. In Eq. (8), over which parameter is the maximum taken? Is it with respect to \(\rho\)? If so, could \(\rho^*\) become unbounded? Furthermore, Theorem 2 is not utilized when selecting \(\rho\) in the experiments, which diminishes the significance of the theorem.
Another point pertains to the baselines used in the experiments. To the best of my knowledge, SVD++ [17], the winner of the Netflix challenge, is among the most effective algorithms for time-sensitive recommendation. Including SVD++ as a baseline would further enhance the quality of the evaluation. That said, I am not dissatisfied with the current baselines.
Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
Originality: In my opinion, the paper appears to be novel, as time-sensitive recommendation is still a relatively new research area.
Significance: I believe time-sensitive recommendation has the potential to be impactful.
