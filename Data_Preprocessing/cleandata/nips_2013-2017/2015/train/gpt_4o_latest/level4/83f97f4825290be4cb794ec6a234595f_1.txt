This paper introduces a straightforward greedy approach to address the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem within the streaming model. It also defines a stochastic framework for generating input hypergraphs and establishes sufficient conditions for the asymptotic recovery of hidden clusters in hypergraphs generated under this model.
I believe the paper tackles an intriguing and significant problem. The proposed stochastic model for hypergraph generation appears both novel and interesting. It is particularly compelling to observe that the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem can be nearly recovered under specific conditions of the hypergraph.
However, my primary concern lies in the practicality of the proposed stochastic model for generating hypergraphs. Specifically, is the assumption of hidden co-clustering in the data generation process realistic in real-world scenarios? I would like to see more justification or evidence supporting the naturalness of this model for practical applications.
Additionally, the authors should reference a recent, highly relevant paper that addresses a similar min-max graph partitioning problem and introduces an offline greedy algorithm closely related to the one proposed in this work. The offline greedy algorithm is reported to have a time complexity of O(k|E|), where k represents the number of parts in the partitioning and |E| denotes the number of edges in the bipartite graph. I am curious to see a comparative empirical evaluation of the streaming greedy algorithm against the offline greedy algorithm.

Minor Comments:
- Lines 168-171: This section of the paper seems to argue that random partitioning of the hypergraph can lead to poor performance. However, it only demonstrates that random partitioning results in a cost of (1-1/e)m, without clarifying what the global optimum would be. This makes the argument incomplete or unclear.
- Description of Algorithm 1 (Lines 216-225): The notations used in Algorithm 1 are somewhat confusing. Initially, Si is defined as the assignment of items, which suggests that Si should represent the set of items in block i. However, in the algorithm's description, S_i appears to refer to the set of topics covered by the items in block i. This inconsistency in notation makes the explanation difficult to follow.
In summary, this paper presents a simple greedy strategy for the min-max hypergraph partitioning problem under the streaming model, along with a stochastic model for hypergraph generation and conditions for asymptotic cluster recovery.
