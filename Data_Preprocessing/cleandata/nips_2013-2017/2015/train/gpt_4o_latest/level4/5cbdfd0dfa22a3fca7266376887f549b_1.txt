In this paper, the authors propose a modified Leurgans' algorithm for performing decompositions on sparse and low-rank tensors. Tensor decomposition is a challenging and computationally intensive task, making it valuable to explore efficient algorithms tailored for sparse and low-rank tensors. The authors focus on order-3 tensors as examples, providing a clear presentation of the algorithm and a theoretical discussion of its efficiency. In Section 4, they also discuss the potential extension of the algorithm to higher-order tensors. The paper is well-structured. Below are some questions and comments:
(1) The proposed algorithm requires performing multiple eigenvalue decompositions on matrices, which are computationally demanding. Additionally, it involves solving two convex matrix optimization problems (Equation 6). Can this method handle large-scale tensor decompositions effectively? How is sparsity defined in the context of this paper? What is the largest tensor that can be decomposed using this algorithm? In Section 2.2, the numerical examples only include results for a 50-dimensional order-3 tensor, which is insufficient to demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency comprehensively.
(2) On Page 2, Line 071, the definition of low-rank is given as \( r \leq n_1 \). In the numerical implementation section (Section 2.2), results are presented for a \( 50 \times 50 \times 50 \) tensor with \( r = 1-4 \), which represents very small ranks. What are the computational results for \( r = 40-49 \)? Are they similarly efficient, or does the algorithm only perform well for very small \( r \)?
(3) In Section 2.2, how is Problem (6) solved in the implementation? Additional clarification on this point would be helpful.
Other suggestions:
- Typo on Line 093: "the resulting \( n \times n \) matrix" should be "the resulting \( n1 \times n2 \) matrix."
- Typo on Lines 96-98: The summation index should be corrected from \( \sumk \) to \( \sumi \).
- Typo on Page 5, Line 216: \( Xa \) should be \( Xa^3 \).
- Typo on Page 4, Line 198: "coefficient" should be corrected to "coefficient."
While the paper introduces a modified Leurgans' algorithm for sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition and is well-organized, the numerical implementation section is insufficient. It only provides results for a specific order-3 tensor with very small \( r \). Including more diverse examples would strengthen the paper.
