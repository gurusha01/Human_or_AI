The paper introduces both synchronous and asynchronous gossip algorithms for U-statistics, deriving their methodologies and demonstrating that they achieve convergence rates of 1/t and log t / t, respectively.
The manuscript is well-structured and includes results that effectively highlight the performance of the proposed methods. The topic is of moderate interest, and the techniques presented are valuable to researchers in the field. This work proposes novel gossip algorithms for estimating U-statistics, offering advantageous convergence rates. Experimental results validate their performance benefits compared to existing methods and showcase their accuracy.
