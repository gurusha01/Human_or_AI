The paper presents incremental advancements in Isotonic Regression with $\ell_p$-norms.
A significant portion of the paper's contributions is detailed in the supplemental section, making it challenging to fully grasp the work's impact based solely on the main sections.
Additionally, the paper includes limited experimental results.
No comparative experimental analysis is provided.
Although the results are promising, better organization and more extensive experimentation would strengthen the authors' contributions. The paper offers enhanced methods for Isotonic Regression. While the methodology is examined in detail, additional experimental comparisons with existing approaches in the literature would be valuable.
