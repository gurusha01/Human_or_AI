The paper is well-motivated and well-written. The results of the proposed approach are demonstrated on two datasets, evaluated using the average relative AUC error. When compared to the baseline (U2-gossip), the proposed method shows significantly better performance across various scenarios (graphs). Additionally, the paper provides convergence bounds for the proposed method. However, I would recommend including run-time comparisons per iteration for both the proposed method and U2-gossip. If the proposed method's iterations are substantially slower than those of U2-gossip, the practical utility of the paper could be limited. The work introduces both synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics.
