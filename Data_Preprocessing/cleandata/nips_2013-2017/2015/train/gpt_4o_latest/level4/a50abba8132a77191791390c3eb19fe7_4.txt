This paper introduces several techniques to accelerate SVRG, including increasing the batch size, combining SGD with SVRG, and implementing a novel minibatching strategy.
Specific comments:  
1. It would be beneficial to include an empirical comparison against a well-optimized SGD implementation.  
2. The derivation of the results for "time to reach Eest + Eopt for FG and SVRG" is unclear. E_est should depend solely on n, and for α = 1, it is expected to scale as O(1/n). The emergence of terms like log²(1/ε) and d² requires further clarification.  
Overall, this is a well-executed paper that introduces several enhancements to SVRG.
