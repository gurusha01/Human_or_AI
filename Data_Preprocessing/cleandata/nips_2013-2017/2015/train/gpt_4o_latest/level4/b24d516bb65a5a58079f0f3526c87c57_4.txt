Understanding the process of influence maximization is essential in various fields such as epidemiology, computer networks, and marketing. The CTIC model is the most commonly used framework for capturing the temporal dynamics of cascade processes. A key challenge lies in assessing the quality of results, and prior research has demonstrated that the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix plays a pivotal role, providing a tight bound for influence in general graphs. 
In this work, the authors build on previous research by addressing anytime influence bounds. They introduce definitions for sub-critical and super-critical contagions, derive a lower bound for when a contagion transitions to being super-critical, and demonstrate the applicability of their approach to multiple contagion models. The proofs appear thorough and well-constructed. The experimental results validate the model's effectiveness on synthetic datasets, though it would be valuable to evaluate its scalability on large, real-world graphs.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents itself as a solid contribution. However, its weaker aspects include limited novelty and the absence of evaluations on real-world datasets.
