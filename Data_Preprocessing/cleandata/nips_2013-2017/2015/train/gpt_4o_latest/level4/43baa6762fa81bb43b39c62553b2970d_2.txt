Paraphrased Review:
Summary of the Paper:
The related but distinct problems of matrix completion and robust PCA, both approached via nuclear norm minimization, have traditionally relied on similar assumptions for recovery: the low-rank matrix must exhibit incoherence, and the samples (for matrix completion) or errors (for robust PCA) must be uniformly random.
Recently, it was demonstrated that matrix completion can achieve recovery, using the same convex optimization methods, even when the sampling is non-uniformâ€”provided this non-uniformity aligns with the notion of local coherence.
This paper extends that understanding to robust PCA, showing that exact recovery is achievable even when the errors are non-uniformly random, as long as this non-uniformity is similarly adapted to the local coherence of the low-rank matrix.
Quality:
The result presented in this paper is likely to be impactful and of broad interest. The techniques employed are novel, though they bear some resemblance to the recent methods used in analyzing matrix completion under local coherence.
However, the experimental results are less compelling. The low-rank matrices used in the experiments exhibit very similar local coherence properties, which limits the scope of the evaluation. A more convincing demonstration would involve testing on matrices with significantly different local coherence patterns. This could be achieved by pre- and post-multiplying the generated low-rank matrices with diagonal matrices that have a wide dynamic range in their diagonal entries.
Clarity:
The paper is well-written and clear, although the technical nature of the subject makes it somewhat dense and challenging to read.
Originality:
The paper builds on the recent insights into how local coherence enables recovery under non-uniform sampling in matrix completion and extends these ideas to the case of non-uniform errors in robust PCA. The results are original and represent a meaningful contribution to the field.
Significance:
Robust PCA is widely applicable, so any improvement in its theoretical understanding is significant. However, the paper does not propose a new algorithm; instead, it provides a deeper analysis of an already well-established method. As a result, the practical impact of the work may be somewhat limited.
It would have been valuable to include concrete examples where this type of non-uniformity naturally occurs and leads to noticeably improved recovery. For instance, in the context of graph clustering with clusters of unequal sizes, does the result imply that larger clusters can be sparser yet still recoverable? Overall, the paper presents interesting theoretical results on the ability of the standard robust PCA algorithm to handle non-uniform errors, provided these errors align with the local coherence of the matrix. While the analysis builds on prior work, it introduces a few noteworthy innovations.
