This paper contributes to the understanding of generalization error in adaptive data analysis by introducing the concept of max-information, establishing links to differential privacy and description length-based adaptive data analysis, and proposing new algorithms. Max-information is a natural and insightful quantity for addressing this problem, and I anticipate that this framework will inspire the development of novel algorithms and methodologies for accurate adaptive data analysis, including the description length-based approach discussed in the paper.
Quality: The paper tackles a significant problem and makes substantial progress in advancing our understanding. It strikes a good balance between theoretical contributions—such as the analysis of max-information—and practical applications, including the development of two new algorithms and their empirical evaluation.
Clarity: One minor limitation of the paper is that the main text is densely packed with content, which can make it challenging to follow. While the full version of the paper is more accessible, it might be beneficial to condense or omit some results in the main text. Additionally, the introduction feels verbose and could be significantly streamlined.
Another improvement would be a more formal comparison of the main theorems to those in [6]. While the discussion following Theorem 8 is helpful, a detailed comparison would enhance clarity. For instance, comparing Theorem 9 in [6] with Corollary 20 in this paper would be particularly useful. Both appear to yield qualitatively similar bounds—for sensitive 1/n functions, setting the differential privacy parameter to τ results in deviation bounds analogous to Hoeffding's inequality. If this interpretation is correct, it should be explicitly highlighted.
More broadly, explicitly emphasizing the paper's key contributions would improve readability and help readers better appreciate its significance.
Originality: The work is original.
Significance: The contributions are significant.
Minor Comments:
1. In Definition 3, \( I\infty^\beta((S, \mathcal{A}(S))) \) should be \( I\infty^\beta(S; \mathcal{A}(S)) \).
2. In the experimental section of the main text, you mention using Gaussian noise in addition to Laplace noise. Is this reflected in the figure, or does the figure only show results for Laplace noise?
This paper addresses the critical problem of generalization in adaptive data analysis, offering valuable theoretical insights and algorithms. The results presented are important, and aside from minor issues—primarily related to the dense presentation of results—I have very few criticisms.
