The paper exhibits several writing issues. For example, there are typos and missing punctuation marks, such as on page 2: "Section 4As A is finite." While the overall readability is satisfactory up to page 4, the description of the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe method is problematic. It contains repeated words, undefined concepts (e.g., "weight"), and awkwardly constructed sentences. Additional writing issues are scattered throughout page 4 and the remainder of the document, including undefined acronyms like "QP."
That said, the theoretical results are compelling and well-interpreted.
However, the experimental section is notably weak. First, Fig. 2 is difficult to interpret, with indistinguishable lines in the printed version. Second, the experimental advantages of the FW algorithm variants are already known. The paper would benefit from comments on how the experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings, such as convergence rates or constants. Lastly, while the inclusion of the sparse coding problem is a useful toy example, it would be appropriate to compare the results with state-of-the-art methods for the Lasso problem.
Minor comments:
- Ensure consistency in the bibliography formatting. For instance, "ArXiv," "arXiv," and "arXiv.org" are used inconsistently across different references.
- Adding a conclusions section would enhance the paper's structure.
- The content of Section 4 could be integrated into other sections of the text, as it does not warrant a standalone section.
In this paper, the authors address the convergence rate of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants. While the theoretical aspects are well-presented and the results appear both interesting and impactful, the overall quality of writing requires significant improvement. Additionally, the last two sections of the paper have notable shortcomings.
