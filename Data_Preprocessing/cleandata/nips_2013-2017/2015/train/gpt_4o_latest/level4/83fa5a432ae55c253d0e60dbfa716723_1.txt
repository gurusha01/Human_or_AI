The paper presents a novel approach to distinguishing differences between two distributions (e.g., populations) through the use of linear projections. The experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets appear to validate the proposed conclusions. Overall, this seems to be a robust and innovative contribution.
However, my confidence in this review is limited, primarily due to my lack of familiarity with the relevant literature. The paper is intriguing and demonstrates algorithmic sophistication in its method for identifying population differences, extending beyond simple classification tasks.
