SUMMARY
This work introduces a novel notion of algorithmic stability, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to uniform generalization. The paper investigates various implications for generalization, focusing on methods to directly control algorithmic stability, the richness of the hypothesis space and its regulation, as well as a concept of the size of the input space.
CONTRIBUTIONS
- A new definition of algorithmic stability that aligns with uniform generalization.  
- Theoretical insights into popular learning strategies aimed at enhancing algorithmic stability.  
- A deeper understanding of generalization in relation to the input space, hypothesis space, and learning algorithms.
These contributions advance the theoretical understanding of generalization and open avenues for future research into techniques that enhance generalization (e.g., hold-out validation, regularization, dimensionality reduction). Proposing a stability notion equivalent to uniform generalization is a challenging task, which underscores the significance of this paper's contributions.
SUPPORT
The proofs presented are correct, concise, and easy to follow. The claims justifying techniques for improving generalization are well-supported by the theoretical results. Additionally, the proof sketches strike a good balance between informativeness and maintaining the flow of the exposition.
TECHNICAL QUALITY
The paper is technically robust, and the implications of the main results are well-explored. The authors define stability in terms of expectation rather than high-probability bounds (unlike sample complexity results, which typically hold with high probability). While expectation bounds can yield low-probability guarantees via Markov's inequality, it remains unclear whether high-probability bounds can be derived without specifying a particular algorithm.
ORIGINALITY
The paper appears to be well-situated within the existing literature. However, my limited familiarity with related work on stability prevents me from making a definitive judgment on its originality.
CLARITY
The manuscript is well-written, with clear explanations and proofs. This theoretical contribution is well-executed and accessible (in my opinion). However, based on feedback from other reviewers, there may be room for further improvements in clarity.
FOR THE REBUTTAL
- Could the authors address the distinction between expectation bounds and high-probability bounds? Specifically, is it possible to derive high-probability guarantees without fixing a specific algorithm, or are the expectation bounds themselves a significant contribution?  
- Please clarify how the proposed definition of stability relates to existing definitions, as this has been a recurring concern among reviewers.
DETAILED COMMENTS
The proposed definition of stability is intriguing and intuitive, as it reflects the idea that "the output of the algorithm does not depend heavily on any single example." However, I am curious about its relationship to existing definitions (e.g., those based on removing or swapping a single observation). Perhaps the goal is not to compare them directly but rather to provide a characterization of generalization through stability.
In Section 5.3, should we prioritize the Shannon entropy of the output hypothesis over the size of the hypothesis space when designing algorithms? This question arises in light of challenges with poorly performing ERM learners in multiclass classification [1], where additional measures beyond ERM are necessary for success.
Example 2 reminded me of hold-out set validation (where a validation set is used to enhance algorithmic stability) and minimization via Bregman projections (minimizing a convex loss followed by a Bregman projection onto a set). It also seems related to post-processing techniques.
The concepts in Definition 8 align with the losses used to demonstrate that stability is essential for uniform generalization. Does this alignment suggest that classification with the 0-1 loss represents the most challenging problem in terms of stability and generalization?

POST-REBUTTAL REMARKS
The connections between stability by conditioning, observation elimination, and observation switching remain unclear. It seems that the proposed definition was primarily developed as a tool to achieve the desired results. The authors should explicitly acknowledge the limited understanding of these connections.
The authors emphasize the algorithm-independence of their main result, but this applies only to expectation guarantees, not high-probability guarantees, which are often more desirable. However, it is known that expectation guarantees for a base algorithm can be converted into high-probability guarantees when combined with a hold-out validation scheme (see Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David, "Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms"). The authors should acknowledge this limitation.  
Despite these limitations, the contributions remain solid and thought-provoking. While algorithm-independent high-probability guarantees would have been stronger, they represent a potential direction for future work. Overall, this is an exciting and well-written paper, with elegant results derived using simple techniques. Nonetheless, the limitations of the results should be more explicitly addressed.
