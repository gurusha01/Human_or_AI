* The statement "total multiplicities are bounded by N" in the second paragraph of Section 3 is unclear. Initially, I interpreted it to mean that the maximum multiplicity of any single point is at most N. However, after reading the discussion about the bounded subset of (R^2)^N, it appears that you are referring to the sum of the multiplicities of off-diagonal points being at most N. It would be helpful to clarify this distinction at the outset.
* The paper seems to downplay the significance of the requirements on bounded persistence and, more critically, on bounded multiplicities. However, these are substantial limitations. Particularly puzzling is the argument that bounded multiplicities are irrelevant because the focus is on finite processes. The type of theorem you present would likely be most impactful in connecting the persistence diagram of a smooth function (potentially perturbed by noise) to results obtained from a finite approximation, enabling inference-related applications. Yet, a smooth perturbed function is unlikely to meet the bounded multiplicities condition. Including a discussion of this limitation in the paper would be valuable for non-expert readers to understand the potential challenges.
* Figure 2 is unnecessarily confusing due to its 3D visualization of the function on the plane. Since the functions are supposed to be symmetric, this symmetry is not evident in the current depiction. A 2-dimensional colormap representation might make the figure clearer and more intuitive.
* I find the discussion in Section 4.1 about 0-dimensional features recovering the two holes quite perplexing. How is this possible? You seem to be analyzing sublevel sets of the distance functions without employing "extended persistence." Does "0-dimensional features" imply something other than "0-dimensional homology"? There are additional ambiguities like this throughout Section 4, which need to be clarified, as the current explanation is very confusing.
This paper makes a significant contribution to advancing the statistical foundations of persistent homology, an algebraic topological tool for analyzing scalar functions. Broadly, it employs kernel methods to map a persistence diagram to a scalar function over a plane, demonstrating that the resulting kernel is universal and practically useful. The results are both strong and important, and I recommend the paper for publication.
