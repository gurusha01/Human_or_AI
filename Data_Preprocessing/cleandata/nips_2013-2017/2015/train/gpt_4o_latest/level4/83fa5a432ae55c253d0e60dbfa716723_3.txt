The proposed method is inspired by the "Cramer-Wold device," which guarantees the existence of a linear projection capable of distinguishing between two distributions. The authors directly apply the Wasserstein metric to samples from the distributions and demonstrate favorable theoretical properties for this approach under reasonable conditions (e.g., bounded domain variables). The analysis is extended to cases where the distributions differ in only a few dimensions by incorporating sparse projections. The resulting computational problem is non-convex, and the authors address this by proposing a semidefinite program relaxation along with pre-processing steps to estimate a solution. Empirical evaluations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets, including a bioinformatics application.
The paper is well-written and effectively presents the main ideas. It addresses a problem of interest to the community by employing a novel approach, supported by adequate theoretical and empirical validation.
Minor issues:  
- I recommend that the authors provide more detailed descriptions and legends for each figure to make them more self-contained and easier to interpret.  
- The term "Cramer-Wold device" appears to be relatively uncommon outside of reference [10]. Would the authors consider using the more standard term "Cramer-Wold theorem"?  
Suggestions for future work:  
The theoretical results presented focus on sample complexity relative to the optimal linear projection. It would be valuable to further explore the relationship between the induced divergences and more standard divergences computed directly between high-dimensional distributions. This could help clarify the convergence in distribution implied by the Cramer-Wold theorem. The authors propose a method to distinguish between distributions based on the maximal univariate Wasserstein divergence between projections of the underlying random variables. The paper addresses a problem of interest to the community with a novel technique and sufficient theoretical and empirical validation.
