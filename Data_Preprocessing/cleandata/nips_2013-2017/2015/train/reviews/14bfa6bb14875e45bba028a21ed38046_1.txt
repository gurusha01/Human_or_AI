The goal of the paper is clear and the experimental results are solid. However, the paper is not easy to follow with a few confusing parts mentioned below. 1. Why RPN is translation-invariant, but [19] is not. What about Overfeat?
2. Many parameters are set manually without further analysis. Just to name a few: Why n=3, k=9. 3. The training procedure seems complicated and not stable. Why not applying the same training procedure multiple times? Have the authors tried many other settings, but find the current one performs the best? The authors propose a novel region proposal method which shares the CNN feature used for object localization. The region proposal method consists of a classification layer for recognizing object v.s. non-object, and a regression layer for predicting object bounding boxes. Due to sharing the feature computation with object localization module, the combined new RCNN is ~10x faster than fast RCNN and slightly more accurate. Since the training procedure of object localization CNN assumes regions are given, a multiple stages alternative training procedure is proposed.
