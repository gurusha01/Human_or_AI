In this paper, a modified Leurgans' algorithm is proposed to do decompositions for sparse and low rank tensors. Tensor decomposition is very hard and usually computationally expensive. So it is interesting to study efficient algorithms to do tensor decompsitions for sparse and low rank tensors. In the paper, the authors use order 3 tensors as examples, and clearly present the algorithm and theoretically discuss the efficiency. In section 4, the authors discuss the algorithm can be extended to higher order tensor. The paper is well organized. Here are some questions:
(1) In the algorithm, it needs to do several eigenvalue decompositions for matrices, which are computationally expensive. And, it also needs to solve two convex matrix optimization problems (6). Can this method be applied to solve large scale tensor decompositions? How to understand the sparsity in the paper? What is the largest tensor that can be decomposed by this algorithm? In section 2,2, Numerical examples only present results for 50 dimensional order-3 tensor, which is not enough to show the efficiency of the algorithm.
 (2) Page 2, line 071, the definition of low-rank is r <= n1. In Numerical implementation part, (Section 2.2) for 50 50 50 Tensor, computational results are list for r = 1-4, which is very small. What is the computational result for r =40-49? Is it also very good, or the algorithm only works for very small r?
(3) Section 2.2, how to solve problem (6) in your implementation?
 Other suggestions:
- Typo, line 093, the resulting nn matrix, should be n1n2 matrix;
- Typo, line 96-98, \sumk should be \sumi;
 - Typo, page 5, line 216, Xa should be Xa^3;
- Typo, page 4, line 198, "coefficient" should be coefficient. In this paper, a modified Leurgans' algorithm is proposed to do decompositions for sparse and low rank tensors. Tensor decomposition is very hard and usually computationally expensive. So it is interesting to study efficient algorithms to do tensor decompositions for sparse and low rank tensors. The paper is organized well. However, the numerical implementation part is not good enough. It only shows the result for a very special order-3 tensor with very small r. It might be better to give more examples.
