Answer to authors' response:
The reviews of other reviewers and the authors' response have not significantly affected my opinion of the paper. That said, I am not familiar with the single index model/sufficient dimension reduction literature, so I could very well be unaware of previous work that may be relevant. The authors derive asymptotic guarantees for the generalized square-root lasso applied to Gaussian measurements that are (optionally) transformed by a possibly unknown nonlinear function. The results are very interesting, as they provide a precise characterization of the performance of the method, and the paper is very well written (although there are quite a few typos. especially in the proof section).
