This work studies how to generate sentences from an image stream. It designs a
coherent recurrent convolutional network (CRCN), which consists of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model.
Overall it is a nice work, although it can be improved from the following aspects: * Several related work about video to sentence is missing, e.g.,
Jointly modeling deep video and compositional text to bridge vision and language in a unied framework
 *While the quantitative results of the proposed method looks quite good, the user study in table 2 shows that it performs similar to one baseline, RCN. Significance test is needed to verify whether the improvement is reliable.  Nice algorithm for sentences generation from an image stream.The quantitative results of the algo looks good but the user study only shows weak advantage over baselines.
