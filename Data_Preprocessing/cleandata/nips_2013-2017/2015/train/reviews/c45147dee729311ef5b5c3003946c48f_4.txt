[this is a light review] I would encourage the authors to discuss in more detail how their approach compares to other approaches w.r.t. quantitative and qualitative evaluation of between frame quality (i.e. consistency/flickering etc.).
== post rebuttal == According to the rebuttal, a positive point is that the the authors plan to release their model. Additionally it would be helpful if they release their code to allow repeatability.  The paper presents a novel and efficient (w.r.t. runtime) approach, which is evaluated against a large body of related work as well as ablations. Given that the task is video, it would be good to extend the qualitative evaluation of multi-frame in Fig 5. with a discussion and a quantitative comparison (e.g. consistency measure).
