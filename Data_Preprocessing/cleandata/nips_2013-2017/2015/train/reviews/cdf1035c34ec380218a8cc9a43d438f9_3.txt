Summary of paper
 This paper presents a new online algorithm to predict label on a
 graph. The graph labeling prediction problem is motivated by
 semi-supervised learning where labeled and unlabeled are vertices
 on a graph and edges represent closeness of these data. This work
 uses an Ising model and seeks to optimize a bound on number of
 mistake made by the learner online given a constraint on the
 complexity of true labeling on the graph, such as the number of
 edges connecting disagreeing vertex in the graph.
 The paper exploits a transformation of the graph to Picard-Queyranne
 graph and analyses the mistake bounds for two prediction strategies
 via analysis of mistake bounds in PQ-games and per-cluster mistakes
 bounds. The final mistake bounds are compared with mistake bounds
 in existing literature.
 Quality
 The final results reproduce the optimal result for online
 labelling problem on trees. In comparison to mistake bounds in
 existing literature, this paper's result is better when the graph
 can be covered by label-consistent clusters of different
 diameter. This is because the analysis is done per-cluster and this
 should be a better bound in most natural cases.
 Clarity
 This paper is well written. The background material required to
 understand the PQ graphs is sufficiently covered.
 Originality
 This paper makes novel use of PQ-graph and per-cluster analysis to
 achieve the final mistake bounds.
 Significance
 The algorithms proposed and theoretical results constitute significant
 technical contributions.  This a high quality paper that makes novel use of a Picard-Queyranne graph to achieve new mistake bounds in the online graph label prediction problem. The new bounds are arguably better than existing ones for most natural graph labelling.
