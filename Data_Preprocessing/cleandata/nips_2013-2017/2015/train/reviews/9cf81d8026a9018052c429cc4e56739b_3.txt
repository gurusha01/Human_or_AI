The authors claim that the effective receptive field of each unit expands with larger T (Line 174 in Page 4). I didn't get this point. As you input an still image to the network, how can the receptive field of each unit get expanded with larger T? Can you clarify on this? The paper proposes a recurrent convolutional layer for CNN to improve the performance of scene image parsing. The algorithm looks technically sound and the result looks good.
