The paper introduces a generative model for sequences. The novelty consists in considering explicit latent stochastic variables that are used to condition the data production. These latent variables may depend on the past.
 Pro: provides an extension of recent latent variable models to sequences.
They show that the model is competitive with other sequence models on a series of datasets.
Cons: some claims are not fully supported. The experiments are only proof of concepts. They just used raw signal and no pre-preprocessing
at all, which makes it difficult to compare with state of the art performance on these classical datasets.  aa
