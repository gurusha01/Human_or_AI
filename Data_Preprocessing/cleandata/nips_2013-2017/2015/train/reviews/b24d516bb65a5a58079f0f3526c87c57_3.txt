The authors studied the transition phenomena in information cascades by showing that the spectral radius of Laplace Hazard matrix can characterize the dynamics of the contagion. They focused on the non-asymptotic influence bounds, the super-critical time, and the tight lower bounds of critical explosion time.
Strong points: 1. This work has in-deep theoretical bounds. 2. It focuses on network information cascades, which is a question of great concern to research community. 3. This paper is well organized and easy to read.
 Suggestions: Experiments can be improved to verify their theory. The authors evaluated the case of 'exponential transition probabilities'. They can also verify the cases of 'fixed transition pattern' and 'SI and SIR epidemic models'. The tightness in Fig.1 is only for fully connected networks?
 This paper extends the approach published by Lemonnier et al.[17] to deal with anytime influence bounds. The approach has strict theoretical bounds.
