The paper is well-written in general.
The proposed algorithm presents a slight improvement (more significant in some cases) over the classical glasso and robust techniques, and the theoretical results give consistency guarantees.  In this paper, the authors address the problem of precision matrix estimation using sparsity-promoting methods. Based on the classical glasso, a new algorithm is proposed by adding weights to the data points. This yields a non-convex optimization problem, and the authors propose two different algorithms for solving this problem.Of course, due to the non-convexity, the obtained solutions are local minima. However, a theoretical result is proven, showing that any local minima is guaranteed to have some consistency properties.
