This paper presents a new upper bound for the mixing time of Gibbs sampling.
Unlike previous specialized results, the bound applies to arbitrary discrete factor graphs.
The bound is too loose to be used in a quantitative way, but the paper uses the bound qualitatively to explain why certain real-world networks mix well.
The paper is well-written and covers a nice assortment of methods for proving mixing time (though most of the good stuff is in the appendix).
Section 4 shows that the mixing time of Ising models is related to hierarchy width.
This is again a qualitative, not quantitative, assessment of the theory.
The theorem from [10], p201 suggests that the maximum degree is the relevant quantity, rather than hierarchy width.
How does the figure look with maximum degree on the axis?
The paper claims that exact inference is not feasible in the real-world networks (as mentioned on line 418), which suggests that they have high tree-width.
The paper should report the tree-width and compare this to hierarchy-width and factor weight.
Does Theorem 2 give meaningful bounds for the real-world networks?
The related work section is a bit odd since most of the papers cited are not about mixing time.
It would make more sense to cite previous work on bounds for mixing time in factor graphs.
In particular, there are existing bounds for special graphs that are much tighter than Theorem 2.
One such bound was used by Liu and Domke (2014).

Section 2.1 has 'q' instead of 'Q' in the equations, and typo 'figure 2(a)' instead of 'figure 2(b)'.  New theory about Gibbs sampling, presented in a readable and thought-provoking way, though only used in a qualitative sense.
