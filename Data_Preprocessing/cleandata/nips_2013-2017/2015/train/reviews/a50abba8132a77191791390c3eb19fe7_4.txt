This paper proposes numerous methods to speed up svrg. The methods are growing batch size, mixed SGD/svrg, and a new minibatching scheme.
Specific comments 1. It would be nice to have empirical comparison against a well-tuned SGD implementation. 2. I'm not clear on how the results for "time to reach Eest + Eopt for FG and SVRG were reached. E_est should only depend on n. For alpha =1, it should be O(1/n). It is unclear how log^2 1/epsilon and d^2 arises.  This is a nice paper that proposes numerous modifications to SVRG.
