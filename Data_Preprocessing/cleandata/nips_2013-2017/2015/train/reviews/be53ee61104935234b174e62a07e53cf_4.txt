The paper provides incremental improvements to Isotonic regression with $\ell_p$-norms.
Much of the paper's contributions is explained in the supplemental section, so one cannot fully understand the contributions of the paper with the main sections alone.
Furthermore, there are limited experimental results shared in the paper.
No experimental comparisons are provided.
While the results are promising, improved organization and experimentation would solidify the authors' contribution.  The paper provides improved methods for Isotonic Regression.While the paper provides a thorough examination of the method, further experimental results comparing the algorithm to existing literature would be beneficial.
