The paper presents a region proposal network (RPN) which shares the conv features with R-CNN and includes two fully connected layers that predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. RPN is heuristically combined with Fast R-CNN for object detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance on VOC07 and VOC12. The running time of generating region proposals is greatly reduced since RPN shares the conv layers with the detection network.
Pros: - Smart idea on sharing conv layers between RPN and R-CNN which greatly reduced the run-time of object proposals.
- State-of-the-art performance on object detection.
- Well-written paper.
Cons:
- The training of RPN and fast R-CNN are weakly combined by alternating optimization and there is no convergence proof.
- RPN can be used independently as a region proposal method. However, it doesn't seem to outperform selective search.
  This is a very nice piece of work, which improves both the efficiency and accuracy of R-CNN in object detection. Well-written paper and thorough experimental evaluations. The only concern is on how to combine RPN and fast R-CNN for object detection. The proposed alternating optimization method is a bit heuristic.
