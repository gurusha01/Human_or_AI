This paper is clearly written and the symbols are particularly well-defined. It is a pleasure to read through the paper. Some of the theoretical results are direct extensions of the alternating projection algorithm for standard precision matrix estimation. In my opinion, the most helpful quantitative relationship is the equivalence between tensor normal distribution and a multi-dimensional normal distribution (i.e., vec(T)~ N(vec(0); \SigmaK \otimes...\otimes \Sigma1)) and more emphasis should be given here to guide the readers (especially those who are already familiar with results for standard precision matrix estimation) through the results for tensor distribution. The shortcoming of this paper is also obvious --- the authors haven't motivated well why this more complex (albeit elegant) model is more suitable for practical problems. I recommend acceptance for its theoretical contribution. The authors present an alternating minimization algorithm that obtains the local optimal of the precision matrices of a tensor normal distribution. The problem formulation generalizes the standard estimation problem for sparse precision matrix. I recommend the paper be accepted for its technical contribution.
