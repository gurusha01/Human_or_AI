The paper proposes a new sampler for mixture models based on homogeneous completely random measures. The sampler is a hybrid of two existing classes of samplers and retains the favorable properties of each: the faster mixing times of the so-called conditional samplers, and the ability to exactly represent an infinite object with finite memory of the so-called marginal samplers. The paper uses results from Pitman's work on Poisson-Kingman partitions and size-biased sampling in order to derive a Gibbs sampling scheme for Poisson-Kingman mixture models. The authors show that the proposed sampler performs favorably, in terms of run time and of effective sample size, as compared to the existing conditional and marginal samplers.
Mixture models based on normalized CRMs have received an increasing amount of attention in the Bayesian non-parametrics literature in recent years, and the sampler proposed in this paper is a valuable tool for the community. The key technical insight is to represent the "surplus mass" as a variable in the sampler, and to obtain its complete conditional distribution by using Pitman's results on the joint distribution of the weights and the total mass of a CRM. The exposition is clear and the work is significant for the Bayesian non-parametrics community. The paper proposes an efficient sampler for a class of models that has received increasing attention in recent years. It is well-executed and clearly written, and provides an important tool for the Bayesian non-parametrics community.
