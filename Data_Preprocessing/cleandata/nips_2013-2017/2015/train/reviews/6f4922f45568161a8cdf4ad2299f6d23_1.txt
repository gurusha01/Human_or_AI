A covariance controlled Nose Theromstat is presented to sample from a target measure when computing the likelihhod is infeasible due to far too many terms appearing in the product form likelihood.
This paper builds on much of the solid work in molecular dynamics by the likes of Leimkuhler and is an interesting addition to this emerging area of literature.
 The evaluations experimentally are a bit simplistic thought the final DBM was interesting.
Quality This is a solid piece of work that takes results from molecular dynamics and uses them to address a contemporary ML problem.
 Clarity The paper is clearly written and there was no level of unnecessary complication or obfuscation - a very clear and accessible read.
Originality A similar construction - with fixed covariance - appeared at last years NIPS - and this builds and improves on that work by Skeel. I would not take this as an impediment of the paper as it is a valuable addition.
Significnace This area is going to be significant - for models with factorable likelihoods - a limited class of statistical models A covariance controlled Nose Theromstat is presented to sample from a target measure when computing the likelihhod is infeasible due to far too many terms appearing in the product form likelihood.This paper builds on much of the solid work in molecular dynamics by the likes of Leimkuhler and is an interesting addition to this emerging area of literature.The evaluations experimentally are a bit simplistic thought the final DBM was interesting.
