The authors perform theoretical analysis about faster convergence with multi-player normal-form games by generalizing techniques for two-player zero-sum games. They also perform empirical evaluation by using the 4-bidder simultaneous auction game.
 The paper is understandable and contains nice theoretical and empirical results. My only comment is that it would be better to use various n and m for performance evaluation (i.e. not limited to 4-bidders) to more clearly elucidate the behavior of Hedge and Optimistic Hedge.  The paper has solid theoretical results as well as nice experimental results in the 4-bidder simultaneous auction game.
