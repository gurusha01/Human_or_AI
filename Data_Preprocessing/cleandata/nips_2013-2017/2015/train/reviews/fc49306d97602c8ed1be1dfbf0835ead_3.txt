The idea of cross domain matching based on correlation analysis is known in the literature. However, this paper proposes a novel approach to compute a domain specific shared space of latent distributions that makes it novel.
 The most striking aspect of the paper is the experimental results. It shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms other methods in the literature. Additionally, the paper is extremely well written, leaving no need for further improvement.
  The paper describes a method to compare Bag of Words(BoW) vectors from different domains via a kernel embedding method. The method proposed here is elegant and the problem itself is extremely interesting.
