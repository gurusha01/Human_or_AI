The paper studies EM in a high-dimensional setting. Convergence results are established and inference procedure developed.
 Authors should discuss under what conditions can we find the initial solution, \beta^{\rm init} that satisfies the requirement in line 60 on page 2.
There are two algorithms proposed. Is there a practical guidance on which one to use?
How does one choose $\hat s$ and $\lamdba$ in practice? How sensitive are results on the choice of these tuning parameters? Is there a way to choose them in a data dependent way? In the existing literature on high-dimensional inference, choice of the tuning parameters is of utmost importance to obtaining good sampling properties.
The decorrelated score test is the same as in [*]. This fact should be cited and not swept under the rug. Is there anything new that needs to be developed in order to apply the existing inference procedure in the current context?
The main theoretical results hold under a large number of technical conditions. The authors should discuss whether these condition/assumptions are satisfied for the considered latent variable models.
[] A General Theory of Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Regions for Sparse High Dimensional Models. Yang Ning, Han Liu The paper extends [2] to a high-dimensional setting. It also applies the work of Ning and Liu [] to the problem of inference. The paper combines existing results in a clever way. However, it should be made more clear what is exactly novel in this paper and why is application of existing tools nontrivial. The submitted paper is a "trailer" for the long supplementary material. This trailer should contain more information on the technical challenges required to establish the main results.[*] A General Theory of Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Regions for Sparse High Dimensional Models.
