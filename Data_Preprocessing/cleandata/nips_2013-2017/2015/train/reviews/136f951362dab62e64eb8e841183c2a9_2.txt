-- Summary -- This paper proposed a point process collaborative filtering model to capture the temporal and recurrent structure between users and items. Specifically, for each pair of user and item, the event density is the sum of a constant intensity and a self-exciting intensity depending on the past events. Two sets of intensity are computed by two sets of user and item latent vectors respectively. The corresponding optimization algorithm is derived for parameter estimation and empirical studies have been done to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods to other commonly used alternatives.
 However, the experimental studies can be improved. For example, another sensible baseline would be a simple ensemble of STiC [12] and SVD. Since the authors argued that [12, 13] are not able to recommend completely new items, which can be covered by SVD, and it would be valuable to compare the proposed method to this simple ensemble. In addition, for the \gamma function used for the self-exciting process, how is the bandwidth parameter \sigma set? How sensitive would the results be if we vary \sigma? Furthermore, there is no details about how some other important hyperparameters are chosen for both baseline methods and the proposed method, e.g. the dimension of the latent vectors.
It would also be helpful to provide more details of the characteristics of the two real world dataset. Since the paper is about temporal structure, it's useful to discuss about simple stats like the number of recurring events per user/item pair and how irregular the temporal pattern is.
-- Quality -- The overall quality is reasonably good but not great.
-- Clarity -- The paper presentation can be improved in terms of languages, typos, grammar errors.
 -- Originality --
The proposed method is an interesting combination of point process and latent factor models.
-- Significance --
Both the problem and the method have good practical values.  This paper proposed a point process collaborative filtering model to capture the temporal and recurrent structure between users and items. The corresponding optimization algorithm is derived for parameter estimation and empirical studies have been done to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods to other commonly used alternatives. However, the experimental studies and the presentation can be improved.
