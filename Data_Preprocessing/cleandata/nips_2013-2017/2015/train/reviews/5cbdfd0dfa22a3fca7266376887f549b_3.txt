Summary: It is firstly assumed that an observable tensor consists of two additive parts: a low-rank tensor that is not sparse; and a sparse corruption tensor that is not low-rank. Then the paper proposes an extension of the Leurgans' Algorithm in terms of solving the convex problem defined by the model assumption. This extension has the advantage of simplicity and less computational complexity. With theoretical proofs provided afterwards it can be verified that the both assumed tensor components can be recovered correctly under given conditions.
Quality: The contents are very well structured and the main idea is clearly introduced and motivated. The provided proofs are also convincing and helpful for understanding. But there are quite a few number of trivial typos. Clarity: Altogether the main concept and motivation are quite comprehensible. The authors have made especially remarkable effort to derive and demonstrate the constraints of the proposed approach.
Originality: Although the proposed algorithm strongly depends on that of Leurgans, its combination with convex optimization could be a novel solution to the defined assumption.
Significance: It has been shown that the model is capable of modeling the two additive tensors being low-rank and sparse, respectively. But the proposed algorithm has certain constraints that might compromise the applicability and significance. Especially the final conclusion (Corollary 3.7) is based on uniform dimension without giving further arguments.  The paper proposes an interesting extension of the Leurgans' Algorithm. The concept and main results are very clearly formulated, although it is yet unclear whether the applicability of the model might suffer from the mentioned constraints, since experiments on real-life data are missing in the paper.
