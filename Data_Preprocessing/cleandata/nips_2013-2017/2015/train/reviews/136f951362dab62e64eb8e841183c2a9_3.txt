This paper presents a novel algorithm to tackle time-sensitive recommendation by capturing low-rank structure in a user-item matrix and by using Hawkes process. The algorithm can be solved in a distributed fashion and achieves better results than existing methods.
Quality: Overall I think the paper took a principled approach to model the observation (ratings) using stochastic processes. But I have a few comments.
One concern in theoretical part is in Eq. (8) and Theorem 2. In eq. 8, over what parameter do we take maximum? Is it over \rho? In such case, can \rho* be unbounded? In addition, theorem 2 is not used when the paper chose \rho in experiments, which degrades the importance of the theorem.
Another comment is with the baselines in the experiments. To my knowledge, SVD++ [17] (the winner of Netflix challenge) is one of the best algorithm for time-sensitive algorithm. Adding SVD++ into baseline would improve the quality even better. Though I am not dissatisfied with the current baselines.
Clarity: The paper was well written and easy to follow.
Originality: To me the paper seems to be novel because time-sensitive recommendation is a relatively novel problem.
Significance: I think time-sensitive recommendation can be impactful.
