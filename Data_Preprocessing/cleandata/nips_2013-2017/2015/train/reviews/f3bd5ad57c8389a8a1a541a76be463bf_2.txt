This paper presents a new version of the EP algorithm where one iteratively refines a global approximation of the target instead of refining individual approximating factors. This reduces memory requirements and performs experimentally well compared to standard EP.
This is a useful and neat idea.
 Quality: good, nice idea.
Clarity: good, however a few typos to correct.
Originality: original to the best of my knowledge.
Significance: a useful algorithm which could find quite a few applications.
 Minor comments:
 - The convergence of EP is not guaranteed, have the authors observed similar convergence problems for SEP?
- In the mixture of Gaussian clustering example, the posterior distribution has 4! modes. Is your SEP approximation enjoying this property? (I am not sure I fully understand Figure 4) The paper presents a new variation of the EP algorithm where iterative refinement of a global approximation of the target is performed. Simple and interesting.
