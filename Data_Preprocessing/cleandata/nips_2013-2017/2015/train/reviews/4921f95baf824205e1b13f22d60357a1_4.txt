The article provides some theoretical justification for the common neighbors heuristic for link prediction. Under the stochastic blockmodel, the paper shows for a dense graph, the heuristic successfully recovers the clusters. When the graph is sparser, the heuristic plus a cleaning step successfully recovers the clusters.
The problem is equivalent to clustering a realization of the stochastic blockmodel with weak dependencies among edges. To the best of my (limited) knowledge of the area, such a model has not be studied. However, known proof techniques are readily adapted to the setting. Overall, the paper is well-written. If the nearest-neighbor heuristic is commonly used in practice, but unjustified theoretically, then this paper is a worthwhile addition to the literature.
