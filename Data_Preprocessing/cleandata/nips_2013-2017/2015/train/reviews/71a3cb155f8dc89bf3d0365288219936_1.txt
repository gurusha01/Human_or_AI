In this paper, the authors study the estimation of sparse graphical models, which is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. An alternating minimization algorithm is proposed to solve it. The optimal statistical rate of convergence and the consistent graph recovery properties are discussed. The paper is organized very well and presented clearly. Only few questions:
(1) The sparsity of the solution \Omega. Problem (2.2) is formulated to encourage the sparsity of each precision matrix \Omega_i. In simulation part, there is no sparsity result. Page 8, lines 414-415, "Tlasso tends to include more non-connected edges than other methods", does this mean the computational results of Tlasso are not quite sparse? Please give an explanation.
 (2) Page 4, line 206-210. The initialization of Algorithm 1. You claim the obtained estimators are insensitive to the choice of the initialization. In your simulations, set 1_mk as the initialization got better numerical performance. Why does this happen? How worse can it be for the random initialization? Can you give a short discussion?
