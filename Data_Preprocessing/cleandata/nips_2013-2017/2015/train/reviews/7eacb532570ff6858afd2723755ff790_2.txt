In the setting of dueling bandits and under the PL model assumption, the authors consider two tasks: finding an approximate best arm and finding an approximate ranking of the arms. Both tasks relates to the estimations of the pairwise marginals of the underlying PL model, which is done with an early-stopped version of the QuickSort. This Budgeted QuickSort allows to build algorithms which sample complexity is O(M log^2 M). Experiments compare the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms against state-of-art methods.
The problem is not well-motivated, which is even more visible by the lack of experiments based on real-world dataset. This been said, I like the algorithms for their simplicity and the theoretical study that support them is correct. I didn't check proofs in appendix, but the results seems realistic. I would have appreciated a little discussion about the choice of the method to build confidence intervals in PLPAC -- e.g. is the algorithm sensitive to the method ?
The paper is correctly organized and reasonably easy to follow. I still find a bit curious to put an algorithm (AMPR-PLPAC) in supplementary material.
As I was saying, the problem is not well-motivated but the gain in terms of sample conplexity over existing algorithms is significant. The algorithm is interesting, the theoretical study is complete. However, problem is not well-motivated and looks like a niche problem. This feeling is strengthen by the experiments that are only on synthetic data.
