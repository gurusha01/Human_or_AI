The paper proposes a generalization of training neural networks which have many stacked layers. The information highway idea works well illustrated by experimentation. Further, authors have shown classification accuracy results can be improved by this method.
 Quality: the idea seems novel, and experimentation is solid. Analysis sections could use a bit more variety of details or illustrations.
 Clarity: the main messages of the paper are well delivered and quite clear.
 Originality: the proposed method is sufficiently original although a generalization of previous neural network techniques.
 Significant: the paper illustrates significance to the field since deeper and deeper neural networks need to be trained to arrive at better results in application areas.
 The paper describes an affective method to train very deep neural networks by means of 'information highways', or building direct connections to upper network layers. Although a generalization of prior techniques, such as cross-layer connections, the authors have shown this method to be effective by experimentation. The contributions are quite novel and well supported by experimental evidence.
