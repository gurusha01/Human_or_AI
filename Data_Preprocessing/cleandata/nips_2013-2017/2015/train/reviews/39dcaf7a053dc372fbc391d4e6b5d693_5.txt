The subject matter of the paper is very far out of my area of expertise. I found the paper clear and the motivations for the architecture convincing and intuitive, and the results support the hypothesis, so it seems like a good contribution. I am incapable of giving a more in-depth analysis than this, I'm afraid, and encourage the committee and authors to rely more on the other reviews. This paper provides a novel architecture for the detection of neuronal boundaries in 3d scans. The main contribution is the interpolation of boundary classifications from 3d convnets and 2d convenets, which, combined, produce improved results.
