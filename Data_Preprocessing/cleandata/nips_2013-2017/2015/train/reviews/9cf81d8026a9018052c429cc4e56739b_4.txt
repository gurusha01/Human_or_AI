[this is a light review] Specifically similar approache: - Shuai Zheng; Sadeep Jayasumana; Bernardino Romera-Paredes; Chang Huang; Philip Torr, http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03240. - [15] should be included in the results table, maybe with a star to denote different/more training data.
 The paper adapts the recurrent neural network approach for object detection [13] to scene labeling/semantic segmentation. The approach outperforms baselines but not state-of-the-art. The authors should relate their work conceptually, quantitatively and w.r.t. the difference in approach more clearly from the semantic segmentation task & datasets and corresponding approaches (see e.g. http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/leaderboard/displaylb.php?challengeid=11&compid=6 for a list of winning approaches).
