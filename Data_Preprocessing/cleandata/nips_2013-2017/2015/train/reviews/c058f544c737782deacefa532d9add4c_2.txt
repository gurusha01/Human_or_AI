The paper has some writing issues. There are a couple of typos, missing punctuation signs (like in page 2, "Section 4As A is finite". The reading is pleasant in general until page 4. The description of the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe method is problematic. Repeated words, undefined concepts (weight), weird sentences... There are some other writing problems along page 4, and in the rest of the document. For instance, there are undefined acronyms (like QP).
As mentioned, the theoretical results are interesting, as well as the interpretations.
The experimental section however, is quite weak. Firstly, it's very hard to see anything in Fig 2, and the lines are indistinguishable in printed version.
Secondly, the (experimental) advantages of the variants of the FW algorithms are known. I expected to see some comments on the corroboration of the theoretical results presented in the paper: convergence rate, constants, etc. Finally, I know that the presence of the sparse coding problem is didactic, as a toy example, but it would be correct to add some state-of-the-art methods for the Lasso problem.
Minor comments:
- be consistent in the bibliography: for instance: ArXiv, arXiv, arXiv.org, for three different papers.
- a section with the conclusions would be appreciated
- the content of Section 4 could be placed somewhere through the text, there's no need for a whole section  In this paper, the authors address the convergence rate for the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and some of its variants.The theory is well presented (although the general writing of the paper should be significantly improved), and the results seem interesting and powerful. The last two sections have some problems
