This paper considers the Robust PCA problem ("low-rank plus sparse") where the leverage scores (or local incoherence) of the low-rank matrix and the non-zero probabilities of the sparse matrix are allowed to vary across the entries. Sufficient conditions for exact recovery are provided in terms of local relations of the leverage scores and error probabilities.
 This paper is in line with previous work on matrix completion under a similar non-uniform setting. The analysis uses the techniques of golfing schemes and weighted norms, which are developed in previous work.
 My main concern is that applications of such a result are not immediately clear. In particular, what is a scenario where the error probabilities and leverage scores will happen to align with each other and satisfy the conditions in the paper? Unlike matrix completion where the observation probabilities might be controllable in certain cases, here the error probabilities are not. More discussion would help.
The clustering problem mentioned in the paper could be a potential application. As the local incoherence is related to the cluster sizes, perhaps larger clusters are allowed to have higher error probabilities? It would be useful to write down a corollary for this problem.
Other comments:
1) It would be helpful to formally write down the elimination/derandomization arguments for this non-uniform setting.
2) The results involve both \mu0 and \mu1. It would help to explicitly point out in which part of the proof is \mu_1 needed.
  This paper extends previous work on matrix completion with non-uniform local incoherence. The theoretical results appear correct, and the proof is based on previously developed techniques. It would be good if the authors can better motivate the problem setting and discuss applications.
