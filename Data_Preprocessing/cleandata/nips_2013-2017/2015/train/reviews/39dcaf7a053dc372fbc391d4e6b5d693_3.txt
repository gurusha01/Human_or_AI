In this paper the authors discuss a new deep convolutional network employed for for segmentation of neurons in EM image stacks. The novelty fo teh paper is the arrangement of filters in quite deep networks and the inclusion of 3D filters. Overall the paper is of good quality and is well-written/clear. The authors appear to have improved on previous methods and the application area is quite important for neuroscience. Overall I think it is worth presenting even if there are not necessarily any new fundamental insights about the method (other than the detailed architecture).  A good paper even if the novelty appears to be a bit in the details.
