The paper is well motivated and written. The results of their approach is presented on 2 datasets (evaluated on avg relative AUC error). Compared to the baseline (U2-gossip), their method performs much better in varied scenarios (graphs). The paper gives convergence bounds for their method. - I would like to see see run-times per iteration for the proposed and U2-gossip methods. If each iteration of the proposed method is much slower than U2-gossip, then the paper would be of limited utility. The paper proposes sync. and async. randomized gossip algorithms for computing U-statistics.
