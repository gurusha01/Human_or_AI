This paper presents new Gossip algorithms for computation of U-statistics. The proposed algorithms have faster convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art (U2-Gossip algorithm from Pelckmans, Suykens'09) as well as work in the more realistic asynchronous settings. The experimental results further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to existing algorithms.
The paper is well written, the problem is well motivated and the authors have well positioned their work w.r.t the existing literature. As far I can see, the proposed algorithms are novel, and superior in terms of convergence and cost (memory and communication in comparison to the U2-gossip). Also, the proposed algorithm works for asynchronous settings.
Apart from theoretical guarantees and analysis, the authors have also done extensive empirical evaluations over two datasets and compared to the baselines. This further strengthens the contributions of the paper.  This paper presents new Gossip Algorithms for computing U-statistics, with faster convergence rate as well as for the realistic asynchronous settings. Furthermore, the algorithms are evaluated and compared to state-of-art via extensive experiments.
