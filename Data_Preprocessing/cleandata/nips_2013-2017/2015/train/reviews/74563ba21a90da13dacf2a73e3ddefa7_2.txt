Summary:
The authors investigate the theoretical foundation of applying
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space based technique in expressing the topological invariances of the persistent homology. That investigation focuses on the universality of the potential kernel representation. They demonstrate the usefulness of their approach for example in two-sample hypothesis testing.
 General remarks: --- The statement of Proposition 2 can be reinterpreted since the exponential mapping applied there can be taken as a projection from the manifolds of the positive semidefinite kernels onto the corresponding tangent plane. Thus investigating the the properties of that manifold might yield some further ways to other kind of generalization. For example looking at the sensitivity of universality with respect to the local properties of that manifold might allows to extend the scope of that Proposition.
 --- In the paper only the solution of the heat diffusion problem is considered as a source of a possible kernel representation. What about other possibilities, for example some results in discrete differential geometry may provide other feature mapping exploitable in this context.
 --- The proposed approach is demonstrated via discriminative hypotheses testing. The usefulness of those tests can be checked against discriminative learning methods which can provide confirmation to the applicability. I think that kind of control tests should be carried out for example on a sample of randomly chosen point clouds representing balls and tori.
  Pros: The authors provide a comprehensive introduction of the topological data analysis and the potential kernel representation of the corresponding problems.Cons:The authors do not give a clear view why the universality of a kernel can really help in a learning problem. Showing up a family of problems where this approach has clear advantages can make the paper significantly stronger.
