Small comments:
- It should be mentioned explicitly somewhere that the pairwise marginals of the PL model are just a BTL distribution
- Rem 5: the bound in [25] is for exact recovery, that given here for approximate recovery; this should be made clear
- sec 9.1: several places: c or m [= --> \in] {range}
- p.7, last line: horizontal --> vertical
- sec 9.2: another interesting experiment would be to compare with rank centrality in terms of not optimal recovery fraction, but say fraction of times an \epsilon-optimal ranking is recovered (for some \epsilon > 0); does your algorithm give better sample complexity in that case?
 The paper considers the problem of identifying (approximately) the most probable ranking over n items - or just the top-ranked item - assuming an underlying Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution, from active queries of pairwise comparisons from the distribution (this type of problem is also known as a dueling bandits problem). It proposes algorithms for both settings (identifying full ranking and identifying top-ranked item) based on a budgeted quicksort procedure that is shown to preserve pairwise comparison probabilities under the PL distribution. The paper gives query complexity bounds for both settings. Experiments show that under the PL model, the algorithm for finding the top item outperforms several other recently proposed algorithms. On the other hand, the algorithm for finding a full ranking does not outperform a simple passive sampling algorithm that uses a naive uniform sampling strategy, leaving open the possibility of designing a better active algorithm in this case.The paper is exceptionally well written and has interesting results and very well-designed experiments.
