The paper propose a method for batch learning from logged bandit feedback that avoids the propensity overfitting problem.
It builds on Swaminathan and Joachims 2015 and provides significantly better algorithm.
Quality: I found the quality of research discussed in the paper to be above average. The extensions proposed in the paper does result in significant improvements in training of the original POEM.
 Clarity: For the most part the paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
Originality: The paper gives significantly new formulation to the original POEM algorithm for BLBF problem. I believe the contributions significantly original.
Significance: I think the results in the paper are very interesting and certainly require further research. I am impressed that the proposed algorithm is faster than the original POEM despite having more regularization mechanism built into it. This algorithm may see widespread use in near future.
 This is a good paper. It is clear and reads well.
