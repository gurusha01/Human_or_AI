The paper proposes a reformulation of a large class of mixed graphical models that allows a series of factorization. The paper is quite technical and my main concern is that I did not really to what extant the proposed representation can simplifying some problems or reduce the complexity of some inference algorithm.
 I fear that the 8-page NIPS format does not fit for this kind of work, which would need a series of illustration to examplify the progress it allows.
