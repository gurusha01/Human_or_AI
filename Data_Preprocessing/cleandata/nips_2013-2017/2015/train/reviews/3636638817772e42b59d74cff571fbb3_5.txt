The paper presents a synchronous and an asynchronous gossip algorithm for U-statistics. The paper derives the techniques and shows that they achieve convergence rates of 1/t and log t / t, respectively.
The paper is well organized and shows results that demonstrate the performance. The area it studies is of some interest and the presented technique is thus of use to different researchers. This paper introduces new gossip algorithms for the estimation of U-statistics that has favorable convergence rates. Experiments show its performance advantages over other approaches and illustrate its accuracy.
