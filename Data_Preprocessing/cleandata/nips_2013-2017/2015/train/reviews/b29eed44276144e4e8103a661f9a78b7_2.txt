This paper proposed "hierarchy width" which is a new graph property for bounding the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs.
The reviewer concerns about the fact that the hierarchy width of a graph is always larger than its hypertree width.
By my intuition, polynomial time exact inference seems more difficult that polynomial mixing time sampling.
But the fact is counterintuitive.
Why sampling is much harder than exact inference? It is one of my light review paper. This paper proposed a new graph property "hierarchy width", which bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling on factor models.The theoretical result of this paper seems important for understanding the property of Gibbs sampling on factor graphs.
