Update after author feedback and discussion: I am disappointed in the feedback and the authors not commenting about the practicality of the method for actual streaming data, and thus decreasing my score. As far as I understand, the algorithm could resample any earlier points again and hence to apply it one would need to record and repeatedly access the entire stream. This is clearly not comparable with real streaming algorithms and this would need to be made more explicit. Interesting suggestion to generalise Bayesian inference for infinite data streams. I would have liked to see more comparisons about how the problem could be approached in a Bayesian setting by changing the model, and did not see how this is streaming as you might in theory have to resample the very first data points again much later.
