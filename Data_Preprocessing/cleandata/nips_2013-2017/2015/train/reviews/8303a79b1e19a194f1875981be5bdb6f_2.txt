This paper presents and verifies (correctness and performance through simulation) a sensible variation on HMC for pdfs with discontinuities or on a bounded domain.
The method relies on simulating refraction and reflection that result from hamiltonian dynamics, so leads to better proposals around discontinuities (and higher acceptance rates => higher ess).
 One thing that would be nice is to see an example of a pdf when it's not worth computing intersections.
What types of high dimensional pdfs is this method not suited for?  This paper presents and verifies
