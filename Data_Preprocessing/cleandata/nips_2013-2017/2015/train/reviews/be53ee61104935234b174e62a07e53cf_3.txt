This paper takes the problem of Isotonic Regression with l_p norms as the error estimate and provides fast provable algorithms for this setting. The authors use ideas from the SDD near liner solver literature to provide fast algorithms.
Quality: This is a high quality paper. The paper is overall readable, the ideas are stated clearly, and the results are impressive.
 Clarity:
Overall the clarity is good. Objects are defined and the contribution is clearly stated. I wish the authors could provide some intuition as to why one can obtain the improvement in complexity for the isotonic regression setting. What are the key ideas the authors built off of. I really liked this paper. Relating isotonic regression to a graph problem is reasonable, the idea of using fast SDD solvers to obtain implementable algorithms with bounds is interesting. The authors also have some interesting ideas in their proof formulation.
