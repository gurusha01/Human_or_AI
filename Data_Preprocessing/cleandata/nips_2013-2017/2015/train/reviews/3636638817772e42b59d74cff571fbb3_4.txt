This paper talks about the problem of computation of average statistics in a distributed environment. The algorithm itself is quite intuitive and may be lacking clear novelty - though the proofs are comprehensive.
One weakness of the paper is the it does not compare with any baseline measures. I am sure several intuitive baselines can be generated based on randomized algorithms and some should be considered for experimentation. The paper solves an interesting problem but the evaluation is weak and there are no baseline measures used.
