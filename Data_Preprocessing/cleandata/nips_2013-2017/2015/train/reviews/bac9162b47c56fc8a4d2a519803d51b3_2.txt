Authors apply LSTM recurrent neural networks to the task of modeling student learning in online courses.
Results are better than some previous baselines.
The paper is written quite well, uses a spectacular dataset in evaluation (47,000 students solving problems on Khan Academy), and gets results that are significantly better than the baselines to which the paper was compared. Paper is well-written, and with solid performance results.Definitely an applications paper of the style, "we applied LSTM's to this problem, using a very large dataset, and got great results."
