This work is a natural extension to the existing CNN based object detection. My concerns are as follows.
1. In the optimization section, it looks like there is only one iteration for the alternating optimization between RPN and R-CNN. If this is the case, it assumes the proposals generated by the first iterated RPN are optimal, which is obviously not true.
2. When the pixel-wise sliding window is applied to the top layer of CNN, what is the step size on the image layer? Since CNN has several rounds of max-pooling, the top level is in a much smaller scale compared with the input image. The sliding window on the top level may have a big step on the image level, causing inaccurate bounding box locations.
3. What is definition of $h_a$ in the line 173 and 174?
 This work proposes a two stage object detection algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The first stage is region proposal, which is based on the traditional sliding window method but working on the top layer feature map of CNN (RPN). In the second stage, a fast R-CNN is applied to the proposed regions. Since the convolution layers are shared between RPN and R-CNN, and the calculation is speeded up using GPU, the algorithm can achieve near real-time (5fps).
