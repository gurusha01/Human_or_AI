This work is about predicting links in graphs using a heuristic based on common neighbours. The aim is to achieve a fast procedure based on counting common neighbours (which can easily be achieved by many informatics systems).
Although just a heuristic method, the performance on real-world data is not far behind benchmark algorithms.
The main manuscript is not does not quite work in a standalone manner, as following the proof sketches for Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 requires some definitions from the supplementary material (eg GOOD).
On page 2, there is a stretch of text that may need fixing "connect with probability $\gamma$. network has recently".
On page 4: "CN(i,j) = {u | i ~ u ~ v}".
I think the "v" should be a "j".
 I am not qualified to pass expert judgement, but this work seemed to be potentially useful (in terms of speed), with some rigorous results on the applicability of a proposed link prediction heuristic.Parts of the manuscript are not quite self contained (need to refer to supplementary material).
