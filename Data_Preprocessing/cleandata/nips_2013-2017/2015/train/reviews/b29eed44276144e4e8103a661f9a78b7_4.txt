The paper makes two main contributions: (1) A novel notion of hierarchy width that can be used to bound the mixing time of Gibbs sampling in factor graphs (along with the requirement that the parameters of the factor graph are bounded). (2) A new relational modeling language for generating factor graphs on which Gibbs sampling will mix rapidly.
 Another minor contribution is empirical evaluation, which shows that the theoretical results are indeed applicable to real-world problems.
 Overall, the paper is well-written and was a joy to read. I don't have any special comments except that it might be instructive to also look at "Blocked Gibbs sampling" as well as "Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling" and see how these can help reduce the hierarchy width. On the flip side, can hierarchy width be used as a strategy for constructing blocks and for Rao-Blackwellising the Gibbs sampler. See for example, Venugopal and Gogate, UAI 2013; Hamze and de Freitas, UAI 2004; and Bidyuk and Dechter, Journal of AI Research, 2007. The paper introduces a novel notion of hierarchy width of (relational) factor graphs and shows that along with a bounded parameters requirement it can be used to derive novel bounds on the mixing time of Gibbs sampling. It is well-written, makes an important advance and has good experimental results.
