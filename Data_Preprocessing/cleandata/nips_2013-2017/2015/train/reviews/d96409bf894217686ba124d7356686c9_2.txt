This paper presents a CNN-CRF approach for structured prediction by explicitly learning CNN messages for inference. I have several concerns as described below:
(1) A schematic figure might help explain the overall method. So far the exact roles of the proposed components are not clear. The equations should be made more intuitive.
(2) The scope of the proposed method seems to be quite limited as only very limited number of neighborhood connects can be considered and there are many approximations to the method. It lacks sufficient elegance and cleanness in the algorithm.
(3) The experimental results are only reported on the VOC dataset. Since this is a NIPS submission, justification on other popular datasets for structured labeling, e.g. OCR and POS, is needed.
Overall, the method is quite convoluted and it is hard to see what exactly the benefit of the proposed method is. The general direction of tackling the structured prediction problem by learning message passing in convolutional neural networks based CRF model is good. Improved results over the state-of-the-art on the PASCAL VOC image labeling dataset are reported. However, the scope of the proposed method is till somewhat limited and the solution is kind of intermediate.
