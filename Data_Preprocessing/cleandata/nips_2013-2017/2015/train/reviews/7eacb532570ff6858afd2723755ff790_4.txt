The authors propose an elicitation algorithm to compute the ranking over alternatives w.r.t. their parameters in Placket-Luce. The elicitation is guided quick sort and the sample complexity is bounded.
The paper is very well written. It clearly made a solid contribution to a natural and important problem. It would be nicer to see an lower bound on the sample complexity in the PAC framework for the problem considered in the paper. The main reason for not giving a higher recommendation is the presence of [1], which seems to have most of the conceptual setup of the model and problem. This is a clearly-written paper that made a solid (but not earthshaking) contribution to elicitation under the Plackett-Luce model.
