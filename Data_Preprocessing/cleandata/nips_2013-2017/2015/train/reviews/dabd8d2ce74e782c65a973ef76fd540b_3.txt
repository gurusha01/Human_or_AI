The authors give a multinomial logit (MNL) model to describe user preferences, which (a) under a collaborative ranking context uses a low-rank matrix to capture the underlying preferences and (b) under the bundled choice modeling the low rank structure captures how pairs of items are matched. In order to prove bounds, the authors use the random utility model.
 One contribution of this paper is that it provides a polynomial-time inference algorithm, though the Maximum Likelihood estimation for the general MNL model is intractable. Though there room for improvement, this paper could serve as the intermediate step to more general approaches which are more efficient.
The fact that the authors illuminate the weak spots of the model (e.g above equation 10) can actually help advance the research in this field.  This paper shows that the convex relaxation of nuclear norm minimization approach is minimax optimal. The authors give an upper bound on the resulting error with finite samples, and provide a matching lower bound.
