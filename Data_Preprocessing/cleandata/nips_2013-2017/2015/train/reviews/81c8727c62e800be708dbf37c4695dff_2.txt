This work proposes an optimization criteria that automatically adapts to the intrinsic complexity of the underlying dataset. Thus this method de-emphasize uninformative or weakly informative features and concentrates more on the relevant ones.
The paper is well written. The technical part is clear. It addresses an important issue in machine learning. This method seems novel to me although it might be even better to find the noise in the dataset and discard those items. Finally the experiments confirm their claim. This work presents a novel method that adapts to the intrinsic complexity of dataset. The author show theoretically and empirically the better generalization of the algorithm.
