SGs are graphical models over observed variables, consisting of undirected, directed, and bidirected edges. Bidirected edges represent a common latent parent, while undirected edges capture a bidirectional causal relationship between variables, where A can cause B or vice versa. The overall model seems to be a combination of ADMGs and MRFs.
SGs contain no partially directed cycles; also -- and <--> edges are not allowed to meet. These properties imply a factorization of the joint distribution that is a combination of ADMGs and MRF factors. If -- and <--> edges do meet in the original model, the authors show how to orient -- edges while preserving the conditional independencies; this is one of the main technical contributions.
 Quality: The paper is technically sound, and all claims are supported by rigorous proofs. There are no experiments, but the authors give examples of causal interactions for which SGs would be appropriate.
Clarity: The paper is well-written; however it is very dense and some of the proofs are hard to follow. I had to draw diagrams on the margins in order to understand claims throughout the paper. The presentation would probably be clearer if the paper included more illustrative figures.
Originality: SGs were constructed by merging existing models, and as such are not that original (even though the work is highly non-trivial).
 Significance: Not very significant on its own, but might have impact on future work. SGs would be more interesting if accompanied by e.g. some new results on causal identifiability (that cannot be expressed using existing models), or an inference algorithm for some parametric family.  This is a high quality paper that describes segregated graphs (SGs), a novel graphical model over observed variables, consisting of bidirected, directed, and undirected edges. The model seems to combine ADMGs and MRS, and has a bit more flexibility in specifying causal relationships.
