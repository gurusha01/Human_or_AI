The paper presents a new algorithm for global optimization that avoids delta-cover sampling and that achieves exponential regret, generalizing this way the work of Freitas el al., 2012 that relies on an impractical sampling procedure.
 The paper is well written and is easy to follow and the role of the new algorithm within the current literature of bounded-based search methods is well explained. In this sense, I think that this work deserves some attention from the community.
 I vote 5, however, a not a better score because I think that the experimental section is below the standard of what one expect to see in a BO paper. My main critics to this section are:
- The authors do no compare the methods for multiple initial evaluations of f as it is the standard in BO methods. Therefore no meaningful statical comparison of the methods can be obtained.
- Although they propose a bounded-based search method, the authors should compare they results with state of the art of BO approaches. Information theoretic approaches, such as, Entropy Search, are not used in the experiments.
 - All the experiments are carried out in synthetic functions (whose maximum dimension is 6). No real wetlab of parameter tuning experiment is used to illustrate the performance of the method in real scenarios.
  The paper presents a new global optimization algorithm that avoids delta-cover sampling and that achieves exponential regret. The paper is nice, with some interesting theoretical results but in my opinion the experimental section is below the standards of NIPS paper.
