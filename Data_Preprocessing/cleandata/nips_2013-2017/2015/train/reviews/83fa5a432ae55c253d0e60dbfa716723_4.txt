The paper proposes to find sparse projection bases that maximise the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between distributions. To the
best of my knowledge component analysis using EMD has received limited attention (except [A] for NMF). A non-convex optimisation problem is formulated and solved via a kind of alternating optimization. Some experiments (which importance I cannot fully evaluate) show quite some improvement over the state-of-the-art.

After reading the rebuttal I believe the paper is of NIPS quality and recommend acceptance.
