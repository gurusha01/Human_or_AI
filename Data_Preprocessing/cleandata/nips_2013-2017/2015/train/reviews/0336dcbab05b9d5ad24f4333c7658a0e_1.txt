The paper proposes a top-k hinge loss for top-k classification. It generalizes the multiclass SVM and uses the sum of k largest components as a convex approximation to the desired top-k loss. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed and relationships with previous work are discussed. Paper is clearly written. Experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to baselines.
1. The authors did not report comparisons with [25, 8] due to availability of the implementations. However, I am really interested in seeing the comparisons.
2. Can the authors make the code public upon acceptance?
  A neat formulation of top-k multiclass SVM that works well.
