81 : Maybe explain the current motion based methods better for readers who are not familiar. -Is it the first work that use convolution for recurrent transition for any kind of problem? If not please mention it. -The name conditional convolution is misleading and not accurate as there is no conditioning , it's just a convolution from previous time step input. 180: Explaining second hidden layer in detail is redundant
3.2 Why out of no where suddenly it's compared to TRBM in a whole section? If TRBM an important related work it should have been mentioned before.  The paper propose a new sequence based video super resolution model. The model replace the fully connected recurrent transition with convolutional recurrent transition and add extra convolution transition from the last time step inputs. They achieve better results with lower computational cost. It's an interesting computer vision application paper, with good results and I enjoyed reading it. But I am not sure about its impact to the nips community and it might be better received at computer vision conference.
