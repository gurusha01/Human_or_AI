The article extends the work on precisely characterizing the statistical performance of the l2-lasso to single-index models. The article also relaxes the usual Gaussian assumption on the prior (the distribution of x_0). It is a worthwhile contribution to the literature on precise asymptotic behavior of lasso-type estimators.
The article is well-written. However,
1. as pointed out by Brillinger (1982), the single index model is equivalent to a linear model with scaled unknown signal and non-standard noise. The connection is desribed rigorously in Appendix A, but it should also be mentioned in the main article to heuristically justify the statement in the blockquote on line 140.
2. the article focuses on the l2-lasso, also called the square root-lasso. The main benefit of the l2-lasso over the popular l2^2-lasso is the ``oracle'' value of the regularization parameter has no dependence on the (usually unknown) noise variance (sigma). A practical question that the results could shed light on is whether this justification for the l2-lasso over the l2^2-lasso is valid.
