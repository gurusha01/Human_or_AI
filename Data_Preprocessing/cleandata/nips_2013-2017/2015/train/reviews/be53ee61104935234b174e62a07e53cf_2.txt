The reductions in the computational complexity are significant to existing algorithms. My only concern of how the delta factor is the approximate solution affects the convergence for typical values of n.
Minor, if the first line after 1.1 it says $n\geq m-1$ and I guess it should be the other way around $n \leq m-1$.  In this paper the authors rely on approximate solvers to speed up the solution to isotonic regression with any norm.
