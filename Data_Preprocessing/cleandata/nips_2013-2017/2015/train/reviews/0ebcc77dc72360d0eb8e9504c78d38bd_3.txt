The paper describes a method of Bayesian global optimization which does not require d-cover sampling or auxiliary optimization.
The paper is organized such that the main contributions of the paper are well described in the main section.
The authors provide a good illustrative example of the algorithm in section 3.2, which gives the reader a nice high level understanding.
Section 3.3 also clearly communicates the workings of the algorithm programmatically for future implementation/replication.
Experimental results as well prove to be quite exciting.
Additionally, the authors note that the paper brings together ideas from the Bayesian global optimization literature that do and do not use continuity estimation.
 The paper describes Infinite-Metric GP Optimization (IMGPO), an algorithm for Bayesian optimization without the need for auxiliary optimization or d-cover sampling.The paper is not only clearly written, but provides a strong contribution to the NIPS community.
