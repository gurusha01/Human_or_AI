This paper studies the heuristic of common neighbors in link prediction and local clustering around a query node under the stochastic blockmodel setting. The authors show that theoretically, the common neighbors heuristic can extract clusters w.h.p. when the graph is dense enough, and can also succeed in sparser graphs with the addition of a cleaning step.
 The quality of this paper is generally good. For clarity it is OK, with some parts difficult to understand. In the end the authors compare SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN with state-of-the-art algorithms on real world data sets, and it seems SCAN and SCAN+CLEAN still perform worse than Spectral Clustering and Katz. It would be good if the authors could discuss about why. Maybe the real world networks do not satisfy the assumptions of the presented theoretical results very well. And it would be good if the authors could discuss, analyze and experiment with those aspects. This paper proposes a very interesting study. Overall it looks reasonable and convincing.
