3D object proposal for automatic driving is a novel and less studied research direction. The proposed method is more accurate than other methods. However, 1.2s process time is not particular fast. The paper is in general well-written, but I still have a few questions/comments: 1) Equation 1 is an energy function, but I cannot see why it is a MRF. It seems that energy is computed considering only one single candidate 3D object proposal at a time. 2) Many assumption might be violated. For instance, if depths are sparse and with many errors, will the performance decrease significantly. If ground plane estimate failed, will the performance decrease significantly. I will suggest the authors to conduct some experiments to show how sensitive are these assumptions. A 3D object bounding box proposal method is proposed to detect car, bike, pedestrian in stereo images. Since the focus is for automatic driving, the following strong assumption is used: 1) clean depth can be obtained from stereo pairs, 2) objects are on the same ground plane, 3) objects have typical 3D height and aspect ration which can be represented by a few template. According to these assumptions, several 3D cues such as 3d points density, free space amount, height prior, etc. are calculated (1.2s) to generate 3D object proposals. The proposed method obtains much higher recall than competing 2D and 3D methods given 500 proposals. By combining state-of-the-art CNN with the proposed region proposal method, significant accuracy improvement for hard to detected objects is achieved.
