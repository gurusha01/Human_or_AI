The proposed algorithm uses the KL distance between the true and the proposed posterior as the objective function. To compute the KL distance it uses stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to effienctly sample from the posterior and to optimize it it uses stochastic gradient descent.
 The writing is quite clear. It is a simple but effective approach and the examples provided show its benefits quite convincingly.
  The paper proposes a stochastic gradient algorithm to train a parametric model of the posterior predictive distribution of a Bayesian model.
