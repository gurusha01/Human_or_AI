Although I acknowledge the main thrust of the paper is theoretical, the experimental part is rather weak. In addition to illustrating the improved performance achieved by the several variants of Frank-Wolfe considered, it would also be very useful to give an idea about when these variants become competitive (in practice) with other methods, specially in problems for which many other methods can be used, such as l1-regularized regression in its unconstrained formulation.
  This is a nice paper, providing theoretical support to a number of improvements to the family of Frank-Wolfe algorithms, some of which had been shown in practice to considerably speed up convergence, but still lacked theoretical guarantees. The paper seems solid and well written, apart from a few minor mistakes that the authors can surely correct by carefully proofreading it.
