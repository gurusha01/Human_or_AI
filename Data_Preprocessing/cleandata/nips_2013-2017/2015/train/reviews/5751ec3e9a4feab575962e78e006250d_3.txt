In this paper, population Bayesian inference is proposed for stream data.
By introducing population distribution, the authors try to increase model flexibility with population posterior. Stochastic population variational inference is proposed for model parameter learning.
Experimental results are reported in comparison with stream VB and stochastic VB.
 There are several issues need to be addressed: 1) A more clear statement about the necessarily of population distribution is needed.
2) According to the paper, population VB should be able to capture the change of the data stream. But if  data points are from the current data set, what is difference between population
VB and SVI?
Why the sampling procedure for population VB can capture the current stream change if all data sample are treat equally?
3) With population distribution and parameter , we may get a more flexible model. But it comes with more computational cost due to the sampling procedure and additional parameter tuning.
Could the authors give a quantified computation time for all of the three methods on the data sets? Also details on how to choose .
 4)
The reasons why population VB performs worse than stream VB on Twitter dataset.
 Population Bayesian inference is proposed but lacks technical soundness.
