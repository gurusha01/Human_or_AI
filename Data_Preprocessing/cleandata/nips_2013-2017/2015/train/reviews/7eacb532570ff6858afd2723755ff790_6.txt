The authors have done a very good job in explaining the relevant literature in online preference based mechanisms. Both PAC-item and AMPR preference-based approximations are considered as goals for the problem of dueling bandit ranker. The authors build upon the fact that the pairwise comparisons executed by QuickSort algorithm in a stochastic setting are drawn from the pairwise marginals of the Plackett-Luce model. The idea of the Budgeted Quick-sort based algorithm seems simple enough -- however, I am not entirely convinced about its novelty. The elimination strategy used both for the PAC problem and the AMPR seems very intuitive (eliminate an item significantly beaten by another item). For the AMPR problem the authors estimate the Copeland score for every item. One contribution of the paper is that the authors give sample complexity bounds for both PAC and AMPR. The synthetic data results mostly follow the bounds covered in the theorems. One note is that the Condorcet winner is too restrictive of an assumption, thus "forcing" the authors to focus on the Placket Luce model which satisfies its existence.
 The contribution of this paper is to use a budgeted version of Quicksort to construct surrogate probability distributions over rankings. Based on the fact that the pairwise marginals using Quicksort coincide with the marginals of the Plackett Luce mode, they are able to take advantage of the transitivity properties of Placket-Luce.
