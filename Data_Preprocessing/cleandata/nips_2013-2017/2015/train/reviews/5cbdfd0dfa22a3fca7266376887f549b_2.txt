This paper proposes a tensor decomposition algorithm with a sparse noise setting. The proposed method is interesting and useful for general settings of tensor decompositions. And the algorithm could be tractable by reducing the original problem into matrix decompositions of matrices in pairs of modes. However experimental evaluation is limited.
Quality: This result is of decent quality. The proposed approach is general and useful, which can easily extend to high order tensors without increasing much computational cost. However numerical evaluation is limited and the used evaluation measure is unusual. The reason why authors used the accurate probability instead of MSE should be provided. Additional numerical evaluations with several noise settings are necessary.
 Clarity: This paper totally reads very well.
However no optimization algorithm for (6) is provided. I guess authors used [22] or [23]. At least, the summary of used algorithms should be described. In section 2.2, the model description X=\sum_{i=1}^r \lambda ... includes a mistake.
Originality: The proposed decomposition algorithms and its theoretical analysis are quite novel.
Significance: The proposed approach seems to be a promising decomposition. This approach can be easily implemented and extended to more general settings of tensor decomposition. To stress these advantages, discussions about related works is necessary.
  The proposed tensor decomposition algorithm is interesting and useful.
