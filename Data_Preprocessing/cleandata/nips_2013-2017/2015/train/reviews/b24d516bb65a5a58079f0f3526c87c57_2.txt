- It would to point out that pij(t) are actually subprobabilities, since \int{0}^{\infty} p_{ij}(t) < 1.
- Daneshmand et al. [ICML '14] also use the naming "hazard matrix" to denote a different quantity on a set of observed cascades. It would be useful to point out this, highlighting the differences.
- In section 4.1., the authors do not explicitly state that \alpha{ij} in [0, 1). I think this is necessary for p{ij}(t) to be a (sub)probability.
- The writing of the first paragraph of the introduction could be heavily improved.
- The authors refer to [3] as early work on influence maximization. [3] does not tackle the influence maximization problem, but a different one.
- The proof of Lemma 3 could be described more explicitly. In particular, explicitly relate f(x), g(x) and \mu(x) to the actual functions in the problem setting. This would help a reader to understand the definition of "right positive correlation", which is never formally written.
- In Eq. (11) in the proof of Lemma 4, the authors should explicitly write what is a and x in ln(1 - ax) >= ln (1-a)x to help the reader.
- In Eq. 12, should fi(s) on the right side not be fj(s)?
- There is some very recent work that aims to establish the theoretical foundations of influence models. In particular, there are sample complexity results on the recovery of influence models:
Daneshmand et al., ICML 2014 Pouget-Abadie et al., ICML 2015
Although different to this work, it would help the reader understanding that there is already an on-going interest on the theoretical analysis of such models. The authors perform a theoretical analysis of diffusion of contagions in networks. In particular, they develop a novel non-asymptotic upper bound on the influence (average number of infected nodes) of any source set in a network and a lower bound on the critical time after which a contagion becomes super critical. The analysis uses the concept of Laplace Hazard matrix, an intuitive quantity, which depends on the network structure and edge probability distributions and is based on previous work. Their bounds are fairly general and the authors instantiate them on several well-known diffusion models. The authors also validate their theoretical results with a fairly brief (and perhaps too shallow) experimental evaluation on synthetic data.The problem is scientifically interesting and is timely. To the best of my knowledge, there is no previous work on influence bounds for continuous time diffusion networks. The paper is mathematically sound. The experimental results could be a bit more insightful/illustrative.
