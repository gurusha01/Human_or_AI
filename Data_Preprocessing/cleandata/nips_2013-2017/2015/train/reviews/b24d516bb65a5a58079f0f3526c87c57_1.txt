This paper extends NIPS'14 paper [17] to upper bound the maximum influence and lower bound the time on the critical time of diffusion over networks. The particular insight is to use the Laplacian Hazard matrix (containing the laplace transform of the transmission rate function) as an extension of the harzard matrix in [17], and relate the size of influence (of infected nodes) to the spectral radius of this matrix.
The authors have also shown a few specific cases of particular transmission probabilities over time, e.g. contant, exponential and SI/SIR.
 The insight and the derived bounds are novel. The paper is clearly laid out.
I have not checked the accompanying proofs, they seem reasonable. It is also likely that I did not understood parts of the argument, hence the low confidence rating.  This paper extends NIPS'14 paper [17] to upper bound the maximum influence and lower bound the time on the critical time of diffusion over networks. This is a theoretical contribution that is novel, the influence bounds are shown to be tight visa simulation, and potentially applicable to algorithm and experimentation (not shown in this paper).
