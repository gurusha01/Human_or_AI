Summary of paper:
This paper proves linear convergence of (four) variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, under weaker conditions than in the existing literature.
Quality:
The paper is well written and the results are interesting. I think overall it would make a decent addition to NIPS, as it is a meaningful advancement of our understanding of the Frank-Wolfe procedure, which is increasingly important eg. for sub modular problems.
 Clarity:
The paper is clearly written overall. I feel the reader of an 8-page nips version would be better served with a "in words" description of the different variants, with the exact algorithmic description boxes being in the appendix. As currently written it is hard to parse what precisely the variants are doing differently, one any way needs to rely on the text.
The intuition section is useful.
Originality:
As per this reviewer, the main original contribution of this paper is to present a more unified view of the various FW variants already proposed, and also a more unified proof of their convergence.
 Significance:
Overall, this paper will provide a good reference for variants of the FW algorithm. FW algorithms, like other first-order methods that leverage problem structure, have seen renewed interest in the ML community, so this could be interesting to the NIPS audience. This paper proves linear convergence of (four) variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, under weaker conditions than in the existing literature. It gives both a unifying view of existing results, and establishes new convergence guarantees.
