This paper proposes a 2D-3D convolutional network to detect neuronal boundary from 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain image. Different from the traditional convolutional network, the proposed method uses both 3D and 2D filters to encode the information in EM image sequence. In the training stage, a recursive schema is applied to effectively learn 3D features from 2D initialization. Further, ZNN is applied for more efficient computation. The proposed method is tested on cortex images. Compared with base2D and VD2D models, the proposed 2D-3D model achieves lower error rate.
The paper is in general well written and easy to understand. The proposed method shows novelty in neuronal boundary detection and has potential to be applied to other sequential data such as video frames.
However, the experiment part is not strong enough. Although 2D-3D model demonstrates more accurate boundary detection compared with 2D models, further experiments should be carried out, such as the comparison experiments against the state-of-the-art in boundary detection.
 The paper is interesting and generally well written. More comparison to the state-of-the-art in neuronal boundary detection is needed to demonstrated the power of the proposed method in such an application.
