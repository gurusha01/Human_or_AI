The authors consider the problem of finding policy parameters that minimize a given risk measure. The class of risk measures considered in the paper is general, and defined by simple coherence properties such as convexity, monotonicity, and translation invariance. The presented approach is based on a dual representation of any coherent risk measures as a convex hull of probability distributions. The risk of a random variable (such as a cost) is given by the maximum expected value in the hull. The paper makes an assumption on the family of coherent risk measures, by bounding the maximum derivatives of the convex hull's borders (i.e., the borders of the hull are M-Lipschitz continuous). Using this assumption, the authors analytically derive the optimal policy parameters (w.r.t the risk measure), as well as a general gradient estimation algorithm for both the static case (one-step decision), and the dynamic (or sequential) case.
The paper is well-written and organized. Although I am not familiar with risk-sensitive optimization, I was able to follow most of the explanations. The main contribution of this work is the unified analysis of a general class of risk measures that include most well-known measures. I believe that this is a significant contribution. However, a deeper empirical analysis of the proposed gradient algorithm would be appreciated.
Some comments/questions 1- The preliminaries section is not clear enough. I was confused about the roles of P_{\theta} and \ksi . 2- Isn't Equation 2 just the definition of a convex envelope? Why is this more restrictive than Theorem 2.1? 3- I would suggest adding a comment on how the analysis generalize to distributions on continuous variables. 4- It would be nice to mention in the short paper the role of the smoothness of the constraint functions in proving Theorem 4.2  A strong theory paper that provides a general approach to risk-sensitive decision-making. Results seem compelling but proofs need to be verified.
