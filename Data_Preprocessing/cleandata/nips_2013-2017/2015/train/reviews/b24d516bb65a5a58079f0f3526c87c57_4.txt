Understanding the process influence maximization is critical in several domains like epidemiology,
computer networks, marketing, etc and the most widely used model to capture the temporal behavior in the cascade process is the CTIC model. Assessing the result quality is a challenge and prior work shows that the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix plays
a key role and derives a tight bound for the influence in a general graph. The authors extend the prior work to handle anytime influence bounds. They define when a contagion is sub-critical and super-critical and provide a lower bound when the contagion becomes super-critical and show the application to several contagion models. The proofs look comprehensive. The experimental results show the goodness of the model on the synthetic dataset but it would be useful to also see how the model scales up for large real graphs.
 The paper looks like a good paper and is well written. The weak points may be the novelty and lack of evaluation on real datasets.
