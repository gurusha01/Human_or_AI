This paper proposes the use of a (Budgeted) Quick-Sort algorithm for the rank elicitation problem (in the dueling bandits setting). The algorithm works by fitting the observations to those observed under a Plackett-Luce distribution. Under this assumption the model is then analyzed theoretically and studied empirically.
While I like the overall idea in the paper, I had a few concerns starting with the restrictiveness of the model. Compared to closely related work, such as the vast work on the Dueling Bandits, the model here is analyzed under a very strict assumption of having been generated under a P-L model. Given that both the theoretical and empirical analysis is under this assumption, I'm unclear how impactful this will be given other existing algorithm. Some analysis and experimentation with even the smallest amount of violation from this P-L assumption would have added significant value in my opinion (given that real world data has no guarantees of coming from a P-L model). I also would have preferred ranking metrics to study performance at the AMPR problem in addition to optimal recovery rate, to better understand where the errors lie. Interesting application of QuickSort to the dueling bandits problem. However unsure of impact due to limiting model assumptions.
