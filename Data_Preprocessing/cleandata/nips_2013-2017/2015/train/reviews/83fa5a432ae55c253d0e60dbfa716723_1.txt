The paper give a rather original approach to characterizing differences between two distributions (e.g. populations) by linear projections. Experiments on synthetic and real data seem to support the conclusions. Looks like a very solid and original paper.
 Unfortunately I have low confidence for this review mainly due to my ignorance of relevant literature. Interesting and algorithmically sophisticated paper on a method trying to find differences between populations, going beyond mere classification.
