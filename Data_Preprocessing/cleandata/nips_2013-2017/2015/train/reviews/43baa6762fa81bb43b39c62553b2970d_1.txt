The paper presents an analysis of the robust PCA problem (decompose M=L+S) but with random locations of the locations of the errors S and a local notion of incoherence.
 That is rather than a global incoherence of L, authors study local incoherence of each element of L. Using this notion, they derive tighter bounds for the number of non-zeros allowed in S.
 The result of the paper seems novel and somewhat interesting. The analysis follows the standard analysis but includes complications due to the local incoherence. However, it is not clear if the local incoherence indeed adds a lot of complication to the proof. Also, the main message or technique from the analysis is not concrete.
 So, despite the result being novel, it is not clear how interesting the analysis is and how important the result is.  See below.
