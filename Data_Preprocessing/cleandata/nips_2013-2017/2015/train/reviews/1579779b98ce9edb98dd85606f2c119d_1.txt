Edit after feedback: After discussion with the other reviewers and looking at the rebuttal, I still think this is a good paper that deserves publication on the basis of the elegance of the approach, and the fact that it is likely to lead to more research on related approaches. I do agree that the experimental results are a bit disappointing. Still, with stronger results I'd probably rate the paper even higher, so I think that this score is appropriate. Very clearly written paper proposes a nonconvex relaxation for global optimization of decision trees with a fixed structure.Elegant approach, but somewhat disappointing experimental results.One simple change would be, after using this global optimization, to throw away the last split in each tree and optimize it and the leaf node in the standard way, which might lead to better results.Also important to evaluate that global optimization should generally lead to more overfitting.
