Overall I liked the paper although at times it is difficult to follow. The authors make a good effort at going from the process interpretation to the generative model interpretation and also repeatedly pointed out the main goal to achieve by their proposed method. If they can match it with extensive experiments I think this will be a great paper.
 The authors have answered my questions on experiments in their rebuttal and I hope that these details will be added in the final version. The paper presents a Hybrid MCMC sampler for Poisson-Kingman mixture model. It combines the usefulness of conditional and marginal sampler. The authors claim that this reduces the memory requirement while increasing mixing.My main criticism is with respect to the experiments done in this paper. They have shown result on uni-dimensional dataset without any experiments to show that their method is not effected with increasing dimension or size of datasets. Nor is their any experiment to show how significant of a reduction in memory requirement they get which has been mentioned as one of the main reasons for which this method should be used. This is why I did not give this paper a 7 score. I would request the authors to comment on this.
