This paper describes the application of RNNs (simple and LSTM) to the task of predicting student performance based on their previous performance. The improvement over the baseline method (BKT) is very large. There is a brief experiment on improving curricula, and an exploration of the relationships between exercises.
The method is easy to follow, both because the paper is well written (but needs proofreading, see below) and the techniques are not very complicated. Personally, I think that "not complicated" is a good thing, but for some, this might be considered a negative. The paper is a novel application of an existing technique to an existing problem. As mentioned already, the improvement is very large and should be significant for the computer-assisted education field.  A clear paper with good results on an application in computer-assisted education; from a machine-learning point of view, maybe not as impactful.
