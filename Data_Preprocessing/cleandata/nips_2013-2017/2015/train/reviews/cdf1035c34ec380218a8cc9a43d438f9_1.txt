Online binary vertex classification over a graph. In the problem, initially the learner is provided with a graph $G$ and on each round, possibly adversarially a node from this graph is picked and the learner provides a label in $\{0,1\}$ for this node. Nature then reveals the true label $y_t$ for this node. The prediction made by the learner is based on the ising model when the temperature parameter approaches 0. However this is a compitationally hard problem to solve and so the authors propose an approximate scheme based on constructing Picard-Queyranne graphs that preserve combinatorial structure of minimum cuts. Now the learner makes predictions by playing an online game on the PQ graph instead. The authors provide a mistake bound for the algorithm. In the case when the graph is a tree the mistake bounds are comparable to treeopt algortihm
 I really liked the paper but it definitely was a hard read and the paper is not all that well written. Even the basic problem setup and description is staggered around in the first two sections. It would nice to give a bullet point type list to give a concise but complete description of the basic problem. The authors should also consider giving an informal proof outline and high level results in one of the first two sections. The 0-ising model is a very natural although intractable benchmark model to compare against. The comparison of the treeopt to the proposed algorithm is encouraging.The reduction to PG graphs and the prediciton PQ prediction game is interesting and novel
 Overall I believe the work is defintiely worth publishing. The problem considered is a very interesting one and has practical applications. The time complexity of the algorithm is order square of number of vertices which makes it suitable only for small to medium scale problems.
