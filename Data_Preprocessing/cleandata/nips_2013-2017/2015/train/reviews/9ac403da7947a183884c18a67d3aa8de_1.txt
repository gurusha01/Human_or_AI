The authors try to tackle the problem when bidirected edge (<->) and undirected edge (-) meet in a loopless mixed graph. They propose to construct a new mixed graph called segregated graph (SG) (where bidirected edge (<->) and undirected edge (-) never meet) which preserves all conditional independencies on the observed variables.
 I like the originality of the idea. I am somewhat disappointed by the clarity of the paper, which affects the quality too. Also the significance of the problem considered is not well addressed. Here I give more details on each criterion: Clarity: I like the authors' explanation of the big picture before going to details, which helps to clarify to some degree. However, once we check the details, it becomes less clear caused by typos and undefined/undeclared symbols. It would be much easier to read if the authors follow notations in any of the well known (and recent) publications on this topic such as [4], [1], and [2*].
Quality: it is dragged down by the level of clarity. Also I notice that if we move most of the proofs to the supplementary file, the paper would have much more spare space (2-3 pages perhaps). This suggests much more content can be added to the paper. Originality: good. *Significance: the importance of the problem is only lightly touched (line 128-129) with a bit further discussion on the implication in conclusions.

After reviewers' dissuasion and seeing authors' response, I've increased the score by one step. This paper proposes segregated graphs in order to tackle a problem in loopless mixed graphs, where bidirected edge (<->) and undirected edge (-) meet.
