This paper builds upon previous EM method for CTMC, and tackles the conditional statistics borrowing some recently developed tools. It makes a detailed comparison over a few inference methods, in terms of accuracy and complexity.
Quality: a. For experiments, the baselines chosen are too week since they do not consider state transition/trajectory information. It is natural to compare with discrete time HMM approaches where you can set discretize the time horizon by setting a proper bin size.
b. Related to a., considering the time complexity to do inference on CT-HMM, why not simply discretize the time horizon? If the sampling rate is irregular, we can consider a proper bin size: if bin size is small, we have 1 or 0 (missing) observation in each bin; if bin size is large, we have >=1 observations in each bin and take a local average. I expect in most problems, this method works just as fine. Have you considered this approach for your dataset? c. For CT-HMM, other inference methods like sampling also exist, i.e., Fast MCMC sampling for Markov jump processes and extensions, Rao et al., JMLR 2013. Have you also compared with such approaches?
Clarity: The paper is clearly written.
Originality: This is novel in the sense it provides an EM-based approach for CT-HMM, although the tools/building blocks used were proposed in previous work.
Significance: The paper proposes an EM-based inference method for CT-HMM. If the author can release their software package, it will be a useful toolbox for the community. This work presents an EM method for CT-HMM model, using some of recently developed tools. Though incremental, it provides an inference method for CT-HMMs.
