The material in this paper is non-trivial and the paper is well-written. The experimental results are also good.
The only suggestion I have is to motivate the choice of the loss function further.
 Also, I spotted a typo in page 3 - "globally optimal leads to" (remove optimal).  This is a nice paper that describes an interesting problem. The idea to to learn with respect to the top-k loss, where k predictions are made and the loss is zero if the true class is included in the k predictions.
