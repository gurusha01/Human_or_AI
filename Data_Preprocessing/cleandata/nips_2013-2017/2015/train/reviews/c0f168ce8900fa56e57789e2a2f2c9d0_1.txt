The analysis by the authors is highly technical and impressive.
 The issues with the paper are: 1. There are many areas where facts are stated and a citation is expected, but none is provided. For example, "Indeed several Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have been analyzed for the case where the posterior distribution is supported on a convex set, and the negative log-likelihood is convex." As well as, "... convexity is a key property to obtain algorithms with provable guarantees for this task."
2. It would be interesting if the results section compared to more standard MCMC algorithms on interesting inference problems rather than just "volume estimation" benchmarks. The performance gains should also be specified quantitatively rather than just graphically.
3. There is no conclusions section (even a few sentences). That is not a very polished way to end a paper.
4. There are no axis labels on the plots. Error bars would be nice too.
Other comments: 1. It would be nice if the authors could elaborate on what exactly they mean with "Unfortunately the techniques used in Dalalyan [2014] cannot deal with the singularities in the diffusion process ...". What singularities?
2. It appears there might be a typo on line 307. Is the C supposed to appear in the inequality? Would that make Lemma 3 contain C^2? The authors do a heavy theoretical analysis to provide guarantees on the accuracy of Langevin Monte Carlo methods. Their main result shows a big-O like result relating the number of samples required, the dimension of the space, and the desired accuracy (as measured in total variation distance between the target distribution and the one actually sampled from).
