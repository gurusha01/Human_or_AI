Summary
The paper studies the problem of batch learning from logged bandit feedback, a very relevant problem in for example ad ranking. The paper identifies an "overfitting" problem in the recently proposed CRM principle and proposes a solution based on multiplicative control variates (this results in a biased estimator).
 Quality
High-quality and well motivated. Again, as it is follow-up work on [1] I would have expected additional experiments and some additional analysis on the optimization of the training objective (more details than in the paragraph on line 415).
 Clarity
Presentation is clear and paper is well written.
 Originality
Follow-up work on [1], but modifying the risk estimator to be self-normalizing, which seems to make a big difference in the experiments studied by the authors.
 Significance
The problem of learning from logged data is relevant, however it is difficult to say how the substantial experimental improvements translate to more real-world applications.
 Various Remarks
365: if you already run several repetitions, please also include some measure of variance. The paper identifies a problem in the recently proposed Conterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) principle and introduces a solution to the problem. Overall the paper is solid, well written and the work is relevant and novel. I would however have appreciated some extended experiments and especially additional applications then the ones in [1], including some actual real-world applications.
