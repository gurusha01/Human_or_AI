- It would be nice to mention from the beginning that you need full model knowledge (Eq. 6)
- Sect. 4 and 6 are disproportionate.
 - Sect. 4 does not mention the recurrent units from the abstract.
- l. 405: How is this a stochastic NN? The training data is stochastic but the network itself seems deterministic.
Rebuttal ======== Thank you for the additional information. LIGHT REVIEW The paper shows promising results but should be restructured.
