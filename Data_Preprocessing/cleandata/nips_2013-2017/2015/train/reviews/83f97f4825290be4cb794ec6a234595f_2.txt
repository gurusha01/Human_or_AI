The paper proposes a new greedy method for streaming hypergraph clustering, with the goal of minimizing the maximum number of topics covered by a partitioning. The proposed algorithm is simple, and the authors prove the algorithm provably performs well under a balance assumption of the data, asymptotically uncovering the hidden partitioning. The algorithm is then compared against other simple algorithms on real data sets, which it outperforms in terms of normalized maximum load.
It is noted that the new techniques could not be compared against batch methods on real data sets due to their slow computational time. The experiment could be performed on smaller sets (or simply small subsets of the data sets used), and may be interesting (even though the new method cannot necessarily be expected to perform as well as batch techniques, it would be interesting to see what the gap is).
 Small typo: Double "the" on line 319.  The paper proposes a new greedy method for streaming hypergraph clustering, with the goal of minimizing the maximum number of topics covered by a partitioning, proving that it performs well under balance assumptions and demonstrating its efficacy in practice. This problem is typically studies in the batch setting, this makes a natural step and studies it in the streaming model, and the new method seems to work well.
