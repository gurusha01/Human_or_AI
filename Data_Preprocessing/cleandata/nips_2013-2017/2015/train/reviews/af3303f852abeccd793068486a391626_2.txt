the main idea of the manuscript is, in a regression context, to approximate the predictive distribution with a simple tractable model in order to avoid the high cost required to approximate the true predictive distribution using Monte Carlo samples. The authors discuss why they want to use a Bayesian approach (and their claims are somewhat supported by their simulations) in contrast with a plug in approach. The approach developed comes with no surprise, but is natural and sensible : minimize an averaged KL divergence between the true predictive and the surrogate parametric model using the output of SGLD algorithm. Performance of the method is illustrated through simulations on some examples and, as for any manuscript, outperforms competitors. There are numerous parameters to choose in the algorithm, which is not discussed. Nothing surprising in the manuscript. It is an idea worth exploring.
