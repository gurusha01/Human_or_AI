The paper introduces EAMSGD algorithm for fast convergence of distributed SGD. The idea is based off several prior class works in distributed optimization and is first drawn a connection with deep learning models. Results on public datasets CIFAR and ImageNet are solid and shown clearly.
 Quality: high quality paper with good ideas and solid results.
 Clarity: the paper is well structured, at the same time, clearer and more direct formulations of the algorithm might be more appreciated by the reader. For instance, the different types of distributed sgd at start of section 5 is not clearly documented. Suggest a table format or show the list of available algorithms with clear categories. It will bring out the results even better.
 Originality: since the idea is draw from prior classic works, the idea is not entirely new, at the same time the application to recent deep learning models and dataset is a first-time.
 Significance: due to the flourishing of distributed deep learning in industry and academia, this paper should be appreciated by many engineers and researchers.
 The paper, with the proposed elastic averaging method for distributed SGD, shows good results on empirical image classification experiments. The authors also provided theoretical analysis and mathematical formulations by drawing analogy to ADMM. The research idea is novel and results are solid and show clearly. Other than some details in experiments which could be improved, this is a good paper recommended to be published at NIPS.
