Overall, I liked the paper. The paper addresses an important problem, and has a nice balance of theoretical results and empirical ones. Some comments:
1) The authors should mention that the problem they consider is a special case of submodular load balancing, studied in 'Submodular approximation: sampling-based algorithms and lower bounds' (Svitkina & Fleicher).
2) The result about arbitrary partitions (Proposition 2) was known for general submodular functions (see, again the above reference). 3) Another related paper -- Graph Partitioning via Parallel Submodular Approximation to Accelerate Distributed Machine Learning (Mu Li et al) This paper studies the problem of Min-Max hyper-graph partitioning in a streaming setting. The authors observe that this problem is an instance of min-max subodular data partitioning, a problem also called the submodular load balancing problem. The authors show theoretical results, and demonstrate the algorithm on real world data.
