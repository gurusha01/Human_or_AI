The paper addresses the problem of estimating the density ratio \( q/p \), a critical task in statistical inference, importance sampling, and transfer learning under covariate shift. The authors propose a novel formulation of the problem as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind and solve it using regularization techniques in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The resulting family of algorithms, termed FIRE (Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator), is theoretically analyzed, with convergence rates and concentration bounds provided for Gaussian kernels on Euclidean spaces and smooth sub-manifolds. Additionally, the authors introduce an unsupervised model selection method, CD-CV (Cross-Density Cross-Validation), and demonstrate FIRE's effectiveness through experimental comparisons with existing methods like Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) and LSIF.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Rigor: The paper introduces a principled framework by connecting density ratio estimation to classical inverse problems, leveraging RKHS-based regularization. The theoretical contributions, including convergence rates and concentration bounds, are robust and well-supported.
2. Algorithmic Simplicity and Flexibility: The FIRE algorithms are computationally efficient, leveraging the representer theorem for explicit solutions. The flexibility in using different norms and regularization techniques is a significant advantage.
3. Unsupervised Model Selection: The CD-CV approach addresses a critical challenge in unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, providing a practical mechanism for parameter tuning.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments demonstrate strong empirical performance of FIRE compared to alternatives, particularly in computational efficiency and robustness under various settings.
5. Connections to Related Work: The paper situates its contributions within the broader context of density ratio estimation, transfer learning, and kernel methods, providing clear distinctions from related algorithms like KMM and LSIF.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the theoretical exposition is thorough, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with integral equations or RKHS theory. Simplifying key concepts or including a more intuitive explanation of the Fredholm problem could enhance accessibility.
2. Limited Experimental Scope: Although the experiments are compelling, they are primarily focused on synthetic and small-scale datasets. Evaluating FIRE on larger, real-world datasets or more diverse applications (e.g., reinforcement learning or domain adaptation) would strengthen its practical significance.
3. Comparison with KMM: The paper critiques KMM for lacking out-of-sample extensions and stability but does not provide direct experimental comparisons due to this limitation. Including a workaround for comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Assumptions on Smoothness: The theoretical results rely on smoothness assumptions (e.g., Sobolev spaces) that may not hold in practical scenarios with high-dimensional or noisy data. A discussion of these limitations and potential remedies would be valuable.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant theoretical and algorithmic contribution to density ratio estimation and kernel methods. The novel formulation, rigorous analysis, and practical algorithms represent a meaningful advancement in the field. However, the authors should consider revising the manuscript to improve clarity and address the experimental and theoretical limitations discussed above.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical contributions with detailed analysis.
- Novel and flexible algorithmic framework.
- Practical relevance through unsupervised model selection (CD-CV).
- Empirical results demonstrating competitive performance.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense presentation may limit accessibility for a broader audience.
- Limited experimental scope and lack of direct comparison with KMM.
In summary, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field, and its acceptance would benefit the NeurIPS community.
