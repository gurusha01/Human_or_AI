The paper presents a novel Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for Bayesian low-rank matrix reconstruction and its application to clustering problems. The authors claim two primary contributions: (1) extending existing AMP algorithms to handle maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and (2) formulating a clustering algorithm that incorporates structural constraints directly into the low-rank matrix reconstruction framework. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to Lloyd's K-means algorithm and other baseline methods in numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The extension of AMP algorithms to MAP estimation is a significant contribution, as it broadens the applicability of AMP beyond posterior mean estimation. The integration of structural constraints into the clustering framework is also innovative and addresses a gap in existing methods.
2. Performance: The proposed AMP-based clustering algorithm outperforms Lloyd's K-means and K-means++ in terms of K-means loss and accuracy, particularly for high-dimensional data. The results on the ORL face dataset further demonstrate its practical utility.
3. Efficiency: The algorithm achieves linear computational complexity in the size of the input matrix, making it scalable for large datasets. The authors also highlight the fast convergence of the AMP algorithm compared to variational Bayes methods.
4. Theoretical Insights: The paper provides a detailed theoretical foundation for the algorithm, including its derivation from belief propagation and connections to the Bethe approximation. The discussion of state evolution and fixed-point properties adds rigor to the work.
5. Comprehensive Experiments: The numerical experiments are well-designed, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The inclusion of multiple performance metrics (e.g., normalized K-means loss, accuracy, and iteration count) provides a holistic evaluation.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the dense mathematical exposition may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with AMP or Bayesian inference. Simplifying some derivations or providing intuitive explanations could improve clarity.
2. Comparative Analysis: The paper compares the proposed algorithm primarily with Lloyd's K-means, K-means++, and variational Bayes methods. However, it lacks a comparison with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms that might also handle high-dimensional data effectively.
3. Convergence Guarantees: Although the authors assume convergence of the AMP algorithm, they acknowledge that it is not guaranteed in general. A more detailed discussion or empirical analysis of convergence behavior would strengthen the paper.
4. Real-World Applications: While the ORL face dataset is a useful benchmark, additional experiments on more diverse real-world datasets would better demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and generalizability.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper makes significant contributions to Bayesian low-rank matrix reconstruction and clustering, supported by strong theoretical and experimental results. Addressing clarity issues and expanding the comparative analysis would further enhance its impact.
