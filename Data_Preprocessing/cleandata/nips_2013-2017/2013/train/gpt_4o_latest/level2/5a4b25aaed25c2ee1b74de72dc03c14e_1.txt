The paper presents a novel approach for inference in high-treewidth Ising models by projecting parameters onto a "fast-mixing" set, ensuring rapid convergence of Gibbs sampling. The authors propose multiple projection methods, including Euclidean distance, zero-avoiding KL-divergence, piecewise KL-divergence, and zero-forcing KL-divergence. They demonstrate that Gibbs sampling with the projected parameters achieves higher accuracy than with the original parameters under strong interactions and limited sampling time. The work is evaluated experimentally against standard variational methods and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters, showing promising results.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new notion of tractability for high-treewidth graphical models, focusing on parameter-space conditions for fast mixing rather than exact inference. This is a significant departure from traditional approaches like mean-field or tree-based approximations.
2. Technical Rigor: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation, including the derivation of projection algorithms using spectral norm constraints and dual optimization techniques. The use of stochastic gradient descent for KL-divergence minimization is well-motivated and aligns with state-of-the-art optimization methods.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper includes extensive experiments on both grid and random graph topologies, comparing the proposed methods with variational approaches (e.g., LBP, TRW, MF) and Gibbs sampling. The results demonstrate that the proposed projections yield more accurate marginals under time constraints.
4. Practical Implications: The approach is particularly useful in scenarios where exact inference is infeasible, and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters is too slow. The ability to guarantee rapid mixing is a practical advantage for real-world applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Looseness of Spectral Norm Bound: The spectral norm condition for fast mixing is overly conservative, as acknowledged by the authors. For example, the bound is less tight than known thresholds for the Ising model, potentially limiting the practical applicability of the method.
2. Computational Overhead: While the fast-mixing projections improve sampling efficiency, the computational cost of the projection itself (e.g., iterative thresholding of singular values or stochastic gradient descent) is significant. This overhead is not fully accounted for in the experimental comparisons.
3. Limited Scope: The method is currently restricted to Ising models, and its extension to general Markov random fields (MRFs) is left as future work. The dependency matrix bounds and projection algorithms for general MRFs remain open challenges.
4. Evaluation Metrics: The experiments primarily focus on marginal accuracy but do not explore other important metrics, such as computational efficiency relative to accuracy or robustness to different parameter settings.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Investigate tighter bounds for the spectral norm to improve the theoretical guarantees and practical utility of the method.
2. Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational trade-offs between projection overhead and sampling efficiency.
3. Extend the approach to general MRFs and explore its applicability to learning tasks, as suggested in the discussion.
4. Include additional evaluation metrics, such as runtime comparisons and robustness analysis, to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
Recommendation:
This paper offers a novel and technically sound contribution to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models. While there are limitations in the tightness of the bounds and computational overhead, the proposed methods are innovative and demonstrate clear advantages over existing approaches in certain scenarios. I recommend acceptance, with the caveat that the authors address the looseness of the spectral norm bound and provide a more detailed discussion of computational trade-offs. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel approach to tractability via fast-mixing guarantees.
- Strong theoretical foundation and experimental validation.
- Practical relevance for scenarios with limited sampling time.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Conservative spectral norm bounds limit applicability.
- High computational cost of projection methods.
- Restricted to Ising models without generalization to MRFs.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field and aligns well with the scope of the conference.
