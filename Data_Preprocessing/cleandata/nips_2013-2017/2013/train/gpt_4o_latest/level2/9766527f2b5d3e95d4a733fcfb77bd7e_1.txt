The paper presents a novel approach to variance reduction in stochastic gradient (SG) optimization by leveraging control variates constructed from low-order moments of the data. The authors demonstrate the utility of this method on two distinct problems: MAP estimation for logistic regression (convex) and stochastic variational inference (SVI) for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (non-convex). The results show faster convergence and improved performance compared to standard SG methods, highlighting the practical significance of the proposed technique.
Strengths:
1. Clear Contributions: The paper makes a clear and well-articulated claim about the use of control variates for variance reduction in SG optimization. The theoretical foundation is robust, with detailed derivations and explanations.
2. Novelty: The use of low-order moments to construct control variates is innovative and provides a practical solution to a common challenge in SG optimization. The approach is generalizable to both convex and non-convex problems, which broadens its applicability.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on logistic regression and LDA are thorough, with results demonstrating significant improvements in convergence rates and predictive performance. The use of multiple datasets for LDA further strengthens the empirical evidence.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a logical flow from theoretical formulation to practical implementation and experimental results. The inclusion of detailed derivations and approximations enhances reproducibility.
5. Significance: The proposed method addresses a fundamental issue in SG optimization—high variance in noisy gradients—and offers a solution that can be widely adopted in machine learning applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Applications: While the paper demonstrates the approach on two problems, additional examples (e.g., hierarchical Dirichlet processes or nonnegative matrix factorization) are only briefly mentioned in the supplementary material. Expanding the experimental scope would strengthen the claim of generalizability.
2. Computational Overhead: The paper does not thoroughly discuss the computational cost of constructing control variates, particularly for large-scale datasets. While the diagonal approximation for \(A^*\) reduces complexity, a more detailed analysis of scalability would be beneficial.
3. Assumptions on Data Moments: The reliance on low-order moments assumes that they adequately capture the data distribution. This may not hold for all datasets, especially those with complex structures or heavy-tailed distributions.
4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: Although the authors acknowledge potential future work, the paper does not explicitly discuss limitations of the proposed method, such as scenarios where control variates may fail to reduce variance effectively.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of stochastic optimization. The theoretical insights, combined with practical implementations and empirical validation, make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, the authors are encouraged to expand the scope of experiments and provide a more detailed discussion of computational costs and limitations in the final version.
