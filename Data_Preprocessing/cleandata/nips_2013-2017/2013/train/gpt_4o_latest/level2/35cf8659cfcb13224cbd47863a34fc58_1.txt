The paper presents a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), for uncovering hierarchical community structures in social networks. The primary claim is that BHCD is computationally efficient, scaling quadratically in the number of vertices and achieving comparable or better accuracy than the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) while being two orders of magnitude faster. The authors also introduce a greedy agglomerative algorithm for model selection, which constructs a hierarchical tree of communities in a single pass through the data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses an important problem in social network analysis—discovering hierarchical community structures—by extending Bayesian approaches to relational data. The hierarchical aspect is a significant improvement over flat community models like the stochastic blockmodel and IRM.
2. Efficiency: The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, with a worst-case complexity of \(O(n^2 \log n)\), making it suitable for large networks. The introduction of caching for sufficient statistics and the sparse variant further enhances scalability for sparse networks.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on Sampson's monastery network, NIPS-234, and the full NIPS co-authorship dataset convincingly demonstrate the model's ability to uncover meaningful hierarchical structures and make accurate predictions. The comparison with IRM highlights the computational advantage of BHCD.
4. Clarity of Methodology: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the model, including the generative process, likelihood computation, and the greedy agglomerative algorithm. The inclusion of variations like BHCD sparse and binary-tree restrictions adds depth to the analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more thorough theoretical analysis of the model's properties, such as its robustness to hyperparameter choices or convergence guarantees.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The evaluation primarily focuses on predictive performance (log likelihood, accuracy, AUC) and qualitative insights. Additional metrics, such as modularity or interpretability of the hierarchical structure, could strengthen the results.
3. Comparison with Other Models: Although the paper compares BHCD to IRM and references other Bayesian nonparametric models, a direct empirical comparison with more recent methods like the Latent Factor Relational Model (LFRM) or Infinite Latent Attributes (ILA) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Scalability for Sparse Networks: While the authors mention the potential for improving scalability on sparse networks, the current implementation still has a worst-case complexity of \(O(n^2 \log n)\). This could be a limitation for extremely large sparse networks.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include a more detailed discussion of the model's limitations, such as its dependence on greedy search and potential sensitivity to initialization.
2. Explore hyperparameter inference or non-conjugate likelihoods, as suggested in the discussion, to improve predictive performance.
3. Provide a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art hierarchical models, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to hierarchical community detection in social networks. Its computational efficiency and ability to uncover meaningful structures are significant strengths. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the theoretical and comparative analysis gaps. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the aforementioned weaknesses.
