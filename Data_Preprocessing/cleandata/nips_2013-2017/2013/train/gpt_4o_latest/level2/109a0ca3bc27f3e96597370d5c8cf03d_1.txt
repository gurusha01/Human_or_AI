This paper introduces and rigorously analyzes a new class of structured Schatten norms for tensors, focusing on two specific norms: the "overlapped" and "latent" Schatten norms. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for the empirical observation that the latent approach outperforms the overlapped approach in certain tensor decomposition scenarios, particularly when the underlying tensor is low-rank in a specific mode. The paper also establishes a novel duality result between these norms, connecting the work to structured sparsity literature. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the authors demonstrate that the latent approach achieves superior denoising performance, with error scaling determined by the minimal mode-k rank of the tensor, as opposed to the average rank dependency of the overlapped approach.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the latent Schatten norm, including consistency results and deterministic error bounds. The duality result between the overlapped and latent norms is novel and connects tensor decomposition to broader structured sparsity frameworks.
2. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments effectively validate the theoretical predictions, particularly the scaling behavior of the mean squared error (MSE) with respect to tensor dimensionalities and ranks. The latent approach's superior performance is convincingly demonstrated.
3. Practical Relevance: The latent approach's ability to handle tensors that are low-rank in a specific mode has clear implications for real-world applications, such as neuroimaging and collaborative filtering, where such structures are common.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly explains the differences between the overlapped and latent approaches, both theoretically and empirically, providing actionable insights for practitioners.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the experiments confirm the theoretical results, they are primarily conducted on synthetic data. Real-world datasets, such as those from neuroimaging or collaborative filtering, would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
2. Complexity of Implementation: The latent approach involves solving a more complex optimization problem compared to the overlapped approach. The paper could benefit from a discussion on computational efficiency and scalability, especially for large tensors.
3. Unexplored Extensions: The paper briefly mentions potential extensions, such as using other Schatten norms (e.g., S1/âˆž), but does not explore these in detail. This leaves some opportunities for further innovation unaddressed.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes significant theoretical and empirical contributions to tensor decomposition, a critical area in machine learning. The duality result and the analysis of the latent approach's performance are novel and impactful.
- Con: The lack of experiments on real-world datasets and limited discussion on computational efficiency may reduce the paper's immediate applicability.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a strong contribution to the field, but the authors should address the scalability of their approach and consider adding experiments on real-world datasets. Additionally, a more detailed discussion of potential extensions would enhance the paper's impact.
