This paper investigates the computational basis of active sensing, proposing a novel myopic approximation to the C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller) algorithm and comparing it to existing models, including Infomax. The authors also present experimental results from a human visual search task to evaluate the models' ability to replicate human behavior. The primary claim is that the myopic C-DAC retains the context-sensitivity of the original C-DAC while significantly reducing computational complexity, making it a more practical and psychologically plausible model for human active sensing. Additionally, the paper claims that C-DAC and its myopic variant outperform Infomax in capturing human behavior, particularly in terms of context-sensitive decision-making and confirmation bias.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The introduction of a myopic approximation to C-DAC is a meaningful contribution, as it addresses the computational intractability of the original model while preserving its context-sensitivity. This makes the work relevant for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence communities.
2. Experimental Validation: The use of human behavioral data to compare models is a significant strength. The results convincingly demonstrate that C-DAC and its myopic variant better capture human behavior, particularly the confirmation bias, compared to Infomax.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the models, experimental setup, and results. The theoretical derivations, such as the stopping boundary for Infomax, are well-presented and enhance the rigor of the work.
4. Practical Implications: The proposed myopic C-DAC has potential applications in designing computationally efficient, context-sensitive artificial systems, bridging the gap between neuroscience and engineering.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Generalizability: While the myopic C-DAC is computationally simpler, its performance is still tied to specific experimental conditions. The paper does not explore whether the model generalizes to more complex, real-world active sensing tasks.
2. Incomplete Approximation: The authors acknowledge that myopic C-DAC does not fully match the performance of the original C-DAC in reproducing human behavior. This leaves room for further refinement, particularly in approximating switching and stopping boundaries.
3. Comparison with Other Models: The exclusion of the greedy MAP model from the experimental comparison, despite its mention in the introduction, limits the breadth of the analysis. Including additional baseline models could strengthen the claims.
4. Behavioral Assumptions: The assumption that human subjects rely on Bayesian inference and follow specific policies (e.g., choosing the most probable location first) may oversimplify human decision-making processes.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and computationally efficient model for active sensing, addressing a critical limitation of the original C-DAC.
- The experimental results are robust and provide valuable insights into human active sensing behavior.
- The work has potential implications for both neuroscience and AI, making it a strong candidate for the conference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The generalizability of the proposed model to more complex tasks remains unclear.
- The paper could benefit from a broader comparison with additional baseline models and a deeper exploration of its limitations.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field, but addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly regarding generalizability and additional comparisons, would strengthen the work further.
