The paper introduces a class of Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) algorithms for parameter estimation in the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, leveraging pairwise comparisons derived from full rankings. The authors claim their approach is computationally more efficient than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm while maintaining competitive statistical efficiency. They provide theoretical guarantees for the consistency of their methods under specific breaking strategies and demonstrate these properties through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a novel application of GMM to the PL model, extending prior work on rank aggregation by introducing a systematic way to break full rankings into pairwise comparisons. The connection between GMM and the Rank Centrality (RC) algorithm is insightful and bridges theoretical gaps in the literature.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors rigorously establish conditions for the uniqueness and consistency of their GMM algorithms. The characterization of consistent and inconsistent breakings is a significant theoretical contribution.
3. Computational Efficiency: The proposed GMM algorithms are shown to have better asymptotic complexity than the MM algorithm. The detailed complexity analysis highlights practical trade-offs between computational cost and statistical efficiency.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on synthetic and real-world data (sushi dataset) effectively demonstrate the computational and statistical performance of the proposed methods. The observed time-efficiency tradeoff among top-k breakings is particularly compelling and aligns with theoretical expectations.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the exposition is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly for readers unfamiliar with GMM or the PL model. For example, the mathematical formulation of breakings and the consistency proofs are not easily accessible to a broader audience.
2. Practical Applicability: Although the authors emphasize computational efficiency, the real-world applicability of the proposed algorithms is somewhat limited by the assumption of data generated under the PL model. As noted in the sushi dataset experiments, the PL model may not always fit real-world data well.
3. Experimental Scope: The experiments focus primarily on synthetic data and one real-world dataset. Additional experiments on diverse real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's claims about the practical utility of the proposed methods.
4. Comparison with Alternatives: While the paper compares GMM with MM, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other rank aggregation methods, such as those based on neural networks or other probabilistic models.
