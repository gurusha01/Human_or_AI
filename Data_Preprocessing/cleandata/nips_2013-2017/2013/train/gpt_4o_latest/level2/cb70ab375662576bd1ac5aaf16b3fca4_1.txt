This paper addresses the challenging problem of learning dynamic models, specifically first-order Markov models and hidden Markov models (HMMs), from non-sequential data. The authors propose a novel approach leveraging the method of moments (MoM) and tensor decomposition techniques to provide the first formal guarantees for learning such models in this setting. The work is motivated by real-world applications, such as modeling galaxies, chronic diseases, and biological processes, where sequential data is often unavailable, and only unordered snapshots can be obtained. The paper claims to offer provable recovery of model parameters under reasonable assumptions and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods through theoretical analysis and preliminary simulations.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by tackling the problem of learning dynamic models from non-sequential data. The use of tensor decomposition to provide formal guarantees is innovative and advances the state of the art.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed theoretical analysis, including assumptions, derivations, and proofs, to support their claims. The sample complexity analysis for HMMs is a notable contribution.
3. Practical Relevance: The problem is well-motivated with real-world examples, and the proposed approach has potential applications in various domains, such as biology and astronomy.
4. Clarity of Assumptions: The paper clearly outlines the assumptions (e.g., Dirichlet-distributed initial states, geometric time steps) required for the proposed methods to work, which aids reproducibility and understanding.
5. Simulation Results: The simulation results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating convergence of the proposed methods and the feasibility of estimating key parameters like transition matrices and noise variance.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the experimental section is relatively limited. The simulations focus on synthetic data, and there is no application to real-world datasets, which would strengthen the practical impact of the work.
2. Complexity of Assumptions: The assumptions, while reasonable in theory, may not hold in many real-world scenarios. For example, the Dirichlet distribution for initial states and geometric time steps might not always align with practical data-generating processes.
3. Scalability: The sample complexity analysis suggests high computational requirements, particularly for large state spaces or high-dimensional observations. This could limit the applicability of the method to large-scale problems.
4. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections, particularly those involving tensor decomposition and its application to HMMs, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Additional intuitive explanations or visualizations would improve accessibility.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of learning dynamic models from non-sequential data, and its novelty and rigor make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, the lack of real-world experiments and the complexity of the assumptions warrant further exploration. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity of presentation and consider including real-world applications in future work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and significant contribution to a challenging problem.
- Strong theoretical guarantees and rigorous analysis.
- Potential for impactful applications in multiple domains.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited empirical validation on real-world data.
- High computational complexity and restrictive assumptions.
Overall Rating: 7/10 (Accept with minor revisions).
