This paper presents a novel approach to improving the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with factored states and actions. The main contributions are the introduction of Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), a new algorithm that balances between Modified Policy Iteration (MPI) and Value Iteration (VI), and a memory-bounded version of OPI that enables a space-time tradeoff. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms through extensive empirical evaluations, showing significant scalability improvements over state-of-the-art symbolic planners.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in symbolic planning for factored-action MDPs, where the exponential growth of state-action spaces poses significant challenges. The introduction of OPI, which opportunistically enforces policy constraints to manage memory growth, is a novel and impactful contribution. The memory-bounded variant further enhances the practical applicability of the approach.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, covering multiple domains (Inventory Control, SysAdmin, and Elevator Control) with varying complexities. The results convincingly demonstrate that OPI outperforms existing methods like FA-MPI and VI in terms of scalability and runtime efficiency.
3. Theoretical Soundness: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for OPI, including its convergence properties and bounds relative to Bellman backups and policy backups. This ensures the algorithm's reliability and correctness.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper is well-organized, with clear delineation of contributions, including the pseudocode and detailed explanations of the algorithms. The pruning procedure and its impact on scalability are particularly well-explained.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge the challenges posed by the growth of value and policy diagrams, the discussion of limitations is brief. For instance, the suitability of ADDs for representing value functions in certain domains (e.g., Uniring) could be explored further.
2. Comparisons with Approximate Methods: The paper primarily focuses on exact methods. While the authors mention potential extensions to approximate backups (e.g., APRICODD), a direct comparison with existing approximate methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. Scalability Ceiling: Although OPI demonstrates significant improvements, the paper does not explore the scalability limits of the proposed methods in extremely large-scale problems. This could help contextualize the practical applicability of the algorithms.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:

Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper. Its contributions are novel, impactful, and well-supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. While there are minor areas for improvement, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the work. This paper is likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners working on scalable planning and decision-making under uncertainty.
