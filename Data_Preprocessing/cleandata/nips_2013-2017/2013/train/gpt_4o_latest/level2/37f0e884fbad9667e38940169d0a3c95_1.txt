The paper introduces the Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of reducing the computational cost of smooth and strongly convex optimization problems, particularly in ill-conditioned settings. The main claim is that EMGD achieves a significant reduction in the number of full gradient evaluations required, from \(O(\sqrt{\kappa} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})\) to \(O(\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})\), by leveraging a combination of full and stochastic gradients. The algorithm divides the optimization process into epochs, using mixed gradient descent within each epoch to achieve linear convergence. Theoretical analysis supports these claims, showing that EMGD requires \(O(\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})\) full gradients and \(O(\kappa^2 \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})\) stochastic gradients to find an \(\epsilon\)-optimal solution.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that effectively combines full and stochastic gradients, addressing a key limitation of existing first-order methods for ill-conditioned problems. The reduction in full gradient evaluations is significant for large-scale optimization tasks.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed theoretical analysis, including convergence guarantees and complexity bounds, which are well-supported by mathematical proofs. The comparison with existing methods (e.g., SAG, SDCA) highlights EMGD's advantages in specific scenarios.
3. Practical Applicability: EMGD is versatile, applicable to both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems, and requires less storage space than competing methods like SAG and SDCA. The algorithm's robustness to distributed computing is a notable advantage for large-scale applications.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly outlines its contributions, including the reduction in computational cost and the stronger convergence guarantees compared to existing methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Dependence on Known Condition Number: A significant limitation is the assumption that the condition number \(\kappa\) is known beforehand. While the authors acknowledge this and propose future work to estimate \(\kappa\), this dependency may limit the algorithm's practicality in real-world scenarios.
2. Computational Complexity in Some Cases: While EMGD performs well when \(\kappa \leq n^{2/3}\), its computational complexity is higher than SAG and SDCA for larger \(\kappa\), which may restrict its applicability in certain settings.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks experimental results to validate the theoretical claims. Empirical comparisons with existing methods would strengthen the paper's impact and demonstrate the practical utility of EMGD.
4. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical analysis is thorough, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive descriptions of the algorithm's steps, particularly for readers less familiar with optimization theory.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of convex optimization, particularly in addressing the computational challenges of ill-conditioned problems. However, the lack of empirical validation and the reliance on a known condition number are notable drawbacks. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the inclusion of experimental results and a discussion of practical strategies for estimating \(\kappa\). These additions would enhance the paper's completeness and practical relevance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and theoretically sound approach with significant potential impact.
- Rigorous analysis and clear comparison with existing methods.
- Practical advantages in terms of storage and applicability to constrained problems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Dependence on a known condition number, which may limit real-world applicability.
- Higher computational complexity than some methods in specific cases.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field, but addressing the noted weaknesses would significantly strengthen its impact.
