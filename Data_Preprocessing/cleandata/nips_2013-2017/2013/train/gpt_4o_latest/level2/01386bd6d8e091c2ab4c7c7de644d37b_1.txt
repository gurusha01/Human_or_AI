This paper presents a novel statistical method for "stitching" together data from non-simultaneously recorded neural populations, enabling the characterization of joint population dynamics and noise correlations in circuits larger than what current imaging technologies can capture simultaneously. The authors frame the problem as fitting a latent dynamical system with missing observations and demonstrate the method's efficacy on both synthetic and real calcium imaging data from the mouse somatosensory cortex. The proposed approach significantly outperforms naive methods and approaches the performance of a fully observed model, offering a promising tool for expanding the scope of neural circuit analysis.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses a critical limitation in current neural imaging techniques by enabling the analysis of larger neural populations. This is a significant contribution to the field of computational neuroscience, as it provides a practical solution to a long-standing experimental bottleneck.
2. Technical Soundness: The method is grounded in a well-established framework of linear dynamical systems, and the use of expectation-maximization (EM) for parameter fitting is appropriate. The authors validate their approach rigorously on both synthetic and real datasets, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness.
3. Real-World Applicability: The method is demonstrated on experimental data from mouse somatosensory cortex, showing its potential utility in real-world neuroscience research. The ability to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neurons is particularly impactful.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The inclusion of both synthetic and real data analyses strengthens the paper's claims and provides a clear narrative of the method's capabilities.
Weaknesses:
1. Model Simplicity: While the linear Gaussian dynamical system is computationally efficient, it may oversimplify the complex, nonlinear dynamics of neural circuits. The authors acknowledge this limitation but could explore more sophisticated models in future work.
2. Dependence on Overlap: The method's performance relies on some overlap between recorded populations, which may not always be feasible in experimental setups. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how to optimize overlap versus coverage in experimental design.
3. Scalability: While the method is demonstrated on relatively small populations (up to 100 neurons), its scalability to larger circuits with thousands of neurons, as mentioned in the introduction, remains untested. This is a critical gap given the paper's stated goal of analyzing large neural circuits.
4. Limited Exploration of Alternatives: The comparison to alternative methods is limited to a naive approach. Including comparisons with other advanced statistical methods for handling missing data or subsampled observations would strengthen the evaluation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and timely problem in neuroscience and provides a novel, well-validated solution.
- The method has clear real-world applications and could be widely adopted by experimental neuroscientists.
- The results are robust, with strong performance on both synthetic and real datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on overlap between populations and the untested scalability to larger circuits may limit the method's applicability in some scenarios.
- The simplicity of the model may restrict its ability to capture the full complexity of neural dynamics.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. While there are some limitations, they do not detract significantly from the paper's core contributions. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly encouraging the authors to discuss scalability and experimental design trade-offs in more detail.
