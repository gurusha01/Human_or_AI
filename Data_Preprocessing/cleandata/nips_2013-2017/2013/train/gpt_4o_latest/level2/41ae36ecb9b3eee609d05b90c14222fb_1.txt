The paper addresses the problem of minimizing convex smooth loss functions with trace norm regularization, a topic of significant interest in machine learning due to its applications in tasks like matrix completion, multi-task learning, and matrix classification. The authors challenge the prevailing belief that the proximal gradient method (PGM) has only a sublinear convergence rate for such problems. They establish that, under certain conditions, PGM achieves a linear convergence rate without requiring the strong convexity of the loss function—a notable contribution. The key innovation lies in deriving a new Lipschitzian error bound for trace norm-regularized problems, which could have broader implications beyond this work.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper provides the first linear convergence result for PGM applied to trace norm-regularized problems without assuming strong convexity. This is a significant theoretical advancement.
2. Technical Depth: The derivation of the Lipschitzian error bound is rigorous and addresses an open question in the field. The use of matrix perturbation theory to analyze spectral properties is particularly innovative.
3. Practical Relevance: The results apply to widely used loss functions, such as square loss and logistic loss, making the findings relevant to various machine learning applications.
4. Clarity of Results: The theoretical contributions are complemented by numerical experiments on matrix completion and classification, which demonstrate the linear convergence behavior empirically.
5. Comprehensive Related Work: The paper situates itself well within the literature, referencing relevant prior work on ℓ1-norm regularization, sparse group LASSO, and other optimization methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the numerical experiments validate the theoretical claims, they are limited to two specific problems. Broader experimentation across diverse datasets and problem settings would strengthen the practical impact.
2. Assumptions on Loss Functions: The assumptions on the structure and smoothness of the loss function (e.g., f(X) = h(A(X))) may limit the generalizability of the results to other machine learning problems.
3. Complexity of Analysis: While the theoretical analysis is thorough, it is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. A more intuitive explanation of the key ideas would improve accessibility.
4. Step Size Constraints: The convergence result relies on specific step size conditions, which may not always be practical in real-world scenarios. The backtracking line search used in experiments is not discussed in detail in the theoretical analysis.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by advancing the understanding of PGM's convergence properties for trace norm-regularized problems. Its results are novel, technically sound, and relevant to the machine learning community. However, the experimental validation could be expanded, and the presentation of the theoretical analysis could be made more accessible. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the experimental scope and clarify the practical implications of the step size constraints.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical contribution with potential impact on optimization and machine learning.
- Rigorous and well-supported claims.
- Empirical validation aligns with theoretical findings.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental scope.
- Dense theoretical exposition may limit accessibility.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing machine learning and optimization techniques.
