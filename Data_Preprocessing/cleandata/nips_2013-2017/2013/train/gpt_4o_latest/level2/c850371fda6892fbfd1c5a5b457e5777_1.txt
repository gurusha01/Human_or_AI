This paper presents a novel approach to designing differentially private algorithms for online learning in both the full-information and bandit settings. The authors modify the Follow the Approximate Leader (FTAL) algorithm to achieve privacy guarantees while maintaining competitive regret bounds. Their contributions include the first private algorithms for the bandit setting and improvements over previous regret bounds in the full-information setting. Notably, their algorithms match the dependence on the input length \(T\) of optimal non-private regret bounds up to logarithmic factors, while requiring logarithmic space and update time.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses the challenging problem of ensuring differential privacy in online learning, particularly in the bandit setting where no prior work exists. The proposed methods achieve regret bounds that are competitive with non-private algorithms, advancing the state of the art.
2. Technical Depth: The use of tree-based aggregation for maintaining private gradient sums is well-motivated and rigorously analyzed. The adaptation of FTAL to the private setting is both innovative and technically sound.
3. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors provide detailed theoretical guarantees for privacy and regret, covering both strongly convex and general convex cost functions. The regret bounds are carefully derived for both adaptive and oblivious adversaries, demonstrating robustness.
4. Practical Efficiency: The algorithms are computationally efficient, with logarithmic space and update time, making them scalable for large-scale online learning tasks.
5. Open Questions: The paper concludes with insightful open problems, such as improving regret bounds for bandit settings and leveraging randomness in non-private bandit algorithms, which could inspire future research.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically rigorous, it is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with differential privacy or online learning. The presentation could benefit from additional examples or visualizations to clarify key concepts.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed algorithms. While the theoretical analysis is strong, experiments would provide evidence of real-world applicability and help validate the regret bounds.
3. Comparison to Non-Private Algorithms: Although the regret bounds are competitive, the paper does not explicitly quantify the trade-offs between privacy and performance compared to state-of-the-art non-private algorithms. This would help contextualize the practical cost of privacy.
4. Dependence on Dimensionality: The regret bounds include explicit dependence on the dimensionality \(p\), which may limit scalability in high-dimensional settings. A discussion on mitigating this limitation would be valuable.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes significant contributions to the field of private online learning, particularly in the underexplored bandit setting. However, the authors should consider addressing the clarity issues and providing experimental results in a future revision. These improvements would enhance the accessibility and practical impact of the work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contributions to private online learning.
- Strong theoretical guarantees and rigorous analysis.
- Efficient algorithms with competitive regret bounds.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of experimental validation.
- Dense presentation that may hinder accessibility.
Overall, this paper is a valuable addition to the literature and aligns well with the goals of the conference.
