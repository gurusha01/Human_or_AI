This paper investigates structured Schatten norms for tensors, focusing on two specific norms: the "overlapped" and "latent" Schatten norms, which have been proposed for convex-optimization-based tensor decomposition. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the latent approach, which has been empirically observed to outperform the overlapped approach in certain settings. They demonstrate that the latent approach achieves superior performance when the underlying tensor is low-rank in a specific mode, with its mean squared error scaling no greater than the minimum mode-k rank of the tensor. A novel duality result between the overlapped and latent Schatten norms is also presented, linking this work to structured sparsity literature. The authors validate their theoretical findings through numerical experiments, confirming that the latent approach consistently outperforms the overlapped approach, particularly in challenging scenarios where the tensor is low-rank in only one mode.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the latent Schatten norm, including consistency results and deterministic bounds. The duality result between the overlapped and latent norms is novel and connects tensor decomposition to broader structured sparsity frameworks.
2. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments are well-designed and confirm the theoretical predictions about the scaling behavior of the mean squared error. The results demonstrate the practical advantages of the latent approach over the overlapped approach.
3. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly explains why the latent approach outperforms the overlapped approach, particularly in scenarios where the tensor is low-rank in one mode. This insight is valuable for both theoretical understanding and practical applications.
4. Relevance: Tensor decomposition is a critical problem in machine learning, with applications in neuroimaging, collaborative filtering, and spatio-temporal data analysis. The proposed methods and analyses are likely to be of interest to the broader NIPS community.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Empirical Evaluation: While the experiments confirm the theoretical findings, they are conducted on synthetic data. It would strengthen the paper to include real-world datasets to demonstrate the practical utility of the latent approach in diverse applications.
2. Complexity of Presentation: The paper is dense and highly technical, which may make it challenging for readers unfamiliar with tensor decomposition or structured Schatten norms. Additional intuitive explanations or visualizations could improve accessibility.
3. Comparison with Other Methods: The paper focuses primarily on comparing the latent and overlapped approaches. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with other state-of-the-art tensor decomposition methods, such as non-convex approaches, to contextualize the results further.
4. Future Work: While the authors mention tensor completion as a potential future direction, they do not provide preliminary insights or hypotheses about how the latent approach might perform in this setting.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to the theoretical understanding of structured Schatten norms and the latent approach for tensor decomposition are significant and well-supported by empirical evidence. The work advances the state of the art and provides a foundation for future research in tensor decomposition and structured sparsity.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Theoretical novelty: The duality result and analysis of the latent approach are significant contributions.
- Empirical validation: The experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate practical advantages.
- Relevance: The work addresses a critical problem in machine learning with broad applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited empirical scope: The experiments are restricted to synthetic data.
- Accessibility: The technical presentation may be challenging for non-experts.
Overall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it makes a meaningful contribution to the field.
