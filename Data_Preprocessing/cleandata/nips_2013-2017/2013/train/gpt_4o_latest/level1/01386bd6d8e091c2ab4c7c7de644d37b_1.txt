Review of the Paper
This paper presents a novel statistical method for "stitching" together sequentially imaged neural populations into a unified model, enabling the characterization of population dynamics across neurons that are not simultaneously recorded. The authors frame the problem as fitting a latent dynamical system (LDS) with missing observations and demonstrate the method's utility in predicting noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. The approach is validated on both simulated and real calcium imaging datasets from the mouse somatosensory cortex, showing promising results in reconstructing joint dynamics and correlations. The method represents a significant step forward in addressing the experimental limitations of current imaging techniques, which are unable to capture the activity of entire neural circuits simultaneously.
Strengths
1. Scientific Contribution: The proposed method addresses a critical bottleneck in neuroscience—limited simultaneous imaging capacity—by providing a computational solution to infer joint dynamics of large neural populations. This is a meaningful contribution to the field and could have broad applications in neuroscience research.
2. Technical Rigor: The method is grounded in a well-established framework of linear dynamical systems and employs expectation-maximization (EM) for parameter estimation. The authors provide theoretical intuition for why stitching is feasible and validate their approach with both synthetic and real datasets.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper demonstrates the method's efficacy using both simulated data and real calcium imaging data from mouse somatosensory cortex. The results show that the stitching method accurately predicts noise correlations and coupling parameters, outperforming a naive baseline approach.
4. Clarity of Results: The authors provide clear benchmarks by comparing their method to upper (fully observed model) and lower (naive model) bounds, which contextualizes the performance of their approach.
5. Potential Impact: The method could significantly expand the scope of population-level neural analyses, enabling researchers to infer dynamics of circuits that span thousands of neurons.
Weaknesses
1. Model Assumptions: The use of a simple linear Gaussian dynamical system may limit the method's applicability to more complex neural dynamics, which are often nonlinear and non-Gaussian. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the paper could benefit from a discussion of how the method might generalize to more realistic models.
2. Dependence on Overlap: The method relies on some degree of overlap between sequentially imaged populations for stitching to work. The authors note this limitation but do not explore in depth how varying degrees of overlap affect performance or propose strategies for optimizing overlap in experimental design.
3. Scalability: While the method is demonstrated on datasets with hundreds of neurons, its scalability to circuits with thousands of neurons is not fully explored. The computational complexity of the EM algorithm for large populations could be a concern.
4. Comparison to Related Work: Although the authors reference related studies, the discussion of how their method compares to alternative approaches (e.g., latent GLMs or other methods for sub-sampled observations) could be more detailed.
