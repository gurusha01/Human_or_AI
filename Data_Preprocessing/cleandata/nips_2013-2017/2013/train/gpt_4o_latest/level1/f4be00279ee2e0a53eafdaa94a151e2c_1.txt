This paper presents a novel approximate inference algorithm for continuous-time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous-time likelihoods. The authors extend the classical Kalman-Bucy smoothing procedure to non-Gaussian observations by deriving a hybrid fixed-point iteration that combines expectation propagation (EP) updates for discrete-time terms with variational updates for continuous-time terms. They further introduce post-inference correction methods to improve the accuracy of marginal approximations. The proposed approach enables efficient inference in a variety of models, including spiking neuronal models and box likelihood models, and demonstrates significant computational savings compared to discrete-time methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's accuracy and efficiency.
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by extending EP to continuous-time observations, a problem that has not been adequately explored in statistical machine learning. The derivation of continuous-time updates from the EP framework is rigorous and well-motivated.
2. Hybrid Algorithm: The combination of EP and variational updates is elegant and results in efficient forward-backward updates. The authors also provide a clear connection between the EP updates and variational methods, which is insightful.
3. Post-Inference Corrections: The correction methods improve the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations, particularly in cases with strong non-Gaussian effects, as demonstrated in the experiments.
4. Practical Relevance: The method is applied to challenging real-world problems, such as neural spike train modeling and point process inference, showcasing its utility in domains where continuous-time data is prevalent.
5. Computational Efficiency: The approach is computationally efficient, especially in scenarios with high-resolution data, as it avoids the need for fine-grained discretization required by traditional methods.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the technical content is thorough, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with EP or continuous-time stochastic processes. Additional intuitive explanations and diagrams could improve accessibility.
2. Scope of Experiments: Although the experiments are compelling, they are limited in scope. For example, the method's performance on more complex non-linear diffusion processes or hybrid stochastic systems is not explored, despite being mentioned as a potential extension.
3. Assumptions: The framework assumes a latent linear diffusion process, which may limit its applicability to more general non-linear systems. While the authors discuss extensions, these are not implemented or tested.
4. Comparative Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed comparison with alternative state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of scalability and accuracy on large datasets.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a novel and important problem, advancing the state of the art in continuous-time inference.
- The hybrid EP-variational approach is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical derivations and experimental results.
- The method has practical relevance and demonstrates significant computational advantages.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper's clarity could be improved to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
- The experimental evaluation, while promising, is somewhat narrow and does not fully explore the method's limitations or broader applicability.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of approximate inference in continuous-time models. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and experimental breadth, the novelty and significance of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and experimental concerns.
