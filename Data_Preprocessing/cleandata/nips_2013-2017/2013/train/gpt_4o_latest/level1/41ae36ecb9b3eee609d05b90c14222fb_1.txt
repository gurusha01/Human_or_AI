This paper addresses the problem of minimizing a convex smooth loss function with trace norm regularization, a topic of significant interest in machine learning due to its applications in matrix completion, multi-task learning, and other areas. The authors focus on improving the convergence rate of the Proximal Gradient Method (PGM), a widely used algorithm for solving such problems. While PGM is known to achieve a sublinear convergence rate under general conditions, this paper establishes that for a broad class of loss functions, PGM achieves a linear convergence rate without requiring strong convexity of the loss function. The key contribution is the development of a new Lipschitzian error bound for trace norm–regularized problems, which is novel and may have broader implications for optimization research.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical advance by proving linear convergence for PGM under weaker assumptions than previously required. This fills a gap in the literature, as prior results often relied on strong convexity.
2. Novel Error Bound: The Lipschitzian error bound introduced is a major technical achievement and could be of independent interest for other optimization problems involving trace norm regularization.
3. Broad Applicability: The results apply to a wide range of loss functions, including square loss and logistic loss, making the findings relevant to many machine learning applications.
4. Rigorous Analysis: The proofs are thorough and well-structured, leveraging advanced tools such as matrix perturbation theory and the Luo-Tseng framework for convergence analysis.
5. Empirical Validation: The paper includes numerical experiments on matrix completion and matrix classification, which corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed analysis.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the theoretical content is strong, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer exposition, especially in the proofs. Non-expert readers may struggle to follow the technical details without additional context or simplified explanations.
2. Limited Experiments: The numerical experiments, though supportive of the theoretical claims, are relatively limited in scope. For example, the paper could explore larger-scale problems or compare PGM's performance with other state-of-the-art methods.
3. Practical Implications: While the theoretical results are compelling, the paper does not fully explore the practical implications of the linear convergence rate, such as how it translates to real-world computational efficiency gains.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses an important and timely problem in machine learning and optimization.
- The theoretical contributions are novel, rigorous, and impactful, advancing the state of the art in trace norm–regularized optimization.
- The results are broadly applicable and supported by empirical evidence.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in the presentation of proofs and technical details.
- The experimental section is somewhat limited and does not fully demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed results.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and provides valuable insights into the convergence properties of PGM for trace norm–regularized problems. While there is room for improvement in clarity and experimental depth, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve readability and expand the experimental evaluation.
