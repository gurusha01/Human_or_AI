The paper addresses the challenge of inference in high-treewidth Ising models, where exact inference is intractable and Gibbs sampling can converge slowly under strong interactions. The authors propose a novel approach to project Ising model parameters onto a "fast-mixing" parameter set, ensuring rapid convergence of Gibbs sampling. They explore projections under various divergences, including Euclidean distance, zero-avoiding KL-divergence, piecewise KL-divergence, and zero-forcing KL-divergence, and evaluate their effectiveness experimentally. The results demonstrate that Gibbs sampling on the projected parameters achieves higher accuracy than on the original parameters when computational time is limited. The paper also compares the proposed method with standard inference techniques like loopy belief propagation (LBP), tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRW), and naive mean-field (MF), showing superior performance in certain scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new notion of tractability by focusing on fast-mixing distributions rather than low-treewidth or exact inference. This is a significant departure from traditional approaches and provides a fresh perspective on approximate inference.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors derive a dual algorithm for Euclidean projection and extend it to probabilistic divergences. The use of spectral norm constraints to guarantee rapid mixing is well-grounded in theory.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering different graph topologies, interaction strengths, and divergence measures. The comparison with standard inference methods highlights the practical utility of the proposed approach.
4. Clarity of Exposition: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, theoretical results, and experimental setups. The discussion of trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency is particularly insightful.
Weaknesses:
1. Overly Conservative Bounds: The spectral norm bound used to guarantee rapid mixing is acknowledged to be loose, leading to overly conservative projections. This limits the practical applicability of the method, as it may unnecessarily restrict the parameter space.
2. Scalability: While the method is tested on small graphs and grids, its scalability to larger, real-world graphs remains unclear. The computational cost of repeated projections, especially under stochastic gradient descent, may become prohibitive.
3. Limited Generalization: The approach is specific to Ising models, and the extension to general Markov random fields (MRFs) is only briefly mentioned as future work. The lack of a concrete plan for generalization limits the broader impact of the work.
4. Comparative Baselines: While the paper compares its method to standard variational techniques, it does not include more recent advances in approximate inference, such as neural variational methods or advanced MCMC techniques, which could provide a more rigorous benchmark.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in probabilistic inference and proposes a novel, theoretically sound solution.
- The experimental results demonstrate clear advantages in specific scenarios, particularly under strong interactions and limited computational budgets.
- The work opens new avenues for research, such as extending fast-mixing guarantees to general MRFs and exploring applications in learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The looseness of the spectral norm bound reduces the practical utility of the method.
- The scalability and generalizability of the approach are not convincingly demonstrated.
- The lack of comparison with more recent inference techniques weakens the empirical evaluation.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of approximate inference in graphical models. While there are limitations, the novelty and theoretical insights outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly addressing the looseness of the spectral norm bound and discussing scalability in more detail.
