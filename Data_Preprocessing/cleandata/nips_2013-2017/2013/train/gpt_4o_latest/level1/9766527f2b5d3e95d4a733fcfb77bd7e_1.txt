The paper proposes a novel variance reduction technique for stochastic gradient optimization using control variates, which leverages low-order moments of data to reduce the variance of noisy gradients. This approach is demonstrated on two distinct problems: MAP estimation for logistic regression (convex) and stochastic variational inference (SVI) for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (non-convex). The authors show that their method improves convergence rates and performance compared to classical stochastic gradient methods. By constructing control variates that are computationally inexpensive and highly correlated with the noisy gradient, the authors achieve unbiased gradient estimates with reduced variance. Empirical results on logistic regression and LDA demonstrate faster convergence and better predictive performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for the proposed variance reduction technique. The derivation of the control variates is well-supported by mathematical analysis, and the authors clearly demonstrate how the method ensures unbiased gradient estimates.
2. Generality: The approach is broadly applicable to both convex and non-convex optimization problems, showcasing its versatility. The paper also hints at its potential applicability to other problems like hierarchical Dirichlet processes and nonnegative matrix factorization.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on logistic regression and LDA are thorough, with results showing significant improvements in convergence rates and predictive performance. The use of real-world datasets like Nature, New York Times, and Wikipedia adds credibility to the empirical findings.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and results. The inclusion of detailed derivations and approximations enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Overhead: While the proposed method reduces variance, the additional computation required to estimate control variates (e.g., covariance and variance matrices) could be a bottleneck in large-scale applications. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of this trade-off.
2. Limited Scope of Applications: Although the method is demonstrated on two problems, its generalizability to other stochastic optimization tasks is not extensively explored. For instance, it would be useful to see its performance on deep learning tasks, where stochastic gradient descent is widely used.
3. Simplifications in Control Variate Construction: The use of approximations (e.g., Taylor expansions) to construct control variates may limit the method's effectiveness in cases where these approximations are less accurate. The paper does not discuss potential limitations or failure cases of these approximations.
4. Comparison with Alternatives: The paper does not compare its method with other variance reduction techniques, such as SVRG or SAGA, which are well-established in the literature. This omission makes it difficult to assess the relative contribution of the proposed approach.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in stochastic optimization and provides a theoretically sound and empirically validated solution.
- The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in convergence rates and predictive performance.
- The work is relevant to the NeurIPS community, given its focus on optimization techniques for machine learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of comparison with alternative variance reduction methods limits the contextual understanding of the contribution.
- The computational overhead of the proposed method is not thoroughly analyzed, which could impact its practical utility.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to stochastic optimization, but it would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of computational costs and comparisons with existing variance reduction methods.
