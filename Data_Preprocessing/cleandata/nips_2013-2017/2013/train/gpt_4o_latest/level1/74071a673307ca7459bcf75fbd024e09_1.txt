This paper addresses the problem of asymmetric regret guarantees in online learning, specifically in the context of the absolute loss game. The authors provide a detailed characterization of Pareto-optimal regret trade-offs for two experts, both in finite and asymptotic horizons. They propose optimal strategies for achieving these trade-offs and demonstrate that the commonly used square-root-of-log-prior regret bounds are suboptimal in this setting. The work also extends its findings to general linear losses and multi-expert scenarios, offering insights into recursive strategies for achieving regret bounds in these cases.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Pareto-optimal regret trade-offs, filling a gap in the literature on asymmetric regret guarantees. The exact characterization of trade-offs and the derivation of optimal strategies are significant contributions.
2. Novelty: The study introduces new insights into the limitations of traditional regret bounds, such as the square-root-of-log-prior bounds, and proposes alternative approaches that are more optimal in the absolute loss setting. This advances the state of the art in online learning.
3. Clarity of Results: The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions, theorems, and proofs. The use of visualizations, such as the Pareto frontiers for finite and asymptotic horizons, aids in understanding the results.
4. Extensions: The authors extend their analysis beyond the absolute loss game to general linear losses and multi-expert settings, demonstrating the broader applicability of their framework.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity: While the theoretical results are robust, the paper's technical depth may make it less accessible to practitioners or researchers unfamiliar with advanced concepts in online learning and game theory. Simplified explanations or examples could enhance accessibility.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical validation of the proposed strategies. While the theoretical results are compelling, experiments demonstrating the practical performance of these strategies in real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Scope for Multi-Expert Settings: The extension to more than two experts is promising but remains somewhat preliminary. A more detailed exploration of the trade-offs and strategies for multi-expert settings would enhance the paper's impact.
4. Horizon-Free Strategies: The discussion on horizon-free strategies is brief and left for future work. This is an important area that could have been explored further, given its practical relevance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by characterizing Pareto-optimal regret trade-offs and proposing optimal strategies for achieving them.
- It challenges existing assumptions and provides new insights into asymmetric regret guarantees, advancing the field of online learning.
- The extensions to general losses and multi-expert settings demonstrate the potential for broader applicability.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental validation limits the practical impact of the work.
- The complexity of the paper may hinder its accessibility to a broader audience.
- The discussion on multi-expert settings and horizon-free strategies is preliminary, leaving important questions unanswered.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of online learning and regret analysis. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of empirical validation and accessibility, the novelty and rigor of the work warrant acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and accessibility concerns.
