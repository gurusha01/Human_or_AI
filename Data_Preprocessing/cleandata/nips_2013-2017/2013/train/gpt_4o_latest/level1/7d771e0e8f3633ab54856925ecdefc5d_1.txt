This paper addresses the scalability challenges of symbolic planning for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with factored states and actions, introducing two key contributions: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI). The authors propose symbolic implementations of these algorithms to improve the efficiency of solving MDPs with exponentially large state and action spaces. FA-MPI extends symbolic Modified Policy Iteration (MPI) to factored action spaces, while OPI introduces a novel backup operator that opportunistically enforces policy constraints to avoid excessive growth in the value function representation. The paper also presents a memory-bounded version of OPI, allowing for a flexible trade-off between memory and computation time. Empirical results demonstrate that OPI and its memory-bounded variant significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic planners in terms of scalability.
Strengths
1. Technical Contributions: The introduction of OPI as a hybrid between Value Iteration (VI) and MPI is a novel and meaningful advancement. By selectively enforcing policy constraints, OPI addresses a key limitation of FA-MPI, namely the growth in value function representation size.
2. Scalability: The empirical results convincingly demonstrate that OPI scales better than existing approaches, particularly in domains with large action spaces. The experiments span diverse benchmarks (e.g., Inventory Control, SysAdmin, Elevator Control), showcasing the generality of the proposed methods.
3. Memory Efficiency: The memory-bounded version of OPI (MB-OPI) is a practical contribution, enabling the algorithm to handle larger problems by trading off memory usage for computational time.
4. Clarity of Empirical Validation: The experiments are well-designed, with clear comparisons against baseline methods such as SPUDD and FA-MPI. The inclusion of metrics like time-to-convergence and memory usage provides a comprehensive evaluation.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical content is strong, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with symbolic dynamic programming or Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs). Simplifying some explanations or including a more accessible overview of the methods could improve clarity.
2. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The authors acknowledge that the ADD representation is less effective for certain domains (e.g., Uniring in SysAdmin), but this limitation is not explored in depth. A discussion of when OPI might fail or require alternative representations would strengthen the paper.
3. Comparisons to Approximate Methods: While the paper focuses on exact methods, it would benefit from a comparison to approximate approaches like APRICODD, particularly in terms of scalability and solution quality.
4. Theoretical Guarantees: Although the convergence of OPI is established, the paper does not provide a detailed theoretical analysis of its convergence rate compared to FA-MPI or VI, which could be valuable for understanding its performance.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of symbolic planning under uncertainty, addressing a critical bottleneck in scalability.
- The proposed methods are novel, well-motivated, and empirically validated across a range of challenging domains.
- The introduction of memory-bounded OPI is a practical innovation that enhances the applicability of symbolic planning to real-world problems.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper's dense presentation may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
- The lack of a detailed discussion on limitations and comparisons to approximate methods leaves some questions unanswered.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper represents a strong contribution to the field and advances the state of the art in symbolic planning for factored-action MDPs. While some aspects of the presentation could be improved, the strengths of the work outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the noted limitations.
