The paper presents a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), for uncovering hierarchical community structures in social networks. The authors propose a tree-structured mixture of stochastic blockmodels, which enables efficient inference of hierarchical communities. The key contribution is a greedy agglomerative model selection algorithm that scales quadratically with the number of vertices in the worst case but is independent of the number of nested communities. Empirical results demonstrate that BHCD is two orders of magnitude faster than the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) while achieving comparable or superior accuracy. The paper also introduces a sparse variant of BHCD for improved performance on sparse networks.
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with a well-defined probabilistic model and a clear derivation of the inference algorithm. The authors provide detailed mathematical formulations and justify their design choices, such as using conjugate priors for computational efficiency.
2. Efficiency: The proposed algorithm demonstrates significant computational advantages over existing Bayesian nonparametric methods, particularly in terms of scalability. The O(n² log n) complexity for inference and O(n + m) complexity for likelihood computation are notable strengths.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets, including Sampson's monastery network and the NIPS co-authorship network, effectively showcase the model's ability to discover meaningful hierarchical structures and make accurate predictions.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from the problem definition to the proposed solution and experimental results. The inclusion of variations (e.g., sparse and binary tree versions) and their impact on performance adds depth to the analysis.
5. Significance: The work addresses a challenging problem in social network analysis and provides a scalable solution that advances the state of the art. The ability to infer hierarchical structures efficiently has broad applicability in network science and beyond.
Weaknesses
1. Originality: While the hierarchical approach is novel, the model builds heavily on existing work, such as stochastic blockmodels and Bayesian hierarchical clustering. The innovation lies primarily in the efficient inference algorithm rather than the underlying model.
2. Limited Comparisons: The paper primarily compares BHCD to IRM, with limited discussion of other state-of-the-art methods like the Latent Factor Relational Model (LFRM) or Infinite Latent Attributes (ILA). A broader comparison would strengthen the claims of superiority.
3. Interpretability: The hierarchical structures produced by binary-only variations are noted to be less interpretable. This could limit the practical utility of these variants in certain applications.
4. Scalability on Sparse Networks: Although the sparse variant improves performance, the inference complexity remains O(n² log n) in the worst case. This could be a bottleneck for extremely large, sparse networks.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper provides a significant computational improvement over existing methods, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
- The empirical results are compelling, demonstrating both speed and accuracy on real-world datasets.
- The proposed method is generalizable and has potential applications in various domains.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The originality of the approach is somewhat limited, as it heavily builds on prior work.
- The lack of broader comparisons with other advanced methods leaves some questions about its relative performance.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to scalable Bayesian nonparametric modeling for hierarchical community detection. While there are minor limitations in originality and comparative analysis, the strengths in efficiency, clarity, and empirical validation outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to include broader comparisons and address interpretability concerns.
