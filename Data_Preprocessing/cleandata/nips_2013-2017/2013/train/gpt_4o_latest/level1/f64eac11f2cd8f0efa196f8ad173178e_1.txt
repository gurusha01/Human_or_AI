This paper addresses a critical yet underexplored aspect of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning: the automatic selection of step size. While policy gradient methods have been extensively studied and applied in robotic and motor control tasks due to their ability to handle continuous state/action spaces and partial observability, the choice of step size has largely relied on manual tuning, which can significantly affect convergence speed and stability. The authors propose a novel approach to compute the step size by maximizing a lower bound on the expected performance gain. Specifically, they derive a closed-form solution for the optimal step size in the case of Gaussian policies and extend their analysis to approximate settings where gradients are estimated from trajectory samples. The empirical evaluation in a linear-quadratic regulator (LQG) problem demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing the automatic selection of step size, a topic that has received little attention in the policy gradient literature. This work complements existing research focused on gradient estimation and direction.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The derivation of the lower bound and the closed-form solution for the step size is mathematically rigorous, with clear connections to prior work on policy performance bounds and gradient methods.
3. Practical Relevance: The approach is particularly relevant for real-world applications where manual tuning of step size is impractical, and the risk of divergence or slow convergence is high.
4. Empirical Validation: The numerical simulations in the LQG problem provide evidence that the proposed method avoids divergence and accelerates convergence compared to fixed or manually tuned step sizes. The comparison between REINFORCE and PGT gradient estimators further highlights the practical utility of the approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: The empirical evaluation is restricted to the LQG problem. While this setting is instructive, additional experiments on more complex and diverse tasks (e.g., robotics or high-dimensional control problems) would strengthen the claims of generalizability.
2. Assumptions on Gaussian Policies: The theoretical results are derived under the assumption of Gaussian policies with fixed variance. While this is a common assumption, it limits the applicability of the method to other policy models, such as Gibbs or neural network-based policies.
3. Approximation Challenges: The bounds in the approximate framework depend on several constants (e.g., policy variance, reward bounds) that may be difficult to estimate accurately in practice. This could limit the practical utility of the approach in highly stochastic or complex environments.
4. Discussion of Limitations: While the authors briefly acknowledge the limitations of their approach (e.g., sensitivity to policy variance), a more detailed discussion of these limitations and potential remedies would be beneficial.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in reinforcement learning.
- The theoretical contributions are novel, rigorous, and well-grounded in existing literature.
- The proposed method has clear practical implications for improving the stability and efficiency of policy gradient methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation is limited in scope, making it difficult to assess the generalizability of the approach.
- The reliance on Gaussian policies and fixed variance assumptions restricts the applicability of the method.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning by tackling a critical yet overlooked aspect of policy gradient methods. While the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, the theoretical insights and practical relevance of the proposed approach justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to expand the experimental validation and discuss limitations more thoroughly.
