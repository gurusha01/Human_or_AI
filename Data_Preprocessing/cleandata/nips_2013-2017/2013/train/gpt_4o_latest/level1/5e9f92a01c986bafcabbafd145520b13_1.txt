The paper proposes a novel compressed sensing (CS) framework for calcium imaging, targeting the efficient monitoring of large neuronal populations. Instead of traditional raster-scanning, the authors advocate for imaging randomized projections of spatial calcium concentrations, significantly reducing the number of measurements required per timestep. The framework includes scalable nonnegative deconvolution methods for spike extraction and rank-penalized matrix factorization for spatial demixing. The authors provide theoretical guarantees, demonstrating a phase transition in the number of measurements required for accurate recovery, and validate their approach using tools from conic geometry and compressed sensing. The results suggest that this method could enable faster imaging of larger populations compared to existing techniques.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a novel application of compressed sensing to calcium imaging, leveraging the sparsity of neural activity. This approach is innovative and addresses a critical limitation of traditional raster-scanning methods, namely the tradeoff between spatial coverage and temporal resolution.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the phase transition curve using statistical dimension tools, offering valuable insights into the conditions for successful recovery. This theoretical grounding strengthens the paper's claims.
3. Scalability and Practicality: The proposed methods are computationally efficient, scaling linearly with experiment length and supporting parallelization. This is crucial for real-world applications in neuroscience.
4. Experimental Validation: The authors present simulations demonstrating the robustness of their approach under various noise levels and sparsity conditions. The results are compelling, showing significant undersampling ratios while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.
5. Potential Impact: The framework has the potential to advance the state of the art in calcium imaging, enabling the study of larger neural populations at higher temporal resolutions, which is a significant contribution to neuroscience.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions and Practical Limitations: The analysis assumes idealized conditions, such as noiseless measurements and known system parameters (e.g., neuron locations). While the authors acknowledge this, the practical challenges of implementing the framework, such as motion correction and noise robustness, are not fully addressed.
2. Experimental Validation Scope: The simulations are limited to synthetic data. Validation on real-world calcium imaging datasets would strengthen the paper's claims and demonstrate practical feasibility.
3. Sparse Basis Limitations: The non-orthogonality of the sparse basis introduces complexities in recovery, particularly for periodic spiking patterns. While this is analyzed theoretically, the practical implications of such limitations are not fully explored.
4. Hardware Feasibility: The reliance on fast random projection matrices (e.g., spatial light modulators) assumes advanced hardware capabilities. The paper could benefit from a discussion on the feasibility and cost of implementing such systems in practice.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound framework with significant potential impact in neuroscience.
- The use of compressed sensing and statistical dimension analysis is innovative and well-executed.
- The methods are computationally efficient and scalable, addressing a critical bottleneck in calcium imaging.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of validation on real-world data raises questions about practical applicability.
- The paper assumes idealized conditions, which may limit its utility in real-world experimental settings.
- Practical challenges, such as motion correction and hardware constraints, are not sufficiently addressed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical and methodological contribution to the field of calcium imaging. While there are some limitations in practical validation, the potential impact and novelty of the work outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to address the practical challenges and include a discussion on real-world applicability.
