Proposes an agglomerative method for scalable clustering of networks into hierarchical communities. The prior over (potentially non-binary) trees and the algorithm's structure remain largely unchanged from earlier work on Bayesian rose trees [12]. The likelihood is adapted in a straightforward manner to accommodate networks, with additional effort enabling efficient caching of sufficient statistics. The paper is clearly presented, and experiments demonstrate favorable results compared to a baseline model with flat community structure. However, comparisons to other hierarchical network models are absent.

SIGNIFICANCE & RELATED WORK:  
The paper is generally well-written and appears to be technically sound. The presentation in Section 3 is particularly dense; it might be worth exploring whether there is a more intuitive way to notate and explain Equation (9) and the subsequent derivations that rely on it.
Since the comparisons are limited to models without hierarchical latent structures, the experiments primarily highlight the benefits of modeling hierarchy for relational datasets. However, they do not establish whether the proposed approach outperforms other existing hierarchical methods. For instance, two notable Bayesian nonparametric models are not mentioned: the "Multiscale Community Blockmodel for Network Exploration" (Ho et al., 2012), which employs a nested CRP, and the "Mondrian Process" (Roy et al., 2009), which introduces a novel stochastic process for hierarchical structures over K-d trees. These models could potentially uncover more refined latent structures, and their omission is a notable gap.

ORIGINALITY & CLARITY:  
The model presented here appears to be a Bayesian rose tree combined with a standard block-model likelihood. The primary contributions lie in how the new likelihood affects the recursive updating of sufficient statistics during greedy agglomerative clustering. The likelihood computation, which operates in O(Nodes + Edges) time, is a strong feature. However, the explanation of this aspect is insufficientâ€”there is a brief mention of dynamic programming before Equation (10), but the details are difficult to follow. Similarly, while equations are provided for the recursive updates of sufficient statistics, there is limited explanation to justify their correctness.

TERMINOLOGY:  
The use of the term "nonparametric" is debatable. Blundell et al. [12] describe the rose tree approach in terms of model selection and explicitly contrast it with nonparametric methods in their discussion. I align with their interpretation and question the appropriateness of the terminology here.

EXPERIMENTS:  
The qualitative experiment on the Sampson dataset is adequate, and the comparison to the IRM effectively demonstrates the advantages of averaging over multiple hypotheses for predictions. However, the most significant limitation is the absence of comparisons to other hierarchical network models. While scalability is briefly discussed, the networks tested in the experiments are not particularly large.

Effectively integrates prior work on Bayesian rose trees with stochastic block model likelihoods for networks, extending efficient agglomerative clustering methods to this context. This enables effective hierarchical community discovery in the experiments, but the lack of comparisons to other hierarchical network models remains a major shortcoming.
