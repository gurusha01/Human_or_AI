Review  
------
The paper explores random utility models incorporating "types." In this context, a "type" is defined as a formula that combines an agent's attributes with those of a given alternative, producing a perceived value. Importantly, this definition does not imply that agents of the same "type" necessarily share identical tastes or preference profiles. This makes the model quite expressive. The observations consist of complete rankings of alternatives, determined by the perceived values.
Beyond introducing this model, the theoretical contributions appear to be:  
(1) Demonstrating the identifiability of the model when the types are known.  
(2) Establishing identifiability of the model when types are unobserved, under specific conditions on the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) governing the noise.  
The algorithmic contribution is a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) heuristic for estimating the model parameters from observed data. The experiments include both synthetic datasets and real-world data from a sushi preference experiment [26].  
Strengths  
- The model appears to be novel. The sushi experiments provide some validation, as the best fit is achieved with three "types" rather than just one (see also my remark below).  
- The identifiability result for unobserved types (2) is interesting, though the identifiability result for known types (1) is less surprising, as it is analogous to the full-rank condition in linear regression.  
Weaknesses  
1. While the model is original, it is unclear why latent "types" are preferable to an alternative approach where both individuals and alternatives are assumed to have additional latent features. This approach is common in collaborative filtering. Although this would also lead to a non-convex optimization problem, the proposed model faces similar computational challenges. A comparison between these approaches would have been valuable.  
2. In Section 1.2, the paper claims to enable inference at finer levels of aggregation, such as the individual level, in contrast to prior works (e.g., [7]). However, the experiments do not demonstrate this finer-grained inference capability. For example, while the sushi data fitting with three types is an interesting result, it does not substantiate the claim of "individual-level inference." A comparison with the cited works in Section 1.2 would have strengthened the paper.  
Detailed Comments  
- Last paragraph on page 1 (continuing onto page 2): The "unresolved issue" regarding "restrictive functional assumptions about the distribution..." seems misleading. The reader might expect this work to address the issue, but it appears that assumptions about the "taste shock" are still being made.  
- Section 3.1: The first sentence is poorly written and needs revision.  
- Last sentence on page 4: Specify which equality is being referred to. Display the equality using math mode and reference it with \ref{}.  
- Last sentence on page 5: Why is a theorem referred to as a "problem"? Clarify this phrasing.  
- Page 6: Correct "a enough" to "enough."  
Summary  
The paper introduces a random utility model with "types," provides statistical identifiability results, proposes an RJMCMC-based algorithm, and includes experimental validation. While the model is novel and offers some theoretical contributions, the experimental results are somewhat underwhelming, particularly in supporting claims about individual-level inference.
