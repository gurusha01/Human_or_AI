The paper introduces a method for constructing multivariate distributions over unbounded counts that adhere to the Markov structure of an undirected network.
Developing multivariate distributions for unbounded counts is a challenging task, as extensively studied by Besag and others over the past three decades (including foundational works like Arnold et al.'s Conditional Specification of Statistical Models (1999), which generalizes some of the authors' observations to other conditionally-specified distributions, such as exponential distributions).
The proposed approach achieves notable successes in certain aspects. On the positive side, the construction supports marginal distributions over counts and enables relatively straightforward estimation procedures. However, there are limitations: QPGM exhibits marginally thinner tails, while SPGM lacks closed-form conditional distributions, which somewhat undermines the purpose of a conditionally specified model. In fact, it is unclear how SPGM qualifies as a Poisson distribution (whereas for QPGM, one could argue that only the base measure is altered). While this is acceptable, it raises questions about the primary motivation for modeling counts, given that the Poisson distribution itself is often a poor fit for empirical data. (To clarify, the Poisson distribution is undeniably useful as a building block in various models—e.g., components of stochastic processes and latent variable models—but could the authors plot the breast cancer data and demonstrate whether it resembles a Poisson distribution at all?) Additionally, a plot of the probability mass function for SPGM would be helpful, as its structure appears somewhat convoluted at first glance. I assume the authors treat R and R0 as constants (otherwise, the model would not belong to the exponential family). How are these parameters chosen, and what guidance can the authors provide to practitioners?
That said, constructing a multivariate distribution over counts that satisfies the independence structure of an MRF is undeniably a difficult problem. I sincerely appreciate the effort invested in this work, and I believe the results hold theoretical significance for NIPS. However, the paper's engagement with the existing literature feels somewhat superficial. For example, the discussion suggests the authors may not fully understand the concept of a copula. Their interpretation of [8] appears flawed or misrepresented, as that work specifically addresses the construction of multivariate distributions for arbitrary discrete data (including count data) and provides a suite of MCMC and approximate inference methods. This raises doubts about the relevance of the discussion surrounding [11], as the central contribution of that seminal book is to demonstrate how to construct discrete models with log-linear parameters in a way that avoids exponential growth with the number of variables. (Admittedly, I do not have access to a copy of the book at the moment and cannot recall its specific treatment of Poisson distributions.) Perhaps the most significant oversight is the omission of the extensive spatial statistics literature, which has long addressed high-dimensional count data analysis.
It is worth noting that many alternative approaches (e.g., the sparse precision Gaussian copula model in [8]) do not enforce MRF-style independence constraints in the observable space. Thus, the theoretical contribution of this paper remains valid. However, as a practitioner, I am not yet convinced of the practical advantages of this model over the simpler structured Gaussian random field + Poisson measurement model, which has been a standard approach for some time.
A final note: I am not an expert in gene expression analysis, but I would appreciate a more recent reference than [20] to substantiate the claim that "counts of sequencing reads ... are replacing microarrays." 
In summary, the paper presents a method for constructing multivariate distributions for counts that are Markov with respect to undirected graphs. Like any nontrivial multivariate construction, it has its strengths and weaknesses. However, the literature review feels incomplete.
