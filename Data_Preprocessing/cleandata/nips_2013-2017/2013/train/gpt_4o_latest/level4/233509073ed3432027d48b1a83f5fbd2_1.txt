Reaction to the author feedback:
I respectfully disagree with point (3): The work by Siracusa III and Fisher (AISTATS 2009) does not assume that the data are iid, and it accommodates variability in the "generating structure" (albeit within a limited set of graphical models). While the proposed method in this paper is arguably more flexible in certain respects, I believe it would be misleading to assert that this is the first method to address the problem.
---
The paper introduces a hypothesis-testing-based approach for learning graphical models in an online manner from time series data. The proposed method is specifically designed for scenarios where the "data-generating" graphical model may change relatively frequently. The method's performance is evaluated using both simulated and real-world datasets.
Quality
The results appear to be correct. However, I find the discussion of related work in Section 2 somewhat misleading. Typical score-based algorithms for learning Bayesian networks do not assume that the data originate from a single generating model; rather, they rely on the scoring function factorizing into local components. While it is true that commonly studied models assume exchangeability (or iid data), this pertains to the model itself, not the algorithm.
Clarity
The paper's presentation is generally adequate, but there is room for improvement. Most critically, the paper is unclear about the precise learning task being addressed: Is the goal to infer change points (under well-defined assumptions about their existence and nature), to infer the generating structure of the most recent data point, or something else entirely? Additionally, it is unclear whether the work proposes a (new) model (i.e., a set of assumptions and learning objectives), a (new) algorithm (i.e., computational techniques to achieve these objectives), or both.
The paragraph at the end of page 3 is particularly difficult to follow. For instance, does the equation for \(\rho_{r+1}\) define it, or was the definition provided earlier? I also wonder why the authors avoid using periods to conclude sentences that end with displayed equations. Another significant issue is the font size in Figures 1–4, which could be doubled for better readability. Furthermore, descriptions for the different colors in Figures 1 and 2 would be helpful. In Section 6, I found the claim that improved tracking could offset the additional computational cost somewhat confusing—doesn't this depend on a highly domain-specific trade-off between tracking accuracy and computational expense?
Originality
The work appears to be original. However, it seems to lack substantial innovation or a truly novel idea. There may be some novelty in the construction of the p-values, but I was unable to fully grasp the details.
Significance
The potential significance of this work, if published, lies in its ability to inspire the development of superior, likely Bayesian, methods for the problem. However, this should be viewed more as a step toward development rather than a contribution to foundational research. The approach presented here appears heuristic and addresses a somewhat vaguely defined learning problem that existing machine learning techniques should, in principle, already be capable of solving.
