Review - Summary  
=======  
This paper introduces a bound on the generalization error for hierarchical multi-classifiers applied to large-scale taxonomies. This bound serves to explain the empirical performance of both flat and hierarchical classifiers. Additionally, the paper derives a bound on the approximation error for a specific family of classifiers, which is then leveraged to define a node-classifier aimed at pruning large-scale taxonomies to enhance overall accuracy. The theoretical findings are supported by experiments conducted on two widely recognized taxonomies.  
Evaluation  
========  
The paper is well-written and clearly presented.  
It offers compelling technical content that appears to be theoretically sound.  
Overall, the paper is of high quality.  
However, this reviewer identifies two limitations in the proposed methods:  
1. Treating hierarchical classification solely as the task of classifying leaf nodes is restrictive for two reasons:  
   a. In practical scenarios, category nodes often contain documents that do not belong to any of their child nodes. This is particularly common when new document types emerge that do not fit into existing child nodes, making the parent nodes the most appropriate classification choice.  
   b. The reviewer questions whether there is a significant debate regarding the use of flat versus hierarchical models in the specific context proposed by the authors (i.e., leaf-only classification). In fact, within this setting, flat models often demonstrate superior performance.  
   Conversely, top-down methods tend to achieve higher accuracy when classification is extended to internal nodes as well. For instance, the following paper demonstrates that top-down approaches outperform flat models in such settings:  
   Alessandro Moschitti, Qi Ju, Richard Johansson: Modeling Topic Dependencies in Hierarchical Text Categorization. ACL 2012: 759-767.  
   In this context, a more thorough comparison with other methods, such as the one mentioned above, as well as those cited by the authors (e.g., Gopal et al.) and the following:  
   Zhou, D., Xiao, L., Wu, M.: Hierarchical classification via orthogonal transfer. ICML11.  
   would strengthen the paper.  
2. The proposed bounds appear to lack strictness: the Rademacher complexity term is a coarse approximation that does not account for feature distribution or relevance, both of which significantly influence text categorization.  
   For example, in the Reuters 21578 dataset, there are rare categories that may represent only about 0.1% of the training data (approximately 10 documents), yet systems can achieve accuracy rates of around 90% for these categoriesâ€”higher than for more populated categories.  
   This observation highlights the importance of data imbalance among categories, but it is not the only factor. For instance, category ambiguity (i.e., the degree of similarity between categories) should also be taken into account.  
After the Authors' Response  
====================  
In addition to the reviewer's initial comments, the concepts clarified in the authors' response should be incorporated into the final version of the paper.  
However, the authors' response does not fully address all of the reviewer's concerns. As such, the authors should inform readers of the potential limitations in their theoretical framework.  
- While the technical content is strong, the proposed bounds may not be sufficiently strict. The authors should explicitly acknowledge this limitation.  
- The claims made in the paper should be tempered and adjusted in light of the reviewer's comments and the authors' response.
