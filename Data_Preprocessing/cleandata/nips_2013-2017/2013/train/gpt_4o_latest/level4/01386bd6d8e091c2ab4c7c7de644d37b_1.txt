The paper introduces a statistical approach to "stitch" together sequentially imaged neuronal populations. This method enables the characterization of population dynamics for larger sets of neurons than can be simultaneously imaged, thereby offering a more comprehensive view of neural circuits that cannot be fully captured due to experimental and technical constraints. The proposed method is demonstrated on both simulated data and experimental calcium imaging data from mice. The authors demonstrate that their approach can estimate correlations in variability between two populations that were not imaged simultaneously.
The authors frame the problem as fitting a latent dynamical system with missing observations, employing a simple linear Gaussian system in this case. The model incorporates four key parameters: a functional coupling matrix, a stimulus receptive field matrix to capture stimulus-dependent activity, and two covariance matrices representing neural and measurement noise. These parameters are estimated from experimental data using a variant of the standard EM algorithm.
Quality  
The model performs well on simulated data with two non-overlapping neuronal populations. However, when applied to real data, a certain level of overlap between populations is required to achieve reasonable results. While it is intuitive that greater overlap improves the outcomes, it remains unclear why overlap was unnecessary in the simulated data example. Additionally, the authors do not address the source of the significant difference in correlation values observed when applying the model to simulated data (Fig. 2c) versus real data (Fig. 3b). The model's strength lies in its ability to recover pairwise correlations between neurons that were not measured simultaneously.
Clarity  
The paper is generally well-written, but the figure legends lack sufficient detail, and the accompanying text in the main body does not provide enough elaboration on the figures.
Originality  
The authors reference several prior studies that address the inference of functional connectivity from 2-photon imaging or electrophysiological data. However, these prior works do not tackle the challenge of inferring functional connections between non-simultaneously imaged neurons, which is the novel contribution of this paper.
Significance  
There are inherent limitations to the number of neurons that can be imaged simultaneously, which constrains our ability to study neural computations at the circuit level (beyond a few hundred cells). This paper proposes a method to overcome these limitations and expand our capacity to investigate larger neuronal populations.  
Overall, this is a strong methodological paper that employs a relatively simple linear dynamics model to extract measures that are otherwise challenging to obtain.
