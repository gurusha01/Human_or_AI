This paper investigates the robust single linkage (RSL) algorithm for constructing the cluster tree when the density's support lies on a manifold. Prior work [1] introduced and analyzed the algorithm in the context where the density is supported on the entire ambient space. The current paper demonstrates that the same algorithm can be applied in the manifold setting, achieving rates that depend solely on the manifold dimension rather than the ambient dimension. The proof structure closely mirrors that of [1], with several adjustments to account for the fact that the density is supported on a manifold.
The central contribution of the paper does not seem to be sufficiently emphasized: despite the density being restricted to a manifold, the RSL algorithm, which relies on Euclidean distances, achieves rates governed only by the manifold dimension. Providing intuition for this result—perhaps through a simple synthetic example—could significantly enhance the reader's understanding. Since the proofs largely rely on arguments similar to those in [1], it remains unclear what fundamental insight underpins this phenomenon, at least as presented in the current proofs.
Upon reviewing the proofs, they appear sound. However, additional discussion about the parameter $\rho$ could be beneficial for readers, as this point seems related to the broader intuition behind the results. Additionally, I find the authors' definition of the "class of RSL algorithms" somewhat unclear, which has implications for interpreting the lower bound. Specifically, the phrase "of the form described in the algorithm in Figure 1" is ambiguous—does it imply there is only one algorithm in this class?
In summary, this paper studies the robust single linkage algorithm for cluster tree estimation when the density lies on a manifold and establishes that the algorithm achieves rates dependent only on the manifold dimension, despite relying on Euclidean distances.
