This paper investigates the class of zero-sum perfect-information simultaneous-move games, which includes notable examples such as Goofspiel and Tron. The authors examine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with regret-matching for this class of games and establish convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium.
The manuscript is well-written, with clear exposition and well-presented results. The primary contribution lies in the novel formal analysis provided. Prior work, such as Lanctot et al. (2013) [20], explored a similar setup but offered only preliminary analysis. The authors employ an inductive proof technique, starting with optimal strategies at the leaf nodes.
The main limitation of this approach, in my view, is its inability to yield significant insights about the inner nodes of the game tree. This limitation overlooks key concepts in game theory, particularly subgame perfect Nash equilibria. Strengthening the analysis by connecting it to these concepts would enhance the paper's impact. I recommend citing the following work: "Existence of subgame perfect equilibria in games with simultaneous moves" by C. Harris (1990). While this paper provides novel computational analyses of regret-matching strategies with MCTS in zero-sum perfect-information simultaneous-move games, it falls short of leveraging the well-established game-theoretic framework of subgame perfect Nash equilibria, which has been extensively studied in the literature.
