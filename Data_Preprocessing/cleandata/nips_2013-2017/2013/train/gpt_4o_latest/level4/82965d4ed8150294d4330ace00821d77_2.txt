The paper explores HOG-based image detection, where the primary computational bottleneck lies in the scalar product operation between pairs of HOG cells derived from the image and the template. The paper's key contribution is replacing this scalar product with a single lookup operation by vector quantizing the HOG cells on the image side and precomputing the scalar products with cluster centers on the template side.
Pros:
+ The proposed idea is straightforward, conceptually sound, and clearly articulated.
+ Given the popularity of HOG-based detection methods (including DPMs) and the authors' commitment to releasing their code as a software library, this work has the potential to become widely adopted and frequently cited.
+ The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results demonstrate significant improvements for the proposed method, achieving several-fold speedups compared to already optimized DPM evaluation codes. However, it is worth noting that this strong performance required extensive low-level optimization.
Cons:
- The paper has one major drawback, which is significant: the central idea is not novel, as it already appears in [10]. While it is true that [10] emphasizes a different aspect and retrains its models, the core concept is the same. The primary distinction between the proposed approach and [10] is that [10] employs vector quantization on both the image and template sides (ADC vs. SDC as described in [13]), resulting in a coarser approximation.

If accepted, please correct the author names in reference [13]. Overall, this is a well-written paper with a clear and thoroughly evaluated idea that is likely to attract interest from many computer vision researchers. However, its impact is diminished by the substantial overlap with prior work published in CVPR12.
