Summary:  
The paper introduces an algorithm/approximation method aimed at efficient model selection for latent feature models by leveraging factorized asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference and the factorized information criterion (FIC). FAB and FIC are established techniques for mixture models, where FIC facilitates tractable model selection by approximating a model's log likelihood through factorization and Laplace approximation. The primary contribution of this work is the extension of FAB to latent feature models, incorporating a mean field approximation for latent variable inference and an accelerated shrinkage mechanism to reduce the global number of selected features.
A notable aspect of the proposed approach is its increased automation in model selection, requiring minimal manual intervention. The authors demonstrate the method's computational efficiency through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Quality:  
The presented results are supported by comprehensive analysis, and the method is benchmarked against a diverse set of competing approaches across multiple datasets. The references provided are adequate.
Clarity:  
The paper is well-written and organized in a clear and logical manner.
Originality/Significance:  
The work appears to be a natural and robust generalization of prior research on model selection in latent feature models using FAB inference and FIC. Specifically, it combines multiple approximation techniques into a novel, cohesive method that performs effectively.
However, it would be valuable to explore scenarios where the proposed approximations might lead to suboptimal performance. For instance, testing the limits of the method by identifying cases where the interplay of approximations (FIC, mean field, and shrinkage) might result in degraded outcomes could provide deeper insights into its robustness.
