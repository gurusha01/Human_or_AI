The authors propose a novel class of methods for learning sparse Bayesian Networks. Their initial approach employs a DP framework that incorporates the Lasso as a scoring mechanism. However, due to the computational challenges of searching over an excessively large space, they refine this method by introducing an A search algorithm, which still utilizes the Lasso scoring function. This A approach leverages a heuristic function that is both admissible and consistent, ensuring it finds the optimal solution while enabling effective pruning. Their final approach approximates A* by imposing a limit on the queue size. While very small queue limits result in reduced solution quality, the authors demonstrate that moderate limits yield significant speed improvements with minimal quality degradation.
The authors highlight that many existing methods first prune the search space and then identify the best DAG within this restricted space as a separate step. This two-stage process risks excluding the optimal solution. Consequently, their approach offers a promising alternative to avoid such pitfalls.
The experimental evaluation appears comprehensive.
The paper is well-written and well-structured.
In Figure 3, what parameter was varied to produce the curves? Was it Lambda? The non-monotonic behavior in the Hailfinder 2 plot is somewhat unexpected. Additionally, does SBN actually fall below the "random guessing" line in four instances? If so, this could suggest an issue worth investigating.
