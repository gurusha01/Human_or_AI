Paraphrased Review:
Summary:  
This paper addresses a critical issue in linear regression modeling for high-dimensional, sparse coefficient vectors (commonly referred to as 'sparse recovery'), specifically the challenge posed by correlations among covariates. The goal in this context is to identify a sparse subset of non-zero coefficients, known as the support of the coefficient vector, which pinpoints the covariates influencing the response variable. It is well established that correlations among covariates significantly complicate the accurate identification of the true support.
The authors propose a wrapper algorithm, named SWAP, which is designed to enhance the performance of existing sparse recovery methods, such as the Lasso. SWAP operates by iteratively swapping covariates in a greedy manner to optimize a specified objective function. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration that SWAP can recover the true support with high probability under certain conditions. The authors also provide empirical evidence of SWAP's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art sparse recovery methods on both synthetic and real datasets. However, there are two main concerns that limit the impact of this work:
1) Limited innovation in the proposed method.  
The algorithm heavily relies on the quality of the initialization, i.e., the accuracy of the initial support in terms of its size and overlap with the true support. Given a reasonably good initial support, the algorithm can trivially replace irrelevant covariates with the correct ones through its swapping mechanism. To achieve this, the authors recommend using well-established, high-performing sparse recovery methods for initialization. However, in practice, the size of the true support is often unknown, and existing algorithms do not guarantee recovery of the correct support size. This necessitates testing a range of potential support sizes, which increases computational overhead and introduces errors if the true support size lies outside the explored range. Furthermore, the performance of SWAP is highly sensitive to the quality of the initial support, as evidenced by the low true positive rates observed when random initial supports (of the correct size) are used (Figure 2).  
In summary, while the proposed procedure appears computationally efficient, it functions primarily as a straightforward post-processing step for the output of other sparse recovery algorithms. These base algorithms must themselves be sophisticated for the overall framework to perform effectively.
2) Issues with the presentation of results.  
The description of Figure 1 in the text is unclear and scattered, with key details required to interpret the figure only mentioned at the end of the discussion. Additionally, some terms, such as "sparsity level" (represented by values from 1 to 10), are not formally introduced, making the figure harder to follow. It would be more effective to explain the figure immediately before or alongside the relevant discussion.  
More critically, Figure 2 appears to have incorrect captions for its sub-panels (a to i), rendering the results difficult to interpret. For instance, the text suggests that sub-panels (a) and (b) depict the number of iterations, but (a) is actually a legend, and (b) has a y-axis labeled "Mean TPR." These inconsistencies make it challenging to connect the results to the conclusions drawn in the text.  
Additionally, it would be helpful to report the "Sparse Recovery" probabilities under typical parameter settings, particularly for the applications discussed in the results section (e.g., the gene expression application in lines 139-146). A comparison with other wrapper methods is also notably absent.
Minor Comments:  
- Line 158: Simply testing several values of \(k\) and observing a linear relationship between the number of iterations and \(k\) is insufficient to generalize that the runtime complexity of SWAP is \(O(k)\).  
- Line 163: Remove "roughly," as the \(O\)-notation is inherently understood as approximate.  
- Remark 3.2: The empirical convergence rate mentioned here seems inconsistent with the theoretical results in Proposition 4.1.  
- Line 374: Change "types cancers" to "types of cancers."  
- Line 316: Replace "that the Lasso" with "than the Lasso."  
- Line 317: Change "a backwards algorithm" to "a backward algorithm."  
- Line 321: Correct "Figures 1" to "Figure 1."  
- The paper is generally well-written and well-organized, but the English in Section 5.1 is weaker compared to the rest of the manuscript. The description of example A1 (lines 302-308) in particular should be rewritten for clarity.
Conclusion:  
This paper tackles an important problem in high-dimensional statistics and introduces a simple wrapper algorithm for sparse recovery. While the proposed method demonstrates strong empirical performance, it lacks sufficient novelty or significant contributions to merit acceptance at a prestigious conference like NeurIPS.
