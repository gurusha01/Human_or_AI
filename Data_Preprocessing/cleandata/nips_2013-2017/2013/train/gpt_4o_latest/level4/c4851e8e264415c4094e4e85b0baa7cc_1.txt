The authors extend the replicated softmax model to propose a classification framework tailored for video classification tasks with limited examples. The model is composed of two components: The first component resembles a replicated softmax model that identifies topics in the features, but it incorporates rectified linear units instead. The second component is a discriminant function represented as a linear combination of the identified topics. To ensure tractable inference, the authors employ a clever trick: they derive a variational bound, which is further lower-bounded by leveraging the semi-conjugacy between rectified linear units and the Gaussian likelihood. The model's performance is assessed on a dataset comprising videos of social activities requiring classification.
The problem addressed is significant, the derivation of the model is methodologically sound, and the experimental evaluation is appropriately conducted.
Nonetheless, the approach appears to be largely independent of and not specifically motivated by the application of unstructured social group activity recognition. It seems that the authors have developed a general-purpose feature learning and classification method, which would benefit from evaluation on additional classification datasets and comparisons with more baseline methods.
In summary, while the approach is reasonable, it has limited relevance to social group activity recognition. As a generic feature learning and classification framework, the work would be strengthened by broader comparisons to other baselines.
