This paper presents one of the most natural examples of a learning problem where computational tractability is achieved with a sufficient amount of data but remains computationally intractable (albeit still information-theoretically tractable) when the data is limited. The computational intractability is grounded in a complexity-theoretic assumption regarding the difficulty of distinguishing satisfiable 3SAT formulas from random ones at a specific clause density, particularly focusing on the 3MAJ variant of this conjecture.
The authors investigate the specific problem of learning halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors. They complement their negative results with nearly matching positive results, contingent on a stronger complexity-theoretic conjecture—that the hardness persists even for random formulas with clause density proportional to n^μ above the satisfiability threshold. Unfortunately, the algorithmic results are relegated to the Appendix and are not discussed in the main text. It appears that these results are essentially adaptations of Hazan et al.'s 2012 work, but a high-level discussion of the algorithm would be highly beneficial. Even if formal proofs cannot be included in the main body, a clear description of the algorithm would enhance the paper's accessibility.
Overall, I appreciate the paper but recommend significant changes to its presentation. For example, the proof of Theorem 3.1 is much clearer than the high-level intuition provided on page 6. This section could likely be condensed without sacrificing clarity, which would create space for a discussion of the algorithmic results in Section 4.
Typos/suggestions:  
- Consider rephrasing "refuting random 3" as "distinguishing high-value formulas from random" (?).  
- p.6: "it would have necessarily return" → "it would have necessarily returned."  
- "with proper efficient algorithm" → "with a proper, efficient algorithm."  
- p.3: "proof item 1" → clarify phrasing.  
- Appendix A: "B(n)-decomposable." → "B(n)-decomposable matrices."  
I genuinely like this paper and believe that its results have the potential to become a classic example illustrating how some problems exhibit distinct thresholds for information-theoretic versus computational tractability.
