This study introduces a novel method for calculating the firing rates in recurrent networks of integrate-and-fire neurons in response to specific inputs, based on the principle of achieving an optimal balance between excitation and inhibition. Although the paper is quite technical, it is well-written, and the proposed approach is innovative, intriguing, and appears to be methodologically sound. The results are generally compelling, though the spiking activity depicted in Fig. 1 seems less stochastic than what is typically observed in the cortex. Overall, this approach holds significant potential to advance our understanding of the operational states and functional mechanisms of cortical networks involved in sensory processing.
