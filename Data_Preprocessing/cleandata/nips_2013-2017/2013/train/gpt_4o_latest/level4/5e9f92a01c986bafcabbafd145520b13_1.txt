This paper introduces a method for compressive sensing calcium imaging that leverages the sparse nature of neuronal activity. The approach significantly reduces the number of measurements required and employs recently developed mathematical techniques to decode these measurements. Additionally, the paper explores the minimum number of measurements needed for full recovery using state-of-the-art mathematical methods.
The paper's primary strength lies in its application of contemporary mathematical techniques to tackle a significant problem in neuroscience. However, its main limitation is the absence of analysis using real-world data. While I understand that the necessary datasets may not yet be available, it seems somewhat impractical to expect an experimentalist to read this paper and directly implement a compressive sensing imaging protocol. Moreover, the core idea could likely be conveyed in a much simpler manner than the current, highly technical presentation.
