The proof for |Rk| ≤ κ |Xk - X_{k+1}| has been explicitly demonstrated in "Scalable nonconvex inexact proximal splitting," Suvrit Sra, NIPS'12 (Lemma 4).

For trace norm regularized risk minimization, the proximal gradient algorithm is a widely used method. Its sublinear global convergence rate is well-established, and it is also known to achieve a linear rate when the loss function is strongly convex. This paper relaxes the strong convexity assumption by building on the framework introduced by Luo and Tseng. Specifically, the authors establish a local error bound, enabling them to prove that the proximal gradient algorithm converges asymptotically at a linear rate for trace norm regularization. While the paper largely adheres to the standard approach for proving local error bounds, it introduces a novel observation that facilitates the simultaneous diagonalization of matrices.  
Quality:  
The paper appears to be technically sound. The only concern I have pertains to the appendix, line 085. Could the authors clarify why the specific choice of κ3 (e.g., α < 1) leads to the stated inequality R(X^k) ≤ κ3 |X^k - X^{k+1}|_F?  
Clarity:  
The paper is generally clear and easy to follow. However, given its technical nature, it might be beneficial to first outline the main claims and then delve into the details step by step. In particular, after presenting the local error bound, the authors might consider deferring the highly technical proof of this bound and instead proceed directly to the proof of the linear rate (which, incidentally, does not introduce much novelty).  
Originality:  
The originality of the paper is moderate. The observation enabling the simultaneous diagonalization of matrices appears to be novel and intriguing. Beyond that, the authors largely follow established methods to derive the local error bound, and the subsequent steps are not particularly new.  
Significance:  
The primary contribution of this paper lies in its theoretical insights, with limited implications for algorithmic design. While extending the linear convergence rate of the proximal gradient algorithm to more practical settings (i.e., relaxing the strong convexity assumption) is valuable, the significance is somewhat diminished by the asymptotic nature of the results. Nonetheless, the authors' approach to matrix diagonalization may hold independent interest. This work demonstrates that the proximal gradient algorithm, when applied to trace norm regularized risk minimization, achieves asymptotic linear convergence under a relaxed form of strong convexity. The authors rely heavily on the well-established framework of Luo and Tseng, with the key novelty being the simultaneous diagonalization of matrices, which effectively reduces the problem to the vector case. Overall, this work represents an incremental contribution and is moderately interesting from a theoretical perspective.
