Review - Paper 1349 – Context-sensitivity in human active sensing  
This paper investigates how individuals direct their search for information within a visual display. The authors discuss a recently introduced model, C-DAC, present an optimal stopping result, and propose a computationally bounded approximation to the optimal cost. They then describe an experiment involving three patches of stimuli (dots moving either left or right with varying levels of coherence), where participants are tasked with identifying the patch with dots moving to the left as quickly as possible. Overall, the models employing C-DAC generated policies that aligned more closely with human behavior compared to those generated by a model using an Infomax policy. The paper concludes with simulations designed to differentiate among the three policy generation methods.  
The study addresses an important computational challenge faced by both humans and machines: how to allocate sensory resources across different areas of the environment to effectively accomplish a task. The approach is compelling, elegant, and a plausible candidate for explaining the computational goals of the visual system. However, while the simulations distinguishing between the different methods were particularly intriguing, I was disappointed by the absence of corresponding human data. Additionally, I found the evaluation of the proposed method insufficient to justify publication at NIPS. Since C-DAC is a previously published model, it cannot be considered a novel contribution of this paper.  
That said, there are several issues with the paper that leave me uncertain about its suitability for publication at NIPS. The framing of the paper emphasizes how C-DAC provides context-sensitive policies, but it is unclear in what way the model is context-sensitive. Greater clarity on what constitutes "context" in this scenario would be helpful. Moreover, the case study does not convincingly demonstrate the importance of context-sensitivity. Apart from Infomax misestimating search times when 9 was the target, the experiment did not strongly support the claim that human behavior is guided by computational principles akin to those of C-DAC. Additionally, the number of dependent variables predicted by C-DAC seems limited given the model's complexity and parameter count.  
The simulations presented at the end of the paper were far more compelling than the case study and could potentially provide stronger evidence for C-DAC. However, the lack of human experiments aligned with these simulations is a significant limitation. The authors might consider delaying publication until they can include human results for these simulations, which would result in a much stronger and more complete paper than the current submission.  
Minor comments:  
- Section 2.1: When a vector is indexed to a scalar, I personally prefer it to no longer be bold.  
- Section 3.1, line 232: "the probability of a target containing a target" – should this be "a patch containing a target"?  
- Section 3.2 title: "Model vs. behavior" – the use of "vs." seems slightly awkward. Should "model" be plural?  
- Section 3.2, lines 261-263: "… the general tendency for human subjects typically rely more on recent observations…" → "… the general tendency for human subjects to rely more on recent observations…"  
- Figure 2: Please label the units for the y-axes.  
Overall, this is an excellent project in progress, but it appears too premature for publication in its current form.
