This paper introduces an algorithm for normalized cuts on hypergraphs by framing the cut problem as the minimization of a ratio of two convex functions, which can be efficiently solved using existing methods (RatioDCA, with the inner problem addressed via a primal-dual approach). Additionally, semi-supervised learning on hypergraphs is formulated as a related optimization problem and solved using a similar primal-dual method. The proposed approach is demonstrated on multiple datasets to outperform an alternative method that transforms the hypergraph into a regular graph for semi-supervised learning, clustering, and cut objectives.
The paper is well-written and clearly presented. It is technically robust and offers a meaningful contribution to the problem of hypergraph cuts, with potential implications for semi-supervised learning and clusteringâ€”provided that a hypergraph-based approach is indeed suitable for the given problem.
However, regarding this latter point, the paper does not provide much discussion on the relevance of using a hypergraph-based approach. In all the examples, the hypergraph is not an inherent structure but is instead constructed from the covariates by creating a hyperedge for all samples that share the same value for a given covariate. If the data points are originally represented as feature vectors, other semi-supervised learning and clustering methods (e.g., those based on scalar products or regular graphs derived from the features) would also be reasonable and should be included for comparison.
Similarly, the paper does not discuss the relevance of semi-supervised learning for the datasets used. For instance, what kind of performance would be achieved without leveraging the unlabeled samples? That said, the primary focus of this paper is on how the proposed formulation enhances semi-supervised learning, rather than on whether semi-supervised learning itself is appropriate for the datasets.
A few minor comments:
- Total variation appears to play a secondary role in the paper, whose primary contribution is the development of an improved algorithm for hypergraph normalized cuts. The current title may be somewhat misleading in this regard.
- The semi-supervised problem (3) is effectively a proximal operator of \(\lambda\Omega\) at point \(Y\). While there may not be a simpler way to compute this proximal operator than the proposed algorithm, it would be helpful to clarify this distinction to avoid confusion between the proximal operator in (3) and the proximal operator of its first term combined with the conjugate of the second term, which are used in the computation.
In summary:
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured.
- It makes a significant and technically sound contribution.
- However, it provides limited discussion on the relevance of using hypergraphs for representing this data (as opposed to feature vectors or regular graphs).
