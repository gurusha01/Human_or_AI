This paper introduces a tensor factorization method for parameter estimation in scenarios where the underlying structure is a hidden Markov model (HMM), but only a small random subset of observations is available. The main contribution lies in identifying the tensor factorization framework within this problem, building on the work of Anandkumar et al., which is relatively straightforward. A notable aspect is demonstrating how the transition distribution can be recovered from an expectation over the sums of the transition distribution. The authors also provide sample complexity results and some illustrative toy simulations. Overall, the paper offers a reasonable contribution with some novel ideas.
Presentation suggestion: I recommend defining the core model/problem (currently in Section 3) much earlier in the paper. For instance, Theorem 1 should not appear before a formal definition of the problem is introduced. Additionally, the discussion on tensor decomposition occupies too much space; a citation to prior work with a concise summary of the key ideas would suffice, or this material could be moved to the appendix.
In Section 3.1, when defining the model, please clarify explicitly that $N$ i.i.d. replicates of the model are being observed. Initially, it was unclear how this setup was feasible given only a single random draw from $\pi_0$.
The theorems, as currently presented, state true results but lack accompanying commentary to highlight the key properties or insights. For instance, the factorization structure outlined in line 062 of Appendix A.1 is well-explained and could be incorporated into the main text. Additionally, more intuition around Theorem 3 would be helpful for readers.
Experiments: It is encouraging to see some qualitative alignment between the empirical results and the theoretical bounds. The observation that $U$ is easier to learn is unsurprising but worth noting. I would be interested in a comparison of this algorithm with EM, given that the motivation for this method is to avoid the local optima issues associated with EM. Naturally, experiments on real-world data would strengthen the paper, particularly from the datasets cited that involve learning from non-sequence data.
Minor comment: In lines 318 and 320, the primes should be placed above the subscripts in $M2$ and $M3$.
In summary, this paper extends recently developed tensor factorization techniques to the novel setting of learning an HMM from non-sequence data. While the paper could be revised to better convey key insights, it represents a reasonable contribution overall.
