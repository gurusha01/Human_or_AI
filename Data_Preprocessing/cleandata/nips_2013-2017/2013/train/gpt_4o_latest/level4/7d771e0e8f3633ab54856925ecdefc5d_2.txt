This paper presents an enhancement to symbolic policy iteration tailored for domains with factored actions. The central concept is that symbolic backup operations can be adjusted to minimize the size of the resulting ADDs. Specifically, the approach involves performing a more general backup (as opposed to an on-policy backup) for certain actions, provided this does not increase the complexity of the resulting expression. The authors prove that this method converges and support their claims with thorough and reasonably impressive experimental results. However, due to my limited expertise in symbolic policy iteration, I cannot fully assess whether the experiments are exhaustive.
Symbolic methods and factored actions are both intriguing and underexplored areas, which makes me favorably inclined toward the paper. However, my main concern lies in the lack of clarity regarding how \(\pi\) is represented as an ADD, as it is introduced as a constraint in Section 3 without sufficient explanation. Including more detailed explanatory material—such as an example contrasting on-policy and off-policy action backups and illustrating how pruning affects the resulting expressions—would significantly enhance the paper's accessibility. As it stands, the reader must infer the pruning operator's function from a combination of mathematical descriptions and diagrams before encountering a high-level explanation, which is only briefly mentioned. This issue is further compounded by Figure 4, where D and C appear to represent D and \(\pi\), adding to the confusion.
Regrettably, these issues, combined with my only partial familiarity with symbolic methods, made the paper unnecessarily difficult to follow, despite its seemingly straightforward underlying ideas.
Beyond this, I have only minor writing suggestions:  
- Consider replacing "flat actions" with "atomic actions," as "flat" is often interpreted as the opposite of hierarchical.  
- "assume a small flat action space" → "assumes a small flat ..."  
- "Factored State and Actions Spaces" → "Factored State and Action Spaces"  
- Avoid using parenthetical citations as nouns.  
- "assignments OF n boolean variables to A real value" → revise for clarity.  
- "interestingly, the first approach to symbolic planning in MDPs, was a version" → remove the comma.  
- The graphs are very small. While I understand the space constraints, reducing whitespace could allow for larger, more legible graphs.  
- Ensure full citation details are provided and references are properly formatted, including capitalization.
In summary, this is an interesting paper that proposes a technical improvement to symbolic backups, enhancing their performance. However, it is often challenging to understand due to unclear explanations and presentation issues.
