The authors introduce a hierarchical extension of the IRM for network modeling, leveraging key concepts from the Bayesian rose tree (BRT) framework: 1) the hierarchy is employed to define a mixture over consistent partitions of the nodes, and 2) this hierarchy is learned via an efficient greedy agglomerative procedure. The paper includes qualitative results on Sampson's monks dataset and the full NIPS dataset, as well as quantitative results on the NIPS-234 dataset. The proposed inference method is computationally much more efficient than the IRM while achieving comparable predictive performance.
Quality/Clarity: The paper is exceptionally well-written, with a clear exposition of the core ideas.
Originality: While the primary ideas are derived from the Bayesian rose tree framework, the authors have made meaningful adaptations to apply these concepts to the relational data setting, particularly in preserving the same computational complexity.
Significance: Scaling Bayesian nonparametric models, particularly for network data, is a critical challenge for practical applications. Although the \(n^2\) scaling of the base algorithm may limit its applicability to larger networks, the sparse version is expected to remain practical. It would have been valuable to include runtime benchmarks on larger real-world networks. For instance, while NIPS-234 requires only tens of seconds, how long does inference take for the full NIPS dataset? Gene networks often contain tens of thousands of nodes, and real-world social networks are even larger—how does the method scale in such cases?
Additionally, it would be helpful to assess how close the greedy method comes to the optimal tree. This could be explored on datasets where exhaustive search for the optimal tree is still computationally feasible. Is there any theoretical support for the method, such as guarantees related to submodularity?

While the ideas presented here are rooted in the BRT framework, the contribution remains significant, and this paper merits acceptance.
