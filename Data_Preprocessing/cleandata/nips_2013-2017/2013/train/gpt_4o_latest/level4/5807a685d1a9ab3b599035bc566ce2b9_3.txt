Review - Local Privacy and Minimax Bounds: Sharp Rates for Probability Estimations  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
This paper investigates the concept of local privacy, where each user generates an \(\alpha\)-differentially private signal based on their own type and potentially the signals of the remaining \(n-1\) users, and reports this signal to the data curator. The authors analyze this framework using the min-max expected error approach, where an adversary selects a distribution over user types, and the goal is to design an \(\alpha\)-DP local scheme that minimizes the discrepancy between an estimation derived from the original data and one derived from the reported signals (e.g., sums, aggregations, or averages). The paper establishes a lower bound for the min-max rate of \(l_2\)-distance estimations for users drawn from a discrete distribution over \(d\) types. It demonstrates that the randomized response mechanism achieves this bound, proving its optimality. The authors further extend their analysis to the problem of density estimation, where they again show that the min-max lower bound is achieved by a perturbation scheme in which each user perturbs only their own type.  
This is a solid and significant contribution, as it demonstrates that a classic mechanism achieves the best possible performance by matching established lower bounds. I believe the NIPS community would find the results both relevant and insightful, and I recommend acceptance.  
However, I do have a few concerns. First, in terms of presentation, the explanation of min-max bounds could be made more accessible. Additionally, the paper uses a substantial amount of cumbersome notation. Since all the bounds provided are specific to the \(l2\) norm, it would be clearer to phrase the bounds explicitly in terms of this norm. Furthermore, I would have appreciated a discussion of the \(l1\) norm, which is stricter, or at least a comparison of the given bounds to those for the \(l_1\) norm. It would also be beneficial to relate the results to other lower bounds in differential privacy, even if those primarily apply to the classical (non-local) setting.  
Another limitation is that the min-max bounds presented appear to be specifically tailored to the local privacy setting. It would have been valuable if the authors had considered a broader range of settings and provided min-max lower bounds for those as well. That said, I appreciate the result showing that, despite the local privacy setting allowing users to randomize their reports based on the remaining \(n-1\) users, the simple scheme where each user randomizes their report solely based on their own type is optimal. I believe this point should be explicitly emphasized in the paper.  
Finally, I have an additional reservation. With the recent publication of the FOCS 2013 accepted papers list, it appears that this work is an extension of an existing paper, particularly the results in Section 3. While I still recommend acceptance, my enthusiasm is now slightly tempered.  
In summary, the paper provides a rigorous analysis of local privacy through min-max rate bounds, establishes lower bounds, and shows that the upper bounds are achieved by randomized response. This is a noteworthy result.
