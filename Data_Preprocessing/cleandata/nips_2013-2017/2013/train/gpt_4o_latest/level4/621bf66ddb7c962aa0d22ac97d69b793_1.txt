The authors introduce a method (SHRT) aimed at accelerating Ridge Regression in scenarios where the number of features \( p \) significantly exceeds the number of samples \( n \) (\( p \gg n \)).
The core concept involves reducing the dimensionality of the design matrix \( X \) to expedite the computation of \( XX^T \), reducing its complexity from \( O(n^2p) \) to \( O(np\log n) \). This is achieved using Walsh-Hadamard transforms, which can be computed efficiently in logarithmic time.
The research idea is of high quality and holds substantial practical value. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and presents novel contributions. However, a major concern is the considerable overlap with the recently published ICML 2013 paper:
*"Fastfood â€“ Computing Hilbert Space Expansions in Loglinear Time,"  
Quoc Le, Tamas Sarlos, Alexander Smola.*
Both works appear to have been developed independently, given their close submission timelines. Nonetheless, the Fastfood algorithm is closely analogous to the proposed SHRT method, albeit more general:
- SHRT(\( X \)) := \( RHDX \)  
- Fastfood(\( X \)) := \( \exp(SHGPHBX) \)
Key similarities and differences include:  
1. The basis matrix \( R \) in SHRT corresponds to the matrix \( P \) in Fastfood.  
2. The Walsh-Hadamard matrix \( H \) is shared between both methods.  
3. The Rademacher matrix \( D \) in SHRT is equivalent to the matrix \( B \) in Fastfood.  
4. A primary distinction lies in the setup: SHRT assumes \( p \gg n \), whereas Fastfood allows the number of random features \( p_{\text{subs}} \) to exceed \( p \), enabling the construction of multiple "SHRT blocks."  
5. SHRT does not include a matrix \( G \), which represents spectral samples of a Gaussian kernel in Fastfood. This omission is due to SHRT's assumption of a vast feature space, where a linear kernel suffices. Consequently, Fastfood's \( G \) and \( S \) matrices are diagonal in SHRT, and the method avoids exponentiation.
The theoretical contributions, particularly Lemma 2 and Theorem 1, are rigorously developed and constitute novel material. The application of SHRT to the PCA algorithm further underscores the originality of the submission, ensuring sufficient novelty.
The authors should reference the foundational works of Rahimi & Recht (2007, 2008) and the Fastfood paper. Additionally, the paper would benefit from a stronger connection to existing literature and, ideally, a comparative analysis with other randomized methods.
After reviewing the Author Feedback, I acknowledge the proposed method's ability to accelerate the computation of \( XX^T \) in ridge regression from \( O(n^2p) \) to \( O(np\log n) \) by leveraging subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms. While there is some overlap with the ICML 2013 Fastfood paper, the submission presents novel theoretical advancements.
