This paper introduces a myopic adaptation of C-DAC, a visual search algorithm that incorporates both costs and benefits. It is evident that some cost-benefit algorithm of this nature will outperform a naive version that disregards such considerations, so the primary question lies in the specifics of its implementation.  
Figure 2 demonstrates that C-DAC performs well across multiple dimensions of fit.  
Comments:  
Why is C-DAC not considered psychologically plausible? Could this be clarified?  
In Figure 2, why are sets 9 and 1&3 particularly diagnostic?  
This paper provides evidence supporting a search algorithm that myopically accounts for the cost of future visual saccades.
