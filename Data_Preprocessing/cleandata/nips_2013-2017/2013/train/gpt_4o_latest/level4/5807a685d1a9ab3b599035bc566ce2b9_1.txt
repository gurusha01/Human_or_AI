SUMMARY: This manuscript, formatted for NIPS, is an adaptation of an ArXiv submission and employs a Fano/LeCam-style argument to establish a lower bound on estimation algorithms that process private data under the assumption that the algorithm is not trusted by the data owner. A notable implication of the results is that, in certain contexts, randomized response emerges as an optimal strategy.
As a disclaimer, I did not examine the supplementary material.
Pros and Cons:
- The results effectively characterize the fundamental limitations of learning from data that has been perturbed to ensure privacy.
- Some imprecise commentary on the results could potentially mislead casual readers (details provided below).
- The paper appears to lack connections to prior work on differential privacy.
Additional Comments:
- The focus on local privacy, which is central to the results, distinguishes the privacy model from the differential privacy framework. This distinction may not be immediately apparent to all readers and could lead to confusion. For example, statements like the one at the bottom of page 4—"Thus, for suitably large sample sizes n, the effect of providing differential privacy at a level $\alpha$…"—are overly broad (and possibly incorrect) and should be revised to avoid misinterpretation.
- Is the restriction on $\alpha$ in Theorem 1 essential? Empirical evidence suggests that $\alpha \approx 1$ might be the practical limit for certain learning problems under differential privacy. It is unclear what the bound implies for such cases.
- Including commentary on potential choices for $\rho$ would be helpful, as it would allow readers to better understand how various utility measures are captured within the analysis.
- How does the proposed density estimator compare to Lei's M-estimation procedure? Lei's work is not cited, but it seems relevant and should be acknowledged.
- There are numerous alternative approaches to histogram estimation for discrete data. While randomized response achieves the optimal rate of convergence, it would be valuable to discuss how these other methods compare.
Addendum After Rebuttal:
- The distinction between population and sample statistics should be clarified more explicitly and earlier in the paper (see the authors' response to Reviewer 9).
- A comparison to related work, such as Lei and other references raised by reviewers, is critical for providing proper context.
- Upon closer examination of [10], which has now been published, the additional contribution of this paper appears narrower than initially perceived. While the target audiences of this paper and [10] differ, the contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) a detailed exposition of the local privacy model, and (2) new bounds for density estimation. The latter contribution is novel, but the former is largely covered in [10].
