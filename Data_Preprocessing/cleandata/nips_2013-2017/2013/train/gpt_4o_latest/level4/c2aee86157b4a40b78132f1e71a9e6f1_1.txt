The paper introduces a novel online method for solving POMDPs, building on established approaches such as POMCP and AEMS2, which are among the leading methods for this problem. The primary innovation lies in pruning the forward search tree by regularizing the policy size. Additionally, the paper contributes a performance bound on the value estimate, which is integrated into the algorithm to guide the search. The authors provide a range of empirical results, comparing their method against other recent online and offline POMDP approaches. The introduction of the new LaserTag domain is another notable contribution, as it has the potential to be adopted by other researchers in the field.
The central idea of managing the complexity of online search through constraints on policy size is compelling and represents an unexplored avenue in online POMDP methods. It sheds light on the critical issue of balancing computational effort and solution quality in POMDPs. This aspect of the paper is particularly intriguing and could significantly influence the resolution of large-scale POMDPs. The authors' intention to share their code is also a positive aspect.
While I found the core idea promising, it is challenging to predict the broader impact of this work. Specifically, the empirical results do not clearly identify which components of the proposed R-DESPOT framework contribute most to its practical performance. Is it the particle filtering mechanism, the DESPOT structure, or the regularization itself? These factors need to be disentangled and analyzed more thoroughly to provide a clearer understanding of the framework's strengths.
I have some reservations regarding the experimental setup. For instance, why were the AEMS2 results not recomputed? Given a DESPOT implementation, AEMS2 should be relatively straightforward to implement. The reported AEMS2 results are now five years old and appear competitive with DESPOT/R-DESPOT, at least in smaller domains. For larger domains, why not test AEMS2 with particle filtering belief representation to determine whether the belief filtering or value approximation is the critical factor? Addressing this question would significantly strengthen the paper. Additionally, the authors should speculate on why their POMCP results are weaker than those reported in [3]. A more detailed discussion in Section 6 would greatly enhance the reader's understanding of the work's impact.
The paper is generally well-written, particularly in the introductory sections, including the introduction, related work, and the description of the DESPOT framework. However, the latter sections contain several technical details that require clarification:
- Clearly specify the differences between DESPOT and R-DESPOT. Is the distinction limited to the PRUNE function (line 301)? Providing pseudo-code for this function would be helpful.
- Summarize the key differences between POMCP and DESPOT. Both appear to use particle filtering for belief representation, so is the primary distinction the use of lower and upper bounds in DESPOT? This could be clarified in Sections 3 or 6.
- Elaborate on the looseness of the lower bound. Are you using the actual bound in expression (1), or is it a hand-tuned parameter L?
- Provide more details on how the key parameters alpha and K (or L) were selected experimentally. Were the same parameters used across all experiments? How much offline time was required to tune them? While this may be a secondary issue, understanding the procedure and the associated computational effort (at least in terms of order of magnitude) is important.
- Explain how the time constraint (1 second per action) is enforced in practice. If the parameters (e.g., K) exceed the time limit, are they ignored?
This paper has the potential to be a strong contribution, offering an interesting and potentially impactful approach to POMDP solving. However, the lack of technical detail may hinder reproducibility, and the limitations in the results and discussion make it difficult to fully assess the work's significance. I look forward to the authors' response.
