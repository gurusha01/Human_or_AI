This paper introduces a novel robust methodology and a unified framework for addressing a learning task that generalizes clustering models. The proposed approach effectively handles challenges such as clustering, subspace clustering, and multiple regression by incorporating weights on data samples. 
To mitigate the influence of outliers, the authors associate probability distributions with each "model" (as opposed to the classical use of Dirac distributions). These distributions are derived by minimizing a trade-off between two components. The first component is the (Euclidean) distance between the average weight distribution and the uniform distribution, serving as a regularization term to ensure weights are evenly distributed within each model. The second component is a weighted loss function that accounts for the significance of individual samples, acting as a data-fitting term.
Overall, the paper suffers from loose notation, imprecise formulae, and insufficient mathematical rigor. The quality of English is also subpar, which often compromises the clarity of the presentation. While the motivation and proposed method are intriguing, this version of the paper appears to be more of a preliminary exploration than a polished, camera-ready submission. Substantial revisions are needed to improve clarity and presentation.
For example, the authors should elaborate on the proposed method in the simplest scenario of their framework, such as clustering in the presence of outliers, and provide detailed explanations and experiments. This could be achieved by moving Section 2.1 to the Appendix and using the main text to better develop the clustering context.
The experimental section is even weaker than the theoretical discussion. The figures lack sufficient explanation, and Section 3.1 provides little insight into the practical performance of the method. The authors should compare their approach to existing methods for specific tasks, such as clustering, to better contextualize their contributions.
Finally, a more thorough discussion on the selection of the trade-off parameter \(\alpha\) is necessary, both from theoretical and practical perspectives.

- l185: Clarify that \(u = (1/n, \ldots, 1/n)\), if this interpretation is correct.
- l186: The indices in the summation are inconsistent. Please revise.
- l194: Is the optimization over \(W\) or a single \(w_j\)? This ambiguity should be resolved.
- l200: Why is an unusual closeness index being used? Please provide a justification for this choice.
- l207: The term "average penalty" is vague. Specify what it refers to.
- l232: The phrase "has 1/3 the point" is unclear, and the corresponding figure is not interpretable. Please clarify.
- l254: The notation \(P_\Delta^n\) is introduced only in the Appendix but is used earlier in the main text. Define it upfront.
- l299–314: The term "MAD" appears in the legend but is not defined anywhere in the text. Please include a definition.
- l368: The right-hand side depends on \(i\), but the left-hand side does not. This inconsistency should be corrected.
- l402: Replace "requires" with "required."
- l403: Replace "converge" with "converges."
- l457: Correct the citation to "Candès" (with an accent).
- l468: Specify the nature of the referenced work (e.g., article, conference paper, etc.).
- l553: The sentence "with the corresponding variable ..." is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity.
- l778: Is the equality valid for all \(U\)? It seems incorrect without additional assumptions, which should be explicitly stated.
In summary, this paper proposes a general robust formulation for handling multiple model learning (e.g., extending clustering algorithms) by optimizing data distributions. However, significant improvements in clarity, rigor, and experimental validation are required to make the contribution more impactful and accessible.
