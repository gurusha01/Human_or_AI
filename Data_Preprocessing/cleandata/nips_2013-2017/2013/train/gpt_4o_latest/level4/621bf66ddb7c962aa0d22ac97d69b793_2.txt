This paper introduces a fast algorithm for ridge regression by leveraging the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT), which effectively reduces dimensionality and significantly lowers computational costs. The core concept of the algorithm involves first applying the randomized Hadamard transform, followed by uniform feature sampling. Additionally, the theoretical risk associated with the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Based on the derived theoretical results, the order of subsampled features, \( p_{\text{subs}} \), is estimated. The paper also compares the proposed algorithm with principal component regression. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and UCI datasets are conducted to illustrate the strong performance of the proposed method.
The paper presents an engaging algorithm and is well-written. The proposed algorithm is conceptually straightforward, with the efficient implementation of the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform being the central contribution. While the idea is simple, it is intriguing. A notable drawback of other random projection techniques is the computational cost associated with generating a random projection matrix and computing its product with the design matrix. This paper's key contribution is the integration of these two steps into a single, efficient implementation.
However, the empirical studies are somewhat limited. For the UCI datasets, the classification accuracy is reported. Since this paper focuses on ridge regression and provides a theoretical bound on risk, it would be more appropriate to evaluate regression error instead of classification accuracy.
There is also a minor typo: in Eq. (3), the right-hand side of the inequality is written as \( \sqrt{\frac{c \cdot \log(2k/\delta) \cdot k}{p_{\text{subs}}}} \), but in the subsequent discussions, the coefficient 2 is missing. While I have not verified the cited references, this appears to be a typographical error.
In summary, the paper proposes a simple and efficient implementation of ridge regression using the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform. While the idea is straightforward and interesting, the theoretical results and empirical evaluations are somewhat limited.
