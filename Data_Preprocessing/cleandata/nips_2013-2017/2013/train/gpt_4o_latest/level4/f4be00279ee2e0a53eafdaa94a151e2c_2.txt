This work employs approximate inference to address nonlinear diffusion equations by leveraging the continuous-time limit of the expectation-propagation framework. The resulting method is a tracking algorithm that is, unsurprisingly, significantly faster than sampling-based approaches and demonstrates commendable accuracy in the presented experiments. I wonder whether incorporating a linearization of the loss function combined with the Kalman-Bucy approach (e.g., an extended Kalman-Bucy filter), potentially applied iteratively, could yield a more or less effective alternative. Additionally, it would be valuable to include more extensive experiments, such as those involving high-frequency financial datasets, where this methodology is commonly applied and well-established benchmarks exist.
Quality: the technical foundation of the paper is robust.  
Clarity: the manuscript is well-written and logically structured.  
Originality: relatively high.  
Significance: the demonstrated speedup over Monte Carlo methods is potentially impactful.  
This paper introduces an approximate inference approach—expectation-propagation—for nonlinear diffusion processes, achieving notable computational efficiency compared to sampling methods. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.
