The paper presents a novel sampling method for selecting entries of large matrices. In contrast to deterministic methods, which focus on selecting matrix entries exceeding a predefined threshold, the authors propose a probabilistic approach for identifying matrix entries as candidates for storage and subsequent analysis. The goal is to construct a matrix B that optimally approximates an input matrix A, with optimality measured by the loss ||B-A||.
While the authors support their approach with rigorous mathematical arguments, I found the paper unconvincing overall. The introduction was particularly unclear. For instance, the formula in (1) does not yield a probability, as it produces a score between zero and one. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I also could not grasp why Bij should belong to the set (-thetai, 0, thetai); it seems more plausible that it should be in the set (-1/thetai, 0, 1/theta_i). Additionally, the reasoning behind B being an unbiased estimator of A was unclear to me. Similar minor mathematical inconsistencies appear throughout the paper. For example, in Theorem 1.1, the expected value of a matrix is stated to be zero, but this should likely refer to the n x m zero matrix.
The most significant issue, however, is the lack of a compelling motivation for this work. It is unclear why the machine learning community should be interested in sampling models for matrix data. The authors reference the "streaming model" as a motivation, where decisions about retaining entries must be made upon presentation. However, in such cases, a deterministic approach that retains entries exceeding a threshold might suffice. The final paragraph of Section 3 does not convincingly argue why such deterministic methods would be less effective. The paper would benefit from at least one concrete application where sampling models for matrix data are essential. While such applications may exist, they should be explicitly discussed in a paper of this nature.
Overall, while the problem is interesting, the work requires stronger justification to make its contributions compelling.
