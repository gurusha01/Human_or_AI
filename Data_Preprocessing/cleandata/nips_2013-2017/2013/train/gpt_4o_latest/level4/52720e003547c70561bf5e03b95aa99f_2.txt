This paper introduces an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for addressing the linear programming problem in the CLIME estimator. The authors establish a convergence rate of O(1/T). The proposed algorithm is implemented on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures, and numerical comparisons with other methods, such as DC-QUIC, Tiger, and CLIME-Flare, are presented.  
Quality: The paper is technically sound.  
Minor Comments:  
1) The derivation of the inexact ADMM for CLIME follows standard approaches. For reference, see:

2) Given the structure of CLIME, each subproblem's solution can be computed componentwise, with the most computationally expensive operation being matrix-matrix multiplication. Consequently, ADMM is well-suited for parallelization in the context of CLIME. It is widely recognized that matrix-matrix multiplications parallelize efficiently.  
3) The setup of the numerical experiments could be more detailed. For instance, what level of accuracy is achieved by each solver?  
Clarity: The paper is well-structured and clear.  
Originality: The evaluation of ADMM on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures is noteworthy.  
Significance: Addressing large-scale sparse precision estimation problems remains a challenging task. A simple yet robust distributed algorithm is valuable in this context. The evaluation of ADMM on shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures is intriguing. However, the derivation of inexact ADMM is standard, and the observed scalability benefits stem primarily from the simple structure of CLIME.
