This paper presents a graph-theoretic extension of the concept of k-anonymity, termed b-matching anonymity. The correspondences between records before and after anonymization are modeled as a bipartite compatibility graph, referred to as the compatibility graph. When the graph achieves k-anonymity, the compatibility graph becomes a k-regular bipartite graph. Traditional k-anonymity mandates that k-anonymous records form fully-connected k-cliques. The authors generalize this idea to b-matching anonymity, ensuring that the compatibility graph forms a k-regular bipartite graph. This relaxation allows for adaptive anonymity, enabling each record to independently define its anonymity parameter based on the desired privacy level.
The authors' contributions are as follows:  
(1) Development of polynomial-time algorithms to compute b-matching anonymized records, utilizing alternating steps of the max-flow algorithm (if my interpretation is correct) and the minimization of a variational upper bound.  
(2) A formal characterization of b-matching anonymity in the presence of adversaries with knowledge of a limited number of edges.  
(3) Empirical evaluation of the utility of the proposed approach.  
The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions of concepts and theorems. While notions similar to b-matching anonymity have been introduced in prior work (e.g., [A] and [B]), the paper should explicitly discuss the relationships between these prior approaches and the proposed method. The characterization of b-matching anonymity against adversaries with background knowledge appears to be novel and offers a promising new direction for research in this area.  
While I find the work to be of high quality and potentially suitable for venues like STOC or FOCS, I am uncertain whether it aligns with the interests of the NIPS audience.
