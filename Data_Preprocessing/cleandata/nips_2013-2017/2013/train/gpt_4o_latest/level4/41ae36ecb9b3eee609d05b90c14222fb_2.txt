The paper establishes the linear convergence of the standard proximal gradient method for trace norm-regularized problems under assumptions weaker than the strong convexity of the loss function, addressing an important challenge in many machine learning and signal processing applications.
The manuscript is well-structured and clearly articulated. It builds upon the Lipschitzian error bound framework introduced by Tseng [20], extending its application to the nuclear norm case, which had previously been an open question. To the best of my understanding, the core proof appears to be correct.
* One aspect that I find lacking in the paper is a clear comparison or analogy to the vector case of l1-norm regularization, as discussed in [20,22] and related literature. It would be beneficial to draw connections to the results and methodologies used in the l1-norm case and to clarify if and why those techniques do not directly extend to the trace norm case. Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss whether the l1-norm case could now be derived as a corollary of the trace norm results.
This point is relevant when assessing the contribution of the paper, as some readers might not find it particularly surprising that the results for the l1-norm also hold for the trace norm. Nevertheless, I still consider this to be a valuable contribution.
 Separately, I recommend reconsidering the title of the paper. The primary novel contribution pertains to the loss function rather than making the trace norm regularization explicitly structured*. The added flexibility introduced by the linear operator A is tied to the loss function rather than the regularizer, which might warrant a slight adjustment to the title. However, I leave this decision to the authors.
* Minor issues:
- Notation: Referring to P as a sampling or mask operator might be misleading, as "sampling" could imply randomness, whereas P is fixed in this context.
- Line 337: Broken reference.
- The definitions of "Q-" and "R-" linear convergence may not be widely familiar and could be briefly reiterated for clarity.
- The residual R(X) defined in (6) could be further explained in relation to the original definition (46) in [20] to aid interpretation.
Overall, I suggest including more discussion and possibly additional conclusions to balance the lengthy technical proof of Lemma 3.2 in Section 3.
* Update after author feedback:
Thank you for addressing most of the questions. Regarding the title, my comment was specifically about the use of the term structured, which I found unnecessary in this context. However, I defer this decision to the authors. The paper establishes the linear convergence of the standard proximal gradient method for trace norm-regularized problems under assumptions weaker than the strong convexity of the loss function, addressing an important challenge in many machine learning and signal processing applications.
