The paper focuses on efficient posterior sampling in copula models for discrete data, leveraging the Hoff extended rank likelihood. Efficient posterior inference in copula models for discrete data is, in my opinion, a topic of significant interest. The authors' algorithm builds upon the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) approach introduced by Pakman and Paninski (2012) for sampling from multivariate Gaussians under linear inequality constraints. However, rather than directly applying the existing algorithm, the authors propose an innovative approach that reduces the computational complexity to O(n) with respect to the sample size by utilizing the Hough Envelope algorithm. I find the paper to be well-written, with high quality, clarity, and originality, and it presents intriguing ideas.
That said, I have concerns regarding the significance of the contributions (outlined below), which the authors have addressed effectively in their rebuttal. It is crucial for them to revise the paper carefully to incorporate these improved experiments.
Previous concerns:  
The experimental results in the initial submission were not compelling. Having applied the Hoff algorithm that the authors aim to improve upon, I have not observed significant mixing issues. Furthermore, Murray et al. (2013) report good mixing in their copula factor model using a similar sampling algorithm. The proposed algorithm is notably more complex and, based on the authors' code, incurs a computational cost per MCMC step that is 50 times higher, while yielding only modest improvements in effective sample size. From the trace plots provided, it appears that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence, but not necessarily better mixing. Additionally, I suspect that the example presented may have been carefully chosen to highlight limitations in Hoff's approach by involving a relatively large sample size compared to the model's dimensionality. For smaller sample sizes, I question whether such "gains" would still be observed. A more compelling evaluation would involve demonstrating improvements in effective sample size per unit of CPU time, along with a discussion of scenarios where the proposed algorithm's benefits are expected to be more or less pronounced. Under such a metric, Hoff's method appears to perform better and has the added advantage of being significantly simpler. Based on the results provided, I would find it challenging to implement the proposed algorithm from the brief description, but given the current findings, I would not be motivated to do so.
The algorithm is interesting, addresses an important problem, and the paper is well-written. However, the experimental results in the initial submission were very weak. In their rebuttal, the authors included additional experiments that are far more compelling. If these new experiments are incorporated into the revised manuscript, I believe the paper would be acceptable.
