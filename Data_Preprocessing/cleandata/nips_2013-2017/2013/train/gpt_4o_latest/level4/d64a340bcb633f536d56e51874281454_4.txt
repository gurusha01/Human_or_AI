Review - Summary:  
This work introduces a novel greedy algorithm, SWAP, designed for sparse recovery in the context of correlated measurements. The algorithm operates by iteratively swapping variables until further reductions in the specified loss function are no longer achievable. The implementation is straightforward and easy to follow. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, which ensures exact sparse recovery with high probability. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Major Comments:  
1. The authors claim that the proposed algorithm is particularly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. However, it remains unclear why this algorithm outperforms standard sparse learning methods in such scenarios. Could the authors provide an intuitive explanation for this advantage? Furthermore, how does the theoretical analysis substantiate the algorithm's superior performance in addressing highly correlated sparse recovery problems?  
2. Does the theoretical analysis indicate any specific advantages of the proposed method compared to other existing sparse learning algorithms with support recovery guarantees? Are the assumptions underlying the analysis less restrictive?  
3. The assumptions presented in Eqs. (3), (4), (7), and (8) appear to deviate from those typically used in existing sparse learning methods. It would be helpful if the authors could provide intuitive interpretations of these assumptions. Additionally, a comparison of the assumptions in this work with more commonly adopted ones in the literature would strengthen the paper.  
4. Several established sparse learning algorithms [1] [2] [3] are designed to address problems involving high correlations. The authors should include a comparison of the proposed method with these algorithms to better contextualize its performance.  
5. The description of the proposed algorithm in line 104 lacks clarity. For instance, the definition of \( L^{(1)}_{I,i^\prime} \) is not explicitly provided. Clarifying this term would improve the readability and understanding of the algorithm.
