This paper presents an intriguing exploration of how firing rates in a balanced network can encode solutions to a quadratic cost function, capturing deviations between input signals and decoded outputs. The manuscript is generally well-written, though a few points (outlined below) require further clarification.
Regrettably, the conceptual advancement over Ref. 13 (Bourdoukan et al., NIPS 2012) and the accompanying supplementary paper under revision appears limited. Specifically, Section 2 largely reiterates findings from Bourdoukan et al., NIPS 2012. The observation that inhomogeneous networks can achieve signal representation with performance comparable to homogeneous systems has already been established by Bourdoukan et al. and other recent neuroscience studies. This leaves the derivation of firing rates as the primary novel contribution. However, even this aspect was largely addressed in Bourdoukan et al., NIPS 2012, including the spiking condition \( Vi > Ti \).
Another issue that warrants attention is the specific structure of the proposed balanced networks, where the number of inputs matches the number of neurons in the recurrent network. This raises concerns about the applicability of the model to neural circuits, which often exhibit divergence and convergenceâ€”key features of biological networks.
Minor points requiring clarification:
- In Eq. 3, the lower integration limit should likely be 0, while the upper limit may extend to infinity.  
- In the legend of Figure 1, it states, "A spike is produced whenever the total input exceeds the spiking threshold (thin black line, bottom panel)." However, the number of spikes does not correspond to the number of red dots in the upper panels, which are also described as marking spike times for this neuron.  
- On Line 187, the statement "We find that these curves are highly nonlinear" seems inconsistent with Figure 1c, where the curves appear to be fairly linear.
Overall, while this paper is well-written and engaging when considered as a standalone contribution, its conceptual novelty relative to Ref. 13 is questionable.
